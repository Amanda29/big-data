It has strange lights that seem to move around the craft.  I have noticed it in the same place for the past 4 nights now at the exact same time in the exact same place.  It seems to stay around for about 45 minutes then just disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a friend over one night and showed them the craft and just as she was telling me i was crazy, we both watched the light just fade away to just an outline with a dull white haze where the craft was.  Just like it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later i was looking in that general direction at the stars, or what i thought were stars, but they were unusually bright and not twinkling like a normal star and just then a very small dot raced from one to the other and then the 2nd &#34;star&#34; also vanished....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Am i just crazy, or what.  I definately know this thing has been showing up like clockwork but i can&#39;t seem to get a clear view without a telescope or something.  Wish i could get video....<n>

My boyfriend was driving the car and I looked and saw some bright lights off to our left (on this part of the highway, we are secluded and the other half of the highway is below behind trees).  At first I thought it was a plane, I kept telling him to look because they seemed like they were getting closer.  Finally, the lights were right behind the tops of the trees and I told him he had to look now.  When we both looked, it was suddenly about 10 feet above the trees.  It had 3 bright white lights on the front with red accent lights.  It was hovering above the trees for about 2 seconds and started to move over the highway. When it started to move, I could tell it was a rounded triangle shape.  The bottom seemed to have grooves, almost like several small triangles. I could tell because the red lights were highlighting some parts and not others.  We couldn&#39;t stop on the highway, b! ut when I looked behind us, it was on the other side.<n>

All of a sudden I seen some sort of beam of light. At first I thought it was lightening, but then I seen something strange, some sort of circlular or octagon shape.  I glanced at the first light, rubbed my eyes and seen the shape kind of light up and it just hovered there.  After about 15 seconds it flashed again and disappeared.  I waited there for probably 20 minutes for something else but nothing showed up.<n>
4/30/10 21:00|Erin (Canada)|ON|Triangle|3 min|Erin Ontario UFO SIghting|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75249.html|4|ndxe201004| Erin Ontario UFO SIghting<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what happened. I, my brother and a close friend were driving to my cousins in Erin, Ontario.  We were coming close to the edge of the town, when my brother noticed something moving in a strange way in the sky.  It turned out to be a star and the moving clouds created the illusion of it moving.  As I looked at the star I noticed something else.  It looked like a tear from the side but from below it was a triangular shape.  It had a red light on what looked like the aft of the vessel. It was so close I thought it was a plane making an emergency landing.  We opened the windows to see what it sounded like, and heard nothing at all.  If it was any known craft in this area it would have been deafening at the distance it was.  We decide to follow the craft as far as we could we got to the edge of the town and watched the craft fly east at a steady pace, stop, hover, then fly west, stop, hover, then continue north west.  The three of us are still unsure what this was! and there was no reported military training in that area.  A week prior to this my brother and I were outside my house when we noticed what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  I said that it was probably a satellite just I  I said that the star stopped moved the opposite direction, so east, and then continued its original path, until it was out of sight.  My brother and I have had a number of experiences with these phenomenons.  We used to live close to military base Borden in Proton Township, and we would see these same types of craft all the time.  Being located so close to the military base they let the community know when they are training, and none of the sighting to which I speak of corresponded to these training exercises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

4/30/10 21:00|Sparks/Reno|NV|Flash|20 minutes|Red light flashing in a pattern while flying around the perimeter of Reno and Sparks.|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75260.html|5|ndxe201004| Red light flashing in a pattern while flying around the perimeter of Reno and Sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way to work at approximately 2100, I was on I80 from Sparks heading to Reno. I make this trip 5 nights a week and have never seen this before. I saw a red light that was blinking and moving around the “bowl” of Reno. It was blinking or flashing in a pattern and the pattern changed between 3 different patterns. The first pattern (only because this is the first pattern when I noticed it) was like a heartbeat, flashing two beats with a pause. I didn’t count how many times this went on before the next pattern, which was just a repeated single flash. The next was a series of three flashes with a very small pause.  I lost sight of it when I turned onto 395 and started heading in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing I should mention, I thought I saw this earlier while having a smoke on my balcony. I live on top of a hill that overlooks the whole valley or bowl of Reno/Sparks. I was having my smoke and looking out over the valley and saw this red light moving against the far hills, flashing. At this time it was moving fast and I lost sight of it when it went behind a hill. It didn’t come out the other side and I didn’t see anything else from my balcony so I just convinced myself it was a helicopter, though I knew even a helicopter has more than just one red light and it doesn’t move that fast…  We have an airport that is in the center of the city and I see planes and helicopters flying around all the time, but this was something different. There were regular planes and jets taking off and landing at the same time that this thing was flying around...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Look at the top of the picture and you will see three UFO’s I have zoomed in and out of all three and they don’t look like something that I would normally see in the sky.  This is the first time in my life I have ever got the chills by looking at a something like this.  I have not altered or modified this picture in any way.  Three objects in an oval shape silver in color.  I have a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside on my front porch to watch the weather. As I was looking up in the sky I saw a  round bright light  with a row of red lights behind it. I thought maybe an airplane or helicopter but I knew there would not a an aircraft out in a storm. I watched as the lights would go on and off. The spotlight would scan back and forth  then shine my way. I could not tell the shape of the object   or the color because it was dark. The light came closer and spotlighted the backyard  of my neighbors house for a few seconds  then disappeared. I then yelled for my son who is 25 to come see. We watched it  reappear  in the same location with the lights on then from under the  this thing  a red ball about the size of the moon  fell straight to  the ground. No sounds, no fire ,nothing. Then up in the air it reappeared again with the spotlight scanning and the row of red l! ights going on and off. This event happened for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/30/10 20:00|Broadview Heights|OH|Circle|1/2 hours|Me and my family saw weird objects in the sky one Friday night.|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75282.html|9|ndxe201004| Me and my family saw weird objects in the sky one Friday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday night, sun is setting. Me and my mother and grandfather are having a conversation on the supernatural. To the left right after 9:00 pm, we see a white light, small and distant, but large enough for us to notice. We thought it was a star, but after 10 minutes my grandma came out and said that it couldn&#39;t be because there would be a lot of stars. We were staring at it, also me remembering having this same experience about a year ago. It wasent moving, or doing anything. My grandma said that when she went to Serbia after the bombing in 1999, they saw something like this, but this was much more strange. Later, everybody went inside. Me being a freak on these things, I sit there at about 9:10 pm and am texting my friends and about to send message on facebook telling them to look outside, as I do this, I see it bounce as I am keeping an eye on it, ad watch it dissapear. Now the skies were clear that night. I get dressed into pajamas, come back out. Before I saw it to the left of my porch (facing west), but now I saw an object, I was facing south-east. It was the same, white circleish figure I saw before, but also I saw one on other side glimmering. They didn&#39;t move at this time. I&#39;m staring, thinking. On the left one, it looked as if the UFO opened something and something floated our of the UFO and back into it, from/to the earths surface. Then I saw it dissapear. The other one stayed, bounced a little, and sped of to the north at the speed of light!<n>
4/30/10 13:32|Somerset|MA|Sphere|02  Min|Numerous unidentified white sperical objects spotted and photographed.|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75270.html|10|ndxe201004| Numerous unidentified white sperical objects spotted and photographed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the early afternoon on 30 April 2010, I took three pictures of some rainbow-colored clouds that were approximately 50 to 60 degrees in azimuth in the West-South-Westerly direction above my house.  I positioned myself in the shade of the roof line to mask the sun from my shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I downloaded the pictures, from my camera to my computer, late in the afternoon to see if I was successful in capturing the colorful effects of the sun.  As I visually scanned the pictures, I noticed several outstanding white circular blots which appeared at several locations in each of the pictures.  Some were relatively close to others, some were larger and more prevalent than others, but all except one, were, by my estimation, at an extreme distance in the sky.  I counted no less than eight objects on one of the three pictures I took and found there to be two to three objects on the second photo and five, maybe more on the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One image appears very much larger or closer and lower than the rest:  it is spherical in shape and has what appears to be a dark belt (almost like a wind shield) wrapping horizontally around the mid-section of the sphere.  I cannot describe this image in better detail, because it is out of focus.  I thought, at first, that I might have captured a portion of my old TV antenna array, but I can&#39;t visualize this, even if it is out of focus.  And the antenna is farther to the left of where I took these pictures. In trying to give this object some size or distance perspective with the surroundings in the picture, I note it is at the bottom of the picture, just above the roof line and almost gives the appearance of a head-on frontal aspect of a jetliner, but there are no wings, rudder, or elevators in view.  Additionally, I saw no aircraft while I was taking these pictures, though the Providence airport is in the direction of my photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the other two photos to see if the same images appeared, or if they were at the same relative locations on each picture, thinking perhaps my lens might be dirty, and if so, the spots would be observable on them too, but this was not the case. I thought for a moment, that I might be seeing some very bright stars as an anomally, but ruled this out as these sightings are so close to the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot tell whether these objects had any relative motion, or how long they may have been observable since I didn&#39;t even notice them when I took the pictures.  I am however, baffled by what I have captured on these photos.<n>

Very bright light, constant and did not radiate much beyond object(?). Unable to see shape.  Color: white/pale yellow. Size comparable to the headllights would see on a very low flying helecopter at night if it was coming directly at you. The quality of this light did not change the entire time we watched. Height of this light was about twice that which you would expect to see a helecopter flying over the city (we have air natl guard &amp; their practice flights are usually fairly &#39;low&#39;). This light traveled silently and slowly. From the time it traveled from &#39;in front of us&#39;, to where we could no longer see it at all, was approx 5-7 minutes.<n>

I was looking up at the stars, and noticed what I thought at first was a star.  it was kind of twinkling.  nothing strange at all.  until i realized that this &#34;light&#34;  was moving.  it was headed in a west direction, then went south, at a 45 degree angle.  then just stopped.  and remained there for about 2 minutes.  it then moved again north at a 45 degree angle, then west.  for about 30 seconds, then again, headed west. It gave off one last &#34;twinkle&#34;, then I could not see it anymore.  like I said, I thought it was a star, because thats what it looked like. ( size, shape, brightness)  Until i knew it was most definately moving.  from its distance, i could not tell where it was as far as location, somewhere over the south shore of nassau county, or perhaps over the water?   But, it WAS there.  i know what I saw.  my yard is dark, so ! at night, I have a beautiful view of the sky, and it was amazingly clear out, and a bit crisp.  I live close to an airfield (farmingdale), and at that time to my knowledge, there are no small craft flying, or weather ballons.  There is also a major air port (MacArthur) about 20 minutes east of me, but this was not a commercial airline, nor a small craft.   And at the angle at which it changed, its distance, and its speed, related to that distance.  there were no blinking lights, unless you would ascertain the &#34;twinkling&#34;  as such. did not leave a trail, and no sound.  I just thought I should tell someone outside of family and friends, well because of the obvious reactions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear this is true, not a hoax, and accurate to the best of my ability.<n>
4/29/10 00:52|Las Vegas|NV|Chevron|3-4 seconds|Chevron-shaped flying wing with 7 large round white lights|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75311.html|14|ndxe201004| Chevron-shaped flying wing with 7 large round white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside of the Aria Hotel &amp; Casino at 12:52 am on Thursday morning, 4/29/10, looking up and admiring the enormous structure when movement in the sky above me caught my eye. I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle; the &#34;wingtip&#34; edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip; the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower; at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.<n>

Any and all planes I&#39;ve ever saw have strobes or red light or both. I live in the country outside of town so planes never fly over my house at all unless they are rerouted due to a storm is the only time I&#39;ve ever seen them fly over. Anytime a plane flys over me I will hear it after it passes. Delay in sound. I have also spotted sattellites before.  They look like a star way out above the atmosphere moving slowly across the sky.  Ok what I witnessed was neither a plane nor satellite looking whatsoever.  I was in my backyard facing south towards Dallas tx when to the southwest of me maybe gainsville tx area a bright light moving towards me caught my attention.  My first thought was a that&#39;s deffinatly not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly thought a satellite.  Well it was moving very fast and as it became closer I notice it was not very high in the sky and it was to bright to be a satellite.  It actually passes right over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well when I first see it it&#39;s to my southwest ,passes over my house I run around the side of my house And it&#39;s now heading away from me now because it had flew over my house but was heading northeast the whole time. It&#39;s was flying lower than a commercial airline.  As it went over my house the light was very bright.  It was a clear night with the moon shining.  I don&#39;t wanna say for sure but when it was directly above me it seemed to be a circle or triangular shaped craft but the light on bottom made me unsure exactly what shape it was.  The only reason I saw a bit of a shape for a second was because of the moonlight and position Of the craft at that moment.  There was absolutly no sound whatsoever from it.  From the time I spotted it to the time it went over my house and flew totaly out of site took only a minute to a minute and a half.  It happened about 4 hrs before I wrote this. I hope someone else saw it or it can be explained.  It pretty well traveled across the whole sky in 1 min 30 sec. I&#39;ve sat and watched aiplanes fly for sometimes 5 to 10 minutes before I can&#39;t see them a! nymore and we are talking about planes in the distance with blinking lights.  I am 99% sure it was not a plane we k ow of or a satellite flying across the sky in our atmosphere.  I&#39;d say it was approximatly 10,000 to 15,000 feet from the ground. I jus hope more comes of it becuz it was only 4 hrs ago. I know that there had to be others around here that saw it I jus don&#39;t know yet. I am buying a video camera now jus because this incedent hoping to get film of an event like this if I ever see this again but I doubt it. As soon as I saw it I hollered in the house to two of my friends and they came outside and witnessed it but they were not very interested.  They just said it looked strange because they thought planes had blinking lights and not jus one big bright light facing the ground.  The way it was moving was also strange it seemed to speed up then slow down then speed up again.  It didn&#39;t move slowly across the sky like a plane nice and steady it was more jagged like it could! jus take off and be gone in the blink of an eye if it wanted  to.  VERY STRANGE.  Anyways I probly sound crazy and I&#39;m tired of talkin about it because I can&#39;t do anything about it and I have no proof other than 2 witnesses and myself. Hopefully someone else witnessed it and maybe they have it on radar.  Well that&#39;s about all I can say for now thank you<n>

There were no flashing lights attached as would have been on an airplane and no sound to accompany it.  It moved steadily and was very bright.  I was sitting in a dark room looking out the window when the object came in to view from a Southwest direction and I watched the object until it passed from my view.  I watch the skies at night, as I enjoy stargazing and have seen satelites and meteors (shooting stars) pass by in the sky and this looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  The object looked to be the color of an orange flame and stayed steady but strongly resembled a star.<n>

Practice ended at nine o’clock and it was about 9:20-9:25 at the time.  I walked up my driveway and noticed that I could see the stars very clearly. I leaned against the van and looked at them for a while facing south. I saw a plane, it was clearly a plane and it was flashing going North/East.  Let me be clear: it was obviously a plane.  Any regular person would look at it and say that it was a plane. By comparison the next two objects I saw did not look anything like the flashing plane. I looked at a brighter star and then it began to go North after a couple seconds, it hadn’t gone very far, it sharply went East. It was a bright orb. Before I could see it leave my field of vision I was distracted by a much dimmer orb going South/West. I watched this until it left my field of vision. I stayed for another minute or two and then came inside. When I started typing this it was about 9:35.<n>

The light in the sky was floated by and we were shocked so we ran to my backyard to check it out, by that time I grabbed my camera and took some shots, I only got 1 picture of the big light, I zoomed in and it is a perfect rectangle.   After that we were watching the sky and we noticed some small lights that resembled stars and I began snapping photos.   We followed the light not losing focus and as the small light passed what seem to be a star the star began moving in opposite direction!  The supposed star flew over us, and after that we noticed another one flying,  It seemed far away and it flew over my house.  I have photo proof of what I seen! I zoomed in and there is a UFO FLYING SAUCER with a Red window and there is something white in the window!!!

I couldn’t tell this to my wife, because I know she would believe in me and think that I really saw a UFO.  I don´t believe in aliens or things related to those stories, but this experience was too much for me.  I hope you can help me understand what I saw. I was driving  home this morning from work (I work at night) in my old Ford Orion and suddently something came in my direction.  First, I thought it was an uncontrolled car comming over me and, to avoid an imminent crash, I turned the steering wheel to the right side of the road and stopped. It wasn´t another car.  The object stopped at my left side.  That thing had almost 8m long in a  metallic blue  color, with a damn shape I really can´t describe.  Probably 20 or 30 seconds after we stopped, that object turned in to an absolutely transparent shape and lift off slowly to the air.  I step of the car, look up and about 10 or 15 m over me came another object like the firs! t one with the same size and shape and disappeared at low speed going to North.  I didn´t hear any strange sounds or saw strange lights. The only thing I felt was some strange wind, I guess, and a very strange sensation of relax. Please, I would like to know if some one can try to give an answer.  Thanks and sorry for the bad english.<n>
4/28/10 06:43|Paredes de Coura (Portugal)||Unknown|1 min|A  strange flying object almost crash into my car|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75214.html|29|ndxe201004| On the morning of Wednesday April 28, I was staying at a friend&#39;s house in SW portland and we had been up all night having a conversation.  We were standing in his kitchen looking out the sliding glass door to the upper balcony.  His deck looks east over the Willamette, and his house sits very high up, near John&#39;s Landing and Macadam.  Because his house sits at the top of the viewpoint it offers a full view of Ross Island and directly parallel from the deck is the north end of Oaks Bottom Natural Reservation.  This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I&#39;ve had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.  I was telling him about a sighting I had near Lake Cushman in Washington, where I was staying at a friends cabin.  This particular sighting happened one night a few months prior, when I went out to the deck of the cabin overlooking the lake.  Strangely enough, when I went out there the sky was clear but nothing unusual was visible.  I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won&#39;t go into detail here.  But it&#39;s important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I&#39;ve had recently, which all seem to be the same &#39;type of craft&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn&#39;t noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, &#34;What are those lights out there?&#34;  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren&#39;t that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn&#39;t rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, &#34;This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!&#34;  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I&#39;ve really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can&#39;t really describe it perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay &#39;lit&#39; for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn&#39;t help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn&#39;t really show the incredible animation of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i&#39;ve experienced &#39;supernatural&#39; or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I&#39;ve had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I&#39;ve seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings. Please contact me if you feel compelled to, I feel there is much more to come very soon!<n>

As soon as I pointed it out to my girlfriend she was already pointing out to more of the same objects.  They appeared to be four individual sphere shaped objects forming a bird like v-shape.  We parked at observed the objects for a couple minutes and watched as they seemed to almost fade away and re appear while maintaining their v-formation.

At the time of this incident there were no clouds visible, the sun was at my back, and no known aircraft could be seen or heard at this specific time.  Living relatively close to an airport, I’m very familiar with the daily sights and sounds of small aircraft and helicopters.  I was sunbathing this afternoon while on the telephone with my sister when a flash of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  The flash of light was relative to sunlight reflected by a mirror from a distance.  When I focused my attention toward the eastern sky I had a difficult time identifying exactly what I was witnessing at that moment.  I saw three spherical/disk-like objects flying in what appeared to be a perfect equilateral triangle formation.  These three, separate objects appeared to be metallic and continued to reflect light, but appeared darker on the bottom.  Perhaps the darke! r appearance on the bottom was an effect of shade.  However, the shade theory is merely speculation.  Although the objects were indeed reflecting sunlight, they did not emit any other light whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three, separate objects held their perfect equilateral triangle formation for approximately 30 seconds. They appeared to be fading in and out of my plain of sight flying rapidly, sharply in a direct east to west motion while maintaining the triangular formation. Each separate object appeared to be twice the size of how the planet Venus appears in the night sky. One of the objects was flying at a slightly higher elevation than the two objects below. The appearance of these three objects was specifically puzzling as they appeared as if they were out of focus, exhibiting an almost hazy appearance. I live at approximately 5,500 feet above sea level. Using the western mountain peaks as a reference I estimate that these objects were flying at altitudes between 8,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level. Their low-altitude flight level could be compared to the altitude of a south-bound, ascending plane from the nearby airport, which is within a five mile radius of my home. Despite t! heir low altitude, no sounds could be heard. If I would have held a ruler to the sky to measure their distance apart, they appeared about ¾ of an inch from each other. They were not spread throughout the sky, they were tightly grouped in the equilateral triangle formation for the first 30 seconds of this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first 30 seconds had passed I moved toward the eastern side of my deck for a prolonged view as the objects were slowly creeping north. Suddenly these three objects began flying in circles around each other. The circular patterns they flew around each other were perfect circles which could be compared to the circular motions demonstrated by braiding three sections of hair. Weaving in a very calculated manner from left to right, up and down. They repeated this pattern 2-3 times in a matter of 10 seconds. The three objects then altered their path, all three of them were flying in completely random circles around each other similar to how flies would buzz around each other. During both patterns of circular, weaving motions the three objects became so close to each other it was difficult to discern one from the other at times. This confirmed that what I was witnessing was indeed not a small aircraft or a helicopter. I am aware of the kinds of maneuvers our known aircraf! ts are capable of and these three separate objects were not demonstrating ordinary or technical maneuvers, these maneuvers were absolutely mind-boggling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects maintained their relative position in the eastern sky, slowly making their way toward the north while holding their altitude. Believing the objects would hold their position I bolted inside the sliding glass door of my bedroom and swiftly grabbed my digital camera. With the objects still within sight it was obvious they had returned to their original equilateral formation in those few seconds, exactly as it was earlier; fading in and out of my plain of sight. While fumbling with my camera to set it to video mode, the objects had moved far enough to the north and east that they were no longer visible. Minutes later the sounds of small aircraft could be heard once again, and were beginning to come within sight. I later contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who referred me to the National UFO reporting center per section 6 of FAA regulations regarding Safety, Accident, and Hazard Reports, 7-6-4. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What were these three objects? Why three patters? Why a triangle? How did these objects manage these impossible maneuvers? Why the middle of the day? Why Colorado?  My sighting today has left me with many understandable, unanswered questions. The most poignant of all these questions is: When will I experience a second sighting?? Until then I will keep my eyes on the skies whenever possible.<n>

Out of skepticism, I went out to see what he claimed to be a bright pulsating light going up and down towards the sky.  While waiting to see what he described this light appeared out of the tree line north of our location and began to go up and down, and at times side to side while at the same time getting brighter at times as if it was getting closer to our location and then backing away as it dimmed.  I captured this on my cell phone for about a minute and a half until it drop down towards the ground as a police helicopter approached and circled the same area for about 15 minutes afterward.  This was no helicopter or airplane in the sky that we all saw.  The way it zipped back and forth, no known aircraft can do that.  I was amazed that nothing was reported on the local news agency regarding this sighting because of the length of exposure and the obvious dispatch of the police helicopter to investigate this sighting.<n>

They were moving so fast I thought they were spot lights or my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in my work and came back out 15 min later for another smoke and to leave when I looked over and the 2 lights were still chasing each other but where a lot closer.  I stood there and I saw 2 bright spheres flying at really high speeds all over the sky.  This continued for another 15 min when they started to slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t going to report this until I saw 5 more spheres appear, like they where there the whole time but didn’t have lights on.  Six formed a V formation and one was to the north of the V but behind the leader of the V.  They flew off at extremely high speeds to the northeast until I couldn’t see them anymore.  The date and time of the sighting was 04/26/10 at 23:45 to 04/27/10 at 0:15.<n>

There was a spotty overcast but many stars were visible. I had just finished reading Edward J Ruppelt book  On “A Report on Unidentified flying objects” and was thinking that the reason I was not seeing anything myself was because I was not spending munch time.  Looking at the night sky. That is why I was here on my hammock armed with mosquito repellent and I phone with astronomy Apes.  I had just identified the brightest star in the sky Sirius and was moving my eyes right to the north and west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly high in the sky almost directly over my head I saw a meteor streaming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was no small meteor it was bright and was leaving along lighted trail. I was thinking this is a good meteor one of the best I have seen. I have watched for meteors for decades And have seen some good ones some much better but this had to be in my top ten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then just as it was terminating in a bright red fireball a red light came on and begin to flash red and white and then at times I thought there might be some green but it was a fleeting green that lasted only milliseconds.   The meteor seemed to have terminated rather oddly it was larger and seemed to have stopped for a short period before becoming a red and white flashing light. It was motionless for a brief period of time and then began to move in a northwesterly direction in the general direction of Dallas, TX about 35 air miles away.  It seemed to be moving at about the speed of a jet airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about five min as it disappeared into the northwestern horizon<n>

I saw what i thought was a great one come in very fast almost straight overhead.  But just as it burned out a bright red light came on.  The the red light morphed into a white lithe and for a very short time blue. then red pulse with a very short white. the light continually change its color spectrum from red to whit with only one source.  I never heard any sound at all. the light moved away from me gradually picking up speed to approx that of a jet airplane. It moved away from me in a northwester direction.  It started its move away from a point in the sky about 40 degrees above the horizon maybe less.  As it moved northwest it got closer to the horizon taking about 5 min before I could no longer see the red light.  It seemed to turn somewhat north as it moved away but slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it must have  been the new mini space plane. did anyone else in my area make a report.      Thanks<n>

Cowichan more precisely, during sunny weather with only a few clouds and maybe a high haze, while I was driving down Kingsview Rd from &#39;The Properties&#39; on the W slope of Mt Tzuhalem, as I approached the bottom where it comes to a T with Maple Bay Rd, I spotted something small in the air somewhere over Quamichan Lake, maybe 1km away I estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reflecting the sun (to the upper left) and had some sort of dark attachment, either above or below it - I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember clearly as I only saw it for a few secs.. but it was rising quickly.  As you would expect, my mind was racing thru the various possibilities as to ID - small helicopter/plane or model of such.. mylar balloon, etc - none seemed to fit. (If it were a plane, model or real, I think I would have seen wings.) I could not pull over to watch it as there was traffic behind me and no room to pull over, not to mention going down steep hill, so as I descended toward the main Rd I lost sight of it behind the trees along that road.  But just seconds later, after turning onto that rd in the short merge lane I found I had a clear view out over the lake, and there were no longer any vehicles behind me, so I could pull over and try to relocate it. The only trees were now to my far left, but pretty open view otherwise. There was nothing to be seen in the sky.  It had to have hightailed it out of there pretty fast to disappear like that. When I saw it I could see it against Mt Prevost in the background (beyond the lake and on the other side of Hwy 1), which provided good contrast to see the obj. Some of its rapid upward motion could have been caused by my decent, but I&#39;m sure that effect only added to its real motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not figure out why I could no longer see it anywhere around, after only a few seconds. I wondered if the power line crossing the main rd over to Kingsview had been reflecting the sun as I came down, viewing it almost end-on.  So I got back in my car and spun around to go back up the hill and down again to recreate the effect, but the power line was too low to have caused it. There goes that theory..  I&#39;m quite certain it was out over the lake, maybe 1km from me, almost level with my line of sight and the Mtn in the background, but quickly rising.  It had to be very shiny to reflect the sun like that, but couldn&#39;t have been very large - no bigger than a small helicopter. So it still could have been something mundane like that but even with choppers you can usually see them flying away in 1 direction or other, they can&#39;t move that fast! Hope this is detailed enough considering the banality of the sighting as compared with others, but it was actually my first sighting in 34yrs of life and felt I should report it. Wish it could be less vague.<n>

I observed strange red and white flashing lights high above the corcavado mountain.  The brighter lights were 2 red lights which seemed to move closer with white lights randomly flashing in the same area.  There are lots of flights in and out of Rio and there are also masts in the area of corcavado.  These lights were at a much higher altitude and did not move like a plane would.  One of the red lights appeared to move vertically up in a slow manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible some completely normal explanation, but i did find the event curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My wife went off by herself and I went off the other direction to take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home I reviewed my pictures and saw these objects in one of my pictures.  They weren&#39;t too clear so I asked her to view the picture on her Apple large screen.  Then she viewed her pictures of the same area but from a different angle and she caught the same thing this one if her picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see these objects with our eyes but the cameras picked them up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not really sure what they are.

Me and some buddies were hanging out in our parking lot when 2 of us saw the same green light, very bright, fly by really quickly and disappear beyond the treeline, never saw it land.  We of course started yelling out of fear, we knew it had to land very far away, about 10 minutes later we saw a second, same speed, same green light, the crazy part that made us know this was no ordinary thing was that they wrere so low, and about 5-10 minutes later, government planes (so i think) started flying very low in the same direction of the ufos, not a normal amount of planes, maybe about 15-20, very very low and all in the same places.  Of course we all had to be home but that is what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At about 11:05pm I saw lights over a line of trees to my left from inside of my car. I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It then dimmed to a hardly perceptible point of light travelling very slowly from North to due South. It appeared to be very much higher than an aircraft - I suspect that it was a satellite passing overhead which was still in sunlight although it was almost dark on the ground and that the &#34;bright-light&#34; was simply light reflecting off a metal surface. I would be interested to hear if there have been any other sightings and if you can offer an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night sky many stars were visible. My 6 year old son was riding passenger and I was on my phone with a friend. She heard everything I’m about to recount.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was at approx. 350 degrees in the north sky and at about a 45 degree angle. At first I thought it was a blimp because the size was about that along with the shape, longer body with a shorter height; like one of the super large Goodyear blimps you see at sporting events. Then I realized it wasn’t moving at all and my visibility got better to where I could tell the height wasn’t much at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along the bottom it had white lights that were circling it. The reason I know the lights were moving and not a blinking sequence is because there was a small obvious break in the lights. At the top it appeared to have two smaller lights one red and one white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to keep driving and try to get a closer look to figure out what exactly I was seeing. As I approached the bottom lights turned off and all I could see vaguely were the top lights. It still seemed a distance away at that point. I made a turn on a side street to continue trying to get closer and after passing a tree I could no longer see anything there, no red light nothing at all. It seemed to have disappeared after about a 4 minute show. I kept asking my son if he was seeing what I was seeing and he was. There was no doubt in either of our minds we were seeing something very unusual in our night sky.<n>

So I quickly moved to the sidewalk on Mcart – but when I got out where I could see the sky better, the objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airbus came from the south direction at the same altitude – so I got to compare its size, using my finger and I determined the two spheres were half as long as the airbus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That meant each had enough room for at least 50 human size passengers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact, I didn’t see the spheres anymore – didn’t surprise me, as that wasn’t the first sighting of such objects, in that area and elsewhere about the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s a spot for more of my background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My interest in UFO has been a on and off affair –since my mother recounted a close encounter at a very young age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She the youngest girl and a uncle the youngest boy of 13, on a farm around 1934 or 5, where they came within ten feet of a glowing sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “It was a huge white ball with black lines running from pole to pole and it hummed like a high voltage transformer.”  I asked her how close it was.   She pointed to a wall about ten feet away.   She said, “We had snuck out that night and was about to cross an open field, when this huge ball suddenly lit up in front of us!  We just watched it for a few minutes, then, the older ones grabbed {her &amp; my uncle} and took off down the road…we never saw it again.” That story was verified by her siblings as much as 40 years apart – each time they initiated it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t until July 1973 when I had my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived in Texas and was living in Dallas at that time.  I was outside reading a book, on the back lawn, when I notice a squadron of F-16 fly over.  They were moving rapidly west to east -- in formation with 5 or 6 glowing spheres that phased in and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That incident made me more aware of my surrounding, but it wasn’t until a night in July 1997 that I saw a test flight of a craft that was man made; it took off along I-35w near an air strip I know of in Keller, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was long and big about the size of a 727 and that was about 9 pm as I was moving north on I-35.  I saw it lift off from below the trees – it had a faint pale greenish blue glow.	 	It was invisible to anyone beneath a street light or anyone in downtown area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happen to be in the right spot at the right time, when it climbed to a height directly over the Bass tower in Fort Worth, and it stopped on a dime.  It remained at station keeping for several seconds; it began moving in wide circular patterns, so fast, it seemed to be two places at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That went on for almost 30 minutes, then, it returned to its landing strip.  Being a member of a large family, I had relatives in various fields – like the corps of engineers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes they went to work at the D.U.M.B. where CIA security have to supervise their handling of blueprints stored in a metal scroll like device, so only their area of work is visible. We figured down there is where the craft proto-types are stored and developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I worked at this factory location, I’ve been able to spot a number of alien objects and observed the government’s reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, on a Friday, in Feb. 2008; I had just arrived for work at 11pm, when I saw a bright object drop in the southeast. I thought it was a meteorite and looked away, I continued walking north along the loading rim of the loading dock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went up a short flight of stairs, got my clipboard and continued north, passing 3 overhead docks door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to cross the space of 45ft, between buildings, when I glanced to my left, towards a long 1 story building that ran north by south and next to it was the 2 story front office building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and saw that same bright yellow object still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “That’s no meteorite!”  I said out loud, as I watched the object make a controlled landing not more then a few blocks away from where I stood.   It looked that close.  And it was at least 30ft wide shaped like an egg – but extremely bright like the sun,  I use to work at an airport and seen hundreds of chopper landings in all weather conditions and that thing made a perfect soft vertical landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just took off for the front as fast as I could navigate the complex and when I got to Mcart Street – I saw no trace of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That object was as bright as the sun.  I expected to see a fire on somebody’s roof – it came down right below the roof level of our complex – and it appeared very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was expecting a chopper to arrive, one did, a gray one, but it was circling the wrong area.  It did so all night, leaving once to refuel and came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Days later, I saw one odd looking black chopper fly about the area, in a search pattern, but it didn’t stay long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 week after that, the chemtrails started and so did larger objects appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve lived and worked in this area 10 years and never seen a chemtrail.   But now, it sprayed as thick as a blanket, until the sky has an eerie look and smell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One weekend I noticed a small blimp with an Insurance company logo, fly over this cluster of houses located in an isolated spot where gravel is dump and hauled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving stock toward the warehouse headed west as I saw it, the blimp turned toward me.  It came directly overhead, I suddenly got sick.  My pulse started racing and I felt flushed and it lasted until the blimp moved away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved clear of the area and watched with my binoculars as the blimp just kept circling this one cluster of houses for several hours until just before sundown and then it went away headed north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it return weeks later, from the north and circle this same group of houses, seemly all afternoon, then, it would leave the way it came.  Inside the blimp I saw one, or two people in the cabin at the flight controls – but no passengers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after that, maybe a week or more, I saw an airbus moving eastward with a huge thick trail of dark smoke behind it.  I almost thought it was in trouble, because I saw what I took for smoke move away from the cabin, but it wasn’t smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wearing a pair of very dark sun glasses that enabled me to see the object clearly, as it was almost invisible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object that cut across the path of this airbus was huge – it dwarfed the plane by thousands of feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved toward the ground in a U shape – when it reached the ground it dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked toward the south of the plane where the sky hadn’t been spray-- and saw this mass of objects move from the upper atmosphere and cross paths with the plane, once again moving toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought they were meteorites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see grainy chunks moving in mass toward the ground, with a faint pale yellow green color and dissipate as they reached about 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a moment of trying to figure out what I was seeing, I then thought it was a sun flare that had punched through the atmosphere.  But it wasn’t that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another object come down and cross paths with the airbus, and as I advanced closer, I could see chunks of inner mass move in long stringy formations, like a jellyfish tentacles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I began to wonder, if I wasn’t seeing something that was alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized, all during this incident, the plane hadn’t moved much since I first saw it.  It was still in the same place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That plane was spraying a huge mass of chemicals and I was ready to stay clear of it, so I fled indoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The black opts projects in Texas are in full gear! Since May, 30, 2008.  I’ve stood below test shots of energy beams, 20  to 30 feet wide, shot from a University rooftop at clouds 60 ft above my neighborhood,  I seen metal framed jet powered drones fly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve even seen our folk, or them, make a huge Jacob’s ladder or escalator in the clouds for about 55 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You could see the moment they turned the switch off, the wind and clouds settled down, as if nothing had happened.<n>

I was at the skate park at the time of the incident so I pointed the object out to a couple of freinds.  We kept following it with our eyes and another object of the same shape popped up out of nowhere right next to the first.  We were in awe and were getting exited that the whole park of about 20 people wittnessed the same sight we were seeing.  We kept following the objects when more and more of the same objects were appearing. Some were close to eachother and some were spread out.  About an 1 hour and a half one of the objects went stationary while two objects came near the stationary object and went into a triangle formation. The formation was stationary for about 15 minutes and then flew away faster than anything Ive ever seen.  Soon after that an airforce jet flew by without a smoke trail and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At first I assumed it to be an approaching aircraft but it did&#39;t move at all which drew my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely stationary, which is impossible even for a helicopter.  It was absolutely stationary for about 10 minutes, then another orb appeared as if it were a light being turned on. The second orb was identical to the first and appeared to the right and slightly higher than the first.  They both remained completely stationary in relation to the surface of ocean and to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No way these were stars.

My mother was driving me to a doctor’s appointment at around 3:40pm through Westwood, NJ, facing west towards route 17.  My mother recalls exactly what I did when we reflected on this sighting.  I looked in the sky and saw a seemingly pyramidal shaped object.  It seemed metallic in nature; my mother describes it as a shiny aluminum.  It was dark, almost black at one face and extremely shiny at another face.   Also, there was some rotation that I observed on this object.   The most amazing thing about this object was its seemingly random and very rapid movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, this object was hovering over the town of Westwood, at one point right over our heads.  But in the objects vicinity, there was rapid movement.  At first thinking this was maybe an eye floater, since I was also inside the car, I opened the window and there it still was, moving very rapidly, yet in a general direction; It seemed as if it was headed somewhere.  The best analogy I can give for the rapid movement in the vicinity of the object is that of the following situation:  If you have a camera that you are holding and trying to focus on an object from far away, no matter how still you try to make your camera, the object always seems to be shaking.  This is what it looked it, like it was excessively shaking, even thrashing about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have perfect vision and no history of mental problems.  My mother also claims to have witnessed this same phenomenon.  However, my mother was driving, and I actually took the time to open the window and capture the image in my mind, it is still very clear and fresh to me.   I also want to add that this was completely broad daylight on a clear blue sky with very few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I would like to add that there must have been some other people who saw this object since it was in plain sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Underneath I have drawn a picture of what it looked like. (This object would be against a clear blue sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was trashing about spontaneously, not just traveling in a linear way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also: I called the local paper, the Bergen Record.  They say that they received NO CALLS about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called the Westwood Police station and told them about this, they said that they did not receive any calls regarding this phenomenon.    The officer from Westwood Police Department informed me to call Teterboro Airport to ask if there was anything in the air that day.  I asked for the number to call the airport; he could not find the number and instead told me that he would call Air Traffic Control (he said that if they needed to talk to me that they would call my house phone).  I haven’t received a call yet, and if I do, I will update this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I am AMAZED that in this broad daylight, NO ONE OTHER THAN ME called the the police or news organizations…it might happen later but to the people who read this:  I GREATELY underestimated the TIMIDNESS and PASSIVENESS of people in general.  To me and my mom, we thought that MASSIVE amounts of people would report this…but in fact no one else did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: I tried sketching a picture but it wouldn&#39;t let me copy and paste it into the box.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be happy to draw a picture.<n>

I lost sight of it under the wing and then spotted the object again as it came back out from behind the view of the wing.  Just then it made a large, graceful, consistent right hand arc and sped away.  I watched it for e few seconds until it disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe it as a perfectly round, bright white, featureless &#34;ball&#34; about the size of a large washing machine.  It zipped by under the left wing about 400 ft. down and was traveling very fast (several hundred or maybe a thousand mph?)   As it arced a turn to the right it didn&#39;t deviate in altitude or in speed whatsoever, it just changed direction.  I was struck by how fast and how smoothly it moved through the air.  It looked like it was riding through the air on invisible rails or something.... Just REALLY fast and REALLY smooth...

To the northwest, I observed a fairly large, black object in the sky above the trees but below the cloud ceiling (3600 feet, according to my local FAA Fight Service Station’s data).  At first, I thought it was a hawk, as they do sometimes circle above.  But as it slowly moved across the sky, it became clear to me that it was, in fact, a solid boomerang or backwards-L-shaped object.  It had no lights and was silent (at least to my ears), and it didn’t move like one would expect a gliding bird to.  As I reported above, this was during a thunderstorm, so with the cloud cover, there was no sun or anything else I could use to give it scale, but it appeared to me to be at least as large as a helicopter or a single-engine plane.  It was a solid, hard object, moving slowly and deliberately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a wide, horizontal arc towards me, traveling from left to right in my field of vision, and began moving to the north/northwest, away from my location, and disappeared, possibly into cloud cover.  One unusual aspect of this object was that the &#34;boomerang&#34; did not have a horizontal attitude like a plane, but rather a vertical one, hence the backwards &#34;L&#34; description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the interest of accuracy and full disclosure, I should note here that I am mildly nearsighted and wear glasses for driving.  I was not wearing my glasses at the time of this sighting, and felt that there wasn’t time to go and get them.  However, my vision isn’t that bad, and I stand by what I’ve described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I immediately wrote down the details of my observation, and went to my computer to look up what to do in the event of a sighting of this type, and then called the local police who, in turn, sent two officers to speak to me right away.  They listened to me but did not take a police report, and instructed me to keep a camera handy should the object reappear.  I then called the Center for UFO Studies to make a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also put on record with this report that I’ve had a mild interest in the subject of UFO’s and have read about them and kept an open mind.  However, I never expected to have my own sighting, and can draw no conclusions as to what it really was that I saw, except that it didn’t appear to me to be a plane, helicopter, or other known aerial vehicle.  It did not appear to be natural phenomena, but it did appear to be an object of some kind.<n>

Every so often we could make out a white jolt of light that seemed to project out from the object in random directions (quickly like lightning).  The object was brighter than anything else in the sky and mostly hovered in one spot but also moved from side to side.  At first, the light / object was large and did not seem to be very far away and I was almost sure that it was a strange type of lit up helicopter searching for something on the ground.  I opened the window expecting to hear the engine! and was very surprised to find that it was dead silent outside.    I worked as a professional photographer for a few years and have all pro level equipment.  I asked my wife to grab my camera (a Canon 5D digital SLR with 70-200 L 2.8 IS lens), tripod, and shutter release cable while I kept my eye on the light.  I wanted to try to get a long exposure that showed the path of the light over time.  Just as I got everything setup and settings dialed in, my newly charged batteries went completely dead.  I asked my wife to try to find some other batteries while I kept my eye on the light.  As time went on, the light seemed to be dissipating and was getting smaller as if it was traveling away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also scanning the sky for anything else out of the ordinary and saw a high flying jet moving overhead.  The jet turned slightly and headed DIRECTLY toward the light.  We were watching as the jet approached.  My wife returned with new batteries and I took a 30 second exposure with my shutter release cable (no camera movement) with the jet approaching the light in the same frame.  At this point the light was very distant and just looked like a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the path of the jet overlapped and intersected the light, I expected to see the jet continue on it’s trajectory, bypassing the light in the sky.  I was absolutely startled when the jet disappeared completely from sight at the exact same time that it intersected the light.  It was as if the pilot shut off the strobe lights at the exact same time.  There were no clouds in the sky so I&#39;m certain it did not go behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After analyzing the image, one would tend to discredit the image since the light appears to follow the exact same trajectory as the stars as the jet is approaching.    However, before the image was taken, the light was much closer, much brighter, and clearly traveled in multiple directions in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said that he had witnessed a boomerang shaped craft flying low over our apartment. (around 3500-5000ft.) This has not been the first time we have witnessed an event like this, we had a similar one last year. When I came home he explained to me that he had seen a large craft flying overhead. We are used to seeing planes fly over us all of the time and he knew that this was not a plane. Also from our previous experience last year I assumed that if I waited outside long enough I might see something else, which I did. Flying north towards the mountains, off to my right, there were two slightly glowing orange orbs circling each other in formation. This is when I called to report the event. Then about ten minutes later a single orb flew in the same direction off to my left. Then again about 5 minutes later another one flew over but seemed to vanish as I was! looking at it and I could no longer trace its flight path. They were much like the orange orbs I had seen last year however not as bright and this time they were flying much closer to the ground. I would say lower than planes yet higher than birds if that makes sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a quarter to 11 at night I decided to take a longer way home down back roads. As i came to a stop sign at the intersection of mountain road and skidmore road, as i came to the stop sign in front of me across the rd was an object over a field with a green , red and 2 bright pulsating white lights, it could have been between 500 ft to 1000 feet above the ground since it was dark i could not see a shape but it could have been a cigar shape. I could not tell if it was hovering or just moving very slowly towards me i took a right onto skidmore rd. At this point the object was behind me but i could see it out of my driver side window as it was more on my left side but behind me, I  drove a little over 2 miles to the next rd as i was driving i kept looking back and it seemed to be moving in my direction but at a slow speed i passed 2 other cars on skidmore rd they were going towa! rds it i assume they had to see this thing. The red light was blinking the green light was stationary and the 2 white lights were just pulsating slowly back and forth with each other, these were the brightest lights iv`e ever seen and i havent seen pulsating lights like this, even though they were bright nothing else was lit up not even this object. As soon as i seen this thing i could tell it was not a plane. There is an airport not far from here just across the river and its also used by the military so i see commercial and military cargo planes a lot over here, this thing was moving north west not even in the direction of the airport. Right before i made the turn off skidmore rd i looked back again and it was gone. Up to this point i seen this thing for the whole 2 mile drive by looking out my driver side window. I know about other sightings around here from friends and family, one of them even though not a recent sighting was on this same rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a dark shadow moving west directly above me very slowly. As my eyes began to focus, I clearly saw the outline of a very large rounded boomerang shape ship with no lights. I could make out the outline very well. I would guessed it to be flying at between 2500-3000 feet, because it appeared to be lower than the mountains, which are around 3200 feet. The ship was more rounded like a half a circle with sharp points or horns coming off of it, sort of like a Chinese throwing star. It was low enough that it was reflecting light off of the bottom part of the ship. From the reflection I could clearly see that it was a sliv! er/light color. The object slowly faded away in the distance. The entire experience was surreal and very eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the same night at 11:05PM, I also saw 2 bright orbs connected to one another to what appeared to be a rod of some sort. They traveled in the same direction as the other object, however they moved much faster, and the objects appeared to circle each other as it moved across the sky heading west. This object was also seen by my fiance whom just arrived home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was taking out the garbage. Once outside I glanced toward the western sky and saw what I first thought was a large black bird(buzzard)gliding through the air on wind/thermal current. As I continued to watch I noticed it was moving in a straight line, no wing flaps, no variation from the southwest to north east direction it was moving.  I realised that it was no bird and thought maybe a ballon. It was a black circle moving in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realised that it could not be a ballon, because there was no deviation in it&#39;s path, i.e. no floating or oscillating movements as baloon would with wind currents. I then quickly went inside to get my binoculars. Back outside I focused on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it was solid black, not reflecting any light at all. Kind of a flat black if you will. It was also a perfect circle! Not egg shaped like most baloons being round at the top and more narrow at the bottom.  Anyways I as watched through the binocs it had nothing attached(i.e.string)no lights, no markings whatsoever. I would guess it was about 2-3k feet up, making no sound at all. The thing that puzzled me so was that it flew in a straight line, never deviating from it&#39;s path. I watched for maybe 3 mins until it flew out of sight in the distance.  It was moving around 25-30 mph. Not very fast at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I go back inside wondering what I had just seen, when I decided go back out to make sure I closed the lid on outside garbage. I still had binocs in hand. While outside I looked back to the area where I first spotted the circle and lo and behold there is a second one exactly like the first moving in the exact same manner and path as well as speed.  I estimate these thing were no more than 2-3 feet wide. I checked the time and it was 7:56pm. I also watched this object through the binocs until it flew out of sight. It looked identical to the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside and checked local weather radar on cable TV. The winds were light 3-5 mph out of the southeast. If it were big ballons they would have been traveling in a straight line against a cross wind! I have no idea what I saw, but I know what they were not(bird,or baloon). The Sun was setting but there was still plenty of daylight.  Weather was clear with light clouds. These black circles stood out very well against the sky. If anyone had been in our area and looked up they would have easily spotted the objects. I know people see alot of things, some explainable, some not. But two perfectly shaped circles, black, travelling in precise straight lines with no deviations in their path is really weird. Again, no sound, no smoke trail,no strings, lights, reflections, markings, nothing. I am a 47yo Operations Manager who lives in Beaufort S.C. We have 2 major airports, Hilton Head, SavannahG.A., as well as the Marine Corp. Air Station, so I see lots of private, commercia! l, as well as military air craft. These objects were truly something I have never seen before.<n>

I was situated in the center of the city of Claremont, CA 91711, looking up at the eastern sky.  My angle of elevation was at approximately 75 degrees.  The cluster, of about a dozen or so objects, was loosely arranged in a random configuration, about the size of the sun.  The size of the individual objects was a bit larger than a star.  Their movement was of a random darting about; sometimes appearing to suddenly disappear and then reappear.  I observed the phenomenon for about 2-3 minutes, before it abruptly stopped and disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside to look it wasen&#39;t there of course. But they saw a white light accelerate towards the ground then stopped around 50 feet above the ground and accelerated back up to about 200 feet then it stopped turned on 2 bright white &#34;spot lights&#34; and started moving west from our house. After about 30 seconds of this it emitted a bright white light and disappeared. After looking around in the sky for more I happen to see about 10 flying north very far in the sky a little to the left of the moon. I was amazed! I stayed outside and kept searching for more and saw 1 here 1 there fliyng only north and south.  A little later my girlfriend was on her way to my house &#34;she lives about 30 miles north of me&#34;. I had told her about what happend and was even on the phone with her when i saw 1 flying alone. So she was searching the sky as she was on the way here and then looke! d to her left and saw a HUGE white disk shape and 2 jets a good ways away from it. It was about a mile or so in the air and she said it was about the size of a football field. I&#39;ve seen a UFO before and researched it quite a bit but NEVER anything like this? 2 Ufos close to the ground? and multiple flying north and south? Sorry for the bad grammar and punctiuations<n>

The best I could explain it&#39;s location is that it was hovering a few dozen feet over my neighbor&#39;s house, but since I wasn&#39;t able to determine exactly how close or how far away it was, it may not have been over his house at all and only appeared that way. I immediately reached for my camera phone, fumbling with it as I tried to power it on. By the time it was turned on though and I had it aimed out the window the light was gone. The entire experience lasted anywhere from ten to thirty seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no other lights, and the blue dot that I saw was steady / unblinking.  Its altitude was likely what would be normal for smaller aircraft.  I can not estimate its speed, but it moved from my left to my right in about 2 seconds.  I continued to see it for about another 10 seconds as it continued south over Rt 22 and 78, and it seemed to slow only because my view of it was looking at it from the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was about the size of a bright object like Venus and was both clearly moving and definitely blue in color.  There were no sounds accompanying it.  The route that it traveled is a route I commonly see A-10&#39;s fly, but it was significantly faster than an A-10 (and slower than a meteor and did not fade).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 11:40 p.m. we went out on to the balcony to enjoy the night air.  We were passing to the east of the Dominican Republic after leaving St. Thomas earlier that afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after going out on the balcony I noticed a while spherical shaped light out on the water a couple of hundred yards out form the ship. I remarked to my wife, &#34;What&#39;s that light out there&#34;?  She said, &#34; It&#39;s a ship&#34;. But then I pointed out that there wasn&#39;t a ship to be seen and the light didn&#39;t look like a ship light. It was very intense, bright white, and there were no other lights around. Within seconds of saying this, the light began to rise up from the ocean surface. It reached a height of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. After rising up the light appeared to be more spherical. It then began to perform acrobatic maneuvers. The object would move along a few seconds in one direction then dart back across the sky at a nearly 180 degree angle from the direction it was traveling. As we were seeing this we pointed the object out to a group on a balcony just above us. They confirmed that we were all seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object darted around in the sky for a few minutes then moved back down to the ocean surface. As it moved down, it appeared to be coming right at the ship. All of us watching the object kind of stepped back and had a moment wondering if the object was going to come all the way to the ship. As the object approached the ship, about 150 yards out, it went into the water. We could see the light under the water for a few seconds, and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the object my wife and I were talking to the other witnesses making comments like, &#34;Are you seeing what I am seeing?&#34;, &#34;Wow!&#34; and variations of &#34;Holy Crap!&#34;. We confirmed with each other that we had all seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no doubt we all saw the same thing. However, none of us had any idea what we had just seen. The object moved in ways I never seen a manmade flying object move before. It cut and darted faster than any bird I&#39;ve ever seen. At times it moved so fast it was hard to track it moving across the sky. Then it would stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an incredible event. I have no idea what the object&#39;s origins or purpose was. I have no idea if it was man made or of some other origin. If it was man made, we have  craft that can do some incredible maneuvering. That it went into the water and disappeared  made it all the more incredible and all the more mysterious to me. I have no way of knowing other than the what I saw and the feeling I got while seeing it, but I&#39;m pretty sure we all saw something not of human making. I could be wrong. Its possible we have some fantastic craft. But if I had to bet, what we saw did not come from humans of this time frame.<n>

However when viewed through a telescope it appears to have shape and remains solid in position.  Object does change colors but I can’t determine if it’s actual color change or just atmospheric light distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason the object caught my attention is the abrupt entry and exit speeds of the object.  I have clearly seen aircraft around the object by the indicator lights on the aircraft, but the aircraft’s were not pursuing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I’ve tried both camera and video camera to capture the object but all I capture is a big blurry ball.  I’ve tried to take a picture through the telescope but this also was a failure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot determine the entry and exit speeds however it does leave a trail of light through the sky which only lasts briefly.  It’s entry and exit patterns very day by day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too dark to get a genuine shape however occasionally I will get a glimpse of a reflective surface on moonlit nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no noise that I can hear from this distance and other people have seen it but think it’s an optical illusion and I believe it could be an optical illusion myself however it might be worth checking out.<n>

It was far too long to be an airplane, it made no noise whatsoever, and it moved quite a bit faster than a plane. Because it was dark at this time, I couldn&#39;t make out a shape, but believe it is best described as a long line or rectangle, at least the part of it that I could see.  From the time I first saw it directly above me, while standing outside on my balcony, I watched it for about 15 seconds until it disappeared. I was facing the south, and the object was flying from the west to the east.<n>

I couldn’t tell the size of it. It was either really high and very large or really low and not that large.  If I put my arm all the way out it was the slightly larger than my hand.  It had lights pulsating in sequence beginning from the point of the triangle (the front) down to the back and then back up to the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached the front the lights would pause for a second and then start the rotation over again.  I followed the object for a total of about 10 minutes, and was able to get a pretty good look of it.  The lights on it where a light blue in color.  The bottom/belly of the object appeared to be rounded. The object appeared to be a midnight blue in color but that could have been a reflection from the flashing blue lights.  For about 5 minutes the object was going with traffic while zigzagging left and right over the freeway.  After a little bit, still traveling in a zigzag path, it began to speed up until it traveled out of sight.  At 9 pm my boyfriend called me.  While explaining to him what I had seen,  I saw another light.  At that point I was coming up to the agricultural check point on the northbound side of I-5.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  When I got closer I realized it wasn’t moving and it was only about 100 yards above the freeway.  It was a solid white light approximately the size of my thumb at arms length just floating about the freeway.  As I drove past it I was able to look out the drivers side window and see nothing attached to it.  It was just a single bright floating light.<n>

He didn’t  park his car correctly, because he wanted us to see this and explain what it was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up all three, we saw one very bright light very stady and he told us that there were two of them moving side way but one went west. We couldn&#39;t know what it was. We all went inside the house, when we finish havign dinner my daugther went out to see the light, but it was gone.  Can somebody explain us what it was.<n>

We watched it while driving for about 20 minutes then it began to drop quickly.  We then decided to video it and zoom in on it.  When we zoomed in, the shape seemed diamond but with what looked like many round lights in it. Then it changed into a thin, oblong shape that seemed to split into two parts and make other shapes- almost like symbols.  We stopped the truck and put the camera on the dash and watched the said object jump in, out, and all around the screen.  It would then return to the diamond shape. It changed shape many times. We videoed the object for 27 minutes before it quickly became smaller and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the tape at home, we realized the object was not shaped like a diamond, but more like a spinning toy top is shaped.  It would also seem to pulsate at different times, but only when it was in this shape.<n>

This is what caught my attention. I continued to watch at each stoplight as I drove home down Nimitz drive towards Waikiki. I did noticed two contrails following each other in rocket like arc. Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns. I don’t think that was the case because the contrails were so short. I will attach some pictures. Did anyone else notice these strange aircraft?<n>

EST in Progresso, Yucatan my wife and I were lying on the beach staring due north into the skies. Patchy cirrus clouds made it necessary to be extremely focused, as what took place often occurred at incredible speeds, perhaps hundreds of times faster than the fastest military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two large ships. Nikki (my wife) and I estimate that they appeared about as big as a football field, but we could be way off. One ship was circular and its contours were illuminated by a rainbow array of lights. The other was triangular, and emitted what we immediately thought was a laser-like light---a glow---that was magnificent. These ships were relatively stable in the skies. Although they moved in any direction at will and even appeared to change shape, what they sent into the skies was even more incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty spheres were released by the ships and performed incredible feats of aeronautical engineering. They went up, stopped, went down, went left, right, changed direction. And then we were treated to something even more fantastic. One of the spheres zigzagged (like a zipper) from an altitude of about one mile and landed in the Gulf of Mexico, swimming distance to where we marveled on the beach. Neither of us has seen faster movement by a material object. At the same time, it was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After forty-five minutes (2:15 EST) we were more than overwhelmed and went back to our hotel room. Interestingly, the following day we met our new Shaman in the pueblito of Halacho near the Campeche border with Yucatan and he told us: “It is good that you can see them.” A fisherman chimed in. “Yes. Two years ago we saw one in the same place. It landed in the water and didn’t even make a ripple.”<n>

There was hardly any traffic on the road because of the hour.  This neon blue light moved downward toward as if coming down a staircase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stopped in front of a business park just to the left of us, approximately 25 yards away, and changed from a blue light orb to three neon blue squares linked together in a vertical rectangle tilted forward from the top.  The neon blue light pulsed at a very high rate and radiated from the the blue squares but the object itself made no sound.  The object itself appeared to be slightly smaller than the light on the light post next to it, approximately 10&#34; in length.  It hovered from side to side and up and down, turning sideways and back again; remaining in an a! rea of about 2-3 cubit feet.   As it turned sideways to reveal it&#39;s profile there didn&#39;t appear to be anything behind the blue light bar that we could see.   At first we thought it must be a toy.  There was not a single person around the object or in the parking lot of the business park.  Our driver said it could not be a toy because no transmitter could reach that far, given the fact that it descended from a visual point out of the night sky high above us.  A car coming from behind us also stopped to watch this intriging object as well as a man in a truck coming from the other direction.  The object then returned to the blue light orb and began traveling NE just above the roof tops.  It seemed to be traveling very slow at first so I told my friend driving to follow it.  Before we could get the car turned around the object acceleratled in a straight line NE and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe whatever it was came with an objective and that it traveled so low to the roof tops so that it could travel without much detection.  I also believe that it&#39;s destination were somewhere reasonably close or else it would have made it&#39;s descention elsewhere.  Northeast from where we were located is a military reserve base, Northeast Mesa and Fort McDowell Mtns.  I live right next to the military reserve base where there is a jet and pilot ready 24/7 for take off in case of an intrusion.  In the three months that I&#39;ve lived here I&#39;ve heard the jet take off just after midnight twice within the last week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to share our experience.<n>

Both objects were stationary in the sky, one a very bright yellow and and the other a bright blue. They were probably less than a mile apart from each other.  Each object was not moving and it was easy to tell they were not planes because several planes were flying nearby them.  They both would become more/less intense in brightness at certain times and seemed to be diamond shaped.  The blue colored one appeard to be flickering heavily and very noticebly changing colors from red, blue, green, yellow, etc.. at one point the object appeared to come apart into about 4 separate points of light and then returned together after about 5 seconds.  After watching each object for about 40 minuted we ended up running home to grab binoculars and when we returned the yellow one was gone and the blue one seemed to be further aw! ay.  Looking through the binoculars it was clear to see colores dancing around on the object and it appeared to be flashing and rotating.  After another 40 minutes it was much further away and we left the area.  My girlfriend who thought I was nuts for believing in some kind of extraterrestrial occurances was completely blown away and now is a very interested and intrigued by the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Directly ahead of us, (guessing over Cumberland Heights area was where it was) my husband and I both watched as this oddly shaped tangerine/peach colored rectangle passed in front of our field of vision going in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say oddly shaped because the leading edge had well defined 90 degree edges on it and the length was consistent with a rectangle, but the back end was less well defined almost as if it was fading or in a mist at the back end.  The colors were very pretty and bright, and kind of rippled with different shades of orange, tangerine, peach, and even a little pinkish or salmon color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were far enough away to see it in its entirety, and we saw no other aircraft around (at first I thought it might be a banner pulled behind a plane, but the sky was otherwise empty).  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but the shape was wrong, as was the area, for the area is very rural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it as we continued our drive into town for about 4 minutes and my husband even sped up to get closer to it so that we could see it in more detail.  The closer we got, the more vivid the colors were.  We were also able to say without doubt that it was not being powered by or pulled behind any other craft in the sky.  We were trying to get close enough to see if it had any marking or writing on it, but as soon as we got close enough, the road went between two tree covered hills and we lost sight.  I would say that when we lost sight of the craft we were approximately 200 yards away and the craft was flying about 150 feet high, just over the tops of the trees on the hills that surround the road.  It didn&#39;t leave any con-trail, unless the &#39;mistiness&#39; of the back end would qualify, and it didn&#39;t seem to make any noise, but our distance from the craft and the fact we were in a moving vehicle could have been the reason we heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we came out of the hills, my children (age 11 and 14) and I scoured the sky behind us and to the north for the rest of the drive in, but didn&#39;t see it again.  We figured it had to have landed somewhere in the woods, because it was just gone. We talked about it and we were all left scratching our heads.  To my total consternation, we had left the camera at home, and our cell doesn&#39;t have a camera, so we were unable to get a picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do live near an army base, and there are army aircraft of all sorts in the sky over us on a regular basis.  This sighting also took place not far from a TVA power plant off the Cumberland River.  I am unsure if this has anything to do with the sighting, but not far from the sighting is a small back country looking road that has been closed and gated with a sign saying something to the effect - closed by order of the U.S Government.  Could they all be related??<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this in the hopes that someone else saw what we saw and can verify or disprove to us what it was we saw.  My true hope is that someone else was able to get a picture or video of this UFO so that I don&#39;t wonder for the rest of my days what it was that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for providing this forum so that can happen.<n>

Each formation was now shape in a triangle formation.  Two of the formation got closer together still heading in the same direction and the formation closer to me separated and headed north.  The size of each object in the formation was the size of a small compact vehicle the object&#39;s were white in color with a haze&#39;s around them.

We live in a college neighborhood, so at first he assumed it was some kids partying. However, after about 20 minutes, he decided to go outside and see what was going on.  That is when he realized that there were four or more people standing on the sidewalk watching the sky.  He looked up and saw several glowing orbs of light very low in the sky floating slowly past.  At this time, he woke me up as well and I was able to witness the same thing.  From the time I got outside, we saw six of these floating lights.  Each of them were equally distanced apart, flying the exact same route, and they all disappeared in the same spot of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very cloudy night, so even stars were not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound coming from the objects and they seemed to be very close to us.

It appeared to be about 10 stories off the ground.  We saw the underbelly of the craft and it was triangle shaped.  It had three bright lights on each corner of the triangle and there were two bright white lights on its belly, one longer than the other, there was a red flashing light between those lights.  As we passed it (at about 10:12 PM), I continued to look back and the craft’s front light looked like a spotlight- it had a light cone.  It rotated and then disappeared in place.  It didn’t fly away, it faded away.  Like it went into the clouds, but! there weren’t any clouds that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to drive, I saw what I can only describe as was a flashing red and blue star in the distance. It jumped a measured distance across the sky in bursts.  It was very fast. As we approached the Fredonia Exit we saw the flashing lights move closer.  Suddenly very close.  It didn’t have its lights on anymore but it did have blue and red flashing tail lights. The underbelly of the craft looked indescribable.  It appeared to be dimly lit with a light source below it flashing slight colors.  It disappeared around 11: 10 PM or so.<n>

It had horizontal slits on it that had some kind of lighting that can&#39;t be explained - somewhat similar to a cat&#39;s eyes when you shine a flashlight on them.

It had a small tail of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two men standing at the gate of a house saw it too.  They talked about it.  I stopped and watched it crossing slowly the sky coming towards us. IT wasn&#39;t getting bigger just a bit brighter. I dismissed the thought of any UFO activity.  I was tired and just wanted to walk home.  But as the light faded i realised it was an object.  At first it was just a dark spot.  But as it came closer i could figure out that it had a shape.  It looked like a spinning diamond.  It had a vertical spin.  When it almost reached the point above my head it made a slight left turn and moved in the direction of the inner city of Berlin. There where no lights that came from the object itself.  I could make out the shape of it ! only from the twilight at the horizon.  I could see it for about 4 minutes before it came out of sight.<n>

One at a time in a space of 2 hours or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student of history attending the University of Iceland.  I’d like to note that I’ve never seen anything like this before.  I do believe it is possible that aliens may have visited us and that UFOs might be alien spacecraft.  The things I witnessed yesterday night left a lasting impression on me and I’m actually filing this report because I just need to get this sighting of my chest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night me and my girlfriend had just finished watching a movie. The time was roughly 2:45 am.  I walk out onto my deck and light cigarette. As I am smoking the cigarette I notice a light descending across the sky.  My first thought is; “Oh cool, a shooting star”. But the object moved far too slow for any shooting stars that I’ve ever seen and it’s descent was taking much longer then any shooting star I’ve observed.  As I’ve been looking at it for maybe 5 seconds it suddenly starts to ascend in a curve and then suddenly it makes a U-turn in the sky and bolts at high velocity in the opposite direction it was originally travelling.  By the time this happens I’ve called my girlfriend to come look.  Then the object vanishes but reappears a short distance away from it’s vanishing position about 2 seconds later, takes off at high speed again and then vanishes again. By this time my girlfriend is outside with me but missed seeing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30-40 minutes later I went back outside both to see if I could see some more of these things and to have a cigarette. After gazing at the sky for 2 minutes or so I noticed another light. This light moved in a straight line but seemed to be changing speeds as it did. I observed 5 lights like these in a 15-20 minute timeframe and they all moved in the same line but I never saw more then one at a time. I lost sight of the lights as they moved over my apartment building. They must have been very high up. I called my girlfriend to see these and she saw two of them and agreed with me that there was something strange about those lights. As it was really cold outside I went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was about to go to sleep at about 4:40 am or so I went outside again to have a cigarette before bed. It was beginning to light up a bit outside but still semi-dark. I then observed about 5-6 lights appear one at a time far away on the horizon. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and then they would bolt away at high speed and vanish. One of the lights actually took a whirl in the air before bolting away. Then I went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that the sky that night was mostly cloud free and it was very starbright. Also I would like to note that due to a volcano that is erupting about 200-300 kilometers away from here there was very little airtraffic due to the ash, although none of the ash has reached Reykjavik yet a lot of European flights to Iceland have been cancelled in the last few days. Maybe that UFO was observing the volcano and used the chance as there were no other aircraft around, but that’s just speculations.<n>

Then one slowed down and went in a different direction and the other three that were visable slowed down and moved apart slightly.  They changed directions towards the one that left and then they all came back together in an easterly direction and then there appeared to be six of them flying very close together, almost touching.  They continued going north-east until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  The strange thing was that they changed speed, direction and seemed to hover at times. there was no noise, they were just lit like stars.<n>

But it was odd because it was mostly cloudy out that night so i just kept watching the object as i was driving.  It kept coming closer to the ground so i thought maybe a meteor had came into the atmosphere because it was glowing a yellow-orange color and you could see a trail of light behind it as well.  Then, for a moment i passed some near by trees and houses so i lost sight of it for a couple of seconds.  After i regained sight of it however it was no longer a bright light in the sky. i could only see the side at this point and it looked like some small aircraft maybe the height of a helicopter.  But i knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter after it passed the road down maybe half a mile away from where i was still driving.  I could see the back of it after it crossed and at that point i saw the object had no wings and i could hear nothing coming from the object.  And these little dim lights completely went around the circumference of it and on the back, there were two bright lights in the shape of a square that little up for only a brief second.  I&#39;ve never been one to believe 100% in things like this but after what i saw that night, there&#39;s no doubt that at least there is mysterious aircraft that are nothing like what we fly in today.<n>

Both my friend and i had seen a very large triangular shape fly from one part of the sky to the next heading i believe northwest in a matter of 6 seconds at speeds ive never seen before . it was pretty low and very large as well as completely silent . If you held a quarter in your finger tips and put your arm out that is how big the object was as seen by us . It was blocking out some of the stars as it flew through the sky . It was so close that we were able to perfectly see the triangular shape with three large round lights as bright as the stars in the sky and about the same size . The lights were perfectly spaced apart from eachother at each point of the triangle . I could make out a faint shape of the craft and it was a differant shade of dark than the sky . About 5 minutes later after the sighting there was a jet flying roughly in the same direction almost as if tracking or monitoring the object . The jet i could hear clear as day and it was up much higher than this object . I called the local airport here and i was told that the tower shuts down at 10 pm and that there shouldnt have been any flights or activity at that time wich leads me to believe it was a military jet . But that isnt all that had happend , about 10 minutes prior to this UFO we had seen two differant stars that had been moving at high rates of speed and every few seconds they would pulse and then nothing . They would disapear and then show up pulsing at another place in the sky in a matter of seconds . We witnessed this for about 5 minutes and then they were gone and nothing else happend till the triangular craft .<n>

PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief &#34;screech&#34; sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. The total event lasted around 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have my master’s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  I am also involved in astronomy.  I am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. Though it is possible that I was seeing a &#34;secret aircraft,&#34;  I am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. The measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  It all happened very fast and was short in duration, m! aking it difficult to be definite on measurements.  All in all, I saw a craft without doubt and I am perplexed by what I have seen.<n>

They were about the same brightness as the brightest stars in the sky. They looked like satellites but were moving much faster, say 10x faster. The two lights moved in a perfectly straight line across the sky, but were paired up with each other, and swapped relative positions with each other several times, one behind the other, then rotating to side by side, then back to front-and back, a few different times, randomly. The lights were a constant brightness, no blinking or wavering, they did not leave a trail. There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident was over in perhaps 3 seconds. I stood up in the spa and pointed out the lights to my son but he didn&#39;t stand up and look in time to see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We go in the spa every night and look at the stars. We see lots of planes at various altitudes, lots of satellites, and sometimes shooting stars. I&#39;ve never seen anything which was comparable to these two lights. The strangest parts were their relative position movements, and the overall speed that they moved across the sky.<n>

I watched the object wobble high in the sky for approximately one minute until it suddenly vanished as my sight line was obstructed by a tree.  I quickly contemplated what the object could be; a plane, blimp, kite.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It was circular, black in color, and was as high or higher then the elevation of a plane.  I was able to gauge the depth of the object by comparing it to birds flying in the sky.  The size of the craft had to be enormous, as it was as big as a full moon would be high in the sky.  I may never know what this craft was, but I can assure you that it was like nothing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am sure it is the sight.  I will attach the photos.  I brought back some of the battery parts and light bars to the house.  I found this spot about 2 years ago but no one I spoke to was interested.  If you are I will be happy to help you with location and everything.  I believe it was Stancil that drew the picture I will include first.  The 2nd one is a photo of the rocks closer up.  If you are in the area you will see it as Stancil did.  Photos 2,3 and 4 are of the battery parts left laying there over the years.  The 5th one is the light bars that that are talked about by Stancil and everyone else at the site.  Be more than happy to go get more pictures if you are interested.  The sight is only a few miles from Kingman, AZ.  If there is anything else you want from me please let me know.  I think it is important for people that are interested to know that this really did take place.  Later, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM #1))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not of alien origin.  It is what was left after the military left.  They did not clean up well.  The picture that Stancil drew and the area North of Kingman.  The batteries and light bars that have been there for at least 50 years to decompose and rust as they have.  I KNOW what it is and I guess that is all that is important.  I&#39;m not looking for any recognition or anything.  I only thought someone would like to know.

4/15/10 19:30|Sydney (Australia)||Light|3 seconds|2 star-like lights moving in tandem across the night sky|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75093.html|130|ndxe201004| I have, what may be, the fiRst reported mutilated fish not done by any known predator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about the spring morning of April 15, 2010, I was taking a walk in my yard around my 3.5 acre lake.  About 20 feet from the shoreline I found a decomposing fish.  I didn&#39;t really give it any thought and I certainly did not want my dogs to find it, start eating it and get sick so I picked it up and tossed it into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days passed.  Again I took an early morning stroll around the lake checking on the spawn.  Odd as it may be, I came upon another fish (a largemouth bass) in much the same condition as the one I found earlier that week and only a few feet away from the first.  Having NEVER seen such an incident in the 42 years since building that lake, I was compelled to take a better look at this fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer inspection I saw that there were several parts of the fish missing.  The area behind the anal fin was gone and looking closer it appeared the entrails were also missing.  Some bones could be seen in that open area but it seemed the spine was no longer there.  There was also a hole to the right of the spiny dorsal fin that also allowed viewing the area that was missing behind the anal fin since it was now &#34;gutless.&#34;  The bony plate around both eyes which meets the operculum was gone as well as both eyes were cleanly missing.  The tissue that separates the pelvic fins and running to the underside of the mouth was there, However, the tissue from the pelvic fins up to the pectoral fins was gone allowing a straight-through view to the other side of the fish as well as a view through to the hole above the anal fin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of this seemed to be the work of a predator - of any kind.  I&#39;ve seen the work of predators and this certainly was not.  Since 1972, when the lakes were built, I have seen only two fish &#34;belly up&#34; in this lake; two largemouth bass.  One had tried to eat the other.  Being both the same size, both fish perished, one stuck firmly in the mouth of the other.  But I have never seen any fish twenty feet off shore, especially not in this condition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what struck me as being truly odd was the hole next to the spiny dorsal fin.  It was perfectly round.  A 5/8&#34; (15.95mm) perfectly round hole!  Fascinating!  No predator can make that hole.  Not with that kind of precision.  I researched the possibilities everywhere.  Even my local Pennsylvania Fish Commission and Game Commission could not attest to any predator being capable of making such a perfectly round hole like this one.  But somehow, somewhere I recalled some literature that mentioned a hole of this size (also perfectly round) being common on many cattle and other animal mutilations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I contacted Linda Moulton Howe, told her my story and she was more than taken in with this tale.  She never heard of a fish mutilation in thirty years of research.  This was news to her and she was interested in taking this further.  I sent her the pictures I had taken from various angles which peaked her interest further.  What she needed to know was there any evidence of thermal damage around the edge of the hole, such as would be made by a laser or something that would produce a high degree of heat.  I was now on a quest to find someone (with credentials) who would be willing to perform such tests and provide an affidavit with the results.  I tried dozens upon dozens of colleges, universities, fisheries and independent laboratories to take my case of the mutilated fish.  Not a single person was willing to join me in the search for this critical evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, Mr. Davenport, there you have it.  This can possibly be the first case of a mutilated fish in the realm of &#34;high strangeness&#34; as Linda would say.  Then I learned you obtained a degree in fish biology and genetics.  Why hadn&#39;t I known that before?  I&#39;ve followed your career for many years. I&#39;ve listened to you on Coast for years, first with Art, now with George.  I wrestled with the thought of asking you for your help in this matter for months.  Everyone else turned me down for two reasons I&#39;ve learned; 1) When they learned it might have something (or anything) to do with an extraterrestrial presence and 2) Because their salaries came from the universities, laboratories or wherever, they did not want their name on an affidavit stating the results they would find fearing a loss of their job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I ask the same of you.  Would you be willing to become involved in this matter or even discuss it with me?  As much as I hate to admit failure, I may have to tell Linda I&#39;ve come to the end of the road, so to speak.  The long road I have traveled no longer has a fork, instead a large red stop sign may be staring back at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read this, I greatly appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind Regards,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> ((deleted)) Road Conneautville, PA 16406-2031 814-((deleted)) Home 814-((deleted)) Cell Amateur Radio call sign ((deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos provided by the witness, and are unable to certify that the wound to the fish&#39;s body is necessarily unusual.

I laughed and said look bro it looks like a UFO, he was standing all the way outside and said what the heck I stepped completely out and it deffinetly was not a reflection but a bright yellowish/white light going back and forth behind some trees.  We thought it maybe was a plane but planes dont move like that we walked out to the middle of the street to get a better look and it quickly vanished.  I dont know what the heck it could have been but it scared the crap out of both of us and if anyone knows maybe what it was and could fill us in that would be cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was talking to my mother on my cell phone around midnight on 15 April 2010.  I was standing outside in the middle of the infield next to the Radar site.  I saw a dark triangular craft floating about 60-80 yards away and about 100 feet above the ground.  It was dark and had even darker round type windows, it floated silently and hovered around in an area about 200 feet.  I thought at the time that it was a possible unmanned aerial vehicle since the military lives just the other side of the fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, since I was in the Air Force and worked around UAV&#39;s for 8 years and the fact that they would not be operating UAV&#39;s on or around an active civillian runway, I can only speculate as to what it was.<n>

Many scientists, astronomers, government officials and government agencies have labeled it as a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t believe it was as I believe that if something were to be seen by many as evidence, many still would not believe as the expression goes, even if it were to bite them on their rear ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a video taken from the police dashboard of the sighting.  The strange thing that I wanted to report was that during the viewing of the dash board video there is silence as it was a quiet street that the officer was parked.  However, if you turn your theater home speakers up and turn up the bass something strange happens.  You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the night turns to day you see the green &#34;round&#34; fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Final note is that as the object darts of or at the end of the footage you will hear the police radio pick up something.    I believe it will be in the best interest of sound technicians to analyze this film footage.<n>

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green &#34;fireball&#34; fell past them.  The only other thing I noticed as I observed it was my best guess at its distance from me, as stated above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it fell beyond where I could see, I thought about it and decided it was interesting, but probably nothing.  But of course, curiosity got the better of me.  I have heard and read about &#34;flares&#34; or &#34;fireballs&#34; before, so I decided to post my sighting on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This observation occurred on April 14, 2010, around 10:05 pm (CST), from the campus of Graceland University in Lamoni, IA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.

About 100 feet from the entrance we noticed what seemed to be a very large craft right above our heads.  We could see 4 lights defining the shape of a misshapen square and it appeared to be a single craft since the stars behind it could not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the UFO seemed quite close to us and moved fairly slowly.  But as it moved away it began to change shape, move faster and rise higher into the sky.  As the craft moved away from us in a Northern direction, the lights rotated into a triangle form with the point facing forward.  The UFO also began to speed up.  It was moving faster than any other aircraft we have ever witnessed before.  It had also seemed to reach an elevation comparable to an airplane as it headed farther North.  But unlike an airplane the craft never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the UFO until our eyes couldn’t track it any longer.

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I noticed the sky started to get brighter and bluer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was thinking &#34;huh, that&#39;s weird,&#34; a blue ball of light soared over the clouds low over my backyard, from east to west.  I didn&#39;t know it was a ball of light until it went over a part of the sky where the clouds broke up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after, there was lightning.  I tried to think it was just part of the lightning, but the object in question didn&#39;t flash, just glowing and passed over swiftly.  It didn&#39;t make any noise.  It had an aura about it, and emanated light all around it, but you could tell the shape was spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just sat there with my jaw dropped.  I kept trying to rationalize what it was.  I entertained the thought it was a meteor about to hit the earth, and sat there waiting for the ground to shake.  Nothing happened, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside for 15-20 minutes waiting for something to happen as if to explain it.  I have no idea what it was that I saw.  I only know that it was an unidentified flying object.<n>

We were in my Dads inflatable dinghy near Antons Gowt, Boston, on the river Witham.  I had been having trouble with the outboard motor all day so decided to moor the dinghy up so I could sort the problem out once and for all.  We moored up at 17:02 according to my mobile.  Less than ten minutes later I sorted the outboard out and pulled the anchor out of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was doing this I noticed a clump of what I thought were balloons come out from behind some trees at the side of the river just over a mile from where we were.  I soon noticed however that these spheres I was seeing were too big to be balloons and were travelling quite quickly across the sky even though there was barely any wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spheres were perfectly sperical but bobbed up and down a little as they crossed over the river which made it hard for me to distinguish whether there were four or five of them.  They also appeared to be metallic and reflected lots of light.  It took them perhaps 10 seconds to cover a quarter of a mile.  I lost sight of them once they dissappeared behind the river bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

About 100 feet from the Fitch Ave. entrance we noticed what seemed to be a very large craft right above our heads.  We could see 4 white lights defining the shape of a misshapen square and it appeared to be a single craft since the stars behind it could not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the UFO seemed quite close to us and moved fairly slowly.  But as it moved away it began to change shape, move faster and rise higher into the sky.  As the craft moved away from us in a Northern direction, the lights rotated into a triangle form with the point facing forward.  The UFO also began to speed up.  It was moving faster than any other aircraft we have ever witnessed before.  It had also seemed to reach an elevation comparable to an airplane as it headed farther North.  But unlike an airplane the craft never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the UFO until our eyes couldn’t track it any longer.  We kept a watchful eye to the sky for a bit longer but none of us saw any other unexplained occurrences.  My friends and I have never observed anything like this before.  We are all in agreement that this UFO was not any man made craft that we know of.<n>

There is no base around Wenatchee so we rarely see military aircraft.  When I looked out the window I saw a the wavy distortion that you would expect from something extremely hot. Like a hot road distorting the scenery on the horizon.  But I saw no lights or planes in the darkness. I laid back down and stared up at the stars through my skylight, which is apprx. 8&#39; x 8&#39; in size. Around 10 min. later, I saw a classic black triangle floating silently above my house.  Perfectly framed in my skylight as if planned. I could see it blacking out the stars behind it more than I could actually see the craft, but it was a definite triangle.  Moving quite slowly. Nobody I have asked, around town, saw it. My girlfriend woke up to the jet sounds but nobody else seems to have heard it.  Which I find hard to believe because it was insanely loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a little spot plane circling the area of my house for about 30 min before the sighting and an hour after, which is very strange.  I never see or hear planes circling that late. And I live by a small airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s about it, really.  I have seen several ufos over the years but never the infamous triangle!  I feel like part of an exclusive club now.  It was creepy though.<n>

Our apartment consists of two towers and the roof deck conneects them.  We are exactly one block away from the Hudson River so we are very close, and the sky was completely clear of clouds.  There were only other planes and a few stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat down lit our cigarette when a singular light similar to a plane appeared and flashed across a specifc section of the sky in a downwards arc at an incredible speed of the likes I&#39;ve never seen before.  Judging by the speed and trajectory this could not have been anything like a shoot star.  Also, because of the fact the light just went on then all of a sudden went off-not out of sight although we couldn&#39;t see it anymore-I do not think it was anything man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been on a UFO site before nor have I have had a sighting.

They were varying their speed and stopping to hover at times. The first sphere sped up and moved ahead of the second sphere.  The first sphere then stopped and hovered while the second sphere increased its speed and caught up. Once the second sphere caught up to the first it stopped and hovered.  Then the first sphere shot nearly vertical at an incredible speed until it disappeared into space roughly 8 seconds later.  At that time the second sphere followed with same trajectory and disappeared into space.<n>

We were facing South from our house when I saw what I initially thought was fireworks due to the object emitting white/red/green/blue lights.  It came up like fireworks would but then it hovered in midair.  The perceived distance and speed of the object told me that in order for it to streak across the sky like it did, it had to have been traveling at a VERY fast rate of speed.  I didn&#39;t believe it was a commercial or military aircraft because how fast it was moving and more importantly after it traveled west horizontally, it made a rapid direction change east, too difficult a maneuver for any known aircraft.  We also captured a short video of the object that is very blurry due to it being an old digital camera and not a cam corder<n>

I turned down my radio and there was no noise from the plane.  It looked like a big military cargo plane, it couldn&#39;t have been any higher in the air than the top of a telephone pole.  I could read the stickers on it it was so low.  All I remember of the stickers is that there was an American flag and numbers and letters, no words.  The plane was not tipping in any direction.  It was completely still.  Just sitting in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of being right beside it, traffic started coming from the other direction so I had to move.

I called out for my teen son and he witnessed it also.  We stood in awe as we watched this object slowly move across the sky.

It didnt make any sound  and  it flew right above  the houses of my neighborhood  and since i never knew  what to think of it  i am writing to have your opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to excuse the poor quality of this  38 seconds video since i had all the difficulty in the world to make a decent focus on this object in the distance.  I had  just recently purchased my camera , a power shot a 1000 from Canon at the time i videotaped this.  Not knowing videofilms cant be turned vertically.In the video the first 7 to 10 seconds many sounds you will be hearing are from trucks and cars traffic in the street aside from the crows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the years many times a week i have heard  helicopters fly over my house in that neighborhood ( i have moved since last year) and unless I am making a mistake (which i very well could be) i think i can recognized the sound of an helicopter. It is very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, i heard on national radio that Quebec Province had no drones aloud to fly over populations.  It was said that only Ontario had those in activity for special crime search or ecological disasters research.

I looked up from my driveway to see what I first thought was a night bird, but as my eyes followed it, I could see it was a horizontal triangle with three lights.  Because the night sky was filled with stars, I could see the shape of the object as it blocked the stars’ light.  The triangle appeared to be about 200 feet up, moving easterly in an almost-straight line, wobbling slightly, not always quite level.  It moved at the pace of a soaring bird, coasting through the air.  It seemed to be about five feet wide.  Three round lights were evenly spaced in its corners, the same color as the stars, pale bluish-white, with indistinct edges.  The triangle itself appeared to be grayish, though that may be only because it was against the dark sky.  I noticed in particular that it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Bright white objects not moving in symetrical patterns but seemed to be taking cues from the movement of one another.  Orange orbs and much smaller bright white objects were on horizon simultaneously but having no overt interaction.  Never seen anything like this in my life. Inexplicable.<n>

It would raise altitudes and go from side to side at such great speeds our planes wouldn&#39;t stay intact.

This is just a tiny fraction of what I ha|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74994.html|182|ndxe201004| Triangular object with about 3 lights that changed from bright white to all red when it slowed down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occurred on 04-11-2010 in Terre Haute, IN.  It lasted for at least a half an hour between 9:45-10:30 pm EST.  My husband and I were on our way to return a movie rental and from there, to the gas station.  A few minutes earlier, I had tried to go to the gas station that was closest to home, but the lines were backed up and the attendant said the systems were down.  So, I came home and told my husband what was going on and that I&#39;d try later.  He said he wanted to make sure the tank was filled, so he decided to come along and after returning the movie, we would just go to the gas station that&#39;s a few miles down the street.  As we were leaving the parking lot of the video store, (driving west) I noticed a very bright white light, coming from the east just over the trees well north of us.  At first, I thought it was a low-flying plane but it seemed to be moving faster than a plane and it had no colored lights just very bright white.  I told my husba! nd, who was driving at the time, what I was seeing and he tried to get a look, but we were on a fairly busy street and the object was coming in and out of view from behind trees. He didn&#39;t want to cause an accident so, I just kept watching the object, waiting for it to reach an open area.  While I was watching it, the object went from a fast-moving white light to nearly a stop and all the bright white lights turned bright red.  It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly in the north sky.  As I was telling my husband what had just happened, that I wasn&#39;t crazy, and I knew what I had seen...we turned south.  It was then behind us and out of view.  While driving maybe 3 city blocks south, I noticed the red lights again, this time, in an open area in the distant southwestern sky.  It must&#39;ve moved really fast toward the south (without us noticing) in order for it to be that far ahead of us that soon.   Finally, my husband saw it too.  When we reached the gas station (the ! one that&#39;s a few miles from home) I went inside to pre-pay and! the att endant said the system had just went down.  My husband stayed outside watching the object that appeared to be hovering or moving really slow still to the south of us.  We pulled out from the gas station (driving east) and the object appeared to be moving again slowly toward the northeast.   It looked like it was going to pass directly overhead and we were in an area where we could pull off the road into a vacant lot.  My husband got out of the car, looked up, and watched it slowly pass over us.   He described it as a triangular object with distinct bright red lights at the corners and 1 white light, that made only a slight humming sound.  I couldn&#39;t hear anything from inside the car.  I would think any plane flying that low and that slow would be much louder than a slight hum, but I could be wrong.  I had my cell phone on me but didn&#39;t think to take a picture because, at that time, we were just trying to figure out what it was.  It seemed to be heading northeast toward the s! ame area where I had initially seen it.  We pulled out of the lot and headed north again to the gas station nearest home to see if their systems were up yet.  The object remained on the west side of us moving north toward the east.  We watched it the entire time we were driving, and this time, I tried to take a picture of it with my cell phone.  The street lights and the treetops that were near the object were visible on my screen but, the red lights were not showing for me to get a picture.  It was like my camera couldn&#39;t pick it up.  We pulled up to the gas station (nearest our home) and I went inside to ask if the system was working yet.  The attendant told me it was working fine now... so, I pre-paid.  I went outside to pump the gas and the pump said OUT OF SERVICE.  The attendant came over the intercom and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;ll be a few minutes the system just went down again.&#34;  The object continued on it&#39;s way to the northeast until it was out of view. It was then, t! hat conveniently, the system came back up and I was finally ab! le to fi ll up my tank.  I never saw it return to the bright white lights that I had initially seen, it remained red until it disappeared from view.  I don&#39;t know how to explain the systems going down whenever that thing was in the vicinity, or how I couldn&#39;t pick up the lights on my camera.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed this or reported it.  It happened right over town and there were many people out and about.  Maybe it was just a plane and the systems failing was all just a coincidence...I don&#39;t know.  All I do know, is it was a &#34;weird&#34; and rather frustrating experience for us.  I would also like to know if anyone else experienced this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was watching this &#34;star object&#34; (which was glowing brighter then any star I could see in the clear night sky)  it appeared to float slightly up and down in the sky.  I continued to watch as it dimmed in color(bright orange).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I yelled at the top of my lungs for my wife to come and look at this object.  She came running with her digital camera in hand and as I pointed it out she took a single picture of &#34;it&#34;.   We were both standing there in awe as it seemed to bounce around the sky with no particular flight pattern, lighting up very brightly and dimming to almost no light what so ever(there were many lights on the craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we couldn&#39;t even speak to one another, I think it was just the shock factor of what we had witnessed.  We had watched for approximately 13-15 minutes. It was about 5-10 miles away from were I was located.  I initially thought that the photo we had taken didn&#39;t come out very well, then my wife used the 8x zoom feature on the camera and....well I was surprised to see a very clear picture of &#34;it&#34;.<n>

I watched it for a few minutes and then called my roommate out to the balcony to watch with me because the blinking red light was not moving as if it were the lights on a plane.  There was a constant green light that was always directly in front of the blinking red light.  The blinking red light moved to the left as if it were flying in that direction and then as if turning, started moving right.  As it turned, the red light turned bright white.  After the turn, it began flying to the right again and the light again became a red flashing light.  This same pattern occurred for about 5 minutes until it seemed as though the object shot something off of it to the left, which was a white light (kind of like a small white spec or star).  After this occurred, the object went slowly straight up in the sky.  It then started to slowly fly in our direction and ended up ! flying slowly directly overtop of us.  It was then that we noticed the triangle shape....the constant green light was to the left, the blinking red light was to the right, and a bright, glowing white light was above the two other lights.  It flew directly above our heads, but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up into the night sky because it was a clear star filled night.

The other thing that stood out in my mind is that it was dark, as if flying covertly. The object was traveling fast and only about 600 to 900&#39; altitude. It was difficult for me to gage the size of it. The object made no noise at all that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving fast, with no sound, and were at an altitude of maybe 500-600 feet.   As there was no sound, I did not see them until they were almost directly overhead.  As I watched, the sides of the V crossed over each other and then “swirled” together.  At that point, they separated out again and they either increased speed and disappeared in the distance or just blinked out.

It was a very large Ball of Fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.

Again it was a large Giant Ball of Fire in the sky approximately a mile away from us and I would say about 500 metres up into the sky.  It was so clear that you could see it was fire and it was hovering slowly from right to left of our view.  It was far too slow to be a plane and had no noise to it.  My wife could not believe what she was seeing and I told her it was what I saw before.  We watched it for maybe 30 seconds and the Orb changed route and shot extremely quick straight up into the sky and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am both amazed and confused to what I have seen and still not quite sure how to explain it.<n>

They were flying low and slow like the slow flying bomber planes. The bright lights from the truck stop on the north side of the road were reflecting on the bottom of the 2 crafts enabling me to see the exact shape of them. They each had a light on each of the three points of the triangle.  One light was red, one was blue and the third looked white or off white. One was following the other and they were flying west along Interstate 80.

It is my belief that what was seen was a helicopter.  My reasoning for this is based on the fact that many RI National Guard Blackhawk helicopters were in the air at that time because it was a disaster area and FIMA was involved as well as other state and federal agencies. The choppers were probably doing security flights as there was some looting going on in the disaster areas.  I am not a debunker. I have filed two sightings with you in the past few years and I believe in what MUFON is attempting to do.  I read a lot of the monthly reports with great anticipation.  I guess I&#39;m just offering one mans educated guess at what might have been seen and mis-identified by someone not familiar with the UFO phenominon or other aircraft that may look like a UFO.  I am no expert myself but thought this viewpoint may be of some help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have estimated the time of the event.

The craft resembled a B-2, but it emitted absolutely no sound, not even the low sound of a landing stealth airplane or jet. The aircraft was not flying parallel to the earth, but at a 45 degree angle or steeper, and its trajectory was parallel to the earth. The sighting occurred between the Sea World exit and the I-8 exit on I-5 at 1730 PST or GMT-8. I turned in the passenger seat to see if I could catch a glimpse of it through the back window of the car. I could see the aircraft silhouetted against the sky for several seconds before the aircraft vanished in an instant. There were other commercial aircraft in the vicinity due to the proximity to the SD international airport, but the chevron was definitely not commercial. There are also several military installations in the area, but these are home to only C-130, F-18, CH-46, and CH-53E squadrons.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was high visibility--light cirrus clouds near the horizon, low-lying but nothing but blue sky above 10,000 feet.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a star.  This took place around lunch-time, between 11:30 and 12:30 roundabouts.  The star was very bright and I thought it was strange because I couldn’t see any other stars.  Then it started to move, very, very slowly west to northeast over the course of the next 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried not to take my eyes off of it because it was small and clearly above 30,000 feet as I could see some 747s making contrails (short trails due to such clear conditions) below and around the “star”.  It was not using any of the sky-lanes that planes normally use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally, maybe three minutes in, and then at the five or six-minute mark, it would stop totally for 30 seconds.  It also seemed to have a perfect circlular aura that almost pulsed outwards, only faintly discernible from the object and the blue sky around it.  I was wearing a good pair of sunglasses with polarization so the sky was very blue and the star quite bright against it.  When I took the glasses off the star was still visible but difficult to track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bizarre thing is that my eyes went right to it, and there was 360 degrees of clear blue sky.  If I hadn’t immediately seen it or known it was there, I could have missed it.  Would have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright.  Again, I thought it was a star.  That high up, that shape, that type of light.  The weather was perfect – spring time and about 72 degrees.  I wanted to shout to the neighbors to ask “what is that”, but for those 7 minutes the neighborhood was a ghost town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t take a picture because my phone was inside the house and I knew if I took my eyes off of it I might lose it.  Sure enough, just as it passed directly overhead I glanced away for a second, maybe two, and then it was gone.  Weirdest thing I’ve ever seen.  I work outside and I know the air traffic here.  This was highly unusual.<n>

We passed a mall in our state called “The Warwick Mall” and we a giant flashing light in the sky. I slowed down so we could keep looking because I knew it didn’t look like a plane. It got closer to us, enough to see the shape was like a tall saucer, and there were two lights in the front like headlights. Then I saw smaller lights around the rim. My friend I were starring at it in disbelief for about 10 minutes. Ironically the Warwick Mall was just flooded by a bunch of rainy weather that just happened in RI so the whole thing is damaged and closed down. I feel like “they” or “it” was looking down at that. They were hovering right over it and then passed over me on the highway and we lost sight. I almost didn’t believe it at first, but I’m sure of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dry Lake is about half way between Area 51 and Caliente, NV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred approximately 25 miles after going through Alamo in a totally uninhabited stretch of the Great Basin Highway.  Up in the sky there were thousands of lights and it looked like someone was pouring stars from heaven and there were also objects shooting beams at each other but all were too high in the sky to make out the shapes.  In the mountains there were lights and since we traveled the road often at night we know no one lives in these mountains and there has never been any lights there before.  I got out of the car over my wife&#39;s objections and tried to film this with her pocket camera but suddenly a white globe that was hovering over the mountain started spinning and turned orange and shot directly toward me at which time I took my wife&#39;s advice and got back in the car and g! ot out of there.<n>

So, this is my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were walking our dogs, my buddy decided to drop his dogs off and then go back to my house. As I was waiting outside I wanted to look for the big dipper because it was pretty clear outside.  Then directly overhead I noticed what I thought was a flock of geese in a V pattern.  To my amazement the Geese were not Geese, I was looking at a brilliant V shape set of lights.  I watched them directly and clearly right above me, moving very slow and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not believe what I was looking at.  It was what I’ve come to know as a UFO.  As soon as I could I called for my friend, come here and look!  As he dashed outside I was pointing straight up at the craft.  He then saw it himself.  We watched, without blinking for about 25-30sec. until the craft traveled out of eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was seven lights in a triangular formation traveling east at a very slow pace. As it moved away I caught a glimpse of what looked to be more than the V pattern itself, it was a dark circular shape around the lights.  It was HUGE!  At arms length the object was at least 3 inches wide.  It looked, to my perspective that it was at an altitude of one – two miles.  I could not understand what I was looking at, but I knew it was there (right above us).  Nothing will ever change my mind about what I saw, knowing that it will never be erased from my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for this website.

I looked up for a second and saw a strange formation of white, red, and green lights that moved in an odd motion without blinking in the night sky. I first believed it to be a helicopter, but it did not sound like one. The craft moved very slowly, and then started hovering at the same altitude. The craft also made a low, humming noise similar to a blimp.  The problem was that the craft was much smaller than a blimp.  There was only one of these strange crafts.  Scared, I called out my two sons who inferred the craft to be a circular shape because of the light pattern.  The three of us examined the craft for approximately 25 seconds when the craft disappeared in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All of a sudden one person exclaimed that they  saw what looked like a soft white single color ribbon, flying silently across the sky, it was overhead, low on the eastern horizon, flying south to north and within a few seconds quickly faded as it moved across the sky.  The shape never changed, and there were no distinguishable individual lights visible.  Shortly after that we caught glimpse of another formation exactly like the first sighting flying south to north overhead, silently approximately 80 degrees off the horizon.  It was somewhat translucent, solid faint light, with the leading edge the primary visible structure.  It was a perfectly formed semi-circular object, perhaps boomerang shaped -  that was only visible for a few! brief seconds before fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We caught a third shape of the same formation shortly after the second.

My spouse is a software analyst, and I am a homemaker. We had just arrived that afternoon with plans to stay for the weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were admiring all the stars that appeared in the sky that night, when suddenly to our left a bright red light caught our attention. The light was so large we were asking each other &#34;What is that!?&#34; for we both knew there was no power lines, storm towers, or any form of electricity of that kind for at least 40 miles, and the light was coming from a distance of about 10 miles. The light blinked twice holding the large red illumination for about 3 full seconds each. My spouse said,&#34; It cant be an airplane&#34;. I replied, &#34;I know, look how huge it is&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light then blinked fast about 3 times before it went out. To the right and left of the bright red light were two bright white lights (one on each side, about as bright as the brightest stars). The lights seemed to be about 10 feet apart; which may have seemed close, but they were such a great distance away, the distance could have been greater. I actually thought they were stars until I noticed them starting to blink rapidly right after the red light went out. The two lights were blinking alternately and then simultaneously before they both began to move in simultaneous motion as if they were connected. (One could form a straight line between the lights to measure how precise the movement was). The lights, moving as if one object, proceeded to what is my left, in the sky, angled itself so that the lights still seem to be connected then the lights faded quickly as if it were just flying into the distant sky at an extremely fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Way high in the sky moving really fast.  First few lights were white followed by green lights with an occasional yellow light and finished with 2 green lights.  Too far apart to belong to one vehicle.  I estimate 5 mile plus or minus separation between lights and maybe they were at airliner altitude.  No falling arc, no sparking like a falling star.  Just lights in the sky moving very fast in a flat plane straight west.  I estimate that due to location in the sky, they would have actually flown over south Kansas City, MO.  Total viewing period was approx. 20 seconds and occurred over a 60 degree field of vision.  Both witnesses were left wondering exactly what we saw.

I was looking at the stars facing southwest, when something caught my eye. I quickly looked over and in 1-2 seconds I saw 4 lights moving at an incredible speed past the roof of my house. I quickly ran around to the side of the house to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 2-4 seconds I clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of this object was approximately (and I&#39;m guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can&#39;t stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars. I lost sight of the object in the haze traveling southward. The lights also appeared to be speeding up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the past year, I lived outside the city, and saw many shooting stars during the night and early morning. I am absolutely certain that these lights were not shooting stars. I hope this report is of use to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers -((name deleted))<n>

My friend was talking about band practice that we just had. there was heavy hail coming down and in mid sentence my friend said, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; and a bright light flew directly over his vehicle.  The distance was hard to determine.  It was traveling at a speed far faster than we were going.  I said &#34;Is it safe to fly in weather like this? &#34;.  My friend said &#34;No&#34; and before it came out of my friends mouth I realized there were no lights blinking on the bottom of it.  Then my friend mentioned there were no lights on the bottom of it.  I asked if that was legal and my friend said &#34;No&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned up to the righ to where it appeared to slow down and my friend asked if it stopped.  It then started to gain altitude.  I asked if it could be headed toward the airport.  Then I realized it was past the airport yet was still visible.  My friend said &#34;I think we&#39;re seeing a UFO&#34;.  Then I said &#34;Why can we still see it&#34;  Then my wife began to make fun of us because she didn&#39;t see it and I apologized to her and pointed it out because it remained visible for up to eight minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my friend said, &#34;I&#39;m a pilot and that was no jet and no prop plane and made no sound&#34;  Just before we got into Aberdeen we could still see it.

I was accompanied by two friends  (A women in the back seat and a man in the front seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just beginning to emerge from a hail storm when a very bright, white light came into view in the upper right of my windshield moving westerly at a very high rate of speed.  I knew immediately that it wasn’t any kind of conventional aircraft.  As I looked at the light I asked my friend, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;  Looking at it, my friend replied, &#34;I don’t know.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and have logged more than a thousand hours in small single engine aircraft. The first thing I noticed was the lack of navigation lights on it. The light was less than 1500 feet above ground because it was flying lower than the clouds that produced the hail storm.  I estimated these clouds to be around fifteen hundred feet and the light to be about a thousand feet above ground level.  It was also less than half a mile to our right.  So it was very close when I first saw it.  I figure it was moving at several hundred miles per hour.  Probably around mach 1. Yet there was no noise.  The ball of light seemed to be the same size as a small single engine aircraft.  But it was so bright it is really hard to say with accuracy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a slightly ascending  ten degree right turn then turned back to the left about fifteen degrees and leveled off at about fifteen hundred feet above ground level.  In less than a minute, it was already quite a distance away, perhaps as much as ten or fifteen miles.  It seemed to slow down as it approached Aberdeen.  Since we were traveling in the same direction, it remained in sight for maybe as long as ten minutes as we moved toward Aberdeen.  It in fact seemed to be hovering over Aberdeen at one point.  But it is hard to tell from that distance whether it was over Aberdeen and whether it was still moving slowly or hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we emerged from the hail storm the sky became partly cloudy and the stars came out.  Even being several miles away it was much brighter than the stars.  As we approached about five miles out of Aberdeen the light finally disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally competent witness.  We have invited him to obtain data regarding the height of the bottoms of the clouds, to establish the maximum possible altitude of the object.  PD))<n>

I called the FSS in Seattle and they told me the bottoms of those clouds where at thirty two hundred feet at that time.  So the object could have been that high as it moved under them.  However I did not see the clouds above the object. As bright as the object was if it had been close to the clouds it would have illuminated them.  So therefore I believe the object was less than three thousand feet above ground level.  Possibly as low as a thousand feet agl.<n>

I usually don&#39;t belive this kind of stuff but this is something I definately have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was barking uncontrollably so I went out on my deck to see if a bear or coyotes were in my yard.  While out on my deck I saw 2 lights directly on top of each other hovering in the western sky.  The two lights moved simultaneously so I&#39;m assuming they were on 1 object.  The lights were white then subtly changed to a blue hue and back to white.  The lights hovered, then moved right very fast and stopped then moved left and up very fast and stopped.  Each time the object stopped it hovered for a few minutes before moving again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I saw a red light flying very fast toward the object.  I thought the red light was an airplane but it moved significantly faster than your average passenger jet in the sky.  The red light flew directly at the object until the red light was hidden behind the object and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object kept moving fast and hovering and then in an instant it flew directly downward below the tree line and I couldn&#39;t see it.  My husband, who is a die hard skeptic of all things supernatural, saw it and admitted that it was unlike anything he had ever seen.  He couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing so he finally said. &#34;It must be the space shuttle&#34;.<n>

This time the lights appeared one after another in the west mid section of the skies. The colors of the light&#39;s were yellowish to orange and very bright. As they appeared in the sky they formed a triangle shape. When the fourth light appeared, it appeared beside the triangle form then they faded out in the same spot where they stood.  They did not move like the lights that we had seen before. This took no more than one minute. Then there were again, what looked like jets, very high in altitude. The lights were white and blinking and very small as if they were very far or high in the sky. Many people have seen and have described the! same sightings tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the same time a plane was coming from Ontario airport from the south, so I told my friend now that is a plane, because we seen &amp; heard it was a plane and it flew right over us and as it passed over us it was heading towards the strange orange light and we were quite for about two seconds and both of us said there going to hit and we seen the planes wings turn to the right and mo! ve out of it&#39;s way.  The orange light just stood on it same track going south and as it passed over us it had no sound and no wings or atleast we couldn&#39;t see any type of physical form.  It continued on it&#39;s path South and almost collided with another plane which was on the path from Ontario to L AX Airport and they missed and a minute later it was gone but the orange light had no sound and it looked as if it was doing minor zig-zagging, but it definitely was not a helicopter nor a airplane.

My wife and 21 year old son witnessed this very strange event while traveling Southbound on 5-S.  I am currently in Tucson,  AZ, as a retired U.S. Navy Chief (reason being that I retired June 1 of last year and due to our economy going down the tubes, I had no choice but to lose everything and begin traveling in search of my post naval career), but back on topic...my wife called me to report seeing 3 rather large (larger than anything Boeing has ever made) triangular shaped craft which was soon joined by a 4th craft.  Then the craft merged into one and began making some very interesting shapes in the sky (as you will see on the photos).  I immediately informed her to pull over as soon as she could and begin snapping pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately by the time I got that message across (our first 2 attempts at connecting via cell phone were no good as we would lose signal), but by the time I got the message across sunset had already set in however, my wife used a Palm Treo 650 cell phone with its camera settings on maximum resolution to take the pictures (in which I have about 25 total).  The Palm returned some very interesting photos to say the least.  Upon receiving the pics I immediately reported the sighting to MUFON and filed a report:  Case Number:  22723.  At the end of the event they all seemed to merge into 1 or 2, dipped down from their hover and shot skyward at a very high rate of speed (in which one of them pulsed red as he/she ascended)   Later that evening I noticed that 2 or 3 other people in Southern California reported UFO activity.   One report identically mirrored what my wife and son saw (which indicated 4 craft merging into 2).   We are DEFINITELY not alone in this universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> JC<n>

I heard an extremely loud noise, like loud wind, even though all of the windows were shut. I looked to see the time but the power had flashed off, but came on as the object left the area. I guessed that it was the storm that was nearing but as I looked out my window a saw a huge triangular shaped object, grayish white in color, close to the ground. It was moving quite slow. After a minute it sped up to speeds way beyond that of an airplane. It was headed west but at the last second it made a sharp turn to the left (south) to join two other crafts just like itself, but smaller. Each of them was shaped like triangles and had white lights on each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Balcony is top story looking over a fielf with tall trees twenty to thirty feet back or so. Girlfriend and i were sitting on balcony when bright white light was seen hovering high in the air over the trees. We smugged it off at first as a silent airplane in sleep mode with their lights off. It wasnt until it went over the field, completely silent by the way, that we saw red and green lights show up in a circular pattern and they kept on turning on and off. My skin stood up and i was shivering at what i saw. Im still zoned out about it bad. It was completely silent. in a very abnormal way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My son who is 12 witnessed all because he was up late in the living room watching TV and he was pretty freaked out because he witnessed all this for the first time ever, i being 33 have had little sightings that i wrote off as trick of the eye or just never reported but this time with the power going out and the flash of light with the sighting was all too much not to report thank you for being here for us to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The next night (tonight) I saw it again at a different location and a second one appeared about an hour after the first one was hovering.  The second one was parallel to the other and brighter and flickered red and blue like a firecracker.

One of the nights we decided to take a night time drive through the landscape and country side.  We parked up on a hills side and we were sat talking for sometime when we ended up nodding off to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke and as I opened my eyes I could see straight out of the drivers window.  Hovering just over the hill was a orange/yellow light.  I woke boyfriend and we looked at it for sometime.  The object didnt move or change in anyway. after looking at it for about 5 mins, we came to the conclusion that it must be a star, even if the colour was different slightly.  We continued talking then 5 mins later, my boyfriend realised it had disapeared.  None of the other stars around it had moved, we hadnt moved in the car, we were still parked up in the exact same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didnt hear any sounds that a helicopeter/plane would make.  It was the exact same colour as a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would be the second UFO sighting I have reported to this sight.

Not sure how high it is.  The shape of the object can be round or like a disk.  There were red, blue, green lights that was turning around.  Because of the heigth of the object, we think it can move pretty fast but can stay steady in the sky. We know it was flying around not like a plane. This is the first time I am seeing this in my life.  About 15 minutes after seeing the first object, I saw a big dark object flying as high as a small plane, maybe 5000 feet but flying fast near my house.  The object was big. Do not know how big. Than never seen it again. The first object was still in the same place at the time the big object fly by.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

If straight above my head in relation to the surface of the earth is 90 degrees, it was east-northeast at approx. 37-38 degrees in relation to the surface of the earth. It was basically just a small ball of light with no trail and a slight haze surrounding it. It was on a slow arc downward, and at approx. 26-27 degrees, it made a little more than a 90 degree turn at the same rate of speed and was then heading due north. We then lost sight due to trees and houses, but we were able to follow its course for approx. 2-3 seconds. I do wish there was more to add to make this more exciting, but of all the things I&#39;ve ever seen this was without a doubt the most peculiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were two small circles. Both were red. They looked a lot like what a ring lite on a camera would look like except with the middle part filled in so that there is only a small ring of black. I thought it could be a helicopter, but I&#39;m right near a lot of hospitals so i know what the helicopters look like, and it had no flashing lights on it that would signify it was such. It also made absolutely no sound. The &#34;craft&#34; was moving what appeared to be a straight path, however, the lights were not aligned straight, they were diagonal to each other and moving straight. There was also a helicopter in the vicinity passing nearby so I knew it couldn&#39;t be one. I have never seen any flight vehicle fly in that path either so it felt out of place. It flew at a steady pace. Id say the speed was equivalent ! to seeing a low flying Cessna it was fast, but not supersonic. I didn&#39;t see where it went as I was in a hurry and did not at the time realize what I had seen. The thing that stuck out was the lights, they were odd. I will email image files shortly<n>

I was just outside with my dog and happened to glance into the north-north east sky.  I seen what looked like a falling star, only it lasted longer than a normal falling star.  It gave me time to think &#34;Wow, when is this falling star going to go out?&#34;  Then ,the star turned into a larger, green light with red light around it.  Not a constructed light but like when it hit a certain part of the atmosphere, the object ignited or reacted. The object came in at an angle, like if you were on the clock and drew a straight line from the number two to the 8 approximately.  It went out (no lights) way lower in the sky but still above the ground.  I just looked it up on the internet and I guess it was a falling star or a meteor.  But it was very beautiful!<n>

My mother was upstairs when she summoned me to come up and look at something. I went upstairs and she pointed out at the window. I was startled at what I saw. It looked like a huge craft with 5 or 6 bright lights in an oval shape and made out of individual boxes. It was hovering or moving very slowly to the West near Washingtonia Dr and Cocos lane in San Marcos. I knew instantly that this was something very strange indeed!  I ran downstairs to grab my camera and ran outside but it was gone. My mother said it left just a few seconds after I went downstairs.  I have seen a variety of craft but never anything like this. I&#39;m a pilot and know what conventional aircraft look like and this was nothing in any way conventional! It look like something completely out of this world and I so wish I could have snapped a picture of it or maybe someone in San Marcos or north San Diego county saw i! t too hopefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

With my arm out stretched the light was just over my thumb’s width East of the star. The sky was clear and visibility was good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was very bright and looked almost like a laser pointer aimed directly at me.  It was motionless and held its position from the time I noticed it until about 15 seconds later when it just went out. This was followed by a just as strange “Puff” of green light. A second or so after the red light went out there was a halo like flicker of light that reminded me of a light seen pointing away from you in a fog. It was as if something was in the way of the source of the green light and me. All I saw was the light that washed around the object.<n>

Just east of Staeck&#39;s Farm Hdqtrs to the 11 o&#39;clock position saw a green light with a green aura around it, it was not travelling in a striaght line, rather was moving like a &#34;knickle ball&#34; towards us.   I pulled off the road, my girl friend then saw it and it was about the size of a marble, but a very intense green and it slowed down going north.   It passed behind some High Power Lines and it slowed down considerably, like it was watching us.   Another vehicle came from up behind us and passed us, then slowed down, I think saw what we saw, he had a handlight on the driver sideof his truck and turned it on tried to flash it on the greenlight in th sky.  As he did the green light sped up like it did not want to have the spot light on it (?).  Then it sped up and went north.  The duration of all this was 5-8 minutes.  I am an Iraq War veteran and I have seen various aircraft (trained in ! anti-aircraft artillery).  I thought I saw some odd things but this really topped everything I had seen.  My girlfriend works for an aviation company in the Little Rock, AR area and she knows aircraft too, (She is a book-keeper).    We mentioned what we saw to her Father, and he indicated that he had seen some odd aerial phenomenon in the Lonoke - Hickory Plains area.   This location was much further South than where we saw the green light that evening.

At around 4 pm, while lying down on the grass,  I noticed 2 oblong objects floating way up in the sky. They were very very far up in the sky, almost at the middle of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought those may be floaters or some other illusion. However when I asked my wife if she can see the objects, she also could see them. and the number of the objects increased soon to 8-10. They appeared like white tadpoles zigzagging their way in the sky. Actually they remained in a small zone of the sky for a few minutes. Their movement seemed somewhat like Brownian motion. At some instances it seemed as if those were aircrafts performing some maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty difficult to track all of them as they were very small, and the sun was very bright. Amazingly they disappeared suddenly within 5-6 minutes. We could not follow any particular pathway or trajectory in which they went. They simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if they were some military crafts or some other technological stuff. but their appearance and disappearance were very sudden. I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

I was standing facing south looking up at the stars on a cloudless night and I witnessed two flying saucers flying east to west in typical wingman formation. I was unable to tell how large they were because I had nothing to judge them against.  However, if I had to guess I’d say 75 feet in diameter and maybe 200 feet above the ground.  If I had to guess speed I’d say 75mph. I watched them until they disappeared into the western horizon.  The most unique thing about them was 1st they certainly silverfish metallic and very similar to the typical flying saucers portrayed in the 1950’s science fiction movies. 2nd they both had pulsating lights around the bottom part, but the one in the forward position on the north side had a reddish light and the craft itself certainly had a wobble as it flew, the other craft on the southern side with maybe a crafts distance between them had a pulsating bluish light and no wobble.  After watching them as long as I could, I called my wife’s phone, she was asleep in the house to tell her what I had seen, the phone call had  a lot of static that since then I have been unable to duplicate when standing in the same area.  The craft made no noise and flew in a straight path making no course corrections.<n>

This was seen for an estimated 30 seconds as it appeared over the car in front of me then carelessly hovered to my left over a forest hill.  Light given off from the horizon of a city behind the forest hill was enough to see the UFO tilt!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first viewing it over the front of the car ahead of me, I thought of grabbing my cell phone for a picture but did not because I just wanted to see it.  When the spacecraft passed by to the left, I beeped my horn to the vehicle ahead of me, incase he was not looking to his left and I am not sure if he observed anything. I am glad I did not grab my cell phone for a picture as the car ahead of me slowed down after it disappeared onto the hill and I may have hit him.  I know the time of this incident because after it disappeared I instantly grabbed my cell phone and quickly called my best friend in complete hysteria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The engineering technology involved in this was incredible, to have such a huge square object hover in space.  I now do not define a spaceship or spacecraft to be from &#34;outer space,&#34; but rather to &#34;suspend itself in space.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> This unknown technology was far more advanced, even in comparison to &#34;Big Dog.&#34;<n>

I was driving past the Marquette University campus, when I noticed a very bright light shining in the still dark sky at about 30 degrees to my left and up slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought it was an airplane approaching.  I continued to watch it, thinking, “Wow, what a bright light.”  I really was brighter than any plane light I have ever seen.  It was only one color (a yellowish white, not a bluish white).  It was then I thought why is there no flashing?   The light stayed solid the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I kept watching, I waited to see if it would change or get closer or keep going to the side so I could see what sort of plane it was.  But, I was amazed to notice that it never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That really startled me, so I really now strained to keep an eye on it for about 30 more seconds…no movement.  As I was driving on the freeway, I had to occasionally divert my eyes back to the road, and at that point I did once again, but when I looked back, the light was gone.  I slowed the car down and scanned the whole sky out my left window.  No lights.  There was nothing at all in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the weather was completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights appeared to be moving rapidly and in a rotating manner.  Due to our distance from them we couldn&#39;t see the object itself, based on the size and distance between the light it was clearly not an airplane or helicopter.<n>

We started the night looking at the Orion nebula.  I have a book of star charts and had my head in it trying to see what else in the area would be interesting to look at.  My cousin pointed to an area in the west southwest sky (Taurus the bull)  I pulled my head from the book to look in the direction she was pointing.  From the left of Taurus +30 deg heading due north toward Polaris were three dull green lights traveling at a rate at that of a satellite.  We were only able to track the lights for about 10 seconds before they were lost behind the trees in my backyard.  I immediately began looking for a logical explanation as to what they were.  I have been actively stargazing for the last five years and in that time I have seen many satellites.  Never have I seen satellites traveling in this pattern(unless NASA has launched some sort of weather satellites I wasn’t aware of).  The pale ! green color was also an abnormal color which I have never seen in an orbiting satellite.  To put it simply this event has rendered me clueless as to what myself (Age 31) and my Cousin (Age 9) saw.  One other side note as to the shape of the lights; they were orb shaped.  they were like what one would see when the space shuttle would pass over head bit at a much lower magnitude in brightness.  As for the distance apart from each other;  If you would hold your hand at arms length and make the victory symbol(or peace sign)and measure the distance apart from your index to your middle finger, that’s the distance they were apart.  From the ground they looked like the following demonstration:    (  .           .             . )   Please do not treat this as a false report.  If anyone who reads can present to me a logical explanation to what we saw, I invite your reply.  I am not reporting this looking for attention in any way.  I, for now am treating this event for what it was: an! Unidentified Flying Object.  Until it is otherwise identified! it will remain a UFO, Not aliens or visitors from far off, but simply a UFO.  Thank you for taking the time to read this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, one more side note.  there were no aircraft in the area, and no beacons or strobes to indicate that they were aircraft. It is so quite around my house at night you can hear a plane even when at its cruising altitude.  I know these were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  Computer Engineer<n>

I always look at the sky and was, except i seen these lights blinky and coming close to the house.  It seemed like a plane from far away, but as it started getting over top of the house, it looked like a normal plane, but flying with its nose and tail vertical instead of horizontally like normal.  I waited for it to fly normal and so did my mom.  The weirder thing, was it didnt make ANY sounds while moving like most objects do. It almost seemed like this thing attempted to impersonate a craft we use, and while using it, screwed right up.<n>

So i step outside and look up to the west and see the jet and the jet trail, but i&#39;m still hearing the nose and notice almost parrell is a second jet. some distance away i would have to say but seeing to jets matching speed and general direction strikes me as odd, and as they fade away under the tree line the noise i can still hear, and i look to the east, to 2 more jets. They&#39;re not to low, normal distance from ground for normal everday jets. Exceptthey&#39;re cruising quit fast, with both direction and speed i know they&#39;re niether circling to land at bradely nor west over.  I notice with the one now diretly over head from the wing span, general shape, and th! e spilt in each jet trail after the exuast that these birds have 2 engines per wing, and the cool flat grey of the air force, maybe a c-5 or a c-17 again not out of the ordinary, except they&#39;re going fast from an odd to vector to an unknown destination and even wehn we first entered the war in iraq i&#39;ve never seen more then 2 of these in the air like this at the same time.  Thats when i noticed a 5th? aircraft for the last set as they head west in between the 2, this one was either smaller or higher up, no sign of the ussal jet trail and was matching speed. However as they&#39;re heading towards the sun i figure it could just of been a glare as it soon disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the Last year when comes to air traffic, i&#39;ve seen a few things out of place in terms of military aircraft.  most things are ussal, A-10&#39;s flying either from bradley air national gaurd or from West Over (both currently deployed in the middle east)C-5,s C-17, C-130/ac=130s, black hawks (CT home of skikorsky afterall) and chinooks.  but then theres times were things are odd, i remember seeing here abotu a report in neiboring enfield about 4 f-15s flying overhead, and i remember that night with my brother seeing and hearing them but with being night i could not identify them as f-15&#39;s but just airfighters in formation minimal lights on them going rather fast and low in both a residential area and a general area for comercial airfact to circle.  Back here in somers myself and a friend witnessed in daylight back in janruary a fligth of 3 f-15&#39;s crusing low enough to read USAF on each wing headed towards west over, and last summer my self and my neighbors got to see a little ar! iel show by a lone f-22 doing barel rolls and the short at high speeds and low altitude.  I know of not, in terms of air bases, anywhere out here that support f-22&#39;s.  In short what is certain is air traffic in terms of military has picked up alot latley, and they&#39;re quite noticable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving from North to South in the direction just right of Badger Gap, which is located on the Yakima Army Training Ground.  The object came from out of my view behind me several hundred yards to my East, but appeared to be at a very high alitude.  It was moving very fast through the sky and blinked out over the Army Training Ground. The color was the same as the full moon.  I have seen search lights, and have seen shooting stars comming through the sky, and this was not what I  saw, nor was it a human-made aircraft because the speed was greater then anything that we know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting within this area that I know of.  The first happened a few months ago to a friend driving home one night from work.  He reported to me that he saw a very large, round, bright light in the early morning sky fly over his car. Seconds later, his car stalled out. In his panic he tried to restart his car but it wouldn&#39;t start. He stated that as the bright light flew off, he was able to re-start his car and drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So  we decided to take a little road trip to Timothy Lake to check out the camp grounds  and when we got there  the  entrance was blocked by snow.  So we turned around and headed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it was already late and we were ready to go home and eat. when we got about 3-4  miles away from Timothy Lake we noticed that the road was more brightly lit than I should have been, and we didn&#39;t notice any street lights out there in the middle of nowhere like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I allowed down the car and looked out the windshield  toward and what I saw kind of startled me.  I  didn&#39;t expect to see a very bright light in the sky, and it seemed to be following the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stopped, and got out  of the car.  kept the engine running while my friend in the passenger seat got out  with me.  We did there and watched the light for maybe 10  seconds and dec! ided to get back in the car and go away from this place.  once back in the car I  shut my door and my friend went to shit his door and when he reached for it he suddenly stopped,  got back out of the car and shut the door.  then.......  when I  looked in the  back seat our other friend was outside  and I  couldn&#39;t remember seeing her or even hearing her get out. And I specifically remember looking at the time when we left Timothy  lake,  it was  exactly 1am.  But when I realized my friend wasnt in the back seat I  looked at  the  time again while telling both of my friends to get back in the car  abd it was 2:56am.. I honestly  don&#39;t know how it happened, or if we were there longer than I thought or i could have been driving extremely slow.  But exactly how I just said it, is exactly how and what happened to my knowledge.  after  my friends  stood outside for a moment they finally got back in the car and I  proceeded to drive away,  when I looked up through the windshield  ! again I  saw  the  same light, so I  began to drive faster to  try &amp;  get away, but it seemed like it was chasin us. once I  got up to 80mph  the light slowly  started to  move higher and higher  and eventually  behind the  mountain &amp;  .  until I  showed up to  there respective  homes  and said goodbye  they didn&#39;t say a  single word to me about that..  And we never spoke of it since..  I  don&#39;t know what to think.  So here ya go.  hope this helps whom ever it may concern.<n>
