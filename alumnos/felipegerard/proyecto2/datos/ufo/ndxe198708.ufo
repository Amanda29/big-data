All I remember is looking to my right out the window and seeing a large disk-shaped object hovering approximately 50 feet in the air over the field.  I could only see the underside of the object,  but it was radiating a pink light which lit up the whole car.  I remember a very powerful vibrating humming sound which sent a numbing &amp; tingling sensation thru my body almost like what I imagine an electric shock would feel like.  I turned my head away from the object to look at my date saying, &#34;Oh my God...&#34; as I turned my head, and it felt like I was moving and speaking in slow-motion.  I remember nothing else except that I arrived home at approximately 1:30am,  and do not recall how I got home or what happened.  I never spoke of that night to anyone until about 5 years ago,  and I only told my mother and 2 of my closest friends.  Since that time I have ran into the person I was with,  but have never had the courage to ask him about that night,  because it sounds so crazy.  Since that time, I have experienced what a neurologist told me is probably a sleep disorder called sleep paralysis.  I will be on the verge of sleep,  but still aware of what is going on around me and I get a buzzing sound in my head,  which progressively gets louder and louder,  then what feels like an electric wave runs thru my body causing that same tingling &amp; numbness feeling that I experienced that night.  When this happens,  I am completely paralyzed,  then I don&#39;t remember anything else.  I either pass out or fall asleep or something.  This happened approximately every 3 months until the last year, during which time it seems to have stopped. I am very skeptical,  and have anylized this,  wondering if it really happened or if it was a dream, yet it is still so vivid &amp; such a strong sensation.  I am an educated person, am not delusional,  and am of very sound mind,  but yet when I sp! eak of w hat I saw,  it sounds crazy,  even to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We know nothing about sleep paralysis, although it frequently is cited as a source of suspected UFO abductions.  We observe that UFO abductions could be an adequate explanation for the phenomenon of &#34;sleep paralysis.&#34;  PD))<n>

My pulse rate shot up and my jaw dropped. This was almost identical of what I saw at night in Aug of 1988.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside taking out the trash, when I noticed this large object overhead with all white lights shinning down coasting along at a slow speed.  I could barely make out the shape, but the lights were shinning down in a V shape, just like the Lubbock UFO!!!! This was a very large object! Much bigger than an airliner. It was about several hundred feet in the air, and made not a single sound. I was only about to see it for a couple of seconds, because I was out on my front lawn next to the Apartment, and a line of trees next to a hill.  I remember all the lights I would say it had the same amount as the Lubbock. I can tell you it had more larger lights than smaller ones.  They were not blinding lights, but they were highly visible looking straight up! I always have been a big Aircraft fan (that’s one of the reasons I am in the Air force). I can promise you this was no aircraft! With all my current knowledge of AF aircraft I never herd of any such type of aircraft then or now! When it got to the tree line all the lights went out of site and it was gone.  The direction of this object was heading from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure my parents, and my sister never did believe me the 7th grader.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report helps. I hope you can help me shed some light on this, Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was hovering about 30 feet up in the air.It was large and fairly quiet. It stayed there maybe 10-20 seconds and then in an instant it lifted and disappeared in a flash of light. No doubt it was something not of this earth unless the U.S. has something we all don&#39;t know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were driving from Clinton, Iowa to Mt. Pulaski Illinois in August of 1987. Our children were staying at their grandparents and we were driving there to stay for the weekend and to pick them back up. On the way there on a 2-lane highway we were driving on, out in the country, (in between towns)I observed something hovering close to the road (approx. 20 yds. from the road away)in a field. It was very large and as I remember wasn&#39;t loud at all. It was probably about 30 feet off the ground.(if that)Very close and very large. I got my husband to slow down and to look while he was driving and he couldn&#39;t tell what it was. It was lit up with lights. I don&#39;t remember exactly where the lights were but it seems to me they were around the middle of the craft. It seems to me they were just white lights, not colored ones. It was like a dome in shape. I could see a top and a bottom to it. Metallic I would think. It hovered there for about 10 - 20 seconds and then all of a sudden it just lifted up and sat there for a second and then in a flash it was gone... so fast I couldn&#39;t even see where it went other than in the direction it started leaving in. It was like there was just a streak of light where it&#39;d left from.I knew it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or anything else like that. It wasn&#39;t shaped anything like a helicopter. It scared the hell out of me and I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. I have told this story over the years to people and they tell me I need to report it but I never had because I&#39;m not the type of person to call the police or anything about something I see. I was going to my in-laws and they are pretty much on the straight laced side and they would have thought I was crazy so I never said anything to them but I was really scared about what I saw. My husband says he didn&#39;t really get a real good look at it but he was driving but he said it didn&#39;t look like anything he had ever seen. I know what I saw as plain as the nose on my face. My GOD I was only 20 yards from where it was hovering. I ! had a very close encounter.I have always wondered if there was anyone else that night who DID report seeing something in that particular area. There were other cars on that road. Please let me know what I might have seen and how common this type of sighting is. I feel like most people see something in the sky and I happened to see something that was much closer than that. I could have reasoned this through, in my mind, that it was something else until it just vanished into thin air. You can just contact me through my e-mail if you&#39;d like unless you would like to talk to me more about it. I just want to know how normal this type of sighting is and if I really saw a once in a lifetime thing. If I can help in any way though please let me know.<n>

A friend of mine came by to say goodbye. I&#39;d been loading the car and was standing in the yard with my friend, son, and grandparents. I then saw a very white light that looked like it was driving around the ground across the street on a hill. This happened just at early sunset. I was looking straight at the hill when I saw the object come up around the side of it and into view. At first I thought it was a dune buggy, but it only had a single beam out the front. In utter disbelief, I watched as it drove around to the top of the hill and then continued into the air. It moved very slowly and without sound. It was an extremely bright light and slowly moved across the street towards where we were. At this point we were all watching it. It was like a floodlight. After watching it for some time, maybe 15-20 minutes, my friend and I decided to get in his car and drive down the street to see if we could get a better view from another angle. At this point it was nearly over the street. While driving down the road I first saw a very small red light fly up from the ground and then fly up to the object. It seemed there was activity at the object with other smaller lights moving around it. Then to our left on the side of the road was another object. There are no houses or other structures in this area and nothing had been at this location previously. The object was very close to the road. It had an extremely bright white light shining out of an opening. We could not see the objects shape but it was very big, like the size of a garage. There was what resembled a hatch and the white light was pouring out from it, but it was too bright to make out any details inside of it. We decided to drive up to it. As we neared it, perhaps 40-50ft away the car engine died. Simultaneously with the engine dying what appeared to be the hatch began to close shut. It finally cl! osed com pletely and we were getting scared. The engine kicked back in and we returned to the house. By now the object in the sky was over the house. My grandparents were watching it with binoculars. We were not able to tell the shape of the object. My grandmother called Luke AFB and they told her they hadn&#39;t received any reports. At this point, and I realize this is strange but it&#39;s true, everyone seemed to act like &#34;so what, theres a ufo over the house&#34; and we got sleepy. My grandparents and son went inside to bed. My friend and I decided to go to sleep - on the front lawn, as if that was perfectly natural. We just fell alseep out on the ground. At one point I woke up and couldn&#39;t move and saw a blue light flooding the area but couldn&#39;t see a source. I then recall what may be a very strange dream. (?) Small people approached us and said they were going to check our feet and that they would not approach my grandparents. They did some physical exams. My friend was completely unconscious but I was awake and speaking to them in some manner although I was not able to move. The people did not move their mouths when they spoke. At one point they told me a being was there, I understood it to be a type of scientist. The creature or thing was like nothing I can describe, it somewhat resembled a giant praying mantis. It was fish or bug-like and was abosultely the most horrible thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I became terrified and was fighting them. It was my impression that this creature did not have any compassion for humans. It did not speak to me but had a very cold presence. The next thing I know, my friend and I woke up in the morning still laying on the front lawn. Everyone - my grandparents, son, and friend actted like nothing had happened. They were like &#34;oh yah, we saw a ufo&#34; as if that was perfectly natural. I was the only one that seemed to think something incredible had occurred. We spoke about the examination of the feet and we realized that my friend had webbed toes which I didn&#39;t know, and I have double jointed toes! as does my son. Over the years my grandparents referred to this ufo event from time to time, and my son remembers the episode and says that one of the beings spoke to him. 2007 is the 20 yr anniversary of this event. I&#39;ve often wondered about what happened that night, and although it sounds incredible what I&#39;ve related is true. After the event I had an interest in science and have since earned a masters in astronomy. As long as I live I will NEVER forget the sight of that object driving up the side of the hill and going into the air!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I noticed an object directly overhead very high up. I thought it was drifting at first and looked away. I looked back 30 sec. later and it was still there. So I decided to watch it. For aprox. ten minutes it hovered in a triangle pattern. It was a very specific pattern directly overhead and was not drifting. I looked away for a moment then looked back and it was still there. After another minute or so I looked way and when I looked back a minute later it was gone . I was with my girlfriend at the time and my sister in law. I didn&#39;t mention it to them because they were engaged in a passionate disscusion at the time. I didn&#39;t tell anyone about it until years later.

I lived in a two story building which i only 8 units.It had maple trees that hadnt fallen yet, these are large trees that tower over the complex. I got out of my car and locked it, and started towards my apartment when what looked like a blimp at first was coming right over the trees. I stopped and thought what the heck is a blimp doing out at two in the morning and why the heck is it in springfield oregon. So I stopped and starred at it as it moved slowly into my view. It was moving the speed of a blimp but as it came into view I got a clear look at it directly over my head at 50-60 feet as it stopped right over me. It was shaped like a cigar and it was the cleanest white color I have ever seen. No lights whatsoever, but it was cut in thirds by two strips of what appeared to be metal. These stripps were about 8-10 feet wide and appeared to be moving but i could not tell. it was strang like a tire on a vehicle with goodyear on it. if they spin at the right speed the letters stop, anyhow, it was huge. about the side around as 3/4 of my complex and 40 or so yards long. It was extremely quiet, in fack there was no sound at all. As it moved over me i could see the end was extremly flat and the frint looked like the part on a cigar you would bite off. it stopped and i stood there shaking and in disbelief. Then it slowly raised itself into an upright position, directly over me and in the blink of an eye bolted at gods knows what speed until it disapeared. where it went up way way up there were sparks like a little firework. This vehicle appeared to have no prepultion at all and made no noise. from the time it was strait up-till the time it went poff like a firework was maybe 1 second. I did not blink I saw it all. I stumbled to my wife frantic and shaking so bad i couldn&#39;t stand up. To this day she is the only one who belives me that i told, which isnt many let me assure you.

Dear Mr. Davenport. Thank you for your time and effert.    In 1987 I was assighned to The United States Dept. of the Interior, B.L.M. at the Olancha Ca. This was a prototype Uni-Mog test,we were responsible for over one million acres. At approx. 22;30 we were dispatced from heatquarters in San Bernadino to a fire reported by a deputy sherrif, in the Panamont valley area, this I thought unuseual since a unit was available much closer than us. We responded, and on the highway to death Valley, Panmont Valley and to a small town called Darwen, in 15 minite of Traval time,at appox 60 mph we saw what I at first thought was a semi-truck on the left, we whre going east,just off the road. We did not have on the overhead lights since we were in the midle of nowhere and did not use lights and sirens in unpopulated areas. We slowed and stoped in the middle of the rd. We all saw a saucer, at least 60 feet wide,appox15 to 20 feet high, below the raise road bed, light up by a bright :bug light yellow interior light,showing through portholes across the upper area that was nearly even to the road,since it rested on the desert floor and not the raised highway. My engeneer became very frightend and rolled up into a fetal possition on the floor of the vehicle. He is a Georgia country boy, and not a small man at all. My Capt. who was driveing at the time looked catatonic, and simply said,&#34;Ive seen these before&#34;. I turned on the overhead rotaiting lights,the saucer turned off its lights. I tried to radio headquarters and the radio was dead. I left the engine and approched the saucer. I knew this was real and was very excited and interested,so I touched it with my hand, wearing a glove. The saucer rose up, no noise,lights out,and I could see it blocking out the stars, they were very bright. It rose to perhaps 30 feet,crossed directly over my head and landed just as it was before,just off the road and slightly b! elow it,  now instead of arms length away,30 to 40 feet away. At this time for the first time during this incident I felt fear instead of amazment. I thought something was trying to sneak up on me from behind out of the dark. My memory is not clear from this point. My crew remained in the engine the whole time, somehow I foun myself handsignaling my Capt. in the back up lights of the engine , dircting him to back down a very narrow winding road. I dont know how we got their, engine,crew and all. Eventually we came to a gate, lock in place,but unlocked, and ended up in the town of darwen. I think we were on China Lake Naval Weapons Depot. and drove in to Dawen. You do not just go to  China Lake . You will be shot if you manage to get far enough, even in uniform. I understand the Navy took the wholle town of Darwen and leveled it, due to its closeness to the base. It was just a few gold miners their.I filed a report with the navy and was contacted by a rear Admeral who interveiwed me and kept asking me if I was aware they had a captured Russian gun ship, helicopter and that it was classified. He aked what I knew about helicopters, and when I informed him my duties requiered to fly offten, he said,&#34;with your knowladge of helicopters,what type would you say this was&#34; Fially I responded with&#34; I would say it is no type of helicopter I am familure with. He was content with tat answer. I will reach the other officers who were with me. You can reach ((name deleted)) at 530-((number deleted)), ((name deleted) Station. U.S.D.I. B.L.M. I am sure he will talk to you. I just called, but he is on duty,I left a message to call me. I will have more details for you if interested. Thank you. ((name and contact information deleted))  P.S. I am over what ever affect this had on me now, However, I did have some physical symptoms, and begain sleeping with my Ruger Pistol chambered under my pillow. I had some fear after this. That I do not understand, I was not affraid at the time, and was allways comfertable in any situation. It was unusual for me to keep a weapon in a state of that readyness in my own home. Any way, thank you for your time. ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible to us.

No lights, but the bottom of this thing was illuminated by the light pollution from the street lights on Beacon Street.  It was clearly a triangular, black object and I wouldn&#39;t have seen it if I wasn&#39;t lying on my back on a roof!  It was completely silent.  Made no noise whatsoever, and it was only about 100 feet away.   I was too dark to make out any other features.  It was not a conventional aircraft.

This was on a farm south of Saskatoon. Infrequently, these lights would appear in the southern sky always orange in color, flaring very intensely, going out, reappearing. I would guess their height at 1000 feet. The funny thing was they would totally disappear if I went and got anybody, except once when my nephew witnessed them with me. I am not a nut, I don&#39;t drink and I don&#39;t do drugs. I&#39;ve been off the farm for ten years but I&#39;m confident that if I sat and watched for them again out there,I&#39;d see them again.<n>

I know it was in the late 80s.  The sky was clear, and it was warm weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling west of US RT 33 when a faint light in the sky caught my attention.  I put my head out the window to make sure it was not a reflection on the windshield.  It was still there.  I pulled over to listen, but I could hear nothing.  It was very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe it would be that it was a rectangular shaped object that moved very, very slowly to the north.  It seemed to have four circles that appeared to pulse rhythmically in order - as one would brighten, the one before it would dim.  What really got my attention was the only bright light (not overly bright, at that) that came from it.  My main thoughts were that it was some type of aircraft since it had what appeared to be the same type of light that I had seen on commercial aircraft that were like headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing about it was that the lights were going in the opposite direction of the way the &#34;object&#34; was moving.  The lights also carried out far into the sky.  Without having any point of reference, I will describe the difference in my own terms.  If normal aircraft headlights would extend out one inch, these lights extended out 5 feet.  Even though I know I saw something, to this day, I have no idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

(16:00 - 20:30) to this day i have no recolection of what occoured during that time. from that day forward, though we still had contact niether the adult dottie or her 10 year old daughter would discuss the matter with me. i do not give thier last names here for the sake of their privacy as i have lost track of them many years ago. dottie was a home maker and her daughter was a 5th grade student and both were perfectly normal individuals. i, myself did odd jobs back then and construction work for people building their own homes as well as ranch and farm work. i am a vetran of the us army and a former security guard at juvinile detention as well as a former nursing assistant. i can be contacted at davewitt_ohio@yahoo.com  should anyone know of a dependable hypnotist i would like to find out what happend during the several lost hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving on Hwy 35 just outside of Lindsay, Ontario when I spotted the object about 45 degrees from the horizon in the eastern sky at very close range. It was about the size of a blimp, just a little smaller and a little thinner. It was metallic grey and there were no windows. I would have never noticed it except there was lightning that went from the ground up which caught my eye. Then there was another burst of lightning, again from the ground up when I saw that it was going towards this object. It was a grey cloudy drizzling day and the object was halfway hidden by a cloud. This was strange because clouds thick enough to hide an object at so close a range could not do so. It was as if the object was deliberately hiding from view behind a cloud that could not be there. What was even more strange was I felt my mind go sort of foggy and I was having difficulty hanging on to the image and the memory only second after I saw it. A friend told me afterwards that other UFO sightings had been reported in Peterborough (a near by town) that same afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/87 14:00|Prince George (Canada)|BC|Cylinder|2 minutes|Unusual object spotted above lake.|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27914.html|19|ndxe198708| Unusual object spotted above lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came across this website today, and thought it important to report this even though this was an event that occured a fair time in the past.  I was 11 about to turn 12 in August 1987 and was staying at my father&#39;s house at West Lake (just outside of Prince George, BC, Canada).  It was a clear day although briskly cool and more like a fall day.  I was standing in front of our large living room window and looking out over the lake (southern part of the lake, looking east).  I noticed a dark almost black cylindical object vertically positioned almost directly over the middle of the lake.  It was perhaps 50-100 meters above the water.  Oddly I did not think much of it when I first saw it, but then I started to look at it with greater attention.  It was fairly small, I would guess that it was maybe, at most, a meter wide and 3 meters high.  At the middle point there appeared to be a band that was rotating, not really a light, but the band was of a lighter color.  The object stayed motionless, just sitting there for approximately a minute.  I called my dad, but he did not come.  While I was still viewing the object it sped away at a great speed to the upper right at almost exactly a 45 degree angle.  The speed at which it left was easily faster than any object I have ever seen in the air prior or since although it was visible as it sped away.  It left behind a &#39;very&#39; thin black exhaust trail that lingered for at least a minute and disappeared, but never really dissapated.  I can remember that I ran to my dad and told him regarding the object, and he never really reacted to what I stated, more like an approving nod.  The rest of the afternoon I spent outside with binoculars.  We never talked about it much afterwards.  To create a better image of what I saw, it appeared almost like a black lipstick casing with a brighter band in the middle.  The thing it reminded me of the most when thinking about it afterwards was the probe druid in Star Wars.  The object I saw had little detail bit it just sat there above t! he lake, motionless except for that band.  I am 27 now and this small incident in time still remains a bizarre little fact in my life and I thought I would share it.  I am not certain of its origins, but I am certain it was not a figment of my imagination, nor anything else easily explained.  I would qualify it as an unidentified flying object and that is why I am choosing to share this information here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link to the Park on the Northern part of the lake, fyi:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://wlapwww.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/west_lk.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add something to this information which is likely unrelated, but on the very slight chance it is I will include it.  About a month before this sighting.  I was standing on our dock on the lake fishing.  I had put some water in the bottom of the canoe about 4 or 5 inches deep and any of the fish I caught I put in the canoe (the squaw fish as we called them were intended as cat food).  The canoe was tied at both ends parallel to the dock.  The weight of the water in the canoe was significant and I weighed at least 120 pounds at the time.  I was standing beside the canoe holding my fishing rod and looking across the lake (my line was not out at the time).  The lake was calm that day but I noticed an extremely fast rippling across the water that was coming toward me from the right.  The force of the wind picked the canoe out of the water, slammed it across the dock and into my leg knocking me into the water on the other side of the dock, with my fishing gear in hand.  All of the water and fish in the canoe were released, the canoe rested on top of the dock turned upside down and I was sitting in the water wandering what happened???  I was just in awe of how wind could pick a very heavy canoe out of the water and knock it into me causing me to tumble over into the water.<n>

Before I continue, I would like to say that I am a believer in the UFO phenominum, but I guess when you actually see something, it leaves you wondering if what you saw was a possible sighting. The 1st happened back in 1987 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the town of Bessmer.It was about 2:30 in the morning, it was sometime in the middle of summer. I was driving home on US 2; the weather seemed to take kind of an abropt change maybe partially cloudy evening to a fairly hard rain. Well what happened next is what I have ?&#39;s about. At the very 1st instant I thought I was experiencing lightning, you know how it lights everything up. But after the 1st flash that seemed to last alittle to long, just after it a green colored flash lit everything up and lasted a couple seconds. This sequence of white then green happened 4 or 5 times at about 1 minute apart from each other until I got up to the source of where it was coming from. Off to my left side maybe 150 to 200 yards away, ahuge circular white light appeared partially blocked in the trees. Then in the same interval previously described, two green lights, half the size, and on opposite sides of where the white light was appeared. As I tryed to find a place to safely stop and turn the car around to get a better look, the sequence happened one more time then it was gone and I never saw it again. Could this have been an electrical storm? There was no lightning bolts coming from the sky. It took me maybe 10 minutes to get home afterwards, and as quickly as the rain started it had ended with just a partially overcast sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My parents came home, we ate, and we all went to bed.  My tv was still on at this time.  As I was laying in bed, my tv turned off.  I immediately grabbed the remote thinking that I had rolled over on it.  I hit the power button and nothing happened.  I then thought that my tv tube must be gone since I had it on all day.  I got up and walked over to the tv and tried to turn it on manually and nothing happened.  I tried to turn on the stereo beside it and, again, nothing happened.  I then had an overwhelming feeling that someone was watching me, maybe even playing a trick on me.  I was then drawn to my bedroom window which looked out to the next door neighbor&#39;s house.  I began to open the blinds and as soon as they were open enough for me to get a glimpse outside, there it was.  Hovering outside my window between our house and our neighbor&#39;s house was a disk-shaped craft with all different colored lights blinking on and off in rythym.  As soon as I got a slight glimpse at this craft, it took off at the speed of light.  I pulled the cord to my blinds and raised them as quick as I could.  By the time I got them raised enough to look into the sky, I saw a speck of light moving away from me and then it dissappeared.  I stood there for a minute stunned and trying to figure out what had just happened.  I then let the blinds down and reached to turn the tv on.  To my suprise it came on with no problem.  Thinking that I must have been dreaming, I wrote a note to my parents and left it on the kitchen table.  The note said that I had seen ufo and that if they got this note to wake me up.  My mother woke me up in the morning and asked what had happened!<n>

We watched the object  pass directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no navigation lights.  It was loud and sounded like somebody creasing a thick piece of one-ply cardboard.  The craft was about 500ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sounded like a jet, but not like any I had heard at multiple air shows I&#39;d seen in the past.  We were members of a SAC unit that was a part of a GSU (geographically seperated unit) approx.  120 miles west of Omaha, NE.  Our mission was in part support of SAC by operating a VLF transmitter site there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed that we did not see any exhaust or visible light from the craft.  There was very little light in the upper clear sky as the moon was hidden by low partly cloudy cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 min. after the sighting, I smelled something like jet exhaust that I have smelled before at airshows or on a flight line.  On a note, the site we worked at had a radio tower, the height of which was a little higher than the Empire St. building in N.Y.  This tower was surrounded by &#34;HAZ&#34; markers at the four sides of our 1/2 mile sq. site.  (HAZ was short for HAZARD and lighted at night)  Our site covered 4 corners of four counties, not unlike the &#34;four corners&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later and keeping in touch with my friend, I saw an airshow at Scott AFB, IL, in 1991.  The very same shape and sound was emitted by a craft that flew overhead: the F-117!   As it turns out, my supervisor knew that the F-117 would do flybys by remote USAF sites in the midwest in the late &#39;80s!  From UFO to IFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I originally submitted it two or three years ago and it was apparently not received as it did not appear in the database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my motorcycle on my way home from work one night on SR1 in August 1987 and as I left Castroville I kept seeing flashes of orange and green lights out of the corner of my eye. I assumed that they were just reflections from street and other lights nearby in my face shield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes kept occurring and were random. Then it occurred to me that they were all coming from the same point in the sky. I looked up and saw what appeared to be occasional small flames of orange and brilliant green coming from a small, dark spot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited the freeway and stopped to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a small, dark object in the sky, darker than the sky, to the south and at approximately a 40degree azimuth. The object did not seem to move but I could see what appeared to be sheets of orange and green flame occasionally going from the near end back toward the farthest end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my binoculars and looked for the object, finding it once another sheet of flame crossed it and saw what appeared to be a dark, rounded rock  with a large depression on the side and small pockmarks or craters on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rock was oriented with it&#39;s small part toward me and pointing a bit more West and downward, and the much larger part pointing away from me. It reminded me of some of kind of potato.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rock was much darker than the night sky, even though there were few stars in that area of the sky at the time. Even so, there seemed to be some light illuminating the side I could see as well as the near end, that I assumed was light reflecting off the Earth or from some lights on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched through the binoculars, sheets of orange and green flame would be emitted or produced from the near end and would spread along the length of the object briefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and watched the object until I was falling asleep. It was perhaps just an half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the object move from where it was. I thought the object had moved but it was the stars that had moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned the sighting in sci.astro about two years later. Someone posted a followup (which I never saw until 2006) saying that I saw a rocket from Vandenberg but there is no rocket that looks like a rock. I also mentioned in the post that it appeared to move a few degrees but I was wrong: it did not appear to move relative to horizon or any landmark that I could see but it did move relative to the stars, or rather, the stars moved behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed up the sighting with inquiries to local news and to the FAA and got no response at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe what I saw was an asteroid near-miss. The object was probably at the edge of the atmosphere, which would account for the occasional sheet of flame, and was moving at the same speed and roughly in the same direction as the Earth, which made it appear to be relatively motionless and which kept it from hitting the ground or water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The area can be found on a map in what would be north west of Belfair on the north shore penninsula and about an equal distance south west of the Bangor/Silverdale area of Kitsap County in an area known as Tahuya.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend pulled over and parked the car next to the road.  I don&#39;t remember what day or month it was as it happened so long ago but I do know that it was summer because it was in the middle of the night and it was warm enough to have the windows down without wearing a jacket.  In Washington I would say it was late July or August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how long we sat there but I do remember asking my boyfriend what time it was. He told me and then I began to light a cigarette.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember was what appeared to be car headlights coming from an odd angle behind us, but I didn&#39;t hear any engine noise.  I remember we both noticed the lights as my boyfriend was looking at his driver&#39;s side mirror at them. I wondered who else would be out here in the middle of nowhere at this hour. The lights came up behind us so smoothly almost as if they were floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the next thing I remember (which seemed to be only seconds passing)is no lights and I was looking at my boyfriend and I asked him again what time it was as if I were reliving the minute before.<n> <n><n> He told me and it was 3 hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just looked at each other wondering how that could be.  I think I said something to the effect of &#34;I have been trying to light this cigarette for 3 hours?  Didn&#39;t I just ask you what time it was?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can tell you is that this moment in my life has never gone away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom line is that lights came up behind our car on a dirt road making no noise at all and with their dissapearence I lost 3 hours of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in our early twenties at the time and I never told anyone because I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me.  Now even after all these years I believe something happened to us that night that was not normal or of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I did sleep next I had a vivid dream of being examined by aliens.  I don&#39;t know if this dream was my minds way of trying to account for the missing time or if this is what happened to me during the three missing hours.  I guess I&#39;ll never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still remember the dream though as if it I had it yesterday.  In case it could be related to my missing time I will explain it as best as I can, but like I said I don&#39;t know if it is related to the 3 missing hours and the strange lights behind the car.  I was laying on a metal table but I wasn&#39;t cold or hard. There were several, 3 for sure, (beings? not human) around the table. One to the left of my head one behind me and one to my right side. I had the feeling they were males although I couldn&#39;t tell what sex they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had greyish colored skin and bigger heads then we have with no hair. I remember the heads as being larger especially in the back area more so then ours.  They were talking to me without a mouth I heard them in my head.  They were telling me that I was fine and they seemed happy or I was getting a happy feeling from more then one of them.  It was like being in a room with a group a happy chatty people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that my boyfriend was close but not in the same room as me.  I also received the feeling that he was fine just as I was. The one to the left of my head asked me if I would have a baby for them. I said I would but that I couldn&#39;t have babies and I asked them if they could fix me so that I could and could have one for me too.  I felt a sense of confusion from them and that&#39;s all I remember of my dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one I really looked at was the one to my left.  I don&#39;t remember them wearing clothes and they were what I would call scrawny except for their heads.  I also don&#39;t remember them having ears. The mouth area was like a slash and they didn&#39;t have lips like we do and I don&#39;t remember seeing inside the slash of the mouth so I don&#39;t know how deep it was. The mouth was smaller then our opening for a mouth, about half as small. I couldn&#39;t tell where the light in the room was coming from but the room had a bluish cast to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My comment about not being able to have babies was most likely due to my earlier misscarriage that left scaring and I was told that I would probably not be able to get pregnant again.  However 5 years later I did.  So, was this dream related to my missing 3 hours?  I don&#39;t know but unlike most dreams I still remember this one as if it happened yesterday and I still relate it to my missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a crazy person. I would be very embarrassed if anyone I know found out that I thought I may have been abducted by aliens.  I have always thought of myself as a sceptic, but I can&#39;t or never have been able to explain the lights behind our car and the missing 3 hours, nor why this dream doesn&#39;t fade from my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else in my area saw anything similiar or unusual during the summer of 1987 in the late evening or early morning (before sunrise) during a very warm night in the Tahuya/Dawatto area of the Kitsap penninsula.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please don&#39;t use my name publicly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

8/13/87 21:00|Springfield|OH|Triangle|3-4 minutes|Massive triangular pattern of large white lights above clouds ... completely silent motion|8/10/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08563.html|26|ndxe198708| Massive triangular pattern of large white lights above clouds ... completely silent motion<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mid-August 1987. I was 13 years old and living in Springfield, Ohio. At approximately 9 p.m., I was in an urban shopping mall parking lot, sitting on the trunk of my father&#39;s car while he and my brother finished shopping inside. There was dense low cloud cover, perhaps at 1,000 feet altitude. I was tossing a toy up in the air and catching it ... once, twice. But on the third toss, as I watched the toy, my eyes drifted away to the most incredible sight I have ever seen. Three enormous white lights -- each about the size of a cup saucer -- silently hung in the sky. They were above the blanket of clouds, so they were diffused. Together, they formed an even more enormous equilateral triangle. If the lights were the endpoints of a single triangular object, each side would roughly equal the length of an American football field. I blinked, looked down and closed my eyes, then looked back up again. The lights remained directly overhead. The lights just hovered there, motionless, for about a minute. Then, in unison, they began to rotate in a slow counter-clockwise pattern. Simultaneously, they began moving north at about 30-40 mph. There was no engine or rotor noise of any kind. Beyond the extraordinary silence, the motion itself was bizarre: There seemed to be no acceleration. The motion was instantaneous and fluid. (Imagine having a VCR set on &#34;Pause,&#34; then pressing &#34;Play&#34; to watch something move.) Within a couple of minutes, the lights had moved over a nearby hill and out of view. In a mix of shock, fear, and excitement, I immediately ran back into the shopping mall to find my father and brother. I told them what I had seen and demanded that we get in the car and drive north, to see if we could find the lights. They humored me, but we saw nothing. I knew they probably thought I was crazy, but I didn&#39;t care. As far as I know, there were no other witnesses around the shopping mall. But I never bothered to check. Also, my father -- who happened to be a prominent city politician -- had friends at the local municipal airport, which also served as an Air National Guard base. At my request, he phoned the control tower to find out if there had been any unusual air traffic that night. There wasn&#39;t. I was completely perplexed, and remain so to this day. (Note: I have a degree in journalism and graduate work in information sciences. I used to be an amateur astronomer and airplane afficiando. I am married and hold an administrative position at a college in Ohio.)<n>

We stood there for about 3 min. at least watching this thing flying about 10 degreed lowering itself.  No changing in color. At the end, this object just took off in a much faster speed towards the sky, gone. don&#39;t remember seeing any clould.<n>

Some friends had gotten to gather to hangout with a buddy of ours on leave from the air force. We went to a place called “end-of-the-road” it was located east of town. It was the old highway where they had torn down the bridge that crossed the valley and train tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had built a bonfire and were drinking some beers. We had several cars and trucks parked around. It was about 11:00 pm when “Jack” said, do you feel that? It must be a train coming down the tracks. Then “Paul” said, train my ass look at that! He was pointing to the sky. In the sky was a huge rectangular object about the size of two football fields with a bank of what looked to be lighted windows. It was just hovering over the valley everyone was just in amazement. Then it just flew very fast to the east…like warp speed on star trek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our friend from the air force “Travis” started rattling off all kinds of plane names and numbers. Another friend “Joey” who’s dad was a corporate jet pilot. Started telling stories about things his dad had seen over the years flying…then Joey suggested that it came from the deep old mining pits that were all around the area. How could it just appear? He said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked Travis what it was. He said maybe something experimental from the old Fort Crowder base. Then he said, “I have never seen anything in the sky that big, let alone hover with out moving”. We all just kept speculating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not make sound however; we all felt the earth vibrate. It was a bright moon so we all saw the silhouette. Very rectangular “straight edged” and very big. The total number of people who witnessed the UFO was seven however; the three girls from Granby said they did not see anything. To this day if I see any of my old friends in passing and say “end-of-the-road”, they freak and start saying, “what was that huge thing in the sky”.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We did not see the exact shape of the object because of the distance approximately 2-3 kilometers and because of it&#39;s brightness, the altitude of the object less then one kilometer. The object was on the same place for over 10 minutes and suddenly it separated in two parts, one bigger and other one is smaller, the smaller part become move rapidly around bigger part and looks like it was going to ground and back to bigger part. In about 20 minutes two objects merged together and moved away with a great speed. Also we did not hear any noise. Next day I found out in my school that number of people experienced the same, I am not saying that it UFO, maybe some Russian flying device but definitely not a helicopter and plane. And also the light was kind of flashing and very white and bright. Sorry if my English is not good. It is just a report, I am not trying to make any statments or release my name. Also I heard in the same area people we expiriening such things mmeny times.777 Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I went up the exit ramp, and the van that I had just passed had shut its lights down to a military style blackout drive. (very dim marker lights) I had stopped on the entrance side of the turnoff ramp to catch some sleep. upon stopping, I noticed that this same van had turned off to the right at the top of the exit. I tried for an hour to get some sleep at this location. but I found it was quite impossible.  a train had passed by on the railroad tracks adjacent and to the north of the highway exit. it had stopped as well, and dropped off two railcars at this location. after witnessing two more vans exiting the highway there in blackout drive, and hearing the sounds of alot of heavy, slow moving vehicles in the distance, without a hint of bright light anywhere, I was sufficiently scared enough to leave the area.  about a month later, I had read the PM article on area 51, and its closure ant move elsewhere, after looking at a flight map for the western portion of the US. I also discovered that this area was restricted airspace, with no air bases marked in the area<n>
8/2/87 22:25|East Troy|WI|Sphere|15 minutes|"Star-like" sphere stationary for 15 mins, zigzags and disappears in response to 2 military jets chasing.|4/17/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118343.html|32|ndxe198708| &amp;quot;Star-like&amp;quot; sphere stationary for 15 mins, zigzags and disappears in response to 2 military jets chasing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Sunday evening, August 2nd, 1987. I drove from Madison, Wisconsin to see a Madonna concert at Alpine Valley Music Theater near East Troy, Wisconsin. I would often leave early to avoid drunk or otherwise impaired drivers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 10:25 pm and the concert was about two to three songs away from ending. I walked up the central path to the top and stood in a grassy area near the exit. I turned around to watch the concert a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately felt compelled to look up and to my left about 90 degrees.  I saw what looked like a big, bright star to the northeast and beyond the venue.  I intuitively felt that this was not a star and that it had intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was stationary and prominent like when Venus appears closer and brighter.  Only this was different, in that it looked a whole lot closer.  It could have been as little as 1 mile away, which would place it just south of East Troy, Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of its size and the feelings I was having, I made note of its location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used the “fist as 10 degrees” method of measuring it in relation to the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated this object was approximately 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon and it was approximately 10 degrees above the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you go to the Google Earth image of the Alpine Valley venue, zoom down to where I was standing and face northeast.  You will see the trees on a hill, beyond a building on the eastern edge of the amphitheater.  The trees are flattened on Google Earth, as it is not the actual street view, but a zoomed to level view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe this solidly bright and unmoving &#34;star&#34; for approximately 10 minutes.  Watching it for approximately 20 seconds at a time, then back to watching the end of the concert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I heard the roar of jet engines overhead.  The loudness of the music was mixing with the sound.  Two military jets, (which I assumed to be A-10A Thunderbird Warthogs from Truax Field in Madison) approached from the west and crossed directly over the venue at approximately 500 feet.  I was losing details of them in the bright lights of the music theater, but I could clearly see the central underside of them. The military jets were heading directly towards the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed just to the east of the amphitheater, within about 10 seconds, the object that had been a stationary “star”, moved suddenly south in a horizontal line, then straight up, then horizontally south again and disappeared!  It was breathtaking to witness!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report it to any authority at the time, but a decade later, I reported it by phone to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I followed up with an email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, it did not make it into an official report, so I am reporting it again.<n>

I&#39;m not sure about the exact date of the occurance, as it happenned almost twenty (20) years ago, but when I saw the triangular image today, it confirmed my observation in Carlsbad CA, of a diamond shaped object hovering over the Pacific Ocean.  My dad and I were out on our balcony after dinner, around 9:00pm, when we noticed the diamond shaped object, hovering over the Pacific for about two (2) minutes.  Then without any sound or vibration, the diamond shaped object flew directly over our condo, at an extremely high rate of speed.  Then two (2) air force jets, which had to be scrambled out of Mirimar air force base, attempted to follow the diamond over our condo, but when compared to the speed of the diamond, the jets were no contest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am writing this today, is because your organization might care.  You might be able to reference Miramar&#39;s records to confirm a scramble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, my recolection is 19 years coming.  I might even be a year off, but if there are records available regarding the Air Force&#39;s action, it may give you some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/1/87 22:00|Live Oak|FL|Fireball|10 minutes|Green balls of light come from outdoors and enter house|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87815.html|34|ndxe198708| Green balls of light come from outdoors and enter house<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was lying in bed one summer night when I was 16 (not asleep yet/not dreaming) and saw a big, bright green flash of light outside my window.  Our house was in the country on a dead end road so it was otherwise very dark.  Was about to get up and go to the window when a basketball-sized ball of green light came shooting through the window and then hovered up in one corner of my bedroom.  Then 3 smaller softball-sized light balls came out of the big one and started floating around my room.  One went toward my TV and was floating in front of it when the TV turned on and was all static for a few seconds and shut off.  Another ball floated to my bedside radio and it turned on as well for a couple of seconds of music and then went off.  The last ball of light went to the foot of my bed and then started slowly moving up towards my head, floating about 6 inches above me.  By the time it was right over my face I had the covers over my head and my eyes closed but could! still &#34;see&#34; the green light.  After a few seconds I chanced a peek and just then, very quickly, the little balls shot back into the bigger one and the big one shot out the window, followed by another large green flash.  I got out of bed and looked into the yard but saw nothing.  Went outside with a flashlight but there was no &#34;evidence&#34; in the yard.   This happened very quickly, only a few minutes total.  And besides the TV and radio coming on, it was completely silent.<n>
8/1/87 00:00|Indianapolis (150 miles SW of)|IN|Light|2 minutes|I saw a redish colored orb that was "observing lighting show thunderstorms" & it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed.|6/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75669.html|35|ndxe198708| I saw a reddish colored orb that was &#34;observing lighting show thunderstorms&#34; &amp; it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That’s a  &#39;standard terminal arrival route.&#39;   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer &amp; flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles &amp; slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me &amp; 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft’s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o&#39;clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant &amp; consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn&#39;t turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o&#39;clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I&#39;m going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn&#39;t accelerate up to that speed and it didn&#39;t decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered &amp; changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant &amp; consistent thunderstorm light show display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o&#39;clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn&#39;t see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was under something’s control, sightseeing at thunderstorm light shows in the night, making 45 degree climbs and capable of unknown speeds that amazed me to the point that I only thought was to turn off my rotating beacon/navigation wing-tip lights to hide my aircraft in the dark from its view.  But I didn&#39;t even think to call Indy ARTCC and ask if they had it on their radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two other crewmembers really didn&#39;t grasp what I quickly brought to their attention, it all was over in 2 minutes.  I saw something amazing, I don&#39;t know what it was, I just hope it was from Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an ATP, flying four engine aircraft all over North, South America and Europe, for about 30 of my 40 years aviation life, and I never even came close to having an accident.  I was lucky to always fly well maintained aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s my story.<n>
