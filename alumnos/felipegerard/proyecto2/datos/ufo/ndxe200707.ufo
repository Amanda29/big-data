7/31/07 22:20|Fostoria|MI|Light|5-10 sec|Strange light sequence followed by military fly by|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57932.html|2|ndxe200707| Strange light sequence followed by military fly by<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of July 31st, 2007 at approx 10:20 pm I was on my back deck in Fostoria Mi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night so I was watching the sky for shooting stars and satellites.  It was at this Time that some strange lights appeared in the north east sky. The lights were a golden orange color and very bright. The first light appeared and steadily got brighter, and then it just went out. Immediately after, the next light came on just to the left of where the 1st one  was. It did the same thing as the 1st. When the 2 nd  light went out the 3rd came on just to the left of it until it reached its brightest point and it went out. The timing of the 3 lights were in perfect sequence, one  would appear dim then brighten and go out, then the next light came on brightened and went out, and then the third did the same.  The whole event took maybe 5- 10 seconds. The lights made NO Noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not tell if the lights were separate craft flying in a tight formation, or if the lights were coming on and going off along the side of a single craft. The lights were not far above the horizon and in the airspace between Fostoria Mi. and Clifford Mi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew that the lights were not normal air traffic so I continued to watch the sky. I saw commercial air traffic above my home (Flint/Saginaw Airports). But at 10:50 pm (30 minutes after sighting) off to the north west I could see 2 aircraft flying in obvious formation heading right toward my home. As they approached, you could tell it was military fighter jets. When the fighters were getting very close to the area of the sighting the turned off the blinking lights and even kicked in afterburners. The fighters were flying at a pretty low altitude ( about 1/3 as high as commercial flights) and you could see the bright white afterburner flames. We do not get much military air traffic in the area. But when we do, they are never that low  and never have the afterburner flames shooting out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ones this night were low, fast and loud enough to rattle the deck I was standing on. These fighters passed just between my home and where I had seen the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what the golden orange lights in the sky were, but I know that the military flying by was a direct result of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 41 year old male. I manage an office, and have a wife and 2 children. I know what various aircraft look like and spend a lot of time sky watching. I know what satellites look like as the move across the sky. What I witnessed on this night was not normal air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Off to my left I noticed a disk shaped object moving very erratic from North to South just ahead of the gust front generated by the thunderstorm. I at first thought maybe it was a balloon or other debris but that couldn&#39;t be the case because this storm was moving basically to the West directly at me, and very slowly ! So any objects would have been heading straight towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This disk shaped object moving North to South was traveling very slowly, almost as if it were sightseeing. Lightning was very intense just east of my location so that ruled out any helicopters or private planes in the same area. That disk shaped object was much to low as seen in the photo to be commercial airliner, Sky Harbor international airport in Phoenix was almost 25 miles away. Shortly after this photo was taken it traveled slightly more to the south and lifted almost verticle into the scud clouds and never did reappear.<n>

The two brightest ones were together, while another that seemed dimmer appeared off to the right. After roughly 2 minutes, the dimmer object faded and seemed to reappear, forming a perfect triangle with the brighter two. About 3 minutes later, the three objects in the triangle formation faded and then completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.

It was flat, metallic, circular, full of light. It almost seemed transluscent, like those &#34;sailor of the wind&#34; jellyfish that appear on the Oregon Coast from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove my car out onto the road from a wooded area, the image assumed a pencil shape, still silvery.  I might have thought for just a moment that it was a plane, that I had misinterpreted somehow what I first saw, but within perhaps 15 seconds (?) of my first sighting, it was suddenly sucked away at enormous speed and vanished utterly --UTTERLY-- from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and wide open to my view, and there was nothing in it to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.

Was going to shut him up and looked out window to see what he was barking at. Shocked to see a large well lit top-shaped object flying west to east over our farm and just south of our house heading over the rideau river. was too upset to wonder what it was. just stared. object was well lit in relief by the full moon behind it. originally thought dog must be barking at the moon but he never really barks and being a bulldog really can&#39;t that well ... its a lot of effort for him and he is always quiet which is why i even got up to see what he was on about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess the object was quite large, quite high up - 2000 feet? - could not really tell - was large ... object was greyish where the moon was illuminating it - definitely darker than the surrounding sky, had many bright lights on bottom in rings - random big square yellowish lights - and had a few red lights and other smaller white lights sprinkled over the surface randomly. could not see the top of it from my angle. no lights blinked. object did not spin, windows were wide open last night and object made no noise. moved very slowly eastward. watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds but seemed longer. i was really upset at what i saw .. i remember saying WTF out loud and went to another window on the other side of the bedroom for a better look as tree blocking my view from first window i viewed it from but object did not reappear on other side ... i continued to look for a few more minutes but saw nothing ... my dog stopped barking after i lost sight of the object and i went back to bed. looked at the clock and time was exactly 12:54 am so i saw something at 12:52-53. really upset me to see this, have no idea what it was and i had a lot of trouble going back to sleep. really tired today. searched the internet today to see if anyone else saw something last night and found this site to leave this message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the object was not a plane - too low for that - shape was all wrong. shaped like a child&#39;s top but did not spin .. had a lot of lights on it. it was huge. i could see this really well last night because of the full moon. image is imprinted in my mind and i can&#39;t forget it. i am hoping someone on the other side of the river saw it too last night so i know i am not losing my mind! I can still see it<n>

The next day I decided to look at the pictures and noticed that in one of them there was a weird black object that caught my attention. I have no idea what on earth it is and wish I had someone that could enhance the image. When the picture was taken I didn’t notice anything because the sun was right there blinding me. At the same time I didn’t really pay attention. I have the picture with me. Again, I have no idea what this thing is in the image.  I could be wrong all together and it just might be a bug or a weird angle. Whatever it is, it really caught my attention... This is a possible case, or nothing at all. That I leave for you to decide.<n>
7/30/07 16:43|Wittmann|AZ|Unknown|5 seconds|Husband and I were driving home on US 60 when we notice lights hovering over towards the lake plesant mountains.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57908.html|16|ndxe200707| This evening my husband and I were driving home on US 60 when we notice lights hovering over towards the lake plesant mountains (east of US60)   This sighting is similiar to another sighting of lights back on October 2006 ( see my report I provided to another website previously).  This time I was not alone as my husband also witness the lights.  The lights appear very large but when we happen to look at them, the lights began to turnoff almost immediately.   When the lights turned off we were unable to see anything in the night sky.  So we looked to the west of US 60 and we saw the same lights hovering over what appeared to be possibly 6 to 8 miles east of US60.  The lights again disappeared very quickly.  We don&#39;t know if this was the same object we had seen only a few seconds to the right of us ( west of US60) or if this was another one.  Anyway the lights disappeared and we could no longer see anything in the sky.  I told my husband that was similiar to what I had witness a few months ago and that i then saw jets flying after or searching for something only a couple of minuets later.   Sure enough when we got home to our drive way, here comes a couple of jets flying as if in pursuit.  The same as the last incident they don&#39;t seem to find what they are looking for.  My suspicion is that these two incidents i have witness is that the object is still in the sky, just hovering in the same spot without the lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know, but what ever it is the object by the distance of each light appears to be as large as a football field in length and that this is the second time I have witness these lights as I am also sure that there has to be more people who must have seen these same lights as we are not the only ones traveling on US 60 on these two nights that this object has appeared in the sky and they are very large.  As a matter of fact I think that a couple days after the october sighting the local news had reported other people sighting lights in Scottsdale, AZ.   It would be interesting to see if reports are made to local news after this report is filed from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Makes me wonder if this is an actual UFO sighting or military excercises of sorts, since the sightings are not far from Luke Air force Base and an Auxilary base approximatley 7 miles from my house.  The only ? I have is that the jets do not appear to be coming to going to any of these bases, rather appear to be coming from California or Nevada is my guess from the direction i saw them chasing the or pursing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported by rc from ((numbers deleted))  phnx.qwest.net ((numbers deleted)) on Monday, October 09, 2006 at 3:27AM :  On 10-4-06 driving home from work on US 60 towards Wickenburg around 7:30pm a light got my attention to towards the lake pleasant mountains. At first glimpse I thought it was a fire, but then realized that it was object with it red lights were hovering over the chrysler proving grounds as if in a still position. I could only see a C shape from the angle I was looking at it. It had red lights around the bottom and all i can say is that from seeing the lights and the C shape, my guess is that what I was seeing was round and very large. I was about 10 miles away. The lights turned off one by one very fast and then the i could see no object or anything as it had disappeared?? I could not longer see anything there. As I turned off to go home and got off the car i noticed 2 airforce jets flying over which is not unusual as we live not far from LAFB and LAF auxillary. What caught my attention is that the plans where were turned out to be at least five to seven of them were not flying in any formation as they normally do and were flying extremly faster than what we normally see them out here. They scattered going east as if they were in pursuit. I then suspected that what I had seen is what they might be after, but they were heading the wrong direction. Within a few minuets they turned back around and continued flying around for several hours as if searching for something???? I went to bed, but my daughter stayed up watching and said they searched til 3:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As the Osprey gained the upper hand and chased the crows to the west, behind a stand of redwood trees, I saw a flash as if one of the Osprey had become brilliantly illuminated by the sun.  As I watched I realized that what I was seeing was not a bird, it appeared on that perfectly clear day in a brilliant blue sky to be nothing more than a strangely ovoid shaped cloud-lit a pale white.  I watched for a moment as the &#34;cloud&#34; moved across the sky in an unerring straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;cloud&#34; appeared to the west at between 30 and 45 degrees elevation and proceeded along a northern path gradually diminishing in size until I could track it no longer.  My friend came outside just as the object had decreased to the size of a pencil tip and could not see it even as I pointed out it&#39;s location.  When it first appeared it was perfectly visible and had a relative size of three inches in length from my point of view.  I cannot estimate the distance exactly due to uneven terrain and obstructed views but my best guess is that the altitude of the object was less than 20,000 feet and moving at a moderate rate of speed.  The entire sighting took only a few minutes before the object vanished from view in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or other effects associated with the object, no contrails or other emmissions were visible and no deviation was made from a straight path.<n>

In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. I could see it for a good 20 miles after it passed over me. I compared it with the few stars left in the sky and it was incredibly big and very far away, or close, and so bright it just looked big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

If it wasn&#39;t for the bright flash of lights we would never have noticed it. We were wondering what the light was when all of a sudden they all came pouring over the hill. It was terrifing. Their crafts were shaped like an orange, only grey. The ships flew around for roughly one minute, then began to move behind the hill again. When we went up the hill, one of the crafts was landed. We were horrified, and ran back to the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was blackish gray stood their for a while it seemed like it was going to fall on Collins ave. I asked my son what do you think that was he is 7 years old he said I think its a UFO. I could not belevie what I was looking at so joking with my son and another boy next to me I said maybe the aliens are drunk cause it looked like it was losing control.Then it gained control flue up and around the building next to mine flue up and around that building and then out of sight. Their were lots of other people on the beach taking pictures I am sure some took a picture of it.

Some night toward the end of July I don’t remember the exact night but me my friend and two girls were listening to music on our balcony of the house we rented. All of a sudden a bunch of the street lights went out and a lot of houses went black too as if there was a blackout and then I turned around and I saw a slight white flash or white bright object in the sky and then a beam of light and then it was gone and shortly after that all the lights came back on. This happened on South Mission beach area. It was very strange I don’t know what it was but all I know is it was like nothing I’ve ever seen. It was definitely very strange. It moved very fast it disappeared in no more than 2 seconds. It was a roundish in shape I guess u could say but I couldn’t really tell if it was a bright object or a flash. The sky was pretty clear that night too and there was a slight breeze if I remember right, if that helps at all. But what I witnessed that night was very odd and I will not forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was the only witness to this yet as we headed back into town there was a great spot for taking pictures of the sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We headed back to Orillia Ontario right at the intersection of Hwy #12 and Hwy #11 that’s where I started to shoot pictures of the sky. The clouds were awesome that night and the base of the sky was glowing orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when in the corner of my photo’s I noticed a couple of dots become brighter in my photo’s. So I continued to shoot the sky as well as the two objects reach the clouds, that’s when the 3rd one launched with a vapor trail up so far and the just as fast as it rose up it started to shoot off to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to take the pictures of this one, we noticed a fourth one in the bottom of my pictures! This one shot off through the sky up to the clouds! In total I have about thirty action shots of this object rise up from the ground in the distance and then literally shoot off to the right! As I went home and viewed the pictures there was a fifth one that had been sailing across the sky through the clouds yet this one was heading to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This lead me to look out my bedroom window to investigate. I then saw what at first appeared to be shooting stars in the sky. While I was wondering why there were so many of them or why they were so frequent, i then realized they were not shooting stars at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects would fly one direction, then suddenly turn in another. Some would hover still for a few seconds. Every now and then I&#39;d see one &#34;flash&#34; then shoot off in a direction at incredible speed. I must point out that these objects did seem to be flying rather randomly. In fact, I later joked to my girlfriend &#34;if they were aliens, well they were obviously driving drunk&#34;. The lights do however seem to occasionally &#34;interact&#34; with one another, flying near to each other, hovering then flying away. These lights were visible outside my window until I fell asleep at 6am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the most part I heard no sound connected with the objects, although I did often hear the sound of helicopters - far more frequently then i would normally in my area. I saw a helicopter only once, it did match the description of &#34;black helicopters&#34; that I have read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being somewhat of a skeptic, as well as being aware of the effects of sleep paralysis - I at first put off these lights to being hypnagognic hallucination. This explanation, however was proven wrong when tonight I saw the same thing, also shortly after 3am. This time my sighting was not following sleep and my girlfriend was over and saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, tonight at one point I saw a much larger and much brighter light. This light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then moved slowly to the left. I called in my girlfriend who saw it and became rather frightened. I turned to comfort her and upon me turning back, it was gone. These lights are visible outside my window now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am aware many times alien abductions have been explained away as sleep paralysis. The fact that I had sleep paralysis before my first time witnessing these lights has me wondering if the two are in fact connected somehow. This is why I am checking the &#34;possible UFO abduction case&#34; box below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend was smoking a cigarette while I was sitting enjoying the summer evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly my eye caught what I thought was just a satellite. I soon realized that there was three of them traveling in an off set triangle. I immediately thought of the NOSS satellites, however one of them suddenly shot off! About the time I thought it couldn’t get any stranger, the other two stopped and just sat there!  While we were watching them just sit there, we noticed an opposite direction satellite go zooming by, not sure if it was related or not. The other strange thing is that a few moments later we noticed a military jet appear to be travelling towards their direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since they were so dimly lit, and we never did see them start moving again, we eventually lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a professional firefighter for almost 16 years, I think I have a pretty good idea about what is normal in the night sky as I have also worked in the aerospace industry (as a firefighter) so I know aircraft.

7/28/07 22:00|Stuart|VA|Oval|3 seconds|Saw low flying noiseless aircraft with only 3 window lights seen on a full moon night showing shadow of wingless Lear Jet size at 1k'.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57898.html|40|ndxe200707| Saw low flying noiseless aircraft with only 3 window lights seen on a full moon night showing shadow of wingless Lear Jet size at 1k&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 66 years old native Virginian and retired police officer from Anchorage, Alaska. I had my own small plane in Alaska so am somewhat knowledgeable of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my back porch about 10 PM on Saturday, July 28, 2007 when I saw what appeared to be a low flying aircraft without any noise traveling south at a high speed. It was traveling at least 3 to 4 times faster than a small airplane would at about 1,000 feet, so I would guess between 300 and 400 MPH if at that altitude. If it were higher it obviously would have been a greater speed. If I had been driving a car I would have thought it to be a low flying Lear Jet sized aircraft without running lights, but I was on my back porch in the quiet country. I have no close neighbors or noise polluting source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noisless aircraft had 3 round lights in a row that appeared to be windows lit up brightly. There were no red or green running lights, nothing but the window lights. The full moon slightly shadowed what appeared to be an oblong fuselage but no wings could be seen (but could have existed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled south in a level straight line at about a 40 degree angle above the horizon. It passed behind a large backyard Chestnut tree and I waited to see it emerge on the other side. It didn&#39;t, so must have turned south or north over my house, where I would not have been able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is unlikely that the aircraft was small because of the 3 windows and speed. I&#39;d estimate it about the size of a Lear Jet at 1,000 feet. It is unlikely the aircraft was coasting without power because there are no landing areas nearby for one that large and I would have heard it power up. There is a small grass private airstrip about 1.5 miles south but it couldn&#39;t have landed there. The nearest airport large enough is about 10 miles north and the aircraft could not have made it a fraction of that distance without power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe in UFOs from another world. However, I do believe it was an aircraft, possibly a small noiseless jet, that could be a secrete. If this is the case, I can&#39;t believe it would be flying over Patrick County, Virginia on a full moon night where it could be observed. There were no media reports related to what I saw and it is very puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It isn&#39;t like any UFOs that I have read about in the past. Any ideas?  Ed.<n>

There must have been 8 or 9 lights - bright white and some red - creating the oval formation.  I was in disbelief of what I saw and called my friends over to look.  Two of my friends came to my side and they too saw the formation of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after my friends arrived, the object changed its position and we could now only see three lights – still moving in coordination--until the object flew out of our sight.  A third friend had joined our side and saw the object with only the three light formation.  We were all astonished by what we had just seen, and we kept staring upward to see if the object would reappear.  The object did not pop back out; however, we do believe we saw the object hovering behind some trees that were on the right of the horizon, as we would sometimes catch a glimpse of the bright lights moving up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camera in my hands at the time of our sighting; however, I only got a picture of the object when the three lights were visible.  When zooming in on the object, the picture reveals 3 half-moon shaped lights in very close proximity to one another, appearing the color orange (burnt orange).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day when I was thinking about the sighing, I remembered one piece of information that I found to be relevant or interesting.  From where I was standing and looking, I could see airplanes in the distance (further back from where the object was flying) taking off or coming into my sight path from the bottom of the horizon.  (These airplanes may have taken off from the nearby Schaumburg Airport.)  As it was dusk, I could see the actual airplanes and not just their lights, however when I saw the flying object, at or around the same time, I could only see lights, and not any solid object.  My observation makes me wonder if this plays any role as to why local radars would not pick up these flying objects.<n>

Saw a small object in the distance about 20 degrees to 30 degrees above the horizon, in clear blue part of sky, with cloud bank below and above. The object appeared to be a double object, with two layers or components, one above the other. Later photographs confirmed this impression. The distance to the target was probably several miles as the angular width was small, but could make out that it was considerably wider than tall. The two parts then appeared to separate, and then disappeared into the clouds. Sun was bright and there was considerable sunglint on the objects. Several people outside at the conference saw the object and photos were taken which confirmed the sighting. It hovered stationary for a minute or so before moving off and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The area is well known for it&#39;s frequent UFO sightings and abductions, and because of this is known as &#34;Abduction Alley&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that day was partly cloudy.  At first I saw a white object among the clouds which was moving in a completely different manner than the surrounding clouds.  It moved out to where the sky was bright blue and it was very clearly visible.  After approx. 2-3 minutes it separated from another craft to reveal that there were actually 2 UFO&#39;s, then they both vanished.  They were disc shaped with something pointed coming out of the top of the crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to seeing the crafts that day, many people&#39;s watches and cell phones changed to the incorrect time.<n>

Then I herd my friend Rick also yell what in the hell is that. As I looked to see what they where pointing at, I could clearly see off to the North-West of me just above the mountains a disk shaped object moving slowly towards us. Suddenly as if out of no where another tear drop shaped object seemed to materialize out of no where just below the disk. At the time there where many witnesses and we all watched as the two UFO’s seemed to merge or come together then separate. At that point I remembered I had my camera with me and took some pictures. Then as the bottom object dropped away from the disc, we watched as the bottom UFO suddenly dissolved in to mid-air. Once this happened, the disc quickly darted in to the clouds never to be seen again. A very short time later I watched as a passenger jet flew right by the cloud where the UFO had disappeared in to<n>

Timepiece anomoly also occured|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57925.html|46|ndxe200707| 3 craft sighted by several witnesses in clear daylight conditions.  Timepiece anomoly also occured<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the annual UFO Conference put on by the UFO Watchtower in Hooper, CO several people had the opportunity to witness UFOs.  About 2:00 PM Stan Romanek (one of the featured speakers at the event) was near the parking area outside the presentation building and was excited as he told me about the UFO he had just witnessed and taken some pictures of.  He was really excited that he got pictures of it.  He pointed out a spot above a patch of clouds near where the object was about 4 fingers (at arms length) above the distant mountain horizon in the northwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He mentioned what he saw to a couple other people earlier and walked across the field to the RV he was staying in about 1:30 PM.  He was going to put the image on his laptop computer and bring it back so we could all see what the picture looked like.  He returned and set the laptop up on a table outside under the shade of a canopy of an RV set up to serve food.  As he got the computer set up I continued to scan the skies, especially in the area he had seen the object.  We were excited to see that he did get a picture of it.  It was white in color and although it was a digital image at a distance you could make out the classic saucer shape with a bubble protrusion on top.  A few of us were taking turns looking at the image because the brightness of reflection of the sky in the monitor made it difficult to see well unless you stood directly in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While about 5 or 6 people were marveling at the picture Stan had just taken (with a Nikon Coolpix 6 mega pixel digital camera) I saw what appeared to be the same object in the same location off in the distant N/W horizon.  I would guess the distance to be at least 35 miles away based on the distance of the mountain range it appeared to be over.  It was very white and was dramatically accentuated by the darker blue sky background.  It was also about 4 fingers (arms length) above the distant mountaintop to the northwest about the width of my pinkie finger above the white cloud bank below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I described the location as I pointed to the object for the others to identify also.  They were as excited as I was to realize for themselves how fascinating it was to watch.  You could easily see that the object was not a cloud, balloon or plane.  It stood perfectly still and the distinct sharpness of the edges eliminated it being a cloud as you could compare it to other clouds in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all watched as the stationery object defied cloud movement and all other rational or logical cross references we could use.  Someone noticed an identical object about a pinkie width directly above the one we were watching.  The one above slowly moved downward toward the original object until it was directly over the other nearly touching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for a minute or two to eliminate any plausible explanation for what I was witnessing I went to get my camera and took 3 pictures.  The 5 mega pixel Kodak photos were not distinct as the ones Stan took and only showed a white spot with no definition.  At that time I left to tell others in the nearby building attending the conference about what was happening outside.  By the time I returned both objects had left in different directions according to those watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I served in the military in the mid- late 1960s in Naval Air Intelligence and was trained in aircraft identification.  I am confident this was a physical object and not any kind of natural phenomenon.  I have attached the 2 photos I took even though they are very poor quality compared to what we were visibly seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd note is that 6 individuals’ cell phones or watches were 1 hour off that morning plus another was 2 hours and another was off by 3 hours.  The cell phone services were provided by at least 3 different services.  No one had any explanation for this oddity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I’ve reported a sighting.<n>

At about 3:30 I got out of bed to look at the moon.  I was facing south looking at the sky when, at approximately 3:40 I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  I noticed it when it was just about directly above and it was moving from East to West across the sky.  I waited for it to burn out, but it didn’t.  When it was about 30 degrees above the horizon I started to loose it among the leaves of a palm tree, and it seemed to take a right hand turn.  I then lost sight of it.  It was moving too fast to be a plane and was not on the flight paths that I am aware of.  The whole incident took about 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/28/07 02:30|Sacramento (180 mi. S of; on Interstate 5)|CA|Unknown|30 seconds|A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58370.html|50|ndxe200707| A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting was full of apparent ambiguity. An hour after the first sighting I was on Highway 5 driving north at 70 miles per hour through the San Joaquin Valley. This enormous expanse of agribusiness territory has few settlements along the freeway. It is a desolate area with dry unpopulated low lying hills la short distance to the west To the east as far as the eye can see stretches desert transformed by irrigation into large industrialized farms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moving perpendicular to the highway I saw a faint red light crossing from right to left over the Interstate. It was perhaps half a mile away and from its speed and elevation, about fifty feet above the road, I immediately assumed that the red light was the tail light of a car on a freeway overpass. This impression was reinforced when after crossing the freeway the red light became a faint white one, as if I were now viewing a vehicle that had turned left from the overpass and was heading down towards me on an onramp in order to merge with the southbound traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noticed that there was something wrong with this &#34;car.&#34;  Instead of the usual headlight configuration of two, there were three discrete white lights. They initially appeared quite faint in the distance. They were moving down towards me on what I assumed was an onramp. Traveling at about 100 feet per second I was rapidly closing with the lights that were arrayed equidistant from one another in a straight line parallel to the ground. The distance between them was fixed. I quickly realized that they were attached to something much larger than an ordinary car or truck. The light array covered a distance of at least 15 to 20 feet. My mind raced for possible explanations. Perhaps the three white lights were attached to some kind of large construction or agricultural vehicle that was lumbering down the onramp to get on the freeway. Or maybe it was on a side road adjacent to the Interstate. Why such an oversized vehicle would be cruising about at nearly 3 AM when driver fatigue and poor visibility would make such driving particularly dangerous was beyond me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved steadily closer, the light array suddenly became much brighter. They did not look like headlights at all, but rather like  landing lights of a small plane. As if to confirm this notion, the three lights titled sideways, lifted off the road and then headed up into the sky at a sharp angle. This was crazy! What would a small aircraft be doing flying so close to the ground along a busy Interstate in the middle of the night? It didn’t make any sense at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object that I assumed was attached to the array headed into the sky, I suddenly could no longer see the three white lights. Instead where they had been last seen was now just a solitary motionless red light. It seemed to be hovering some 50 feet off the ground and was just sort of stuck there in the sky a few dozen yards to the west of the highway. I was able to see this strange unblinking red light for only a few seconds as I speed by headed north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thought occurred to me that perhaps I had just seen a crop duster. On rare occasion during the day crop dusters can be seen flying along US 5. They are quite noisy and I believe they move a speed of no less than 80 miles per hour. The object that I had just seen was totally silent. In addition I estimate its speed to have been no more than 30 miles per hour. Its slow approach was one of the reasons why I had assumed it was on some kind of highway onramp. The unknown objects sharp upward turn with its nose pointing practically straight up  is not consistent with the flight characteristics of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted no more twenty or thirty seconds. As I drove off I carefully noted that there was no overpass above the highway. There was no ramp on which the triad of lights might have possibly descended. Whatever I had seen crossing over the freeway at the beginning of the sighting must have been airborne.<n>

I was getting really tired and wondered how long I could keep driving before I would have to find a motel and get some sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing by my car looking back towards the freeway when I saw a brilliant intensely blue light falling from the sky.  It moved downward silently at a steady pace.  It was not pinpoint but rather large, perhaps even large enough to be described as a blue orb. I first caught sight of it at about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was so bright that I had no difficulty following it down as it moved behind some trees. It appeared to reach the ground just a few hundred feet away on the west side of the highway. The blue color was significant because it reminded me of the light I had seen over the Sepulveda Pass in September of 92, just a few weeks after Dr. Greer had trained the LA CE-5 Initiative team that I was to coordinate for the next 5 years.<n>

Helicopter appeared to look for it seconds after it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, Was idly staring out my fifth-floor window overlooking downtown Oklahoma City looking north when a white object that appeared to be round was zipping across the city from west to east.  It went behind an apartment building and emerged on the other side and then disappeared in front of a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about 15 seconds later, I see a black-colored helicopter come in from the east and stop at the very spot where this object had vanished. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then went back east and out of my line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing about this object is that it seemed to be revolving on its axis, because it would go white and gray and white again. Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would add that two days earlier, around the same time, I was 20 miles south in Norman, Oklahoma having lunch with my father-in-law, when I saw a bright object of similar size traveling in much the same fashion.  The difference was is that it seemed to leave a short &#34;exhaust&#34; trail or something behind it before disappearing in front of a cloud. I should also note that Tinker AFB is not far away from both sighting locations.<n>

The shape of the object was very hard to distinguish as the speed of the object was very fast. We were flying at 34,000 ft. north bound over the Atlantic Ocean off the Coast of Florida. Our position was approximately 50 nm south of the airway fix “hanri” on a 210 degree bearing from hanri. The object had what appeared to be three very close blue streaks trailing behind the object. The object appeared at our 3 o’clock position and traveled in front of our aircraft at a much higher altitude to our 9 o’clock position and the distance away was very hard to distinguish as we were at night. The object traveled across the sky and disappeared from sight less than two seconds into its flight. I thought it may be a meteor and its tail but I have never seen such a bright blue light trailing a meteor before and I also did not know what I was seeing or have anything to compare this too. Both pilots are employed at a major airline with very credible reputation. I have never seen an object travel at this speed in my 14 years of experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a child&#39;s block toy - a three dimensional isosceles triangle with large, circular lights; some white ones in the rear and one red one on the underside of the craft. It was cruising rather slowly when I called my friend to come and see it. It was heading west when it passed behind some tall trees and should have come out on the opposite side but when I got to where I should&#39;ve been able to see it, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I saw a round, disk like object with blue lights around 10-15 ft in diameter floating to the left of us. We saw it for approx. 10 seconds and it zipped away in the most odd, quick, zig zag motion i&#39;ve ever seen and then it shot up going faster than anything i&#39;d ever seen before and it disappeared into the sky. Less than 3 minutes later, there were 3 Army helicopters ( we are in San Diego- Army and Navy base central) were flying over us- so loud that everyone around us could not hear the movie.

One was travelling North, one passed it flying South and then another one was travelling East. There were no flashing lights normally seen on airplanes. There was also no sound at all.  Whether these were new military aircraft or &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; I don&#39;t know.  It did seem rather odd that they were all flying about the same speeds, at the same time, in different directions.  Also they were very high up in the sky, not lower where airplanes would normally be seen.  If they were jets why didn&#39;t I hear them?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard any major aircraft flying in this area...we have no major airport for several miles.  Unless they&#39;re making aircraft much more discreet and quiet? Also, at about 10:00pm I saw another one same high speed, same white ball of light very high up in the sky, no flashing lights travelling South East...it seemed to disappear or &#34;fade&#34; off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was an emerald green colour, not too bright and very different from anything I have seen before. Acted in a controlled way, stopping before hitting the fround on the horizon. I was travelling to work so couldn&#39;t stop and look further. I turned off the raod and went away from the area it came down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Ball was traveling from east to west at lightning speed. There was no sound that I could hear and it just shot through the sky for a second then was gone. Everyone in the stadium that saw it gasped. I have never in my life had seen anything like it, the strangest thing was how close it seemed either that or it was huge and far away I don&#39;t know but it was the most bizarre night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The beach was to our left approximately 100 - 200 yards away.  With the ocean to our left. The view directly in front of us was a parking lot, approx. 50 yards across, and another building of the condo complex. As my brother and I sat there talking I was kind of just gazing at the sky.  It was a pretty hot somewhat humid night.  Out of nowhere above the building facing us, a very bright white oval shape with a very bright kind of halogen blue tail flew about half way across the building east to west at a slight down hill angle.  I was already looking at the sky so I saw it just appear and immediately said to my brother something like &#34;look at that shit&#34; and he looked up and saw it fly across the building.  It flew across with no sound for approximately 2 seconds then just disappeared. It appeared very close.  Very vivid color, very bright. The path of travel was east to west, appearing to me approximately 100 yards from the beach and flying about 2 seconds I would say about 50 yards.  It seemed to be right over top of the building which was about 50 yards away and maybe 40-60 feet above the building. Very close. There was no arch to its path it was almost horizontal. Just at a slight downward path. I don’t know what I saw but I cannot imagine what it could have been. Fireworks were being let off on the beach but this was silent, had no smoke or trail left behind of smoke or ash of any sort and flew with no arch.  I rule firework our pretty easily. It appeared to be way to close to be a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My mom pointed out a weird bird formation in front of us.  She thought it looked strange because they were all staying together almost in a circular form and we both thought that birds usually don&#39;t fly like that together.  As we got closer, we thought it was balloons because of the way they moved up and down, but the strange thing was if they were balloons they didn&#39;t go up into the air.  The stayed within the circular pattern and seemed to hover or float horizontally.  Of course neither of us had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I verbally explained it to my dad and he said it may have been a bunch of balloons all tied together which is what it almost looked like...but what are the odds of 30 balloons staying together and not floating straight up into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this because we were on the freeway and the &#34;UFO&#34; was very visible and not too high above us.

He quickly told me it was probably just a plane. It started rising higher and higher but not coming any closer so we started walking down our couldesac to go check it out. We walked closer and it seemed as if two human objects were glowing in the sky. The objects weren&#39;t lights, as they were just a very bright glow. As I am a christian and never believed in U.F.O.&#39;s I thought the second coming of christ was happening and told my brother.  We were drawn to the glowing objectst by curiousity. It hovered high for about ten minutes and the two glowing balls seemed to turn back into one glowing ball. It almost is as if it knew we were there. We ran back home scared and it&#39;s almost as if it followed us. We looked over head and it&#39;s almost as if it slowed down, not like any plane can do but rather fast. Then we both saw it overhead and it looked like some type of plane but with a triangular shaped &#34;torso&#34;. It took off very fast and had basically no noise whatsoever. I heard what sounded like little girls singing, but I&#39;m not sure if this was the sound of the plane or not.  I did some research and found out about the Aurora project and looked at videos on Youtube and Google articles, it looks similiar to those projects but still not entirely sure, it seemed to all happen so fast. I now am a firm believer that I U.F.O.&#39;s exist, regardless if it was exrtra terrestials or a government project. My brother called the non emergency policy number and told the lady he was a college student that wasn&#39;t prank calling or doing drugs. They said they would have somebody check it out. Good luck with that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was looking out my windshield when I witnessed this. The object was closer than an airplane height and was moving at a fast speed. It was heading in a straight line and just disappeared.

7/26/07 22:45|Allen|TX|Unknown|Unknown|Bright, Hovering Lights in the Plano/Allen, Texas Area; 07-26-07|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57847.html|69|ndxe200707| Bright, Hovering Lights in the Plano/Allen, Texas Area; 07-26-07<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, as I was driving home from a friend&#39;s house, I saw a really bright light in the sky.  I was on Parker Rd. on my way to Hwy 75 North from the direction of Custer Rd.  The bright light looked like it was hovering in mid air and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a light on top of a building, but I had never seen it before, so I kept looking while I was driving.  Finally I pulled over into a bank parking lot on Parker Rd. near the street that leads to Hwy 75 North, to get a better look.  Very soon after I parked, the light went out and what looked like a low flying airplane flew over me in the sky.  I could hear the aircraft pass as it passed over me.  So, I thought nothing of it, because I was then pretty sure it was just an airplane, but after I got on 75 North heading towards Allen, TX, I saw the light again, now in a different place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the light was stationary, not moving even a little bit from what I could see.  I called my fiance to see if he could see what I was seeing, but he was at work and could not see anything from his perspective.  He was in Richardson, about 20 minutes away from where I was when I called him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was speaking with my fiance on the phone, the light seemed to go out in a small sweeping motion from left to right, and then I could see flashing lights moving slowly.  By this time I had reached my exit, Exchange Pkwy, and I was only able to see the lights for a short while longer before I had to make the turn onto Exchange Pkwy heading west.  Once I started heading west, my back was to the lights and I couldn&#39;t track them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was able to observe the lights, they looked closer together than a normal aircraft&#39;s lights would be, and the lights appeared to move in the same sweeping motion from left to right.  The motion of the lights made the flying object seem to be a circular shape rather than the shape of an airplane like I had seen when I parked in the bank parking lot on Parker Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the lights, which I assume were attached to some sort of aircraft, were moving slowly across the sky and looked as thought they were making oddly angled turns, speeding up, although not very much, and slowing down as they went along.  There were three lights, all different colors.  I believe the colors were blue, red, and green, but they were hard to distinguish, because I was trying to watch the road and the thing in the sky at the same time.  I am not sure how long the event lasted, as I do not know when the light first appeared, nor was not able to stop my car to observe the whole thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not drink, so consequently, I have not consumed any alcoholic beverages tonight, nor do I use/abuse drugs of any kind, legal or prescription.  The only medication I take daily is Wellbutrin XL for depression.  I do not have a history of any other psychiatric disorders, nor do I have a history of seeing odd things in the sky or anywhere else for that matter.  This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This was located around Ione Washington about 10 miles south July 27. There were 9 of us that witness this sighting. We were all camping and it was in the evening, and getting ready to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 bright green balls they seemed glowing neon like. At first I thought that it was a huge fire work ready to go off then I looked over and realized they weren’t blowing up and they seemed huge about 2 times the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them, they were in between the trees. I said, “OMG Look at that!” to everyone and I started to kind of freak out. I said, “We should get the cam.” but they started too move out of sight. So we all ran out into the drive way out of the tree line and there they were just hovering going slowly up and down and back and forth no real formation. It was kind of bouncy like, hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all. They started to slowly go further into space. This lasted about 5 min. or so. They were very bright in the sky even as they got smaller in size. They started to look like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my dad said, “Look, there’s a red one” it was going across the sky pretty fast but it seemed it could have been a satellite at first, but it then stopped and went the other way. It then turned around and went out into space following the other two. Then they all disappeared together. We didn’t get pics I am so upset cause they were in the sky for so long. But I can now say I believe that there is something out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost forgot this part:  The next day we were at the beach, and then there was this super loud sound roaring like, when all of a sudden there was air force jets flying really low and really fast. They were following the river. This scared the heck out of us. I have been up camping and my grandparent lived in this area all my life (I&#39;m in my 30&#39;s)and never saw either thing ever happen up there before. We do have an air force base in Spokane but not sure if this is related or not. But seems very strange they were in this area the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a craft very low (Probably could have hit it with a baseball If I had one at the time). It was kind of a triangle shape and had 3 very bright white lights on the bottom of it one in each corner of the craft that was it there were no blinking lights of color and the craft did not make a noise what so ever. You could see the bottom of the craft and it was black with a weird design on it. It was totally light up form the 3 white lights. It flew directly over us and in a matter of seconds was completely out of sight. I have no idea where it came from or what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

He and his girlfriend were outside along with two of there neighbors, witnessing lights in the sky. They said they were all moving very fast and changing directions. My husband and I did not see what they were talking about but as we were about to go back inside, we did see something. It looked just like a star in the sky, so it was in outer space. It was moving upwards in a vertical direction in the sky. It was moving so fast! Within seconds it had moved from right above the horizon line to the other side of the sky. I don&#39;t think it was a satellite because I don&#39;t think they travel that fast. It definitely wasn&#39;t a plane or a jet because it was like a star, so I know that it was in space. Maybe it was the space station? I thought it would be brighter though. Anyways, that&#39;s what we saw, but our friend says he saw much more that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I first thought was it was a firework, because of the bright red color, and the way it was decending. But after it had dimmed, it stopped it&#39;s decent, and headed north looking like a red star. I really do not know if the government has flyable flares, and if they are red, but that seems to be the logical answer. It did light up the sky, and there was no smoke trails like you see with flares. Also I could not see a parachute, like you can with flares if you are close enough. This thing did not seem close, and appeared to be at least 10 miles away, although I really can not judge do to being at night. It was bright, and it did fly away north, and I have never seen anything like it... Except Sunday or Monday night at about the same time but over El Mirage dry lake bed area. That night I was taking out the trash and noticed what appeared to be a red firework going up stopping at the top of the apex and then slowly decending and fading as it decended to a red star and continuing on east. I had dismissed this, and figured it was some kind of test with the predator. The object that I saw tonight was roughly 35 to 40 miles south of El Mirage, and I just can&#39;t explain in words just how bright it was and how red it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a dull red glow at first, the type of glow that iron at about 400/450 centigrade gives off when heated.  As it came more overhead I could make its shape to be like a cylinder tapered at both ends, or a stretched ellipse. The glow was amorphous: it did not have sharply delineated edges, neither was it one uniform solid red colour, but it was obviously an object and not just a shapeless glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling in a dead straight line almost directly overhead and was silent.  I watched it pass over. I expected to see navigation lights and headlights like on a plane or cabin lights along the side like a passenger plane but there were none at all; just a dull red glow all over, slightly fainter at each end.  I could not make out any shape or shadow where wings were expected to be either.  As it traveled away from me I looked for engine glow but there was none and still completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be traveling at about the same speed as a passenger plane pretty soon after take off when it is no more that a five thousand feet up.  Size is even more difficult to estimate. It was shorter and wider than a passenger plane fuselage, but not knowing how high up this thing was make it impossible to know its real size or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen countless passenger planes lots of helicopters any many military type planes too but nothing like this.  I used to be into astronomy too and know what a satellite, meteor, meteorite, or fireball look like.  It was a completely cloudless night and the full moon was up but obscured from view on the other side of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent many many hours sky watching with telescopes binoculars and my eyes and never seen anything remotely like this before<n>

The object was headed southward and contained no directional lights such as port or starboard signals. The object eventually fell away from eyesight. It appeared to be lower in the sky than usual aircraft. I saw another conventional commercial airliner off in the distance to use as a gauge for speed and elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the disappearance of the bright orange-yellow light, we spotted a very bright “star” eastward of the night’s almost full moon. This bright star brought our attention to a pair of very twinkling lights that at first seemed to be very excited stars. We were able to spot these through a scope to see that these objects were flashing three bright colors; Red, yellow, and blue flashed in what seemed random order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get a closer look, we headed up a nearby butte. When arriving at the top of the butte, we quickly noticed there were at least five of these combination lights. They appeared to be situated at all different heights in the sky and at different ranges. Focusing on the largest/closest object, we could see indeed that these lights had three main colors that revolved very brightly. The position of the lights did not appear to create a definitive form, but a V-like shape could almost be made out by tracing the lights together. We watched the lights for approximately 90 minutes, from 11:30pm to 1:00am.<n>

7/25/07 22:30|Waukon|IA|Changing|uncertain-15/20 minutes?|Multiple UFO sitings cumulating in siting of an object that changed shape and "zigzagged" through the sky.|8/14/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58065.html|83|ndxe200707| Multiple UFO sitings cumulating in siting of an object that changed shape and &#34;zigzagged&#34; through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, I would like to mention that I have seen multiple craft throughout the summer of 2007, from the end of May to this 9th of August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until my most recent sighting all were alone, all were yellow orbs, all made no sound and did not speed up or accelerate, but stayed on fixed paths at a steady pace. The only exceptions to this rule was a sighting in late June (date unknown) where a singular yellow circle/orb veered in an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappeared into a cloud bank. It never appeared on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t planned to report any of them because I thought they were possibly some strange form of aircraft or satellites. However, the circle that made the 90 degree turn was in the sky with an airplane, and the two could not have been more different. The airplane was much slower, had blinking lights (none of the other crafts had blinking lights), and had multiple light colors (all other crafts have been yellow).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my mother, my sister, and myself were on a walk July 25 between the hours of 9:30 PM (USA Central time) and 11:30 PM. We saw another orb in the sky, making no noise and moving at a fixed pace. However, the light was pulsing and yellow, and the craft itself was moving as though the air was thick, like a jellyfish through water. It was a triangular shape, though I thought it looked equilateral and my mother thought isosceles (we fought about it later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft made its rather slow way across the sky, heading West, making no noise whatsoever. Then it changed shape and became circular and fuzzy-quite hard to see. It appeared to have moved higher in the sky and farther away in a span of time that almost impossible to understand. The tempo of its blinking light also quickened-it seemed to double.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then began a lazy zigzag in the sky.  It did this for a short while and then vanished into the distance, still heading west. I should also mention that before it changed shape there was a flash in the sky, though my sister and my mother both thought that could have been a shooting star. (There were many in the sky that night, but I do know the difference between whatever that thing was and a star.)  These occurrences are made all the more unusual because I have never seen UFOs in the sky anywhere near my town, except for a childhood incident that remains fuzzy and was most likely a meteor (I do not remember that even well enough to report it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Make of this what you will. Godspeed and good luck!<n>

I saw no outline of an airplane, it made no noise, and slowly traveled in the southernly direction towards LA.  I even used my binoculars and saw, no flashing lights, no color lights(red or green)but a white sphere. Not sure what it was but I know it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter or airplane!  I live by an airport and see airplanes and jets take off daily.

I decided not to tell my friends, as they are not inclined to believe. I kept my eyes on it as we moved towards Chelsea. It seemed to rise and fall thousands of feet with relative ease(I used clouds as a background marker to help determine altitude). I do not think it was an airplane. Airplanes normally have flashing lights turned on at night. This one was either not an airplane, or the pilot received a very nasty letter from the FAA the next week. It eventually faded from view. There were also 2 other planes in the area. It is unknown to me whether they were chasing it or if they were just &#34;there&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were big white lights all along the edges, this is how I know it was a triangle. I shouted to my little sister to look, and she kept telling me it was only a plane, calm down. But there was no way it was an airplane. It was way to close to the ground, and it was very clearly triangular. It was behind the hills and out of sight in about thirty seconds. I ran inside and told my mom, but she told me I was a moron.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He pointed it out to the rest of us thinking at first that it could be some sort of spotlight from a helicopter or plane. Within a minute or two the light suddenly dissapeared and reappeared in seconds above the coast line to the right of it&#39;s original location. This flashing from left to right went on for approx. 5 or more minutes. There was no sound, no flashes, no type of trail as though from any form or flare or fired round. The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished. This lasted from the time we noticed it for about 34 minutes central time. There were no planes, no helicopters, no jets, etc. and no sound at all. I never believed in anything and am still not sure of what it could have been except that of a UFO considering the fact that we can not identify it. The beach was full of crab hunters, so others who may not have been focused upon the beach could have witnessed this as well. We did observe these through bonoculars, however by the time we thought to grab a camera the lights stopped. I guess our word is all we have though the lights stayed long enough to get plenty of pictures, I think we were all more stunned than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded. We do not know what they saw. PD))<n>

As this occurred I noticed two other red lights creating a semi-circle with the first two. The arc was bowing downwards, like a smile. I saw this around 8:30 p.m., while driving in Gretna, but the sight was over Belle Chase. It lasted for about two minutes. Then I pulled into a Shell station and lost sight of the occurrence. When I left the station, two or three minutes later, I couldn’t find it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I got closer to the slider glass door to get a better look it floated slowly closer to the slider door and it seemed as if it noticed me and turned into a solid glowing green blue color with vien like black sploches. At this point I could not believe my eyes and scared I ran to the opposite side of the house to get someone else to see what I was seeing and as I looked back acrossed the house about 50ft away it was still floating in front of the slider glass door flashing the red light and in an instant it went up out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made it&#39;s way toward the lake from the south, having either come over the city heading north, or had dropped out of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright object and formless looking at the distance from which I spotted it.  Being familiar with the area (ie, city lights, towers, etc) the light caught my attention immediately. Not to mention there was a dense, low cloud cover and it was approximately 11pm, so very dark.  As it got nearer, through our mutual shock and original attempts to explain it as something else, we both noticed it was vaguely diamond shaped, &amp; looked to wobble on an axis.  Straining to hear a noise, we heard nothing coming from the craft, which was moving in a northerly direction at a fast pace.  Being dark and uncertain on the height of the ceiling of clouds, I could only guess how large or fast it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed a flashling and tried to signal it with timed pulses directed toward it.  At its closest point, it was close enough to one of the shores to see a reflection of it in the water.  That specific shore was perhaps 250 meters to the west of us.  Not long after I flashed my light at it, it seemed to speed up and bow to the east further over the lake, hover, then changed course heading west, southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it hovered, a hole in the clouds opened directly above us two or three fist widths in diameter and I saw something very large, grey or black in color with multiple lights.  Through the clouds around the hole, four or five yellow lights filtered in, these seemed to move with this second craft and I think were a part of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it filled the small hole in the clouds and then some, meaning it would have had to been enormous.  This second craft was moving above the cloud cover in a southwesterly direction and was gone from sight through the hole in a matter of seconds and the yellowish hazey lights faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking back to the red-orange object, we watched it hover for a moment, then take its new course as above mentioned, to the west southwest and stayed on that course below the cloud cover before speeding over the horizon. It seemed to be moving much faster than before as it left the area.  The whole affair couldn&#39;t have lasted more than three minutes.<n>

Area was a narrow road with dense brush and many residential areas. While watching the road for deer, I noticed a strange greenish blue glow in the top left corner of my windshield. A craft cylindrical in shape, flew over head, it was extremely high up, and flew at an incredible speed. Sensing something was extremely odd about this, I pulled off the road and stuck my head out my driver&#39;s window. The craft slowed almost to a standstill, it gave off light trials similar to waving a bright light quickly in a pitch black room. Suddenly the craft became bright white, causing the sky to momentarily glow, and then it disappeared. I drove the rest of the way home with my window rolled down and going about two miles per hour, but I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving a back road close to my home when I noticed a bright light just above the tree line to my left.  As the aircraft passed the trees and was in clear view I noticed that the object was triangular in shape.  It had a bright white light on the front and 4 evenly spaced white lights on the back.  The lights did not project a beam like a landing light will often do, and the lights were a clean white versus the yellowish tint associated with an incandescent light.  The aircraft itself must have been black because I could not make out the shape against the dark clouds other than the shape that the lights produced.  I estimate that it was approximately the size of a commuter jet from front to back, but it was definitely not a commuter jet.  It was moving from east to west at approximately 40-50 miles per hour and at an altitude of about 2000 feet at the most.  I did not notice any strobe or other colored lights associated with commercial aircraft.  I also was unable to hear any sound, and I had rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything.  I turned around in a driveway to follow it and see if I could get a better look and by the time I got back on the road it had apparently sped up enough to get out of my sight or had gone into the clouds.  With the weather being pretty bad, it was very unusual to see an aircraft of this size and altitude in our area, and it did not look like any conventional aircraft that I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It has been stalking me since my first ufo report and it visited me when I was 8. I am 16 now. I was in Fort Collins for vacation for the last week until 7-24-07. I saw the triangle in fort Collins Colorado the same time as the triangle in St. Louis that I have been seeing. It is following me everywhere. In Fort Collins there was also fireballs in the sky. There was a red one and 4 white ones chasing each other in the sky until the triangle showed up at the time 21:33. They all scattered and then when I got my dad, the triangle left but the fireballs were still chasing each other until and aircraft flew by and then they were gone. Then today 7-25-07 the day I’m back from Fort Collins Colorado the same Triangle I saw in Colorado and before came back and dived toward me and I ran for my dad to run out side, then when he came out the triangle went away. I am always on the phone with my girlfriend when the triangle appears. She has even seen the triangle before, and she reported the ufo in North Carolina on the beach. The triangle is what she reported. I keep seeing it when I’m on the phone with her and then she will call me a few minutes latter after the UfO jamms my cell phone to say she is seeing the same thing. IT is scary and I think it is trying to abduct me. I have 5 cats. I think they aliens are not abducting me when I go inside because I have cats. The ship will hover over me when I am away from my cats but when I go and get near one the thing disappears.<n>

The fireball diminished in size as it headed toward the ground until disappearing on the horizon.  This was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First we were really confused about it that wether its a big jet or big commercial ballon but its shape and size didnt fit anything.It was obviously cylinderical and very big even compared to a big flying jumbo plane.Suddenly ,it disappeared and then we noticed same thing on our north side.We were shocked how it is possible for a flying object to fly so swiftly and appearing on quite opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, i grabed my camcorder and tried to capture it ,but unfortunately we were driving at high speed on high way,and object was even flying at higher speed.Suddenly we saw a relativey small sized tear drop shaped flying object,again with a haze around it. Then i was able to capture few shots of that object.i have that recording saved with me in my camcorder.You can see yourself how fast its moving and how strange it is.It was really an extremely strange experience.I can still feel my hair standing out on my back.<n>

We thought it was a satellite or the ISS.  It was a light no bigger or brighter than the stars in the background.  We watched it travel a considerable distance in 6 to 8 seconds, from about the 11 o’clock position until about the 8:40 o’clock position.  We could not tell how high it was, but it abruptly stopped at about a 50 degree angle looking to the west.  It sat there for 10 to 15 minutes and when it didn’t move we went into the house.  There were no contrails or tails and it did not pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept watching it and it seemed to go up and out of sight.  My husband came home and I told him about it.  He saw something a ways over from where I had seen it.

At first glance, it appeared in its flying “behavior”* to be almost kite like, moving very slowly in a very mild zigzag type of formation slowly rising upwards. The objects shape was somewhat circular** and its color was stark white. The object’s location was NNE in the sky and about 65 – 70° from the horizon. The size of the object in the sky was about as big as the head of a large nail, or the circumference of a regular drinking straw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event: As I was standing outside smoking a cigarette, I noticed in the sky an object that appeared upon first glance to be drifting in the wind. The movement of the object appeared to be in a gentle upward rising zigzag motion towards the NNE direction. Upon 10 seconds of observation, the object made what appeared as a semi-circular loop type of movement sending it further upwards toward a small cloud in the sky. The object passed behind the cloud, hesitated, did another semi-circular loop changing direction towards the NNW again yet maintaining an upward rising movement. The movements of the object itself were not in any way angular, jarring, or sudden; all of its movements were extremely gentle and graceful. At about 25-30 seconds of observation, after coming out from behind the cloud (the cloud itself was dense, yet allowed enough light to pass through it allowing a fairly unobstructed view of the objects flight through the cloud itself) the object appeared to pick up speed moving in a more distinct westerly direction in a more linear flight pattern. It was after that that I ran into my home to grab my camera, by the time that I came back outside the object was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * By behavior, I am referring to the way the object moved through the sky itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ** The shape of the object appeared to be circular with other features that seemed to be somewhat angular. Unfortunately, the object was far enough in the air that a detailed description of its features are difficult to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After sitting down and looking up, I noticed how clear the sky and how thinly transparent the clouds were.  Right before sunrise.  I noticed a black object in the in the clouds.. thinking it was a big black bird, I watched it.  Then it made sharp movements and seemed to zig-zag then shot like a bullet and left no trace.  I searched the skies for several minutes to see if it was traveling thru patches in the clouds but it was gone.  I had a very clear open view of the sky. Birds and planes are easy to follow at the height that I saw this object, but this just vanished in a flash!<n>

At 0300h I stood on my porch just looking up at the sky.  At first I noticed what seemed to be a lot of satellites moving in the same direction one every minute or so and some going back in the same direction.  Then I started looking at the area of sky where they all seemed to be originating or heading to.  It was then I saw several &#34;power ups&#34; as someone else refers to them.  In a span of about 45 minutes I saw at least 6 lights appear from nowhere and become the brightest thing in the sky or as they were traveling become the brightest thing in the sky.  These flare ups lasted no more than about 3 to 5 seconds and then after they went back to looking as though they were just satellites traveling across the night sky.  On two occasions I saw very bright flashes of light that only lasted a fraction of a second but they were bright enough to catch my attention.  All in all between objects which did and did not flare up I saw in total around 20 or so objects moving across the sky in that small area.  WOW!<n>

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized that the light from the apparent star was shining faintly across the lake.  It flickered blue, white and sometimes a faint red. As my friend and I watched the light it started moving in complete random directions at a very fast speed.  It would bounce up and down, then shoot left and right with no apparent pattern.  It stayed in the same general area of the sky.  The speed and ability to stop without slowing down was not earth-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my eyes adjusted more I saw what appeared to be a faint smoke trail behind the light.  I could see the frantic random path of the light by the trail it was leaving.  My friend and I watched this light for about 45 minutes until we decided to go back to the car.  As we turned around to walk away from the water we saw an even brighter light in the exact opposite side of the sky.  It was approx. the same height as the other light, but this was a solid white colored light, like a bright star, and was doing the same motions as the other light.  It almost seemed like they were playing a game with each other, it was incredible.  This was the first UFO sighting I have ever had.  I always wanted to have a UFO experience and this far exceeded my hopes of what I would see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Two friends and I drove to a Weird NJ location known as “Mt. Misery Rd.” I was driving my car that night, which was a green Ford Escort. So we drove around for a while, exploring this creepy, heavily wooded area in the Pine Barrens of Pemberton, New Jersey. We’ve been there plenty of time before, but this particular time we took a different road to switch it up a little bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving and talking about nonsense with my two friends, I didn’t realize how deep I had driven, and I paid no attention to any of the turns I was making. Inevitably, as a result of my mere stupidity, we became lost, trying all different ways, but could not find anything that pointed us in the right direction. Of course, that’s when I noticed that all of a sudden, my ¾ full gas tank was now was empty to a point where the E-light was on. At this point, we were all starting to panic a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw it, this HUGE, slow-moving object in the night sky. I’ve always been interested in UFO’s and all things similar, but up until that night I have never seen one, nor have I seen one since, but this sighting, that night, has changed my life and my perspective of everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This giant thing in the sky was quieter than silence itself. My two friends kept telling me to “Go,’’ “Leave,” and “Get the hell out of here!” But I was not about to jet away from this amazing experience. So I stopped the car (but left it running, totally disregarding the E-light), and I stepped out of the driver’s door to get a better look. It was breathtaking. It was even bigger than I had originally thought and it was moving towards the car. Well I don’t know if it knew we were there or not, but it was flying overhead anyways. The underside was beautiful. Four bright blue lights and two or three white lights. The shape of the object was hard to make out, but it kind of looked circular, but not flying saucer. Whatever that thing was it moving too slowly and too silently to be anything man-made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was time to leave. Gas supply was running really low at this point. Eventually, somehow, we made it back to the main road, and started on our journey home. Over the tree tops we were still able to see whatever it was we saw out in “Mt. Misery Rd.” Not too long after it finally disappeared though, I look at my gas-gauge. It was once again ¾ full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THIS IS NOT A HOAX OR AN EXAGGERATED STORY. IT REALLY HAPPENED. I WOULDN’T MAKE UP A STORY JUST TO GET SOME INTERNET FAME. NO ONE BUT ME WOULD KNOW THAT “I” WROTE THIS, SO FAME WOULD GO TO NO ONE. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THIS WITH PEOPLE WHO ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE’RE NOT ALONE****<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was standing beside my son while he was gitting in the go-kart i saw what looked like bright stars in the skies. Two of them where close together and moved to the left and then down below the treeline. They moved togeather at the same rate. When they went below the treeline I saw two more above them through the trees, They did not move togeather but the bottom light went out after about 5 sec. The forth light floated down untill it went below the treeline.													I did not see a parachute or a smoke trail behind these lights, and they where not the lights of airplanes. The intire incedent lasted about 30 sec. or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went over 1 street when a random guy said &#34;Look up in the sky, a UFO!&#34; Sure enough there&#39;s a huge glowing orange ball. It moved so slowly. You had a feeling it wasn&#39;t normal. The guy said it was around 10 minutes before the fireworks. That was like 15 minutes ago. He also said it was moving really fast and stopping on a dime. After watching it for a few minutes my father and I heading on keeping an eye on it. We took our eyes off for less then 30 seconds and it was gone forever. But the odd thing was I saw like three or four planes in the area after.  And they stayed there for 10 minutes. And someones car engine died. But it was like an &#39;04 And we told my sister and mom when we got home. You just knew it wasn&#39;t human, you just knew. Sadly we didn&#39;t have a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially, it moved slowly towards us, then dimmed, brightened, moved back a bit, dimmed, brightened, moved forward again, dimmed, brightened and them moved down toward earth, and disappeared behind the treeline.  When it moved down, it moved more quickly than previously.  Through a pair of binoculars, I saw 4 distinct 4 lights instead of one.  Due to the darkness of the sky and the object, I did not discern the object&#39;s shape or size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our backround:  a suburban street - initially 4 of the neighbors saw the red light from the front of the house, then came around to the back and asked if any of us in the backyard had noticed the red light.  We got up and looked, and saw as described above.  (Backyard is pretty dark.)  I did call the Buffalo Grove police to report the sighting, and they transferred me to the Lincolnshire police - so they should both have reports of the time I called.  Unfortunately, I did not call them until a few minutes after the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 21, 2007 Approx. 21:00 Central Time Northwest of Madison WI Traveling Southeast on RT 12 and while turning East onto RT 19.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Partly cloudy skies, dusk light, slight breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, son and I were driving home from a walk in the woods.  It was dusk.   I was driving, my wife was in the front passenger seat and our 3 ½ year old son was in the back child seat (not a very reliable witness, I&#39;m afraid.)   While heading southeast on rt 12 shortly after crossing the Wisconsin River we were driving up the hill leading out of the river valley.  My attention was on the street in front of me when I “felt” something trigger in my peripheral vision vertically above my line of sight.  My gaze moved strait up and I found myself seeing a saucer shaped object with a high dome centered on top.  The object appeared to be relatively close and at a low altitude.  Between the visible horizon  and our location.  If I were to guess a diameter based on the perceived distance of the object I would say it was similar to that of a medium size commercial airplane, but that&#39;s really a shot in the dark.  The object radiated it&#39;s own light, which appeared similar to the Sun.  A high energy orange-ish yellow, but did not appear to be flickering or com busting, appeared very stable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as my direct vision registered this object it promptly disappeared.  Just sort of blinked out of existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I barely acknowledged it.  Although it did seem extraordinary, it was so quick and I was the only observer so it seemed almost useless to talk about and I promptly stuffed it to the back of my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to the above reasons for not dwelling on it is that I have been doing some fairly in depth research into the ufo disclosure culture recently and it could easily be interpreted that it was what I *wanted* to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would have been left at that, except about 3 – 4 minutes later I was making a left hand turn onto WI HW 19 east and out of the left edge of my peripheral vision I saw the same color in the sky.  But before  I even had the time to turn my head and look at it my wife GASPED.  “Did you see it too!!?” *Now* I was excited.  Before explaining at all what “it” was or indicating my observation, she described the same object, color, including it blinking out of visual perception as soon as her attention was drawn to it. She actually got a better view of it than I did.  It&#39;s possible this was a second object separate from the one I witnessed, but I doubt it.  It seemed like it had been stationary relative to our change in location.  When we got home she drew what she saw and her drawing matched up perfectly with the shape I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most curious part of all of this is that it&#39;s only been for the last few weeks that she and I (to a greater extent, me) have been researching available data on the web pertaining to ufos/technology, attempting to find only the most credible sources and hard data.  It&#39;s amazing how much is out there, buried in disinformation, noise and junk claims, but the credible stuff is mind blowing and almost incomprehensibly important.  Regardless of what we saw tonight, it does feel like we are on the verge of something trans-formative as a species.   We better be, or else we&#39;ll just been a sedimentary layer of interesting archaeological artifacts soon enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m interested in speaking with other rational people about these topics.  I will see if the site admin here is willing to connect other with me without publicly disclosing my information.  Otherwise check out Craigslist or myspace for “madison wi exo-politics” in some form or fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> +m<n>

It was around 9:00 pm and we had just finished having dinner on the balcony of our 15th floor condo.  My husband took our two kids (ages 9 &amp; 14) to walk on the beach.  I remained on the balcony, speaking to my mother on the telephone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat on the balcony looking directly out at the ocean and sky.  It was dark, but the surface of the water and the sky were very discernable.  It was easy to make out where one ended and the other began.  As I looked out, I noticed a large, round. orange-yellow glowing object appear in the sky.  Over the next few minutes, four others just like it also appeared.  The objects would glow and disappear on and off for several minutes to follow.  Three other objects, exactly the same size and shape as the original five, appeared off to the right in a triangle pattern shortly after.  In a span of approximately thirty minutes, several objects appeared in the sky and never moved.  The only change in their appearance or position was that they glowed on and off at different intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this was happening, I told my mother that I thought I was seeing UFOs.  She laughed until I told her that I was absolutely serious.  At that time my husband and kids came rushing back into the condo asking if I had seen the strange light in the sky.  We watched the sky for many hours that night, and every night for the remainder of our vacation.  We saw nothing more of the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until the night of July 21st, I absolutely did NOT believe in UFOs.  I thought anyone who claimed to believe in such things was a nut.  I still don’t believe that there are little green men flying around our atmosphere, but I do know that my family and I saw something that cannot be explained by anything we have ever seen before.  They were not planes – they never moved.  They were not helicopters -- they were much larger and perfectly round.  They were not fireworks.  They glowed on and off in the sky and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other strange events happened in connection with our sighting.  First, when we awoke the next morning, we immediately searched the news stations for reports of the strange light, because we were certain that someone else HAD to have seen what we saw.  We could find nothing on television, so I checked the Internet.  On The Drudge Report there was a story about a UFO sighting in England – with pictures.  The photos were exactly what we had seen several hours later in Panama City, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had read all of the articles that I could find regarding the strange event in England, I came upon this site and one other where I could post information regarding our sighting.  I filled out the required information and uploaded my account.  I was aware that there could be some lapse between the time that I posted our information and the time that it appeared on the sites, but my postings never made either of the sites.  It was as if they never existed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This IS a serious letter, I AM SERIOUS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching a new TV show called Is it Real? It was one on Atlantis, about 2 min to the end they are interviewing a man standing in front of an ancient pyramid or something like that, for an instant I thought a bird few behind him and into the building, but something didnt sit right. I rewound it and here there was something....it was nothing like we have ever ever ever seen! It was small, that threw me, it was though shaped like what I have heard these look like, but not really, this one was so small! I went frame by frame and saw this black ish, object, it was shiny, no windows I dont think. I was really wobbly, it turned on its side, then of ALL things it looked like it flew into the building where no window was! At least I dont think so, it looked like a ledge behind him, but it flew behind him at the last second so we couldn&#39;t see it all. Honest to my God, this DID happen, and it was NOT a bird, it was NOTHING any of us have EVER seen before, and it flew nothing like we had ever seen before! HOW could the editor miss it, unless his mind thought it to be a bird as well! We would give anything to have someone look at it, anyone, just for the reassurance we are right, but we KNOW we are, it is just too astounding! I have it on my tape, I dont know how anyone would get it to see it. I am writing the show tonight though since no one else will even look, I just wanted to report this just in case it is ever rebroadcast so others can pay attention!<n>

The skies where partly cloudy, I ran inside the house to get my camera, but when I came out the object had flown under the clouds and it blended right in. about 5 minutes when by when I then spotted the object again when it broke the cloud on the other side.

I WAS AT THE POOL AREA IN MY APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH MY FRIEND TAKING IN SOME SUN RAYS WATCHING PLANES FLY OVERHEAD FROM DETROIT METRO. AT AROUND 3:15 PM I NOTICED A FAINT REFLECTION OF THE SUN ABOUT 3,000-5,000 FEET ABOVE ME AND TO THE EAST HEADING WEST. I TOLD MY FRIEND AND POINTED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE OBJECT  UNTIL HE FINALLY SAW IT. IT MOVED REALLY SLOW AND WHEN I WAVED AT IT WHEN IT WAS RIGHT ABOVE US IT STAYED FIXED ABOVE US FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, LIKE IT WAS OBSERVING US. IT APPEARED TO BE A SPHERE SHAPED METALLIC OBJECT, I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIRTHDAY BALLOON BUT WHEN IT STAYED OVER US FOR TEN MINUTES I KNEW IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE. AFTER TEN MINUTES IT STARTED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH WEST THEN IT CHANGED VELOCITY AND MOVED SOUTH. I THEN LOST SITE OF IT AND WENT BACK TO SUN BATHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I climb mountains a lot – the Cascades are only 30 minutes due east of my house. My instinctive habit is to look up to check the clouds for possible upcoming weather changes. I looked up and noted it was sunny but slightly hazy, with some high clouds to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after noting the weather I saw a black object gliding from my left to right, which was southeast to northwest. It was about 2/3 of the way up from the horizon to the zenith; I had to tilt my head back to view it. It appeared black in color, but due to the background of a bright light blue sky black may have simply been the default color not the real one. The apparent size of the object was approximately 1 centimeter at my arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped like a crescent with end points that extended slightly farther than a classic crescent, to where the points of the two ends started curving into a slight “C” shape. I was tempted to originally say batwing shaped, but it was actually more like a slightly extended crescent. It was thickest up front, then gradually tapered in thickness toward the end points of the crescent. I saw no protrusions anywhere along the object, so the outline of the object appeared as a smooth curve with pointed ends. It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 3 minutes it went relatively slowly in a perfectly straight line on the original southeast-northwest course. As an idea of its speed, it was about half the apparent speed of a commercial airliner flying overhead on its way to land at SeaTac Airport, which was about 30 miles from my viewpoint. 3 commercial airliners cruised through the sky descending for landing while I watched the object. By comparison it appeared to me that the object was smaller in size and lower in altitude than the airliners. For some reason I got the impression that the object was about half the size of the airliners. However if the object was bigger than an airliner its true altitude would have been higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 3 minutes the object turned smoothly to its left. It now traveled on a nearly due west course in a straight line. Its speed did not change. The turn was not 90 degrees like a classic UFO description, nor was it a long curved turn as I would expect from a plane or a bird. It was a small, tight little curve as it turned. Maybe an 80-degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued west at the same speed in a straight line for about a minute, then did another small, tight little curve to its left that put it on a nearly due south course. Again it moved in a straight line at the same speed. It continued on this southerly course until I lost it in the distance after about 2 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During each turn I observed no apparent tilt. The object’s appearance remained exactly the same during the turns. The object&#39;s speed remained constant from the beginning to the end of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see military and civilian fixed wing aircraft and helicopters on a somewhat regular basis in my area. This was not one. It did not appear to be a bird either flapping its wings or gliding. I spend about 30 days a year in the wilderness and I see many hawks and other birds gliding through the air. At Lake Sammamish, a mile from my home, bald eagles nest and I see them gliding through the air fairly often as well. Their wings are always extended in a roughly straight angle as they glide. There is no crescent shape to their appearance. When a bird turns, I see the tilt in the direction of its turn and I see a relatively wide curve as it turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw was not in the shape of a bird or an aircraft. The turns it made showed no visible tilt, and the turns were much tighter than those of a bird or aircraft. The object’s appearance was simple enough that I drew a rough example as it appeared to me and I will mail it to the National UFO Reporting Center. I will also send a map pinpointing my location as I viewed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I am a lawyer and a lobbyist, a father of two, an avid mountain climber, and an amateur astronomer. I am 43 years old.<n>

At first I thought it was just a cell phone tower till we came to a clearing in the trees and it was a little to high for a tower. I watched the red blinking light till we get to the light to turn onto Rt 90 going east. When we reached the stop light, the red blinking light then turned into two three lights,. It looked like three small lights, red, wight and blue, but my husband said it wasn’t blue that he thought it was green. The lights just stayed still in the air, that is when I thought it might be a helicopter. My husband then turned on the entente ramp to the highway and I figured I would never see it again. I watched as we drove out of it’s view. I was amazed at what I saw and stared repeatedly looking for it. Withing a minuted it came into vew again and was now heading down Rt 90 east. As I watched it, it was now just the red light again, then it changed to a bright white light. It was now moving very fast and almost caught up with the car and I thought it was going to fly right over us, then the light flared and became very bright for a second, I watched it the whole way home. My husband was looking at it from the rear view when we saw it flare again. We reached our exit and stopped at the stop sing. I couldn’t believe it, but the light also stopped. As we turned off the ramp onto the road I watched the light, it had stopped and was just sitting there in the sky, I could now see the red light again with the white. I took a drive back up to the highway about 30 min later to see if it was still there and it was gone. I need to know what that was. Was it a helicopter or a UFO. Please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went out onto my front porch to have a cigarette when I noticed a marble sized (from my viewpoint) black object just hanging in the air to my upper-right.  I watched the object while I smoked, and noticed the sun shimmer off of it&#39;s right side.  I then realized (from the sun shimmer) that the right side had a flat angle.  I continued to watch the object as it just hovered in the sky motionless.  I then decided to grab my Sony Handycam to get a zoomed look, and to record it.  However, my camera was out of battery power after time-coding a tape for a video editing class I took about 6 months earlier.  I then watched as the object very slowly moved out of my eyesight, and into the distant clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking east and saw what I initially thought was an airplane with its flood lights through the branches of the tree located in my front yard, I then thought the plane is pretty low so I walked forward to see clearly what was going on. As I walked toward the light my second thought was the Rockford PD with their new police helicopter are on the hunt for someone with the search lights on, until I came to a clear view and the lights grew intense and then more intense as though a star was expanding glowing brighter and brighter for a few seconds and then from the light it looked as if it was a very large meteor entering the atmosphere catching on fire. I was convinced I was seeing the coolest meteor ever to fall to earth until it hit me, the meteor was not falling to earth it was moving away from earth up through and out of our atmosphere . As soon as I realized it was going the wrong direction for a meteor, a small object too small for great descriptive detail but if I were to give the best discription it was almost like an object with a perfect oval shape tilted on its side horizontally shot from the object that was on fire exiting our atmosphere at an imperceptible speed and seemed to disappear into the starry night sky with the fireball left trailing until disapating to blackness.  I then went and looked at the launch scheduled for NASA to see if it had been the shuttle and found that there were no launches scheduled for July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I then saw another light in the east sky going north make a right turn instantly.It was just weird.by this time it was around 5 a.m. and my friend calls me up he lives couple blocks away and him and his friend came over.I got in his car for about ten minutes and listen to sum songs he recorded and told him about what i saw and of course he brushed it off like i was playing.Then we got out the car and i looked up and saw another light it was dim and i said look.It was going south then it made a quick flash then kept going and made another flash. after that we went into my house to record a song.That could of been a meteor but i was seeing strange lighs all night move through the sky, weird.I would say over two hours of watching the sky i seen about nine lights i couldn&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 12:30 A.M. on July 20, 2007 I was looking towards Miami Beach. Then I saw a green light come from the west at a very rapid speed. It stopped at a distance of a couple of football fields away in the air. It made no sound but it had a color of bright green. It stayed stationary for about 3 seconds and then it speeded off to the west. I turned to the side to tell my friend to look at it when it was stationary and my friend looked up and then it speeded off. But he also was able to see the UFO. When this happened i realized that it was not a glare or my mind playing tricks on me but it was an actual UFO and not a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my husband what it was to which he repied &#34;I have no idea&#34;. He pulled over to the side of the road and I opened my window to get a better look.  The fireball was now slowly traveling upwards and South West.

It was too close to the ground and stationary at first to be a plane, and since it did not fade away or flash, it could not have been something floating away from someones fire.  I have no idea what it was but the fact that it was pretty much hovering over the road was terrifying to me.  It did not start moving until we pulled over.  We tried to take a video of it with our camera but by the time my husband got it out the object was too far away to look like much of anything on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are orange fireballs/light objects a regular observation??<n>

As I was driving home approx 1/4 of a mile to my house, I saw an enormous disc shaped craft in the sky to my left. If you saw seven to ten low flying airplanes side by side I would quess that to be the size of it. It appeared to be a very large dark disc shape with bright yellow lights in the center, the lights were so bright they looked like large flourecent bulbs in the center. I also saw some small blue and grey lights which appeared to be on each end of it.It made no noise as you would expect a large craft would make.  As I was driving, I remember at least one other vehicle coming from the east I began to yell and flash my lights to try and get his attention, because I did not want to be the only one seeing this. As he passed me by I saw the object moving quickly to the south west. I pulled into my home driveway as it was quickly moving to the west, I saw my fathers car who lives next door pulling in front of my garage. I jumped out of the car to try and get my wife to come and see this, as I got out of my car my father said what the hell was that! I said did you see that! as I was running to the door to get my wife. By the time she came out the craft was far to the west and moving south. My wife only caught a glimpse in the distance, and said oh maybe it was a blimp. I said I can still see it, and we grabbed our dogs and jumped in the car and  drove to the south west and it was nowhere in sight. But to recap my visual experience, this craft was hovering to my left in the sky to my west. A extremely large disc shaped craft with bright yellow lights in the center and lights on what appeared to be each end of the craft blue and gray. Making no noise, by eye it was very close to me yet it was still high enough in the sky to not make an accurate judgement of the size. Big enough to cause me to be in awe and writing this letter. Although, it appeared to be hovering moving slow it th! en moved so quickly that within  2 minutes or so it was completely out of site. The disc itself appeared to be a dark grey color, however it was night so it looked black or grey. If you saw a low flying plane in the sky, this would have been at least ten planes as I mentioned it was HUGE! I dont know what these crafts are military or something else but Im now a believer! 30 Miles south of Chicago it was here!<n>

From the southeast almost directly over my house tonight, about 9:20PM were two objects flying in tandem about 100&#39; apart, they both had an almost white reflective-like hull with absolutely no lights, strobes, cockpit lights turned on anywhere, being followed closely by one military black hawk helicopter with one red strobe light on. The two objects were out in front, had no wings, no noticeable rotors spinning, cigar-like shaped structures. They couldn&#39;t have been helicopters as there was no multi-rotor &#34;swash&#34; in the air that you hear with multiple helicopters in flight. They kept a tight tandem formation. All three aircraft were flying in tandem at the same speed together about the normal speed as any commercial helicopter. As they passed by the house I quickly ran to the front of the house and watched as they turned and went westbound over Hwy 50 over the mountains, the two objects out in front of the black hawk becoming harder to see the further away they went. With just a hint of setting sun in the west I could still see the black hawk rotor blades but nothing for the other two objects in front. The elevation here is about 4500&#39; and the aircraft were flying probably at around 7500&#39; - 8000&#39; not too low but not real high either. It is extremely unusual for any aircraft not to have it&#39;s lights on in the night sky at this time of night. Something very strange was getting a military escort tonight to somewhere. About 25 minutes later I heard and saw the same red strobed military helicopter return from the west heading south, but it was too far west to see if the other objects were still with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I do believe in UFOs and I love weather related things so I am always looking at the sky when I am outside. I noticed a very very bright light. The sun had not totally gone down yet , and there were no other stars in the sky. I grabbed my binoculars to see if I could see it closer, but it was hard. All it did was made it look even shinier and the form would change because of the lenses I am assuming. I grabbed my video recorder instead and tried to get as close to the object as I could. Through that, this bright light looked like it had a type of &#39;strobe&#39; effect. It had remained in the same spot for 15 minutes (as far as I know, because I dont know how long it was there before I went outside) but as i was viewing it thru my camera, it moved and I was no longer able to see it as trees were obstructing my view. It did this quite slowly , not a quick motion. I went to all of my windows of my 2 story house to see if I could capture its view again, but to my dismay, it was gone. It was the brightest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky ever. I dont know &#39;N,S,E,W&#39; it was but I do know that it was in the area of a power plant. I am not sure if i am able to name the plant. I will continue to look online daily to see if anybody else has seen what I saw. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The image that sticks in my mind the most is when I first saw it; I really focused in on it to make sure it wasn’t a balloon. It looked like a shinny sliver color with black on top. A saucer type shape it was moving at the same level in the sky, not rising or sinking, but very fast and then it was out of my view with my camera dangling from my neck.  The spinning motion view I had only lasted about 7 seconds because it was moving away from my direction. It was moving East towards long Island.

7/20/07 18:00|oceanside|CA|Fireball|7-9 seconds|sighting,experiences,dreams,my story|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84829.html|164|ndxe200707| sighting,experiences, dreams, my story<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi my name is ((deleted)) I’m reporting this because I have yet to do an official submission of my case, although I have told Linda Howe my story once before.  My entire life seems to have some connection with ufo’s and although I never realized until my twenties I&#39;ve always had some sort of connection with the topic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child I frequently had dreams of craft mostly black triangles and rectangles with red light at corners, keep in mind these dreams occurred before I knew anything about ufology and only found out later on that these types of craft were really being seen by people. I disregarded these dreams for a long time.  In 1997 my mom and sister had a night time sighting of a dark black sphere with lights moving across its rim over Camp Pendleton marine Base near our house, it wasn’t till then that I began to start taking ufos seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in 2009 I went to drive to the beach to pick up my friend to go skateboarding that I had a sighting of my own.  I drove to an intersection near the 76 expressway in Oceanside and at the red light I happened to look up.  In the sky I saw a ball of bluish white light doing zig zag’s and then stopping then starting to zig zag again, the entire sighting lasted only about 7 seconds. Eventually the ball of light dropped down behind a mountain and out of view The sky wasn’t fully dark but was getting dark this happened around 6-7 pm.  This sighting further increased my interest and caused me to become an amateur ufologist in my own rite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years later in 2009 I became alarmed after some more intriguing experiences that took place in my room.  One night I was awoken at 3:00 am by a loud sparking sound and I looked up and saw a small orb of light shoot trough the corner of my room’s wall.  I’m not saying this object was a UFO but I don’t know what it was, orb, sphere, was it a ghost I have no clue all I know is it probably wasn’t ball lightning.  After the orb incident a few months past and I had a dream the completely rocked my world or at least it might have been a dream……  The following is what I recall from this dream / possible abduction…….I wake up in a foreign alien room, the walls are green and spongy I soon realize I’m not alone and that I’m with other humans all dressed in normal casual clothes and no one is talking and I’m not able to talk, I then realize that there are other beings in the room, these beings are brown humanoids with extremely wrinkly skin, they don’t have any noticeable genitals or sexually features, they have small all black eyes same size as ours but the whole eye is black, they range in height from about 5-6 feet tall, they have no hair, 5 digit fingers and toes like us, no nails, the mouth was hard to see because of the wrinkly skin on their faces.  The beings do not talk or use telepathy they motion to sit down on these bench type things that are almost like grown from the floor, the room is cylindrical and besides the weird benches it’s empty of equipment.  The brown alien guys motion us to site down once we all ! do they begin to project images that seem to float in mid air, the room starts to seem like a theater now, on the images they show peaceful images of the earth and earth life, then the next image will be a negative image of earth floods, war, dead bodies.  They seemed interested in how we felt about these images and the contrasting of the images content. After all this was over we were taken out into a hallway and the last recall I have is walking down this hallway and seeing this rather attractive brunette girl then the memory just stops, like I wasn’t supposed to remember anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds crazy but I’ve never head another dream this intense and these aliens look like nothing I’ve heard described before and they sure weren’t grays or reptilian or any of the things I’ve heard of in movies.  If this was just a dream then it may be a dream of a real event coming trough.  I’ve sometimes gone to bed and woke up on the couch and other weird things including unexplained marks on my skin.  I don’t really want to say I’m an abductee but the more I learn about it the more and more I feel I fit the category.  Through all of this I&#39;m still quite normal considering these events, but I know how hard it is to express these things so in hopes that others might come forward and hopefully if anyone has seen similar brown beings it would be nice to share.<n>

His property has a broad, majestic view of a forested hillside. This “bird” was cruising at a steady pace, very evenly, over the forest, and flashing a silver and green light. Eventually it went down into the trees and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made fun of my father for this UFO. But then today we were eating lunch, overlooking the hillside, and I saw a small, steady, hovering object flashing a silver and green light, just over the treeline about 500 meters away. It was too small and quiet to be a plane or helicopter, too steady and odd to be a toy plane or weather balloon. The only thing I could think of was it could be a surveillance drone like the military uses. But that would (hopefully) be way out of place in Lyme.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued flashing its light—silver-green, silver-green—and hovering in that oddly steady manner, and cruised off in a semi-slow pace until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spotted them out of the corner or my eye. They flew in a circle formation. One in the center, nine on the outer edge. They were also flying very fast. They slowed and made a right turn to the right and climbed to a height aproximently 100 thousand feet. The objects left a trail over the house and all our electronic devices went hay-wire and shut off. Then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving West on Hwy 16 between Forest Home Rd. and Ione Rd. At this place the hills fall away to the South(my left). Looking South I saw two very bright white lights, looking like a pair of headlights, heading North Northwest. I kept driving, but slowed down a bit to keep observing the lights. The lights banked slightly(West light a little up, East light a little down) and now headed apparently due North.  As I got to the top of a little rise, I could see that the lights would come directly across the road right over me. I pulled off onto the shoulder, stopped and rolled down the window. I had my head out the window and watched the lights come over. I brought my head back in, turned the radio off, and looked at the time on my phone(4:09AM).  I then got out of my car and by now the lights were slightly North of the road. From this perspective I now saw four white lights and one red light. The white lights appeared to be in a triangulr pattern, in that there was one white light in the front and three in a row along the back (similar to this shape .:. ). The red light was in the middle of the array, between the front white light and the middle back light.  These lights were not nearly as bright as the &#34;headlights&#34; seen in the frontal view, and at no time did any of the lights flash or strobe. There was also no sound from the craft at all. There were no other aircraft in sight (usually I see some planes heading toward the Sacramento airport, but not this morning).The lights headed North and were observed until the near hills to the north obscured them.  No other vehicles came by in either direction. I then got back on the road and continued on to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just before entering Follansbee, WV, Hovering just above the tree lines. A large black craft with 2 bright lights in front and 4 deep red lights. 2 of the red lights were centered on the bottom of the white lights. The other 2 lights were each side of the triange. There were no lights in the back of the craft which was bowed inward. The overall shape was that of a triangle that looked like the corners were cut off and the back was curved inward. There was no letters or writting on it anywhere. The bottom was smooth. Like it had no landing gear. I could not see any windows, or doors. I was very close to it. It was around 4:30 a.m. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it did not move. It made no noise. We slowed to watch it with the windows down. We went up on the hill to get a good look at it. The clearing showed the entire sky. The shy was clear. It just vanished. Nowhere in sight. I was not drinking or use drugs. Very clear of mind. There was another person in the car with me and my husband. My husband was sleeping. I can&#39;t find anything on the net that looks like this. How can it just vanish like that? Awsome. Could you please let me know if you know what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both lights at first were flashing very rapidly while changing colors. The colors the lights flashed were red, blue, green, and orange (sort of incandescent looking). With each flash the lights became more intensely bright. The first light was south west of Antwerp and the second was north east. The lights flashed in identical patterns, first one then the other.  Suddenly they grew very dim and hard to see, after about 10 Seconds they began to pulse slowly. With each pulse growing more and more intense and then going very dim again. Both objects appeared to remain stationary and continued the same pulsing pattern for the twenty minutes I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was like talking to a war veteran about his days in combat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I don’t get this story wrong; my cousin told me just once about it after I brought it up. I heard he saw something after some of the family was giving him a hard time about the experience; saying he must have been drinking and didn’t take him serious (he&#39;s an honest person).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin (35yrs old) and his friend (33 yrs old) were at the friend’s house at about 1:00am, but I am not sure about the date (mid July?) 2007. They had been out fishing and were moving fishing gear back to his car from his friend’s vehicle. His friend said something about the neighbor (1 mile down) must have got a new yard light. They then noticed that the light looked like it was “wobbling” back and forth. Then all of a sudden the light slowly rose above the tree line still “wobbling”. I believe he said it was triangular shaped with three lights (one on each corner); he got a better look at it above the tree line. Then he said within a couple seconds it was a dot in the sky. It went straight up at a very high speed. After seeing it rise he said it might have been further away then what they originally thought (maybe 4 or 5 mi away?). It stayed up in the sky for a while looking like a star until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in the Otisville area and the object was toward the Columbiaville area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/20/07 00:51|Chesapeake|VA|Changing|45 min|Multiple objects visible at miles over Chesapeake VA Near Cornland park|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57739.html|173|ndxe200707| Multiple objects visible at miles over Chesapeake VA Near Cornland park<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dropping my girlfriend off at here house near the North Carolina boarder and saw a bright object in my peripheral vision. It was significant to me because of the magnitude of the object and its proximity to Jupiter, which was low to the horizon and getting ready to set for the night. This object was brighter than the star Vega, and varied in magnitude and color. I grabbed her attention when I noticed it was moving very fast and erratic. It appeared to have several multicolored lights and was flashing at an inconsistent pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would do zig zag patterns and ascend and descend at a rapid pace. The most interesting thing is it almost never moved in a strait trajectory, and if its path seemed to be somewhat strait it would vary its speed, moving in a non fluid motion as if it was jerking. I know this was not the asteroid Vesta or comet C2006v13 due to the comet being near Draco and Vesta has not reached this kind of magnitude, and the motions that this object made do not follow modern conceptions of astrophysics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting thing is, as this object would decrease in magnitude to the point that It could not be seen there where 10 or more objects around and spread out across the horizon that would flash and get bright, these objects would then dimmer and the &#34;Main&#34; object would increase in magnitude. At times up to 4 different lights would be visible and would appear to triangle shaped and at times would appear to be cylindrical. This is hard to tell due to the fact that the object was at a great distance. At times you could see a flash of light that illuminate thin clouds near it and always seemed to be in the direction of other objects that you could see flash light at the main object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the period of 45 minutes the object had moved from about 40 degrees altitude in the eastern south eastern horizon to about 15 degrees, back up to about 30 degrees. In our time of observation four lights were distinguishable, and multiple colours from white, blue, red, and green lights. The objects were still in the sky when I left to head home around 01:40. At that time I had a friend from California on the phone listening in on the event and trying to observer using the stars an Jupiter as a reference. He could not see anything telling me it was localized in nature and was within our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur Astronomer and part of an Astronomy club that is a non profit educational group. This was unlike any event that I have ever seen. In astronomy we are very attentive to objects in the night sky and see some things that cannot be explained. Satellites and the ISS move fast and with a standard trajectory. This seemed to move with intelligence behind it, interact with other objects. This was the most significant thing I have ever seen in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At its brightest point it would reach around A magnitude -1.0 and dim out to where it was not visible. Most of the time it would reach around a magnitude +1.0 . In some cases it would cover areas of around 30-40 arc minutes in a matter of seconds in a jerky motion, at times doing circles and ans S patterns in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My body was facing the Eastern Hemisphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright oval white light seemed to be moving from East to West towards me. Then it rapidly took a turn to the south(right) very quickly as if it was turning on a dime. I saw this object for about 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was definitely some sort of aircraft but I know airplanes and it was no airplane nor was it a star. The object seemed to be no further then 25 miles away and was very large in shape. It was a oval shape and very bright white light. To my guess and I know approximately how fast government aircraft moves and I would to say this object looked to be moving 8,000 to 10,000 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately came inside and wrote down the exact time according to my cell phone and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went to Google and found your site in order to report this.

Also wish to state that I am not drawing conclusions as to what I saw, but I am documenting this so that other witnesses may corroborate with my account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way back to my car after work, I turned my head skyward briefly. The night was a little cloudy but some stars were viewable above me. I focused in on one of the fainter stars (I am not into astronomy – star is a dim orange colour in the high vertical east bound sky of the ACT) and a shooting star happened to fly pass. This did not amaze me much, as I recall seeing what really was a shooting star just a few nights earlier outside my house. What did amaze me is that this object, while appearing to have the same relative looking speed of a shooting star, continued to remain in view without the characteristic fadeout of a shooting star. This suggested to me that the object is upper atmosphere, possibly higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My amazement ended and astonishment began when a second shooting star like object tailed, accelerated and caught up to the original object. The second object moved in on the first object and produced the trajectory of a side-facing parabola – something like stunt pilots would execute. The first object then circled around at a very high speed in a wide arc, but only completed about ninety percent of the circular turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was focusing on the sudden – and frankly mind boggling – acrobatics of the first object, I lost sight of the second. The first object disappeared in its incomplete turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole experience felt like about ten seconds all up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, but I can tell you it was no shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes Canberra has an airport in the vicinity of my eastward vantage, but this event was right above me and these objects were EXTREMLY high. No way it was the air force, balloons etc and I don’t know much about satellites or space stations, but I would guess they don’t move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other likelihood I can think of is very high altitude lightning, asteroid collision or maybe even aurora, but again I know nothing about these subject areas. I also discount the possibility of my tired condition resulting in eye floaters, simply because these were bright objects. To test this, after I arrived home, I tried staring at dark surfaces, but my eyes were not producing any bright artefacts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects in question were just dots but the way they moved! The trajectory crossover and turn did not seem natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone who witnessed this event please confirm. This has certainly messed up my scepticism. I am trying to register an account on the website ATS, but my password doesn’t seem to come through. I will keep trying. This needs to get out hence the email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do however choose to remain anonymous to protect my professional reputation.<n>

In disbelief I did not say anything for a moment, and then I told everyone to look at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boy at the park thought maybe it could be a meteorite, I thought maybe an airplane- but none of us were sure and all thought it was pretty eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming it landed since it was plumating down towards earth, however it was too far away for me to tell if it landed or have a clear perception of its distance.  I lost sight in the trees, but whatever it was it must have been large in size.  For now it is considered a UFO.<n>
7/19/07 13:30|Titusville|FL|Circle|approx. 5 seconds|I saw a moon-sized white glowing circular light divide into two smaller lights as it travelled like a "shooting star" across the sky.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57788.html|178|ndxe200707| I saw a moon-sized white glowing circular light divide into two smaller lights as it travelled like a &#34;shooting star&#34; across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, July 19 at approximately 1:30 a.m. I saw a round white light in the distant sky.  It was a little smaller in size than a full moon.  About half way through the siting, it split into two circles, each about half the size of the original circle.  I saw it/them for approximately five seconds total before I lost sight of them behind a tree.  The trajectory had a slight downward arc as it travelled horizontally across the sky.  I saw it/them travel approximately 15 degrees across the sky horizontally.  It/they were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon vertically.  The light intensity was a little less than a full moon, with a softer glow than the moon has on a clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the impression that the large light was spinning counter-clockwise as it divided in two, like the second circle spun off from the original.  Both smaller circles were the same size.  It/they did not change speed or trajectory during the time I was observing.  After it divided, both smaller circles stayed next to each other horizontally and continued on the same trajectory as the original.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion, it did not behave like a spacecraft.  Except for the splitting, it behaved like a giant &#34;shooting star.&#34;  The dividing process appeared consistent with how a rotating ball of liquid or gas might divide in two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was lightening activity in the sky earlier in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this in Titusville, Florida (northwest of the Kennedy Space Center on the east coast of central Florida).

I was in an isolated area with very little light pollution. The night was very clear and I could see every star in the big dipper constellation, a testament to the clarity of the skies. I was looking Northward when from the right side of my vision (The East), a black, triangular craft with one bright white light, about magnitude 2.0, at each one of the three vertices of the triangle. The craft flew westward with a slight southern turn, it was completely silent throughout the duration of the flight. I observed it fly across the entire sky, from my point of view the object seemed to be two hundred feet long at least. I have taken several astronomy classes and have a background in the physical sciences. I am very skeptical by nature, I am however, unable to explain this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the intersection of  F.M. 249 and Hicks St., I noticed an object flying rather low and at a slow speed.  At first glance it appeared to be a small airplane or maybe a news chopper.  But after a few seconds of observation, I noticed that the brown to rusty colored object was indeed a new sight to me!  We have had rain every day for about two weeks and it was very cloudy, so the object only appeared briefly (about ten seconds) and was gone behind the clouds.  The shape is hard to explain, but for lack of a better term, it resembled an upside down helicopter!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only there was more to it.  A vertical shaft with the lower part of the shaft being slimmer and attached to a horizontal section.  Toward the top of it, there were two more horizontal sections.  One on each side appearing like wings.  Nothing was spinning or making noise or blinking-no lights. Which all contradicts most sightings I have read about in the last day!  It was a brief but exciting experience for me and the first of its’ kind for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have found no way to identify it yet, but I will always remember the way it looked and the movement of this object!  The one other fact the interests me is that the sighting was directly above the Grand Parkway that is being built because it is a huge undertaking that will take years to finish and maybe it was some sort of observation?!  I don’t know, but I have just learned to keep my eye to the sky more often!<n>

M.D.T.<n> <n><n> <n><n> El Paso, Texas  	At approximately 12:45 P.M. local time on July 18, 2007, I was riding my motorcycle north on Hueco Tanks Road in far-east El Paso County, Texas. Visibility was unlimited to the north, ahead of me. The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds visible in that area at all. About forty degrees above the horizon and slightly to my west I saw a flat, disk-shaped object. It appeared to be immobile, and that is what attracted my attention. It was precisely on the glide-path to El Paso International Airport, and at first glance, I assumed it was a traditional aircraft. But after watching it for perhaps five seconds, I decided that that was not the case: it did not appear to be moving, though I cannot swear to that, since I myself was traveling at sixty miles per hour. Its shape—a disk, flat top and bottom and squared off at each end, like three quarters stacked atop one another—precluded the possibility that it was any aircraft with which I am familiar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed this craft for perhaps thirty seconds from this perspective: edge-on. Then a startling thing happened: the craft banked to the left about eighty degrees and presented me with a virtually perfect view of its top surface (or perhaps its bottom surface). Still it did not appear to be moving horizontally. My vision is perfect, conditions were perfect, and I was able to get a crystal-clear sighting of this object. It was delta shaped, coming to a point at one end and flat at the other. It was not an equilateral triangle: the two sides leading to the point were somewhat longer than was the third side, by perhaps twenty-five percent or a third. In simple terms, it looked like an arrowhead. It was metallic, resembling what I can best describe as brushed stainless steel or aluminum. In other words, it was reflective and shiny, but not brilliantly so. There were no indentations or irregularities whatsoever on its perimeter. I saw no ports or evidence of openings of any kind. There was nothing to suggest any leading aerodynamic edges to indicate wings. It was a very simple, delta-shaped object with three flat sides forming its perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Safety dictated that I glance down at the road to make sure I was still in my lane. This consumed only a fraction of a second. When I looked back toward the object, it was gone—just gone. Whether it disappeared or flew away at high speed I cannot say. I heard nothing. One fraction of a second it was there, and the next fraction of a second it was not there. If it did in fact fly away, it must have traveled at immense speed, because I could see for many miles in all directions. I scanned the sky thoroughly for quite some time, until I was convinced it was truly not there. There are some mountains in this area, but they are not large, and the object was far too high in the sky to have been obscured by any of them. That is, in my opinion, simply not a possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object in its banked position for perhaps fifteen seconds. As to its distance from me, that is very hard to say. I would estimate that it consumed three or perhaps four solar diameters from my perspective: similar to holding three stacked quarters between your fingers at arms length. My gut feeling is that it was quite close, because I saw it in such great detail. If it had been far away, atmospheric haze would have obscured some of that detail. I could literally see the degree of polish on its surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This afternoon, 19 July, I called Air Traffic Control at El Paso International Airport. I spoke with an air traffic controller, asking him if anyone had reported anything unusual on radar at the time in question. He told me that no one had submitted a report, but then he went on to virtually confirm my sighting. I made no mention at all of the fact that the object I had seen had disappeared—he mentioned it. He told me that even if someone had seen something, IF IT HAD DISAPPEARED, they probably would have ignored it and not submitted a report. This seems to me to constitute some degree of confirmation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fifty-seven years old, a college instructor of Political Science, and had never before seen anything that I would consider a UFO. Frankly, I did not believe that they existed, though I was intrigued by the evidence. I will admit that since childhood, I have believed that we are not alone in this vast universe. But I never believed that we had been visited. I believe it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was bright enough to stand out greatly against the grey background of high, distant clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was, as best as I can describe, a large disk that was invisible on the top, and radiating a bright, fuzzy white light out of its sides. It was so clear that I didn’t know what to think at first. Then, suddenly, it pretty much disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disappearing part was like an oval of light doing a shrinking iris like at the end of a Looney Tunes cartoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of it was comparable to holding a penny at arms length, or maybe a dime if you have short arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be very high, far away, and very big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t (still don’t) know what to do or what to think or how to feel…I was certainly not a type of person to believe what I saw. Even now my rational self tells me that it had to have been something else… But my eyes and heart tell me that I saw an invisble disk in the sky suddenly fire up it&#39;s engine and take off. I know what I saw, and it was incredible. Unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up and went to my deck door to see the cat and look up at the storm clouds coming in. There was a really dark huge cloud about 75-80 degrees up from my view. I noticed some silvery white orbs things moving around, and at first I thought they were seagulls. As I watched and looked closer there were no wings. There were about 12-15 of them moving around (even thought there was a storm, there was no wind). I looked at the trees to see if they were moving at all and the leaves were not moving. It was a slow moving storm. But the things I saw were moving as if they were floating around dodging each other. Then a few went into the high dark cloud and then the rest did. I watched for 10 more minutes but nothing ever came out. It&#39;s like they all disappeared into the cloud. It was strange and I didn&#39;t tell my husband who was downstairs painting. I was going to yell for him but he wouldn&#39;t have heard me. And I didn&#39;t want to leave and miss out on what I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Roughly 5-7 white pulsing lights in a row, each of which were the same size, and seemed considerably large and bright.

This is a top secret Navy base.(NAWS) Naval Air Weapons Station. Having friends that work on this base doing radar testing and after having a few drinks they started talking about tests they were doing with radar on a silver disc out on echo range. They talked about how this disc was rumored to have seats in it that were too small for a grown man and that it was rigged to be remotely controlled. They told me when and where these tests were happening. As kids we would go for long walks through the desert so I know this area well. The next morning I got up early with my camera and was able to get several clear pictures of this disc being followed by an unmarked helicopter. It was about 20 feet wide and 10 feet high in the center. It would travel slowly with a side to side wobble about 100 yards, maybe 20 yards in the air. It would stop perfectly still and rise about 100 yards into the air then straight back down. It did this over and over until it was out of sight over the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  have had these photos since the summer of 07 and have found it hard to find anyone to take any interest in them.  ??  Maybe you will?  I would really like to send them to someone because I am sure no one has seen anything as clear and in focus as these are.

The object would  pick up speed, and then would start making very tight, perfect spirals  while traveling very fast. In the center of the spiral, this object  came to a complete stop again, turned 90 degrees, and then head east to  west at a slow speed, then disappeared. It did this a few times while I  observed this object for about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was made up of three orange lights that formed a small  triangle. The maneuvers I witnessed were things that I have never seen  before. The high rate of speed, the sudden complete stops, the 90 degree  turns, and the tight, perfect spirals led me to believe that what I saw  was a UFO.<n>

Bare with me, as I am not very good at estimating distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stepping outside of work for a smoke break, I noticed two brightly flashing lights approximately 20 to 25 degrees above my horizon look E-NE.  Both objects appeared approximately two to three miles distant, and approaching me in such a way as to pass to the East of me by maybe a mile.  I watched the lights for approximately 20 to 30 seconds before they passed behind a large tree, blocking my view.  At first I suspected these lights to be aircraft flying to Robins AFB, as both were traveling at a speed that I would estimate to be faster than civilian aircraft or helicopters.  I could detect no sound.  Three things in particular caught my attention enough to question what I was seeing: 1)  The lights of both craft (I am assuming that there were two) appeared to be flying in perfect tandem with each other, not uncommon with military aircraft, with one light trailing the other by perhaps 750 to 1000 feet...far enough to make it too large for both lights to be from any one aircraft I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The lights from both craft, at the distance which I saw them, appeared much larger that typical aircraft lights.  They were approximately the luminosity of aircraft landing lights yet not blinding, and did not appear to shine light in any specific direction.  What I mean by this is it didn&#39;t create any sort of beam of light in the sense that aircraft landing lights do.  The color was a deep red, almost of the sort that you would see on a tall radio tower, but much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  This is the one that got me thinking...both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other.  I would estimate that the light would illuminate for 1-1/2 to 2 seconds, then disappear for the same duration.  When the lights were off, there was no indication of any other wing lights or other illumination.  Both lights blinked in perfect unison with each other for the 20 to 30 seconds that I first saw them, which I thought was unusual, as they did not once get unsychronized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was curious enough to change my vantage point.  I moved to the side parking lot of my office to try to catch another view, and saw an aircraft in the distance probably 4 to 5 miles away, but clearly identifiable as an airplane from the light array.  Thinking that I had just seen an airplane, I began to go back inside,I turned my head and saw both lights again, still blinking in perfect unison.  They were now moving in a southerly direction, and still exhibited no other running lights.  Suddenly, and in tandem, both lights appeared to change direction to the East, and then to the E-NE.  This was a very fluid movement...not sudden, but quickly enough to make me think that it was a very maneuverable jet.  Both lights executed the maneuver without growing closer or further apart from each other, as if was a single craft, yet too far apart to be a single craft.  Also, the lights did not appear to alter position, such as if wings were turning.  They maintained their luminosity throughout the turn...the blinking pattern remaining constant throughout.  I watched this for another 10 -15 seconds before the lights simply vanished.  Interestingly, a second or so after the two unidentified lights changed course, the distant aircraft also changed course, though in a much more leisurely manner, in the general direction of the other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions: Night, with scattered clouds, yet clear enough to see at distance.  The cloud cover appeared to be above the lights at all times.  According to Weather Channel online, visibility is currently 10 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, this is probably just an aircraft sighting, but there were enough curiosities to this incident to report this...if for lack of anything else, just in case someone else reports something.  I&#39;d be curious if anyone else saw this incident.    I am familiar with watching aircraft, day and night, and this was different from any aircraft I have seen.<n>

My best estimate puts the object(s) at around 20,000 feet.  I was able to view the light through a set of binoculars (inexpensive, used primarily at the ball park) at which time I noticed that the light was actually comprised of three glowing lights in a perfect horizontal row.  By the time my fiance looked through the binoculars, she reported seeing four lights, then a brief red dot flashed at one end of the formation.  Immediately thereafter, the lights moved south at what appeared to be high speed, before disappearing.  Neither of us have ever witnessed anything like it, so we wanted to report it to someone who might be more experienced and better-equipped to process the information.  Thank you!<n>

I thought it was a plane at first, but as I paid attention, I realized it was a perfect equilateral triangle dark grey, with one green light at one tip, and white lights at the others. It spun around as it kept flying. It was about as high up as one and a half cell phone towers, and about five times as large as a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a small white dot moving extremely fast. It then slowed almost to a stop then started moving in extreme angles to points in the area it was in. It stopped at each point for a fraction of a second before instantly changing directions and going to another. The speed at which it was moving between points was almost instantaneously. It did this for about 20 seconds staying in the same relative area. Then it started making curving and dipping motions for about 15 seconds before making a 180 degree curve and disappeared. I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/16/07 22:00|North Reading|MA|Changing|2:00|Absolutely no characteristics of any aircraft I have ever seen, or any description availible of a craft on this site.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57714.html|204|ndxe200707| Absolutely no characteristics of any aircraft I have ever seen, or any description availible of a craft on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were on our nightly walk around our neighborhood, clear skies, relatively dark, consellations were very visible, very little light pollution (as the majority of the street lights were not working).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Typically, there are a few commercial airliners passing over per night, very high and easy to recognize, usually off in the distance enough for the sound of the jet engines to be very faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed what we thought initially was an aircraft, flying uncharacteristically low. After a moment, we realized that this aircraft was far too low to be a commercial jet, and the sound it was producing was unlike anything I had heard come out of any aircraft previously. If I had to put words to it, one could compare the sound to a very low pitched buzzing, almost as if the sound, whatever it was, was being projected out of an aluminum garbage can. It was audible, however if a person was inside one of the homes, they would not have been woken up by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise, however, was not the definitive characteristic that really threw us off. The shape and the lighting...primarily where the lights were on the body of the aircraft. There were three lights on the bottom, in a straight line. Two lights, very far apart from one another, on the &#39;front&#39; of the craft, vertically aligned, spread far apart from one another; at first they acted as what seemed to be spotlights, however when the object passed overhead, we realized that the lights were projecting 360 degrees, which seemed downright impossible. There were also lights that strobed around the aircraft, not circular, but more on the lines of a diagonal &#39;connect the dots&#39;. The craft was changing course steadily, however the lights did not move from their original place, making it clear in my mind that this aircraft was moving without banking to make a turn, implying there were no rudders, nor jet propultion required to pilot this aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, visibility of the aircraft was obstructed by trees, allowing us to see the lights only. The aircraft broke off to the right, and left our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/16/07 17:00|Schaumburg area|IL|Rectangle|ten minutes|Vertical rotating rectangle in sky over Chicago|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68578.html|205|ndxe200707| Vertical rotating rectangle in sky over Chicago<n> <n><n> <n><n> In relation to the 2006 Schaumburg, IL sightings, I am quite stunned because I thinkI saw the same aerial phenomenon the following July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving a tradeshow in Chicago in a cab with maybe four other people and a driver. I was next to the driver taking the highway from downtown Chicago to the O’Hare Airport. It was around 5:00 PM, and everyone who was in the cab with me was, like myself, tired and relatively quiet. We had just finished taking our booths down and mostly wanted to just go home to our own cities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in the front passenger seat (we crammed in and split the fare to the airport… very economical…..) and just watched local traffic when off to the north, which was to my right, I spotted something hovering in the sky.  The object may well have been moving slowly or even stationary, and was clearly rotating very slowly, and after a few minutes of mentally triangulating (admittedly not terribly accurate…) I gathered it was approx. one to two miles away, located probably a thousand or so feet in the air, and was solid and dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was blue and calm, with only occasional clouds. Periodically planes could be seen flying, and they were very easy to identify. There was no sign of a balloon supporting this object, nor of a plane pulling it, or for that matter a pole holding it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very curious aspect to me was that the three or four times that it completed a rotation it would be so thin as the edge appeared that it would actually disappear, and then the other side would become visible. It would be like holding up a rectangular piece of cardboard in landscape orientation, but vertical, and rotating it counter-clock-wise. The rectangle had to be at least a few hundred feet long and maybe a hundred feet high, with almost no thickness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seven or eight minutes I remembered I had a digital camera with me and I fished it out of my briefcase. I took a few seconds of video (I accidentally clicked “off” too soon and didn’t realize it…) and the object appears there, but very distant and not clear enough to make any useful analysis of. All it does is confirm to myself that I actually saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the driver asked me what I had been looking at and I told him and the other passengers, but no one else had seen it, and by this point it had faded below the line of site of the buildings and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For my own experience I can&#39;t believe I was so ill-prepared to think to grab the camera when there was a much better shot of it.<n>

He spotted a large, luminous, bright moving object.  It zoomed in one direction and then immediately made a u-turn back towards where it came from, however, it zoomed in a more southward direction.  He frantically called me from my slumber and I stepped out on the balcony and witnessed a very bright light that zoomed to the left.  We did not hear the object make a single noise.  This phenomenon took place for approximately 10-15 seconds.  Although we could not estimate the altitude, it did not seem to be flying very high.  In fact, our view of the object was blocked because of the numerous trees that surround our area.  Although it is more difficult to estimate distance and size at night, the object could not have been far away because the light was very bright and noticeable.  According to my husband, the light mimicked the movement made by a ping-pong ball.  At one point, the light became brighter and after that we lost sight of it. In my opinion, neither a plane nor a helicopter would have been so silent had they been so close. I do not believe that a plane is capable of making such movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be about 50 feet above a street lamp. I was approaching a stop sign which merged onto the highway I needed to drive on. As I came close to the stop sign, the street light suddenly dimmed and went out, as did my car headlights and dash lights. I felt the car was going to stall, but it didn’t. As I turned right, I noticed something to my left, and stopped to investigate. Much to my shock, I saw this object hovering stationary above the street light. I stopped the car, and the craft also stopped, which had begun to move. I began to accelerate and it did the same!  I again stopped my car, and it also stopped….and then began to turn towards me! As I took off in my car, all the street lights and the local motel’s outdoor lights all went out at the same time. I again pulled over, and much to my amazement, all the lights began flickering, and came on again! The craft then took off, heading in a southerly direction. I have just learned that it had been spotted in this area twice since June 2007. Living in the country, and driving alone and encountering this object that late at night really terrified me. This is not my 1st encounter with ufo’s. I had a major sighting in 2005, with 4 other witnesses present. Also summer of 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, in order to reflect a date of July 17.  PD))<n>

It was very bizarre looking; A tiny, tiny speck of brilliant red light traveling across the sky. Is it possible this was a satellite? The intensity of the light was incredible but the object was definitely in space, well above our atmosphere, I am assuming because of its size (it was as small as a pinpoint at arms length) and the time it took to cross the sky (I can only view about 40 degrees of the horizon in my backyard due to the trees and roof of my house) .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking in the sky toward the west, because the previous night I spotted a sateilite flying over the Bremerton, Wa. Shipyard, then over the Bangor, Wa.  Sub-base. Seeing sateilite&#39;s in this area at night is quite common. As I was looking toward the west an object on fire was traveling overhead out of the southeast and traveling on a straight line to the northwest. I could only watch it for 30 seconds in and out of cloud cover until it disappeared into some thick clouds toward the Green Mtn. area of Western Washington State. This all happened at 52 minutes after midnight. I seen no other lights or heard any other noise (like a sonic boom etc.). I&#39;m trying to be complete on what I seen, but due to the cloud cover and the speed of object I seen, I have no idea on the altitude of the object!<n>

It looked like they had lights the shape of a triangle on the, then it would switch to circles, they were strobbing lights almost vilontly.  The objects were either sitting in place or jumping around in an almost zig zag.  Note: there were many airplanes in the sky at this time, it seemed almost as if they were supposed to be a distraction.  Two seperate times i saw a very fast blinking light, both times they disapeared after three blinks, the second time i saw one it didnt travel as far across the sky as the first one, but on the 3rd blink it was fading, then gone.  I have never seen a ufo in my life until last night, and i was almost scared because i saw so many of them on different areas of the sky but they were mainly near jupitor as it glows brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told my other sister to look up. for about 10 mins we seen the lights moving  one behind the other when the frist light drop down and the other one did the same. It was still moving in a stright line but now it was moveing down. for about 3 min when watch it and just as fast as my sister seen it the light when out. To this day we still dont know what we seen that night. It couldnt of been any thing to do with clouds because it was a clear night not a cloud in the sky.

They then moved north about fifty feet very slowly.  They both dissappeared for about two seconds when one suddenly appeared about 100 feet away and about thirty feet high.  It moved to the west at about 10 miles per hour staying at about thirty feet.  It continued west, passing my position by about 50 feet.  It was white, about baseball sized and glowed an even white color.  There was no halo nor spikes of light around it.  I went behind a tree and was gone.  I felt unusually calm during the event, with no feelings of fear.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a green color unlike any I&#39;ve ever seen.  We both saw it and were afraid to say anything right away cause of almost shock.  We both looked at eachother and said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  We both said what we saw and talked about how fast it flew.  There was no possible way it was an aircraft of known nature cause of how fast it flew.  Very strange.  Never saw anything like it.

I mentioned it to my wife and she looked up and she saw what I saw.  What appeared to be two Sat’s moving in the same direction and very close to each other.  She turned away and just said, &#34;What a coincidence that has to be a million to one chance to see that in the sky.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch and noticed that both of them stopped at the same time and same spot in the sky side by side.  They stayed in that position for about a minute or longer. They didn&#39;t drift the entire time I was watching. They appeared to be fixed in one position together.  They had the same brightness of orbiting Sat’s, no blinking lights or changing colors.  I said to my wife, &#34;Lookup the two Sat’s have stopped.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked up just in time to see one of them shoot off into space in a blink of an eye.  There was no streak of light like a meteor entering our atmosphere just a bright ball heading off in to the darkness of space.  The other Sat resumed on its original course from the Northwest to the Southeast.  I have seen a lot of Sat’s in my day but I would have to be hard pressed to say that those two bright balls of light were your average Sat’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are your average people, I believe that there is something out there my wife does not.  But she was shocked at what we saw that night.<n>

I went outside the house to the front yard and grabbed a plastic chair to sit on the driveway.  I sat down and looked at the stars by tilting my head back and resting it on the chair back support.  I kept hearing a buzzing sound (like a floresant light).  I tried to ignore it, but I was angry so I turned my head with annoyance to my right where the noise was coming from.  Thinking it was the street light to be at fault.  I saw hovering  above the light where the next neighbor lived a big black triangle craft.  It had three orange/reddish lights.  One at each corner.  It was just hovering like searching making that buzzing voice.  I got up from my chair really fast and went inside the house.  A minute later I went out to look, but it wasn&#39;t there.  I looked around to find it and saw three red lights on the sky by the butte mountains.  Then one flew fast like a comet then the second followed and finally the! last remaining. It seemed to dive down and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My brother, his son, my daughter and I were waiting for the crowds to clear so we could leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sun was setting in the west, I noticed a shiny light at a high altitude tracking directly toward us.  I am an retired USAF and current airline pilot.  I thought that it was the sun reflecting off of a airplane cruising eastward.  I pointed it out to my group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got overhead, I could not make out the shape of an airplane.  Instead what we all saw appeared to be three round objects randomly circling each other as they progressed eastward.  When they got overhead and the reflected light no longer reached us, the object(s) disappeared.  No contrail was present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, &#34;Hey look, it&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  But deep down, I really thought it was possibly a satellite or the ISS in orbit.  I&#39;ve tried to find historic data on satellite orbit tracks to determine if that was the case.  I haven&#39;t had any luck so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;ve read more on the subject of spheres, it appears that it may have not been a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now I&#39;m reporting it.<n>

So I looked up to see what kind it was. It looked like a news helicopter panted solid black.  It was about 3 telephone poles high. After it past I saw a white light a little lower coming towards me.  Then it curved changed to red and went away from me. It was doing an oval pattern.  It was white coming towards me and red going away from me.  It was probably moving at 30 mph and covered half the length of the block but only as wide as the alley.  It made 4 passes the first three it would get a little closer each time. Then the last and fourth pass it made was right over my head.  It paused there over me for about 2 seconds. As I looked right up at it, it wasn&#39;t white or red anymore but a ball of glittering lights.  It was about the sizes of a beach ball.  Then as it went away again it turn red continued down the alley a! little farther this time.  Here is where I got goose bumps and chills.  Instead of coming back it went down and to the right so fast it left a red streak of light in the sky.  It stopped there on a dime for 1 second and changed to a bright white light.  Then it shot up and to the left so fast it left another long red streak of light in the sky and was gone.  The whole time I was watching this ball of light change colors it never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The time listed is exact.  Weather was sunny with some clouds. While waiting for golfers in front of us, and watching golfers behind us shoot to the green we noticed a dark, oval object in the sky. The color was nearly black with a tint of brown, no lights and no reflection from the sun.  The object was a good distance to us, fairly high in the sky. It was completely circular with no apparent wings or propulsion. We saw several low flying Jetliners from Logan Airport afterwards, and this object was much higher. It moved at a constant speed, remaining at the same altitude the entire time it was visible. I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone but I am sadly not well versed in using that feature. We pointed the object out to the golfers behind us on Hole 2, whom were just as mystified as ourselves. The object seemed to be more over northwest Melrose and Wakefield as Hole 3 runs south by southwest (I Believe per google maps), and we overlooked hole 2 to view the object. We lost sight of the object after 2 minutes behind a cloud. After seeing so many planes that day at different altitudes from just taking off to extremely high (35,000 FT), we both could tell this was no aircraft. The first debunking ideas after viewing the object that came to my mind were the following: Dark colored balloon, Blimp or or kite. I can rule out the blimp, as we saw the Hood Blimp returning from Boston from the Red Sox game that afternoon fly over us later that evening. The balloon is possible, but what is difficult is that a balloon would wobble with wind. This object stayed on-course and was unwaivering steady in its course of movement. Finally the kite theory is hard because it traveled such a distance (at least a mile) while we were viewing it.

The sun was already pre-setting. Me, my mother, and sister were outside enjoying the afternoon, we live on a lake and we had a long dock to go with it. My mother and sister, were in front of the house as I started jogging down a hill towards my dock. I happened to look in the sky and I saw a very bright circular light with a tail. Now I know what a comet looks like, and this was something I never seen before, I stopped dead in my tracks and gazed at the light. It started to go out of my view, I ran to the end of my dock and it was still their, this light looked as if traveled very slowly as if a airplane high off the ground and it made no noise. But I assumed the light was about 5,000 ft. in the air, the light looked like it had a high force of light, almost like a car light 150 yards away in the dark. I yelled at my family to come and see this but as soon as I turned around the light vanished and was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked closely as I moved my binoculars to keep up with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was small and white and I could almost see the back end of it.  It was not a commercial airline or small plane.  It was too fast to even be a military jet.  I&#39;ve been to the air shows and never seen anything moving that fast.  So I thought maybe I was seeing things. Out of curiosity. I&#39;ve decided to look around the same clouds again.  And about 3 minutes later, the same type of craft, except this time it changed directions several times and seemed to be swimming through the air like a dolphin would in water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This small air vehicle had no markings, it was all white from what I could tell. The shape was like a very smooth half cirle and flat back end.(assuming that was the back end) I did manage to see one hole(maybe two) on the back underside.  There was no bright lights from what I could tell because it was in the middle of the afternoon.  It seemed to be cloud hopping as if to take cover.  No sound at all from what I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have proof or photos, this is just a report I thought I should add.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The spheres were all half white and red in color, and I then climbed down asap and grabbed my 70mm binoculars from my room as my friend tracked it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both took turns looking at this object up close as it slowly gained altitude and slowly went out of sight due to haze and it&#39;s distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know that this object to me sounds like maybe it could have been a civilian or military weather balloon and radiosond but there are no military bases near my local and the nearest weather radar station is 25 miles away to the north.  It&#39;s altitude was only between 700-1000 feet as it passed very slowly above my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in July 2007 is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 400 ft. high, moving very slow approx. 15mph.It made no sound, no lights, held steady speed over our house.  I asked my daughter if she saw it too, and she said yes, dad what is that.  Ship had a lot of detail similar to movie starships, but all in white lines only. Would wild guess size, at 1000 to 1500 ft. long, and around 600 ft. wide.  It took about 1 min. to go over our house and was gone.

It was a beautiful summer afternoon, with a clear blue sky.  Around 12:20 PM CDT and approximately 5-10 miles before I reached Ottawa, KS, I looked out my front window towards the right (which I believe was a N/NW direction) and saw a large, shiny spherical object hovering in the sky for about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a very good look at it, as it appeared to be extremely close.   It was a bright metallic white/silver color.  It looked like a quarter or half-dollar stretched out at arm’s length to the sky.  The object was tilted and slowly continued to tilt until it looked like a grey sliver in the sky (like looking at the edge of a quarter against the sky).   After about 2-3 seconds it completely vanished.  I immediately pulled the car over to the side of the highway to look around the sky.   There was nothing at all.  No smoke, streaks, or trails.  I continued to look around for about two minutes and did not see any moving objects in the sky whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving along somewhat like a glider.  As it got closer a tree was blocking my vision so I stood up to watch when it passed the tree into my view again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it slowly came down and towards me.  It stopped right in front of my lani screen.  I walked a few steps closer and it moved back a few feet.  It was a dark night and I could see nothing but the two lights on each side, at that point about 4 feet apart.  No beams at all, something like a two flashlights and the batteries getting low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped back and it again moved up to the lanai screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I was frightened, went into my house and closed the sliding glass doors and blinds.

However, we could recall it moving sideways for it quick duration. Not two minutes later it passed again, but this time we were looking in the general direction from having interest. Again lasting only a second, it was very far away and was seemingly very large, or was extremely bright. We could both describe it as if someone was shining a flashlight on the clouds, except there were no clouds, which left us obviously baffled at what we just saw. I will honestly say that I don&#39;t know for sure whether or not it was extraterrestrial, or maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, which I could believe both to be possible scenarios.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was higher than air traffic in this area, but lower than the stars. Pace was constant and trajectory was smooth with no deviation. No trail. I had woken up from a dream involving the mountains and went outside to journal my dream. I had been looking at the night sky (dusting of clouds and stars) and then began writing. The star I had noticed a moment before started moving as described. I was startled and thought, &#34;Oh, that wasn&#39;t a star, but how did I miss that?&#34;. Then I just watched it thinking, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen a plane move in that direction, nor travel in that direction.&#34; I strained to listen for sound, but it was completely silent.

This is the best way to describe the color...I have never seen anything so bright in my life.  In fact it was so bright that I saw it coming behind the garage before we could actually see it.  I said what is that and then all the sudden we saw the fireball.  We live in a less poulated area so it is dark at night time.  It was the weirdest thing that I think I have ever felt and the coolest thing I have ever seen.  I kept saying did you see that?  Finally my husband said yes.  We just thought it was a weird metor or something.  We were kind of embarrased to tell anyone.

Red-orange light globes slowly crossed the sky, coming over the horizon in the West and travelling SSE.The lights did not give the impression of flickering (not even atmospheric) and were of identical size. The travelling speed could have only seemed slow due to the distance and taking into account a possible upword movement. On first sighting, the globes seemed close together, but crossing the sky it appearded to be a loose formation, 4-5 moving ahead, a middle field consisting of 8-10 lights, and 2 more far back. Towards the end of the spectacle, the first 4-5 seemed to be above a strip of clouds high up, because they were partly hidden by it, then reappeared; while the last two were just below a strip of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light intensity did not seem to fade because they &#34;winked&#34; out, but faded rather because of putting distance between them &amp; us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took some pics, but they&#39;re not good enough to make out more than a few points of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 50 metres and I took some pictures of near church. Everything seemed to be fine, until I put all the pictures to the computer, and when I was watching it I saw somethnig strange on the photo on the sky. After few seconds I recognized an UFO. It&#39;s not a some kind of trick photo. I am photographer amateur. Maybe I made some mistake but if you want so I will send you the photo.<n>

We stopped the car there was no sound. Another car stopped and said &#39;what on earth was that?&#39; We could think of no explanation.The event lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object flew in a circle for 10 or so minutes.  Object then nose dived to a lower altitude.  Flew in circles for a little while longer at the lower altitude then dove out of sight.  The object seemed to have circular blue lights.  It seemed as if the lights were on the bottom.  When object was diving lights were a straight line.  Object moved fairly quickly but still appeared to follow normal propulsion physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew, slowly east, then arched west (turning to my left).  Then, as if someone flicked a switch, it disappeared.  There were no flashing lights like an airplane.  And it seemed like it was too far up in the sky to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The plane then turned off the path.   The object was a bright light flickering at times and white and green.  It was probably about two times the size of the brightest star I have seen.  It flickered like a sparkler does.  I ran into the house and called my daughter and wife out to observe, and it was still there.  The object was very slowly traveling north in a random zig zag pattern and at times appeared to be hanging in the sky.  During the time I watched, the object seemed to drop something.  It was like bits of red fire.  After about a minute or two it had a speed burst and then was totally gone.   I have never seen anything like this in my 47 years.  I still have no clue as to what it was, but I know it was nothing I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The tail kept varying in length and would sometimes include blue and red lights that appeared farther back from the white light tails. There were times the UFO appeared to have no lights on at all but would then start in again with the streaming tail of white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted for about four minutes, and was witnessed by four people. The object made various movements in a fairly small area in the sky. It moved in mostly circular motions including figure eights, dropping, and rising at steep angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object finally disappeared below the tree line and I didn’t see it reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers of this sighting were two inspectors, one who worked for a city public works department, and one who works for tri-county air quality control and their two wives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It moved in many directions and speeds.  It would stop for a couple minutes in one place and then move on in a different direction.  It made 3 tight circular manuvers and during one of these turns it emmited what looked like 3 or 4 flaires evenly spaced that only burned for a short time duration. There were no sounds.  It looked as though it was extremely high in the atmosphere.  I do not know if the light was emmited form the object or if it was the suns reflection off of the object.  It stayed in a relativly small area of the sky.  At times the view was obstructed by a thin layer of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no moon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound was heard.  It was visible for only a couple of seconds and disappeared behind Slate Point. Object was very bright.  We are not sure if there was a fiery tail or if  it was only the illusion of one as the object was visible for such a short period of time and was moving so fast.<n>

I saw a silver looking object that seemed to cast a triangular or star happed reflection. It floated motionless for about 30 second then disappeared completely.  I was very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what this object was but I have never seen anything in my life like this.<n>

I kept looking at the area of the roofline as she went inside the garage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking my eyes caught a round, clear sphere that was up in the sky at a very high altitude and moving east at a very great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved my eyes back and forth because I thought it was a spot in my vitreous fluid within my eyeballs. The vitreous fluid sloshed back and forth with the movement of my eyes and the object I saw kept moving in one direction, so I knew it was not the fluid in my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then screamed out to my wife to see this fast moving object and she ran over but the trees were now blocking my/our view and then clouds were as well. She did not see the object, but she knew by my demeanor and the hair standing up on my whole body that I did see “something.” It was perfectly round, white or clear in :color&#34; and moved faster than anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife it looked as high in the sky as when the news crews are just being able to get a clear view of the space shuttle entering the atmosphere as it is being televised for the news casts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can also say that it looked like a bubble, like when a kid blows bubbles and they move real fast when a breeze catches them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got on the Internet and hoped for a posting by anyone else that may have seen it and found this sight and thank you for letting me report my sighting.<n>

Startled my wife and daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object from my angle appeared like a pyramid shaped craft.  It appeared as if it was a stealth bomber.  I told my wife and daughter that it was a stealth bomber but to be honest once I looked at some of the pictures of a stealth bomber this craft was much bigger.  Also the bottom of it looke thicker since it flew right over us at a very low altitude.  It continued in an East direction and seemed to go further up as it continued in that direction.  I was not aware of any shows in the area, and most people in my area rarely pay attention to these things let alone reporting it.  I would not be surprised if I am the only one reporting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every 5 minutes a new one would appear. I saw one go over the sky at a slow speed - 5 minutes later I saw another one moving at same speed. 5 minutes later I saw another one on other side of sky this time moving still the same speed. 5 minutes later I see another one back in the same place I saw the first 2. 5 minutes later this time one going superfast me and my witness saw all 5 of them. Then it started to turn slighly cloudy. I was amazed of what I saw. Must of been all satalites maybe. Kinda reminded me of 4 crafts looking for something while i was seeing flashes in background like as if an alien was trying to signal the lights in the sky with some kinda flsh. Then the 5 light seemed to me to be like a Police ufo when it went full speed. I was laughing saying I bet cops in space is whats going on right now and they can&#39;t find the alien flashed I think a blue light on earth soil not to far from where i was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I looked up in the sky (higher than many of the clouds) and saw a bright light that was flashing green and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and got binoculars in order to get a closer look.  It appeared to have 2 green lights on the bottom, one green light on the top and a red light circling around in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it in one spot for about one hour when it started to fade away and within 2-3 minutes it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no idea what we saw.  Definitely was not a plane or helicopter because it didn&#39;t move for 1 hour.  Not a tower because it was over the Gulf of Mexico and I don&#39;t think it was a satellite, because it was flashing distinct red and green lights and I do not believe satellites look like that in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone happen to see this recently as well?<n>
7/14/07 01:19|Madison|WI|Formation|4 seconds|Four orange objects in formation followed by another.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57716.html|254|ndxe200707| Four orange objects in formation followed by another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out at night and looked up, and I saw four uniformly lit orangish lights in formation accelerating westwards, and then another slightly larger light to the north following it.  The objects were appoximately egg-shaped, although it was hard to tell because of their speed, and their brightness was approximately one-third of the moon.  They were about a third of the size of the moon, and the four were in a paralellogram formation, with the long ends facing east to west.  They resembled fighter planes flying in formation because of the relative movement to each other when they traveled, but the accelerated so quickly that no plane could ever go this fast.  The formation was about two times as long as the moon, and about one moon or less wide.  The objects were silent and appeared to be at a very high altitude, yet they accelerated very quickly and uniformly.  As soon as I looked up they began accelerating and in about 2 seconds they went from directly overhead to close to the horizon and out of sight.  A second later the other object to the north followed with the same acceleration and speed.  This other object seemed to take off from kind of a small curve, and then it followed a straight line.  The sky was completely clear so I know these couldn&#39;t have been reflections.  I know what meteors look like and I am certain these were not them.  Also, I have seen some of the fastest planes in the world flying overhead at low altitudes, and they were nowhere near as fast as the objects I saw on this night.  Furthermore, I saw almost exactly the same thing in the same city approximately eight or nine years ago and remember it vividly.  I figured since I saw the same thing again I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was pitch black and many stars could be seen, including many high flying airplanes heading for Europe in the same path continuously.  However, towards the Northeast I saw a bright light, about as bright as a light from a lighthouse if it were a mile away, about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Now, there is a small airport with a light in that direction as well, but it was clearly distinguishable that this was not the airport light.  The light, which glimmered, traveled further to the East in a direction away from us.  I mentioned it to my father, who saw it for himself and admitted that he did not think it was an airplane.  The craft would move up and down about 5 degrees while moving towards the East.  The craft did this about five times while we watched it.  The color was an orange that changed slightly to a blue and red as it moved across the sky.  The object disappeared when it dove towards the horizon quickly and faded as it dropped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it must have been a meteor or something along that line.  So I jumped out of my chair and ran to the door to observe it.  On the way I grabbed my camera.  When  I opened the screen door I got a much better look at the object.  It appeared to be a cylinder shape  of transparent orange light.  The cylinder seemed to be in some kind of craft, which was heading from the east to the west (Lk.St.Clair).  It appeared as though someone was directing the light, like it was looking for something.  It was about a thousand feet high, and absolutley silent.  There were no other lights on the craft, and no way to see the shape of the craft. So I snaped off a photo.  As soon as the flash went off, the orange light moved like it was looking in my direction.  Kinda like someone moving a beam of light accross your eyes.  I got a bit nervous and jumped back inside the house.  But then I thoght I was being a bit silly and steped back out and took another photo.  By that time it was getting too far away to get a good photo, but I did get two photos of the orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw &#34;the sky&#34; moving, at least that&#39;s what it looked like for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to the side of the road and we got out of the car.  At first it looked like some lights flying in the same direction but then i realized that a lot of stars were not visible and then visible...something HUGE was flying back and forth across the sky, it was blocking out HUGE swaths of stars at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed there were 2 of them!  Triangular in shape, we could see the &#34;nose&#34; lights of each and they had lights on the ends of the &#34;wings&#34;.  I can&#39;t describe to you how incredibly huge these were.  The ship that was in the lead position was larger than the one behind, but not that much bigger, just a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them fly left to right, back and forth for about 10 or more minutes and basically we couldnt believe what we were seeing.  I went back to the car to turn on the radio to see if anyone was reporting on this, but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and kept driving even though the ships were still there and flying.  I stopped watching them since i had to drive, but my wife kept looking.  Then she says &#34;oh my god&#34;.  I am like, &#34;what?&#34;   She says &#34;a bluish-white light just appeared in the sky and they (the ships) vanished&#34;.  I was like &#34;no way&#34;...and i looked where they had been and sure enough, they were gone, just starry sky was there.  Weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we kept driving.  About maybe 5 minutes or so later my wife says &#34;there they are again&#34;.  I was like &#34;jesus...what the hell&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i stopped again and we got out to see.  Once again the 2 big triangle ships were blotting out most of the sky but this time some kind of orange colored orbs were WAY up in the sky and floating in mid air.  They pulsed in color, yellowish orange, and there were 4 of them spaced out (i could not say how far because i had no spacial references).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, one of them dropped down lower than the others and appeared to be getting larger, and indeed it was rapidly coming closer to where we were even though it had to still be miles away.  We had our dog with us and he was barking and seemed pretty nervous at this point and i really didnt know what to do.  I thought maybe we should go back to the car but we just kind of decided to stay on the road and watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped probably a mile (guessing) from us and was very very low to the ground. Then it hovered a while and went back the way that it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then (sorry this story is so long) we were about to get back in the car when we heard a plane coming from behind us (northeast) and it was moving so fast it had to be a fighter jet, we could see the lights on the plane also even though it was pretty high up in the sky.  It was flying super fast towards! the glowing light orbs and the big triangle ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The damnedest thing, we saw the plane fly (from our vantage point) right close to one of the orb things and the plane blew up.  We saw it explode and drop out of the sky in flames but there was no noise, although it was far away and we thought maybe thats why we couldnt hear it explode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So at this point i am thinking that there is NO way that we are the only ones seeing this whole thing unfold, so again i check all the radio stations but still nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were trying to decide if we should keep driving south towards phoenix or stay away...and we decided to keep going.  As we got closer and closer to the city, the lights of the city made it impossible to see anything anymore and that was it.

They moved toward the West, then dissappeared. The lights did not blink but moved at a steady pace. Then, about 5 minutes later, I spotted a single orange light moving in the same direction as the previous lights. As it moved West, it disappeared. Very strange and startled all of us who witnessed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/13/07 21:40|Columbia|MO|Light|2 min|A bright object was seen moving across the sky, north to south.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63024.html|260|ndxe200707| We were sitting at an outdoor table, looking East, and  counting the Stars and Planets as they came out. Venus(?) was at 1:30 with another  planet below it to the right. A star was at 11:00 and some below it. I counted a total 8 objects in the sky at this time. A bright object was seen moving across the sky, north to south. Roy went in to get binoculars for me, at about Venus it turned around and came back, South to North-NE. I was able to see it with the binoculars as it passed the star at 11:00. It was a steady bright light, not flashing. It was very high in the sky. At this time 2 airplanes came from the North, lights flashing and turned East. One was close behind the other. This gave me an opportunity to judge the speed of the UFO.  I do not know, but I would guess it was moving 10-20 times faster. I looked like a big meteor, but had no tail. Did anyone else see this object??<n>
7/13/07 21:33|St. Louis|MO|Triangle|6 minutes|THe ufo was a triangle and it tryed to abduct me and it happend before 8 years ago. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57650.html|261|ndxe200707| THe ufo was a triangle and it tryed to abduct me and it happend before 8 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared at 21:33 left at 21:39 and then returned exactly one hour later and left exactly one hour after the last time it left. It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek. The weirdest part of the experience is the effect it had on my 5 cats. All five cats came into the room I was in. I even had one locked in my room and it opened the door to get out there. The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours. It happened at dark and the lights of the craft were the only things that could easily be seen. It was spinning clockwise the entire time and when it was hovering over the house. I tried to go outside but my cats would not let me. It came back an hour latter and the! same re sults with electrical devices were happening. I was on the phone with my girlfriend and it went static, I went out to the room and I saw the ufo coming from northwest going southwest towards my house it looked like it was going to collide and then it went invisible and the cats started hissing at something I could not even see in the room. There was a constant humming sound in the room until the cats hissed then it went away again and did not come back. This happened before in September 8 years ago on the 23. The same thing happened then. That was when I was 8 years old, half my life in the past. I think they were going to try and take me.<n>

From my vantage point it was slighlty above a whispy thin cloud.  As the object moved around it would change from the same color as the cloud below (which was white) to a dark gray (looked like a storm cloud color), but remained mostly white during the 2 min.  After about a minute and a half of watching this object and trying to make sense of what it might be another object, the same size but slightly grayer color came out of the cloud that the original object was floating over.  They both continued to move left and right and up and down for a few seconds and then they headed South over the Wasatch Mountains behind a tree in my view and I couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  All I know is my burgers were burnt and my Wife, my Best Friend and I could not believe what we were seeing and I have spent all night looking for some explaination of waht we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Over a huge lake, I saw bright orange light flash. It quickly went out and a second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth light soon flashed consecutively. The lights moved from about a 7:00 position to 1:00 position diagonally. There were either 6 separate lights, or one light that blinked or left a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights were the same small orange light. The six lights lasted about 2 seconds.  Then about 2 seconds later, I saw six lights again do the same exact thing in the same pattern about 10 miles away from the lake over the city.  After this set of 6 lights, I did not see it again. It was obviously not an airplane because it was moving extremely fast and went in a diagonal line from bottom-left to bottom-right.<n>

I was on the phone with a relative who was 5 miles away telling him about it on my cell phone, the phone was making weird noises and the screen was static, and the radio in my bedroom was going rampid and alot of static and what sounded like the russian language being chirped (like a bird would try to communicate in russian). THe thing hovered over and then all the electrical devices in my house were fine. My camera was experiencing static but there was a light shade of a humanoid in the background of it in static like an old black in white tv having bad reception.

What really caught my attention was that this particular object had no vapor trails, every other plane I had seen that afternoon had a vapor trail and I could tell that they were planes, no matter the altitude. The object was also moving considerably faster than the planes I had observed before.  So, I continued to watch it cross the sky when all of the sudden it just took off going north, I could not believe my eyes, what I saw is totally unexplainable.  I have been watching the skies for the past two days in hopes to maybe come up with an explanation, but haven’t been able to… (The weather the past three days has been beautiful, clear blue skies, very few clouds.)<n>

As we got a closer look we saw flashing red lights and we realized they were moving foward, in our direction. Then one of them started flying towards our left. The lights were much brighter than an airplane, and they were lower than an airplane would fly and they also made a loud humming sound, much unlike an airplane. After about a minute or two the next one followed the same pattern and flew off to the left, the other two had stopped and were once again stationary. A few minutes later the third one also flew off to our left. We got a better look at it and we saw yellow, blue and red lights flashing. in the shape not similar to an airplane. The last one however started moving forward again and this one came close to us. We did not have the nerve to stay outside by the time it got very close. Neither of us have ever believed in such things occuring and I know that if I was reading this I wouldn&#39;t believe the story. But it was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear evening I was with my father and my husband having a beach fire.  They where facing inland and I was facing the water.  I was looking at my father who was standing to my left when I noticed what looked like “shooting stars” traveling northbound in the sky.  I started to watch and when I realized that it was three sharp bright lights traveling in formation swiftly I said “what the ---- is that?” my husband turned just as I watched them traveling behind his head.  We both said ‘oh my god’ and then at that moment the lights seemed to just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of lights in the sky where shaped like a triangle on its side.  Each of the three lights where the points of the triangle.  They stayed completely uniformed and traveled in a straight path from south to north as if following the coastline.  There where no sounds and the lights where sharp.  I watched the lights for about 10 seconds but I have never seen anything like that in my life!   I am so glad that my husband saw too but he only was watching for about half of the time I did.  It was breathtaking and scary and amazing all at the same time.  Also aprox. at 3:30am there was an orange/pink light glowing on the western horizon over the ocean that lasted for at least a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned my head and quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t a meteor as there was no tail or burn-out.  My next thought was that it was a satelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately realized that what I was looking at was too bright, travelling far too fast and too low to be a satelite.  I saw 3 bright white  orbs flying quickly and silently in unison across the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved southwest to northeast and left no tail in their wake.  Immediately after they went by I heard 3 faint clicks that sounded like electricity crackle and then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never in my life seen anything move so fast or so quietly through the sky.

7/12/07 22:00|Gresham|OR|Light|over hour|Strange light  attracting smaller lights of eradict movements during lighting and thunder storm sky empty of  commercial aircraft|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57632.html|274|ndxe200707| Strange light  attracting smaller lights of eradict movements during lighting and thunder storm sky empty of  commercial aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 22:00 here in Gresham, Oregon we experienced a lighting and thunder storm, it began approximately around 21:00. This storm was announced in the morning news to be headed into the coastal regions from the pacific ocean and perhaps would reach Portland in the evening. Me and my boyfriend had just finished watching a movie and we decided to go outside and watch the lighting for a moment. Thunder was also heard after the lighting. As we watched the lighting our attention became focused to the southeastern sky where we could view the brightest lighting strikes. To right of these strikes was what we believed to be a bright star, however while viewing this lighting we noticed that this bright star began to bob up and down,move quickly to the right of the lighting away from the eastern sky and towards the southern. We live in close proximity of the flight path of commercial airliners heading for landing at the pdx airport. Suddenly many planes headed for landing,these planes were only about 5 to 8 minutes apart. Thinking this was due to the storm we continued to watch the sky for more incoming planes. We however not only viewed more planes, but more smaller lights we had previously supposed as fixed stars dart around the night sky. We kept our attention focused on the first bright object. My boyfriend said that he could see the smaller objects heading in collision with the bright object, i could not see this because my eyes are not as sharp, however upon looking through some binoculars i viewed smaller objects flying eradically around the larger one and then quickly disappearing as if going inside the large one. The large Object remained the same size while this continued. Alarmed, but curious we continued to observe this unsual sight, the lighting and quickly descending commercial aircraft. After about half an hour the sky became clear of aircraft. The lighting continued to flash all around, but its main focus point was still in the southeast and close to the object, it was very bright l! ighting seeming to be concentrated in this area. There were no sounds of thunder with this lighting in the southeast and it seemed to hit the same spot over and over, i realized this because it was in between two trees of our neighborhood each time. This seemed very strange to me because i&#39;ve never seen lighting crash over and over again in almost exactly the same spot. The behavior of the smaller objects continued on their path towards the brighter one. The brighter object remained stationary in the south. Clear of aircraft we witnessed a military fighter jet appear from the east where the commercial aircraft came from. I am not sure the exact model of the jet but i know the difference between planes and jets. this jet turned towards the south and flew under the bright object. The ufo did not move what so ever and we got the impression that it was much to high for the jet to even come close to reaching. The jet flew under the ufo and then turned northwestern towards the airport or north of it. We viewed another jet plane a couple minutes after this come from the northwestern sky and do a similar flight pattern under the ufo in the south, i dont believe this was the same jet turning around but i can&#39;t be sure. Clouds began to block our view of the ufo for several minutes, but between the breaks of cloud cover we viewed it continuing to do the same behavior of assimulating these smaller objects. I don&#39;t know the number of these smaller ufos but the night sky seemed to be teeming with them. Neither me nor my boyfriend have ever witnessed a sight so marveling and transfixing. He used to work at the pdx airport and said he never seen anything even remotely close to the way this object behaved. The sky after about an hour was still void of commercial aircraft. The clouds blocked our view for some time and the lighting died away. After about another 30 minutes the sky began to clear in the south and the object was gone. Still the sky was quiet of aircraft. After about 10 to 15 minutes we finally viewed a plane in the ! sky comi ng from the south turning east and then west towards pdx, and then another from the east. They were in no hurry like the previous ones, and soon the flight path resumed to normal with planes. Id just like our report to be known and documented to see if anyone else in Oregon witnessed this in the sky while watching this thunder and lighting storm. We&#39;ve never seen anything like this ever before in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD))<n>

Totally motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My twenty year old daughter and I were driving about fifty miles per hour when I looked up to my left into the sky and saw something hanging there motionless.  It was about one-hundred feet in the sky.  It was totally still, and as we got closer I told my daughter to look.  What is that, I said?  She goes, I don&#39;t know..that&#39;s weird.  As we got closer to what was just hanging there in the sky, it almost looked like a bird&#39;s nest or a bunch of branches together kind of in the shape of a cigar.  Nothing was around it, nothing could have been holding it up in the sky.  I had never seen anything like it before.  This was halfway between Mcminnville Oregon and Carlton out in the country.  There was no wind at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They explained that the disk shaped object was spinning around and was tilted slightly at an angle above this house. The object did not make any noise. My daughter told me that they kept walking and pretty soon, because of the trees they were unable to see it anymore and got scared and ran home. The object was low enough to the house that the trees as they passed by covered it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw what looked like a low flying plane and thought &#34;that plane is going to crash.&#34;  I went to get my binoculars woke my husband to see this with me. We looked out and there was this weird looking &#34;thing&#34;  didn&#39;t really have a shape, it looked like a long line and had three lights on it.  A red light, a green light and a bluish/white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It zipped behind a tree and kind of just hovered there, then a round white light came off it and flew back and forth between the trees and it kept flashing, almost like it was taking pictures.  After it flew back and forth, it then went up and down and then returned to the bigger ship (for lack of better words).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the big ship slowing flew out of the tree and flew into the next tree and once again just sort of hovered while the white light flew out again and did the same pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it flew to the third tree and once again the same thing happened.  I couldn&#39;t focus on the big &#34;ship&#34; because it was covered by the tree, but I could still see the flashing lights.  The little one that flew back and forth looked like a perfectly round ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after the third trip,  It hovered in the third tree for a bit and then the street lights that were around that tree got very dim, and this ship kind of took off really fast - went across the sky - not up or anything.  And once it drove away, the street lights came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Colors were red, blue, green, yellow and orange.  While it appeared to be stationary over the two hour period it actually gradually dropped from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  I thought it might be a satellite but after checking the orbit speeds and trajectories of the Hubbell satellite and the International space station, it was easy to rule them out.  I also checked &#34;stationary&#34; weather satellites speeds and orbit and ruled them out.  Whatever this was, it had to be outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere and did not appear to be orbitting the earth.  I have never seen a celestial body that had distinquisable lights rotating around it like this object.  If you know what it is, can you tell me?  I have attached 3 photos I took of it with an inexpensive digital camera shooting into the eyepiece of a $100 telescope.  The photos a a bit blurred and the light streaking due to vibration of the telescope.  But at least you can see that there IS Something there and that the colors described a true.  These photos were taken at about 2 am over a 15 minute period.  The two of us watched this object for about 2 hours from 12:30 am to 2:30 am before going to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will be looking for it again tonight.  See Photos attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially we believed them to be moose or bear, but we were unable to discern the shape of their bodies, and they were soon joined by two more observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This had been quite an unsettling experience, however, we are each educated and not one a believer in, I guess others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, shortly the aura borealis spanned the northern sky in a manner I have not seen since childhood (can someone confirm this? and is there any association?) and there was an amber light at an in determinant distance which was impossibly of terrestrial origin.   Almost immediately, it was joined by a second and the lights commenced in a searching pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were quite alone and very concerned for our safety.  We immediately stopped all our light and attempted to calm one of our party members, since it seemed that it would be impossible to escape the searching lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked each of the party the next day to insure there were no marks that hadn&#39;t been previously.  I can&#39;t say any of us believe in UFOs, but really we just want to know if any one else experienced or saw anything strange on July 11th around Rogers Pass, MT.<n>

They appeared to be glowing almost like a hazy plasma flame around each craft, all the craft were flying north in close staggered formation less than 500 feet from the ground and the size of each craft is hard to determine but I would say about the size of a small aircraft , I was scared , I ran inside and told my  mother who was a skeptic and grab my camera, I ran outside with my mother and took a few pics but I was nervous and shaking to get a good shot and they were going away by the time I can get a good shot and they blink out one at a time, I snapped a 4 pics in normal mode and in night framing mode , I could not believe what I just witnessed and then  all 4 appeared again at 9:36 pm in the same formation and going in the same direction as before , this time I was ready with the camera, I took close up shots, and they show the plasma flame around each craft. I have 9 photos in total showing different formation flying, I am an aerospace engineering student who studies engines and different forms of propulsion and I know these were not conventional aircraft by any means.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once my mom was outside she said &#34;do you see that?&#34; I said, &#34;see what?&#34; Those lights over there. I looked up and just North East of our home we saw about 10 lights red and white in color blinking very slowly, getting dim then bright again.  I said those are planes and yuo re being ridiculous. It was tehn I realized there was no way planes could possibly fly that close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden about 6 lights darted away from each other and were moving erratically across the sky, then they would allrace back twards each other. This went on for about 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still am not positive what they were, but I won&#39;t rule ut UFO&#39;s.<n>

It first appeared to be a planet like object similar to Venus in the night sky; however, much larger and brighter. I stood starring for about 5 minutes until I realized it was moving away from me as it began to drop below the tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my binoculars and returned. It had moved only slightly. Viewing it through 6 X 30 binoculars proved it was not an aircraft (I see small aircraft with their red and green running lights every day &amp; night since the Venice Airport is home to many private craft including jet aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although in the direction of the airport I could easily determine that it was well beyond since I could see small craft landing during the event. I then decided to take a picture and ran back in the house a second time for the digital camera. By this time the object had moved some distance from the original sighting position so the pictures were barely discernible. I ran the pictured through my graphics software enhancing the object. It was circular in shape and emitted a bright glowing light as if it were a glowing white ball and appeared to be much larger than the small craft flying in the area. The event lasted approximately 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have seen many of these kinds of object including bright orange circular craft as well as black triangular craft beginning in 1955 to present.

Looking out over the pine trees in my back field I saw a large &#34;beach ball&#34; type object brightly lit with a few darker patchy areas.  I had an excellent view as we have a sliding door in the bedroom and the curtain was pulled open with the door slightly ajar as well. The object was not moving in a regular smooth path, sort of hovering but going up and down with the whole object&#39;s lights going off and on at the same time, guessing I would say it was moving up and down a about 30 to 50 feet erratically, then suddenly it moved left and went straight down, totally silent.  For a brief moment the distant field appeared to light up, then darkness as if it was never there.  I immediately looked at the time and it was a few minutes before 2:00AM<n>

My house is on a hill facing West with a view of the Pacific Ocean.  It was a cloudless night with a waning moon.  I witnessed a craft that was a large orange glowing orb object traveling just above the horizon come out of the North, headed south, with a smaller white glowing orb following it.  At first I believed it to be an airplane or helicopter traveling very quickly and very low over the water, only a few hundred feet at most.  Then I witnessed the white object move closer to the larger orange object and then disappear as it came right to it.  I then noticed that there was no sound at all coming from them.  The orange orb stopped in mid flight and disappeared into what I assume was the ocean, leaving behind a faint white glow out in the water that lasted for a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 18, 2007 a series of loud rumblings were heard on the Central Coast.  At 14:12 I heard a faint boom, then, approximately 10 seconds later heard a rumble and felt my house vibrate just like an earthquake had hit it.  The rumble lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  I have lived in an area where military jets do maneuvers all my life, and have heard and felt sonic booms many times.  This however most definitely did not feel like a sonic boom at all, and felt just like a magnitude 3 to 3.5 earthquake.  The air force reported to the local media that they were conducting training with their new F-22 Raptors 50 miles off the coast, however the planes were reported to have returned to their airbase by 13:00.  NASA also reported conducting super sonic test flights near Edwards AFB, but both locations are quite far from here.  USGS reported no earthquakes in California that day that would have matched that magnitude.<n>

Seemed to close to the ground to have been a shooting star and it did not appear to dissipate and it was somewhat larger anyway.  It was silent.  A few nights earlier also 2 witnesses observing a very high level very bright white object moving from south to north over Kirkland, Washington, at a very high altitude on a clear, cloudless night. The object suddenly dimmed by a factor of perhaps ten to twenty and kept moving northerly in the upper atmosphere as if it were a normal satellite although perhaps slightly faster (as have observed numerous satellites over the years.)It did not dissipate or &#34;burn up&#34; and just kept proceeding onward.  One speculation is that during its very bright phase right overhead the object may have been experiencing some kind of reentry (or entry) glow/burn while descending through the upper atmosphere although cannot claim to have seen have seen that before so do not know. In fact first impression was that it was already in the upper atmosphere and for some reason unclear, the object may have been intentionally many magnitudes brighter and thusly largely then suddenly dimming to (distant observer size) of a slightly faster moving satellite (similar in observation size to most stars observable on a clear night (cloudless.)  It definitely dimmed down practically went overhead of both witnesses.  The earlier reported light descending over Kirkland was mentioned to a taxi driver who said that she had seen something similar earlier over the freeway in the Kirkland vicinity.  Also would like to report (which uncannily had forgotten until reminded) about a year or so before, a daylight sighting at 3:55pm over Volunteer Park, Seattle, on a clear sunny day a bright star like object stationed directly over head above Fifteenth Avenue East and East Republican (observed by several passers by and small business owner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained overhead for it seemed like maybe a dozen minutes. Most said it appeared unusual but soon lost interest and thought it may have been a daytime bright planet sighting and went about their way.  However (this observer) witnessed the bright silvery object eventually proceed to move slowly in a southerly direction and therefore walked several blocks in order to track the object as it passed above Fifteenth Avenue East, directly over the Aquarian Foundation Spiritualist Medium Church and the Safeway store next to it.  Did not report this to the members there fixing their church wall and as they were bust on ladders (although in retrospect maybe should have as they profess an interest in non terrestrial entities themselves).  The silvery slow moving bright sphere carried on slowly southwards toward South Seattle seemingly in no hurry whatsoever and making no effort to cloak itself in any way and was very clear from a third floor veranda until it was eventually to far gone over south Seattle to continue to maintain observation of the bright silvery (perhaps a very slight blue tint) object which remained silent.  Have speculated that if these were indeed human experimental vehicles, they are beyond current understanding of the general population.  If heretofore vessels were of a non terrestrial intelligent nature then they were making no attempt to cloak or stealth themselves) possibly wishing to be observed at that moment in time. Also have considered that if they are of say a &#34;galactic park ranger&#34; or scientific observer mission, they may be scanning the area with advanced technology to determine possible near future earthquake or volcanic activity in the Pacific Northwest region.  Another possible speculation is that such objects may have some form of mind link ability and may make themselves known to certain individuals and groups for some unknown reason.  Oh, almost forgot to mention about a week ago while riding on a bus across 520 bridge from Seattle to Kirkland, two spherical ! dark obj ects hovering over the exclusive beach front area, one above the other perhaps hundreds of feet, possibly over the Medina area.  No one on the bus seemed to say or not anything and did not raise alarm by asking others what they might be.  They just seemed to be hanging in the air only hundreds of feet above the area (possibly close to where a well known soft ware developer may reside.)  Thought they could have been some promotional balloons for some event although they did not appear tethered.  They were spherical and a darkish color, one perhaps a hundred feet above the other and maybe a few hundred feet above the ground, seemingly stationary and silent, perhaps as large as a house, they seemed a couple of miles away. Definitely could not say what they were.  Definitely could say they were not a conventional aircraft or helicopter. PS: Have met Peter Davenport at a few functions before although he may not recall me.<n>

Hovered in same place for about 9 minutes.  Then it flew faster than an airplane westward until lost from sight.  No other blinking lights or anything.  At first, it looked like a planet, but then took off.  Hotel guests on other balcony witnessed it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object breached over the trees, passing over the narrow valley to the Southern hill side.  The object was slowly passing over at low flight, very quiet having no sound or echo.  As this valley in particular creates an echo from a barn door slamming shut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A coworker and I were sitting on my porch around ten p.m. at this guest ranch we working at.  We both noticed and commented on an plane with bright lights looked to be flying very low and appeared to look like it was touching tree tops on the pine filled hill side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued to fly across over the valley and directly over my cabin, which is located in the center of the guest ranch compound.  My coworker and I stepped off my porch onto the yard, we both looked directly up to view the object.  We were amazed and cohered together.  The object then reached the Southern valley side, as it hit the tree line of the top of the hill, the object flashed directly up faster than the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day that has been the only object in the sky that I could not recognize.  The object still is fresh in my mind of how it looked, how lights flashed around it majestically and how it created no sound being how low it was flying over the valley.<n>

At about 10:00pm my wife and I were staying at a hotel on the south end of the Las Vegas strip.  While lying on the bed taking in the view of the strip we seen on disk shaped object that looked like a spinning top  with rotating lights. It came from the area over the Luxor hotel and went north with a helicopter  that seem to be following it. We watched it until it went out of sight.  10 -15 mins later the object came back and traveled on the same flight path as the first time, only this time the helicopter wasn’t around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that Vegas has a lot of helicopters and planes but we believe that was not either one, it brought both of us out of the bed to the window for a closer look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The land is mostly open in this area other than a medium sized white oak about a hundred feet from where I was. In front of me I noticed an object that I will do my best to describe. I would say this object was about four foot tall at the max, it was maybe three and a half wide. The shape best I can describe was something like an old arrowhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was motionless when I first noticed it however, it was not there when I looked up in that direction a few seconds before. It was black or dark grey in color but it wasn’t a solid object, it was almost like looking through dark window tint, transparent in a way if you will. It also looked like it was two dimensional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I saw this object, I stopped and stared. There was no movement for a couple of seconds but the object seemed to wrinkle and take a textured look quickly. The object then lifted off the ground and projected in a straight vertical line upwards. It went straight up and was gone extremely fast, out of sight in maybe a second tops. Whatever this was kicked up dust from the area when it went up but showed no signs of damage to the grass. It also made no sound at all. There were no lights, disc shape objects or any of that foolishness. It was just there, changed its texture and then shot up out of sight. It was a normal sunny Florida afternoon about 3:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first of two times I saw this object, the second account was as follows:  The second time I saw this object was a bit more dramatic. It was dusk, if I had to guess it would be about 6:30pm to 7pm. There was enough light outside to see but not like day time. I had walked out of the house onto the car port and towards the parking area where a family member was parked. They and my parents were coming right behind me. When I cleared the edge of the car port, I looked towards the right and saw this object once again. This time it was located under two very large oak trees that are about sixty feet from where we were. Once I realized what I was seeing, I turned to my family to get their attention so they could see it. When I started yelling to get them to look I turned back to point at it and the object seemed to wrinkle again like the first time. Maybe a second later it shot straight up through the oak tree breaking or shearing off up to two and a half inch diameter limbs as it went up and out of sight once again. The others never seen the object howev! er, they did see the aftermath of limbs falling from the event. Looking at the limbs, they were not clean cut but broke off from the object. This is on a very old well built white oak tree. Once again, no lights or sound, nothing that I have ever heard or seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was laying in bed, looking out my window, and I saw this thing fly directly over the house. It was in the shape of a rectangle, the bottom of the craft was flat, and it had lights in row down each side. It was flying extremely low. It was only a couple inches above the top of the trees in my back yard. It made some noise, but it wasn&#39;t loud at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was so peculiar about this sighting was how low it was flying, a jet flying that low would&#39;ve made a lot of noise, and the direction in which it was flying. I pay attention to the direction of air traffic near my house and I&#39;ve never seen a plane fly in that direction, that low, before. They usually are over to the left and they travel  east. This object flew directly over my house, traveling north. I saw it disappear north..I thought it was weird but it was out of sight so I decided to just forget about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes passed by and I saw it again! I don&#39;t know if it was the same one or a different one. This time it was traveling from east to west. I got a better look at it this time. It was definitely a rectangle shaped thing, traveling very low, making hardly any noise at all..definitely not an airplane. That was the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This video was aired only for few hours , and not after that , it is piculiar in a country with highest number of news channel and then govt declairing it to be rumor that too when  video is available puts a question that is Indian govt also aware of these ufos and have banned media to publish such news. THE ver next day another video was shot in KOTA in India whos video i missed recording which was clearer and better than this. and interestingly kOta has a nuclear plant also. May be due to that they were there. But anyhow see above link of video. I just didnt wanted it to go unoticed , i am sure many such daily news must be getting supressed all over world<n>

Looking in the direction she was appearently barking at I immediately noticed a very large, very bright object roughly 10 degrees ubove the horizion.  It was very large, not a planet, and deifinetley not a star.  After some few min. of observation I asked my wife and seven year old son to come out and look at it.  All agreeded that it was not a normal object.  It was moving in a west by nortwest direction.  In the time I observed the object had moved approximately 3-4 degrees in a space of just a few min, and was soon behind the treeline.  I attempted to set up my 6 in parabolic telescope to get a better look at it but could not do so in time.  I am certian that this was not a planetary nor star object because it moved at a greater speed than the star field behind it.  There was no noise, nor any other physical phenomina associated with this incident.  Thinking it couldn have been the International Space Station I check its orbital path on the NASA web page and discovered that the ISS orbit passes over northern to central to southeast Canada and New England in the US.  It could not have been the ISS.  I will observe the night sky tonight with my telescope set up to see if it reappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of a planet??  PD))<n>

The sky was bright blue, clear with a few small clouds here and there .  Looking ahead of me, I saw in the sky what appeared to me at first to be a typical passenger jet.  It was a perfect cigar shape and appeared to be white with a black band around the middle of it. The longer I looked at it, the more I began to notice things that made me see that it wasn&#39;t a passenger jet.  I&#39;m not the greatest at guessing distances, but, the craft was flying at, I would say, 10000-12000 feet.  It appeared to be flying at the same speed of an aircraft approaching an airport for landing, or that of a small single passenger private plane.  I would also say that it wasn&#39;t more than 3 miles in front of me. I did not hear any noise coming from it at all, whether it was too far or not.  I also did not see any kind of wings, fins or engines on the craft.  It appeared to be smoothly cruising to the north, right over Fruitville, clost to I-75. The craft was still in front of me as I watched it until it disappeared behind a small cloud, at which it never did reappear from behind of.  I pulled over and watched the spot in the sky where I last saw it for about 10 minutes with hopes that it would return again so that I could try to get a picture with my cell phone.  After 10 minutes, it had still not reappeared from behind the cloud.   There were also no contrails or chemtrails left behind from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/9/07 05:05|Deming|NM|Oval|seconds|anomaly in the southern new mexico sky|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57633.html|319|ndxe200707| anomaly in the southern new mexico sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted a report here earlier this week and have not heard back from anyone yet. The reason I&#39;m submiting another report is because since my last report I&#39;ve found one other person who wittnesed the same event as I did on Monday last. I don&#39;t know if you ever got my last report but I will copy/paste it from documents now.........I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to submit this but at 5:05 am MDT on Monday, July 9th, 2007, I witnessed an anomaly in the sky. I was outside facing the west when I saw an object move across the sky from south to north. It is impossible to judge the size of this object because I didn’t have a frame of reference for depth of field. It did give me a feeling of impossibly large however. It was also traveling at a speed that would be impossibly fast as far as what aircraft known to me would be able to travel. It was oval in shape on the horizontal and had no noticeable trail behind it nor tail of any kind. It gave me the feeling of being solid and not atmospheric in nature, but I could not describe it on more than two dimensions because it passed my whole field of view in only a few seconds. There is a small municipal airport close by and I know what I saw was not the usual scanning beam that one would see from the airport revolving light.  It was very bright blue/indigo in color with a slight fringe of a lighter almost cream color on its perimeter and was obviously emitting it’s own light and was not a reflection of any kind. As it passed rather low in the western sky from my observation point in southern New Mexico it seemed to have a path that followed the curvature of the earth and not rising in altitude nor was it falling like a meteor might be expected to do when entering the earths atmosphere. As it left my field of view then it appeared to be traveling at about 5 to 15 points north. I am not a UFO enthusiast and have no particular beliefs for or against UFOs. I guess I’m trying to say that I’m not some kind of nut who “sees things”. I saw what I s! aw and c an not explain it nor can I find any source to ascertain explanation at this point on Wednesday two days following. I have left emails with the Weather Channel. com to see if one of their experts could explain it along with an email to U S gov.com to ask for an email address for the appropriate dept. There has been no response from anyone yet. Can you please give me an email address for someone who may be able to explain to me what I saw. Or….maybe you have knowledge of what it was I saw.  There must be other people who saw this. There must be a simple explanation. Thank you for any help you can give me.........and that concludes the copy of the report I sent you earlier this week. About one hour ago I found one other person who wittnessed exactly the same thing I did. I asked him to describe what he saw and it was an exact match to what I put in this report earlier this week and in the copy of it just now. I&#39;ve sent emails to various government agencies and am not getting any reply when I make request for explanation. I did get one reply form NOAA stating that there were no meteorological events during the time of my sighting.  I would sure like to find someone who will pay attention to me and possibly help me find a source to get the answer for what I saw.....and now of course at least one other person. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/9/07 05:05|New Mexico (southwest)|NM|Oval|seconds|anomaly in the western sky in southwest New Mexico|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57576.html|320|ndxe200707| anomaly in the western sky in southwest New Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to submit this but at 5:05 am MDT on Monday, July 9th, 2007, I witnessed an anomaly in the sky. I was outside facing the west when I saw an object move across the sky from south to north. It is impossible to judge the size of this object because I didn’t have a frame of reference for depth of field. It did give me a feeling of impossibly large however. It was also traveling at a speed that would be impossibly fast as far as what aircraft known to me would be able to travel. It was oval in shape on the horizontal and had no noticeable trail behind it nor tail of any kind. It was very bright blue/indigo in color with a slight fringe of a lighter almost cream color on its perimeter and was obviously emitting it’s own light and was not a reflection of any kind. As it passed rather low in the western sky from my observation point in southern New Mexico it seemed to have a path that followed the curvature of the earth and not rising in altitude nor was it falling like a meteor might be expected to do when entering the earths atmosphere. As it left my field of view then it appeared to be traveling at about 5 to 15 points north. I am not a UFO enthusiast and have no particular beliefs for or against UFOs. I saw what I saw and can not explain it nor can I find any source to ascertain explanation at this point on Tuesday the day following. I have left emails with the Weather Channel. com to see if one of their experts could explain it along with an email to U S gov.com to ask for an email address for the appropriate dept. There has been no response from anyone yet. Can you please give me an email address for someone who may be able to explain to me what I saw. There must be other people who saw this. There must be a simple explanation. Thank you for any help you can give me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was really close to the trees. I saw rise from above the trees and then hover for a second before it started moving torwards my way. After that it moved to my right like it was trying to get a clear view of me. It stayed there for about a minute and a half. I think it saw me with my camera and must of got scared. Then it just shot straight up faster that a bullet and was gone. When it was was hovering it made a humming noise. I know it couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter or military craft because there was no airport or base within 80 miles. Also because I was in a no fly area. But it was amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.  E-address suggests to us that the source is a young skateboarder.  PD))<n>

I was outside looking east at the Manette Bridge and the Port Washington Narrows in Bremerton, Washington,  when suddenly I noticed a small blue light traveling east towards Seattle. The light resembled the light of a high flying aircraft, but it moved across the sky at an incredible speed, and disappeared over the horizon within a couple of seconds. There were no trails behind it, as one would expect shooting star or fireball to have. Instead the light remained constant as it skimmed across the sky. Its flight path was not straight, as it glided quickly across the sky, but rather it made a few slight curving maneuvers, moving like a hockey puck over uneven ice. The whole incident was quickly over. There was no sound accompanying the object. I felt an overwhelming sense of “Wow” after seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I’ve seen comets, shooting stars, fireballs, falling space debris as well as all matter of aircraft. This moved like nothing I had ever seen before in my life at a speed that was incomprehensible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then my cousin said to me hey look at the jet (take it I live by Luke air force base) I looked at what he was pointing to and I said what that plane (I was looking at what seemed to be a bright star moving south to north east)...he’s said no that one(talking about the jet)..then I said what about that one (talking about the light I was seeing) he then saw the light too...he said that isn’t no plane it doesn’t have any flashing lights...I told him it was probably a plane then it just kept moving north east then it was exactly east of us and then disappeared ...we kept looking at the place where it disappeared then out of nowhere it got very bright brighter than a star get probably about 3 times as bright....once we saw that it started moving south then it got bright again and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Speed (very rapid and parallel to horizon) and light (solid bright white) rule out any known aircraft, and the size and direction seem to rule out a meteor.  Altitude is difficult to determine since we are unsure of its distance from us.  Object was viewed through east and south facing windows by two of three people in the room.  Observers were a 31-year-old male and a 72-year-old male.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/8/07 18:52|Mt. Rainier National Park|WA|Disk|5 minutes|Dark, large, disc-shape hidden in clouds that remained stationary.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113208.html|329|ndxe200707| Dark large disc shape hidden in clouds that remained stationary<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this date I was on the way home from hiking on the Paul Peak trail. There is an area to the left of the road outside of Mount Rainier Park in the Mowich Lake area, where they are logging.  This area is about three to four miles from the park boundary.  The area is bare of trees, so visiblity was unobstructed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to my left, and saw a set of dark black clouds out in the middle of nowhere. One was cigar shape, level with the terrain and the other was disc shaped directly above the other touching on the right side(from my point of view).  The left side of the disc shape was approximately 20 degrees above the other, at an angle, and was much larger.  Inside this strange set of black clouds is a clear outline of what looked like a disc, which was completely black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The average person may say this is just unusual cloud formations, but the problem I have with this is that through the opening on the upper left side, the clouds were rolling into the interior while the rest of the formation remained stationary.  In fact, anything else that got close to the opening, got fed into the upper outer edge of the disc shaped cloud.  It reminded me of the result of intake motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can just make a good guess of the size of the disc to be 2,000 feet wide and 40 to 50 feet high at the highest point.  It is smaller in height towards the outer edge.  There was a definite outline visible.  It could have been even large than that, it was big.  It was hard to tell how much of it was cloud cover.  From my point of view, it was high in the sky, at an angle of about 120 degrees from me, almost directly above the logged area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped a photo with my cell phone, which unfortunatly had a poor camera and it almost completely takes up the whole frame.  I watched for about 4-5 minutes and watched the clouds continue to roll into the edge as I described, and remember thinking how weird this was. I drove home, not thinking too much about it because I was really hungry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time passed by, and I watched a tv show where they mentioned that UFOS hide in dark clouds, and so I found the old phone to look at the picture I had taken that day.  I can still see outline of the disk and the shape in the interior, but it is hard to see the rolling of the clouds on the outer edge.  I put a name on this as the cloud eater, because that is what it looks like; a big mouth eating any cloud that gets close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I am afraid of what this might be, I have a phobia of returning to that area.  I have had several nightmares because of this, which have now subsided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was an encounter, I would like to know what it was that I saw that day.<n>

At first I figured it was just an airplane with the sun reflecting off it.  However, as I neared my home I noticed it was still there and still glowing.  I stopped my car and watched it. It was not moving as I would expect from an airplane.  It was hovering stationary and was changing in brightness.  It got very bright, then would dim a little, but it did not move.  I watched for a few minutes and then just below and to the right of it, a second bright white object appeared.  Both objects maintained their positions and glowed brightly then less so back and forth.  I rushed down the hill to get my wife to come have a look but they had gone by the time we got back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/8/07 02:15|Pine Valley|CA|Sphere|2 Hours|Three objects and static shock in Pine Valley and three witnesses|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58557.html|332|ndxe200707| Three objects and static shock in Pine Valley and three witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping with two friends out in Pine Valley, CA, roughly 50 minutes east of San Diego in a forest/desert area on top of a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been sitting around the fire talking, having a few s&#39;mores, listening to 91x rock radio.  The first thing we noticed was a very bright, flashing sphere of light.  Red, blue, and green lights, and it looked like the blue lights strobed around the middle circumfrence of the ball, flashing twice per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t think much of it until it started getting closer.  We turned up the music and began flashing the truck headlights and it grew twice as large and even closer.  At this time we were freaking out and shut off the headlights and turned off the music.  Whatever is was hovered erratically for thirty seconds and dissappeared instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn&#39;t believe what had just happened and sat back down by the fire and were talking about it when the strangest thing that has ever happened in my life hit all three of us at once.  We were in a half circle, sitting on the ground, and from the tips of my fingers spreading through my whole body I recieved a powerful jolt of electricity, a quick ZAP!  It wouldn&#39;t have been a huge deal, but ALL THREE OF US GOT HIT EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME!  The millisecond it happened we all looked directly into each other&#39;s eyes and said, &#34;Holy $%#@, DID YOU FEEL THAT!  All three of us had recieved a shock the strength of an electric fence, at the exact same time, but instead of my whole body being shocked at once, i first felt the jolt in the tips of my fingers because I was pointing at something and it was the closest body part to the dark forest in front of us.  The crazy thing was, I thought I heard a faint zap type of a sound when it happened, and it seemed to have come from the forest, directly below where we had seen the spherical object with flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night had just begun.  The music and truck lights were turned back on, when two of us noticed something and called over the third person.  We saw a creamy-white light, larger than a star, but we couldn&#39;t tell if it was in our atmosphere, or out in the solor system.  It seemed far away and close at the same time.  It was moving in a swooping direction, like how you would draw a puffy cloud, or in elementary school when you move the decimal point you make the swoosh under the numbers to count how many spaces to move the decimal.  That is the movement this object was making, yet totally different location in the sky, different color, and complete different erratic movement than the first object we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatley following, there was one more oject that appeared way, way out, as far as the stars and about the size of a star, but it was going up, down, left, right, diagonal, every direction possible.  It was so erratic it was completely unpredictable where it would move next.  All three sightings lasted nearly five minutes each, spread out over the course of almost three hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night was the clearest I have ever seen the sky, even more clear than it is in the middle of Alaska.  There were aircraft going by, easily distinguished by there red and green lights, direction, altitude and speed.  I am a pilot so I know what is an airplane and what is not,and what we saw that night, had no scientific, logical, or spiritual explanation.  We all told each other we are surely not alone in this universe.  And we proved it to ourselves that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though all three of us saw those objects, the craziest, most insane thing that has every happened to any of us was being shocked, jolted, in the middle of the dark forest, with no person, place, or thing around.  It was absolutely insane, and will remember that night for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Look up, you never know what you are going to see, (or not see) that is mystifying  the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The ir color was fade orange and the size of the dots was the size of a sattelite or a distant, not very bright star. Dots formed some sort of a group; like a squadron but not a plane squadron; it was like like a birds flock. The movement was very similar to the birds&#39; (the flock is moving in one direction with barely winding on the sky, but the birds are flying across eachother). The movement (style) of the objects could also be compared with the sparks lifting above the fire; gentle without a strain and it almost seemed it was a play of catch me if you can. There were no fire on the ground and it had to bee pretty high above the sky although it didn&#39;t seemed it was in space; it had to be closer than the sattelites circumferences are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or noise. The dots were lost behind the house blocks and were faded out by the citiy&#39;s lightpollution. (direction WEST, we also noticed a couple of falling stars the same hour but in the opposite direction!)<n>

Late at night around 11 PM, I was gazing up at the sky and an odd vertical, dark orange/red light was in the sky. It looked like 3-5 small vertical circles stacked on top of each other. It was very high up in the sky, so I assumed it was a comet or something of that sort. I pointed it out and told my five friends to look at it. As they looked up at it, the single vertical line split into 2 vertical lines and started descending down to the earth. It still appeared very high in the sky at this point. About 15-25 seconds after the single line diverged into 2 lines, it had diverged again into 4 vertical lines. At this point it was very close to ground level. I&#39;m guessing it was 2-3 miles away from where we were looking at it. It was very dark so it is hard to judge the distance it actually was but it was not far away at all. When it had finally appeared at ground level, there were 2 horizontal rows of lights with 4 lights in each row. The light wasn&#39;t nearly as intense now as it was when I had first mistaken it for a comet in the sky, but the light formation clearly made the shape of a saucer and at this point we had no doubt it was a UFO. About 10 seconds after it had fully descended and the 2 rows of lights had appeared, the outermost two vertical rows of lights faded away and immediately following after the center two vertical row of lights faded away. We were silent the whole time we watched this thing descend down onto the earth but after the lights had completely faded, we all confirmed that it was a UFO we had all just witnessed. The grandson of the owner of the property soon told us that his grandparents had witnessed UFOs before on the property (I think he said they saw one about 50 years ago) and that his grandfather had actually coined the city of Earlville&#39;s motto as &#34;The Center of the Universe&#34;.<n>

The sky was clear and starry. The lights were approximately 5to 8 minutes appart. The first and third lights traveled in a North to South direction. The second light traveled east to west. The lights did not blink but appeared to be at a higher altitude than any plane. The lights appeard out of nowhere. Each light was able to be observed for approx. 5 to 10 seconds each. The third light seemed to change direction and traveled up and away from Earth. There was no haze or trail of any sort around or near the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did and what I saw is the most astonishing sight I have ever witnessed. At first glance it looked like an aeroplane on fire. My daughter her friend and a friend of mine were shaking with fear. I watched in amazement and the object changed direction from down to east and then started to ascend. I continued to watch  and it took approximately 40 seconds for the object to ascend so high that it disappeared, not over the horizon but straight up!!  I did manage to snap a picture on my mobile phone and when zoomed in it is incredible. There is structure, what looks like a hexagon and what looks like a power source of two on the rear of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a general interest in astronomy, astrophysics and quantum physics and with all the wonder in our world that I do explore, this was by far most – out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like for my photo to be looked at.

I took the cake box to burn it and after I threw the box into the fire, as I turned to go back into the house, I was facing west and above the tree line (trees are approximately 50 feet tall), there was an oval shaped object that was hovering, not moving, no noise..  It just stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and no wind. I can’t judge how big it was or how high up in the sky but above the tree line (50 ft. trees). It was about the size of a neighbor’s 50- foot wide house two acres away, but up in the sky.  I stood there alone, in disbelief for about 15 seconds and ran to get my fiancé.  I ran about 100ft. to the deck of the house and turned again to look and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to explain what I saw.  I could hardly speak. I called my dad (a former pilot) and he asked for a description and told me to call the police.  I didn’t.  I thought they would think I’m crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew a picture.  It seemed to be dark in color with a wide band going horizontally through the center of the object.  It also had, on each side, as like handles on a cooking pot, underneath, red lights that zigzagged, but only on the sides.  I will send the sketch tomorrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However one spark didin&#39;t fade away from the rest, it kept moving horizontally. It kept moving like an airplane, but it was bright orange and looked like it was flaming. one of us went to get a camera but it flew away extremely fast like it went into hyperspeed or something. we managed to get two very blurry pictures of it that we are trying to clean up right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The fireworks lasted until around 10:30 pm. My family, including my son-in-law and his wife and kids, were standing on our pier just as the fireworks ended. It was a crystal clear evening and you could easily see the left-over smoke from the fireworks against the darkening starlit night. The left-over firework smoke was drifting about 2-300 feet high and 500 yards out from me moving left to right as we stood on the pier looking to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 36 year old son-in-Law pointed out this moving object to our left above the firework smoke moving left to right seemingly glowing like a flame. It was circular and it appeared to look like the fire and glow of the tail pipe of a fighter jet without noise or sound. The object was the size of a medium aircraft but perfectly round. The object was moving much faster then the firework smoke still drifting across the northern sky. I look even further back to my left and it looked like several of these fiery objects were line up in single file like you would see at an airport with airplanes lined up to land. The fiery objects past over head right in front of us in single file and moved rapidly east and upwards until they when out of sight. I counted eight of them which flu west to east almost horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a 15 year veteran NBC affiliate director/producer in television, I frequently carry a video camera for chasing storms and news stories and decided to run to grab my video camera in our cottage during the sighting. It only took me seconds to grab my video gear but before I could get it started recording I was only able to video tape one single object flying left to right climbing out of sight like the other seven objects. Then two more of the objects with the same look, flying perfectly parallel to each other flu to the center of the lake and follow the exact same course until the two glow flame objects perfectly turn together in unison and instead of following the rest of the glow-flame objects to the east, they headed directly straight to the north where I facing during the time I was video taping. The other eight objects all flew to the east and climbed out of sight, but the last two that flew side-by-side did not climb like the others but kept the same altitude of about one thousand feet until they drop from sight in the northern horizon. The whole event lasted about 20-30 minutes with the objects seemingly spaced evenly apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The firework smoke was still slowly drifting east about 5 miles and hour after the incendent. These objects maneuvered about and were traveling much faster then the firework smoke. I stood there on the pier looking at one last glowing light that did not move in the west and I was not sure that it was another glow-flame object. I gave it about 5 minutes and wrote it off to being a water tower beacon off in the distance.  I went inside the cottage for a bit and returned in about 20 minutes later to find that the object I waiting on, that I thought was a water tower beacon we not in the west  and in fact, there were no lights at all. So then I assume it was one of the objects I had been witnessing and did not stick around long enough to see where that UFO headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many people on the lake that night and witnessed these objects. I work with a man who was at the yacht club on the lake that night with approximately 100 guests for a graduation party who all witnessed the fireworks and the same objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and to my surprise no one had reported what I had seen. There have not been any reports in newspapers or media since then. I have talked to a few people who live at the lake who claim they either saw the objects that night or heard about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone for an extended amount of time.  He is a serior executive for a major company, and we deem him to be an excellent witness.  We would welcome other reports from the many other individuals who, we understand, were witness to the same event.  PD))<n>

This apt faces east across Division Street, and I can see all the Lights of East Spokane and the Spokane Valley looking down to the River, The Spokane Community college. I can see the lights of the lights Valley Mall about 7miles east of my apartment, which is about 190 feet above street level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Y W a friend of mine living on the 17th floor came up to my apt to listen to the Coast to Coast radio program, we usually listen to George Noory together most evenings from 10 to 11 PM. She brought with her a bag of micro-waved popcorm and she then sat next to the window looking east while I found a container to pour the hot bag of popcorn into. I then sat down beside her and after a few moments there appeared lights out side our window. Yvone ask, what are those. I answered they look like UFO’s to me, and I opened the window wide so we could get a clearer view of a spectacle taking place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 5 orbs each one looked exactly the same as all the others the were glowing the color of a soft pink similar to the color of the rising moon at night. The were all in a straight line of 5 round orbs or discs straight up into the sky. The were approximately 1, 500 feet away right over the Spokane Community College and were approximately 500 feet above the ground. Each one was moving in rotation around each other. This was a sight of beauty that reminded me later of looking down upon a group of square dancers. You know the doe, see, doe, and spin your partner type thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of each of the 5 orbs or balls was the same, each was approximatly the size of a hot air baloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound as they continued to circle around each other in the sky in front of our ring side seats. The speed of each rotation was a complete rotation took less than one second. After viewing this for about 5 seconds I decided to get a picture of this strange scene and rose up to find a camera. At the same time I ask Yvone to keep her eyes on the orbiting orbs. A few seconds later Yvone said they were no longer visible and described them all rising together at an angle to the right rather than straight up. She also said that the color faded out and the last she could see was the out line or a circle of each one without the each soft orange color.<n>

I went outside of the Lone Pine Hotel to pack backpacks. despite the fires going on to the right, near big pine, and the huge advaning smoke plume, it was crystal clear and bright. I was looking up at Mt.Whitney and decided to put on my glasses(amber lens)because it was so bright. I  immediately saw a group of 15 or more white colored round objects moving quickly above the Whitney range. At first I thought them to be birds but I noticed they all moved together, in perfect formation, up and down. They disappeared when they turned either towards or away from me. I couldn&#39;t tell how large they were or how fast they were moving. I guess they were pretty far away and high, They appeared to be moving quickly to the north, right into the smoke (they may have been higher than the smoke but not likely). I didn&#39;t think birds fly into smoke! Anyway, they were remarkably similar to those ufos spotted down in mexico. My girlfriend saw them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I first thought it was a plane but it didnt move at all.We have a flight pattern over my house so I know the size of planes as they come in for a landing. This thing was about 4 times the size of a plane at that height and distance. It was no more than a couple hundred feet in the air and less than a mile away. There seem to be a tinge of red on the back end of it. I watched it as I turned onto telegraph rd. It stayed perfectly still. As i turned my head to make sure there were no cars in the lane I turned back to look to make sure the ufo was still there but it was gone. I looked all around but it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a perfectly sunny day with no clouds, maybe a little smog.  But I was just taking pictures of the scenery with my digital camera, and didn&#39;t even realize that there was a strange object in the middle of one of the photos I had taken (I put the photos on my computer a couple days ago).  I would have just shrugged it off except for the fact that I had taken an identical picture less than 30 seconds later and the object was no where to be see.  I don&#39;t recall there being anything in the photo at the time I had taken it, but then again, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything to be in it.  In the picture the weird object is just a small black blur that is right in the middle of the clear sky.  I&#39;m not really sure what it is, or what it could be, so I wanted to contact someone to see if they could tell me what it is exactly.  I trust you guys are professionals in this field, and are a lot better at analyzing photos than I am.  I would really wish to be contacted by an investigator via email so that I can email him or her the image, but if this is not possible I understand.  Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a perfectly clear evening. My husband, his 2 brothers and myself were enjoying a quiet night recalling memories around the campfire and watching for shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was gazing off to the South West side of the lake and noticed in the sky an orange glowing sphere moving steadily towards the North East. I didn&#39;t know what to think at first. I quickley spoke up and pointed the object out to the others and asked if anyone thought it was an airplane, even though I knew it couldn&#39;t be because there was no sound and no flashing lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got up from our chairs and followed it as it continued on it&#39;s swift and steady path. At each angle as it passed, the object did not change shape or color. The color resembled the same orange glow of the embers in our camp fire with the exception that the objects color was a steady and non wavering glow. It&#39;s size was considerably larger than any of the many stars that filled the sky and the only sound that we could hear was that of traffic passing on a far off road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object disappeared out of sight behind the trees, we returned to the campfire to discuss what we had just witnessed. As we did, 2 airplanes passed over head. We could clearly see the outlines of the wings marked by the multi colored flashing lights and followed by the familiar sound of the airplane&#39;s engine. It was obvious to see that the object that had previously passed by did not match in any way or form what we were now seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our evaluations of the event however, remain split. My husband and his older brother were positive that it must have been some type of military stealth jet aircraft of unknown origin flying high in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second brother-in-law and I, based on what we had seen, thought that it was too unusual to be any kind of jet. In addition, I have witnessed a stealth jet fly over when they retired the Blackbird SR-71 in 1990. It flew over where I used to work in Valencia, California near Lockheed Aircraft, where it was built. The sound of the stealth jet was not evident as it approached, but after it passed the sound was an unmistakable jet engine&#39;s roar which could be heard even as it flew straight up and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed last evening was in no way a match to that experience. If this was indeed a military aircraft I am totally impressed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The objects looked at first like twinkling star&#39;s, however they had bright red and white lights on them. My neighbor being airforce, and my husband being ex military brought up a good point, no aircraft on earth could be that high up in the sky and move that fast. The night was very clear on 07-06-07, truly amazing to see these objects. Anouther thing that we were thinking, no aircraft here can change direction at a 90degree angle going that fast. Tonight we brought out several other people, one adult and three older children to see if they see the same things. The adult thought we were out of our minds, but is now a believer once he seen them for himself. Now to let you know, there is a very small airport around here, however we hear and see them land and take off. We know what the lights look like from those, and can say that the objects we seen were nothing like an airplane. Tonight when an airplane did fly over, it took about 8-10 minutes to leave our sight, where as these objects are going at a much higher speed and are constantly changing direction. Right before we came inside for the night it became cloudy. We could no longer see any of these object&#39;s, however once again when a plane flew over, we could see the light&#39;s through the clouds. This in turn means to us that these objects are above the clouds beyond our vision.<n>

As we approached the object, it seemed to be growing bigger and also seemed to be getting closer although we had slowed down.  At this point, we turned the car around and started driving back toward Ames.  As we drove, the object continued to get bigger and grow closer.  The object seemed to maneuver toward us using very square and sudden turns.  As we approacted the outskirts of Ames, the object dropped it&#39;s pursuit and left the area very suddenly.  The objects altitutde appeared to be 600-800 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the passengers of our vehicle has had a background with numerous sitings of unidentifiable objects in the past.

The couple we were with as well as my girlfriend and I saw one object floating over the area in a hover pattern. It was circular in shape and had several blue lights surrounding it. I am very skeptical about UFO&#39;s however both the group I was with and a large number of people (about 50) were staring into the sky wondering what the object was. We did not hear the sound of a helicopter and do not believe it was an airplane due to its ability to hover and the tight circles it was doing in the sky. After about 10 minutes the object floated about the cloud layer and was not seen. There were people there taking pictures of the image and most of us were dumbfounded by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

By the time I saw the object it was directly overhead traveling at a very high and constant rate of speed. It disappeared behind the upper decks of the ship just a few seconds after I spotted it. I can’t put a number on the size of the object because it was impossible to gage its distance from us – it may have been as close as a half mile to as much as 10 miles or more away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten minutes after the initial sighting, my son and I spotted two more round faint blue/green colored objects, traveling in line with each other in a west/southwest direction until they seemed to turn suddenly to a southeast direction and disappear. These objects were due south of the ship and looked to be traveling only a 1/2 mile or so above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Adams with my business partner.  After the conference, most of the attendees joined up in the field to sky watch.  Mt. Adams is well known for its paranormal activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we waiting for lights to start firing up on the mountain, as it has done in the past, we noticed a glowing globe setting low in the western sky above the trees.  I had a spotting scope and my partner started to track it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, yellowish/white, globular and undulated with millions of teeny lights inside.  It moved bout, reminiscent of a jelly fish or an amoeba.  A woman sitting next to us said it had been there the night before too and stayed for about 2 hours then went down behind the trees and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe this object until it was out of view.  It became apparent to us just at sunset and stayed visible until around 11 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was orb-shaped, brilliant, and large and were amazed to see it moving, undulating, turning upside down, right, left.  It was yellowish-white and seemed to change color. On close inspection, it looked like an amoeba or jellyfish with electrical impulses firing off inside.  We saw geometric designs inside lit up like a chandelier.  This thing was incredibly beautiful and graceful, like it was alive.  We were in awe.  We put a video of it up on YouTube.com under &#34;Mysterious Skies&#34; if you would like to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it went down behind the tree, it looked like &#39;stuff&#39; coming out of it -- lights. There were two other very small bright objects near it - one at 3 o&#39;clock and another at 11 o&#39;clock.  We noticed that they looked exactly like the big one, only much smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also have stills of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was what looked to be an opening in the center which moved around almost like an eyeball, however, the center opening appeared to be square on the outside but round on the inside.  It almost looked like it was looking at us!  Both my business partner and I are Metaphysical Ministers.  We work privately in the paranormal field.  Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that morning, around 3 or 4 am, we were visited in our motor home by a brilliant, tiny white light.  A flash woke me up.  I thought someone had a camera outside the window and took my picture.  I looked out the window and didn&#39;t see or hear anybody, although I did notice that lights were going off on the mountain like crazy.  When I laid back down, I saw a brilliant white light on the ceiling.  It moved three times before I tried to wake up  my partner.  When I called her to wake her up, it disappeared.  The light did not give off any negativity, I did not feel fear or afraid of it.  I believe It was a light being, as curious as we are and it came to visit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First contact.  Awesome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this info is helpful.<n>

7/6/07 16:40|Portland|OR|Other|1 minute|Bright sun-illuminated "dot" drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57485.html|369|ndxe200707| Bright sun-illuminated &#34;dot&#34; drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area; the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright &#34;dot&#34; was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The &#34;dot&#34; appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees; the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations; it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed; it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were &#34;310&#34; (the heading presumably) at &#34;12&#34; (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at &#34;6&#34; for Troutdale (Oregon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was submitted about 6:40 PM, two hours after the incident.<n>

The plane was at approx 38000 ft over Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I told the other members of my party about it, the object made another pass traveling in the opposite direction.  I was able to take a photo at that time.  When the object passed the second time the rate of speed was considerably slower and the object appeared to have a hazy glow around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description of the object(s) appeared to be a dark speared shaped craft with no visible support wings or stabilizers.

As we pulled into a parking lot near 125th and Antioch, my daughter asked what that was in the sky.  I looked up and saw a disk shaped object flipping end over end floating slowly across the sky.  We stopped the car and got out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for 10-15 minutes.  It flipped end over end slowly and moved as if floating like a balloon from east-south-east to west-north-west.  It almost seemed dormant and non-deliberate if not for the fact it was floating opposite the direction of the wind.  There were no sudden movements in any direction besides the flipping end over end and sideways. As it twisted and turned slowly, there were times it turned in such a way I could see the profile of the object.  It was very, very thin so it was obviously not air filled and buoyant, but rather afloat due to something other than light or hot air.  It was shiny and metallic.  On one side of the object when in full view like looking down at a plate sitting flat on a table, it had three circles in a triangular pattern.  Because I had no idea how big it was I couldn’t tell how high up in the air it was floating.  It appeared to be about the same size as if you held a silver dollar in your outstretched hand.  It was completely silent, made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the object float toward the west, I noticed a second one nearby that I had not noticed before, probably because I was so fixated on the first object, afraid it would disappear if I turned away.  The two objects appeared to be spinning and flipping in tandem.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was with my 6 year old daughter and 2 year old son and seemed to be the only adult seeing the object which was very clearly large enough to see, I was shouting at anyone I could find in the same parking lot to just get confirmation that what we were seeing was real and get their instinct on what it was.  A few people saw it and said things like “what is that?”  None of us could figure any other explanation because it was silent, metal and obviously not floating because it was full of air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it flew over us we could hear the engines and it was a black triangle with lights on the side and what looked like a afterburner on the back with blue lights also on the back. It looked as though there was a window (which reminded me of a submarine window)on the side with a lot of light coming out of it. My friend was looking at the bottom of the craft and she said it had three lights with a door in between the lights (so 2 doors total). It just flew over head and then was gone. Then a little later we saw this glowing ball that was changing colors in the sky and moving in zig-zag patterns. We watched this for about 2 hours trying to figure out if it was the triangle again or something else. After 2 hours all these jets came and got real close to the glowing ball. Then it seemed like everything just died down and there was nothing more to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It passed behind some trees, stopped, dimmed, then changed direction and began heading south, (right towards me).  I watched it as it slowly drifted over my head.  Every 3 seconds it would glow white-hot, then fade out.  At arms length, it was about the size of a pea.  This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve seen this craft.  It always seems to show up between midnight and 2:30am.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Their color   was light orange, about the size of a small star, moving slowly. I watched them for about 30 seconds and pulled into a parking lot next to US31. I then got out of my car, grabbed my camera, and by the time I had it turned on, they were gone. I got back into my car about to leave, and saw another one moving the same direction, same speed. So I got out again, got my camera, pointed it in the area of the light, and it was gone moving a little faster now. I waiting a few seconds, and saw another one, moving the same direction, and speed, This time I got it on video for about 10 seconds, and it faded away. I started to get back into my car, and then a fifth object came into view, heading the same direction, but a little faster, I was not able to get this one on video, to fast. The last three objects were in a single file line, about a mile behind each other. The first two were very close together, and side by side. All were the same color, and sort of flickering, but not flashing. They were no more then a few  miles from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 47 years old, and was out doing surveillance for a client that night, so I did have a couple cameras with me. I do not drink, or do drugs, and I don’t know what it was that I saw, but it did not look like normal aircraft. The footage is a little shaky at one point, but there are a few seconds that were fairly clear, and still.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/5/07 22:30|Parksville (Canada)|BC|Light|5 - 10 min|The light was brighter than anything I've ever seen in the sky & hovered in one place.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57475.html|377|ndxe200707| The light was brighter than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky &amp; hovered in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered in one place &amp; was very bright.  It appeared to be a white light with red lights flashing around it.  The light seemed sparkly.  It disappeared without a trace.  I took 2 photos of it.  Upon viewing the photos, there appears to be 2 other objects close by.  The other 2 objects were undetectable to the naked eye or through the telescope.  My computer program does not have the capacity to adequately zoom into the objects to get a clear, defined picture.  However, they do appear in the photo.  Can I send you the pictures? The 2 observers (myself &amp; my partner) are fully functioning &#34;normal&#34; adults, not &#34;crazy&#34;, as far as we know.  We&#39;ve both been involved in community service for years.  I&#39;m highly educated, with a Master&#39;s degree.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like this &amp; were rather hesitant to file this report.  I also left a phone message.  I&#39;m curious to know if anyone else has reported the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/5/07 20:00|Ralston|NE|Light|10 minutes|Ten starlike objects seen in daylight just s of Omaha - most stationary but some moved various directions|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57500.html|378|ndxe200707| Ten starlike objects seen in daylight just s of Omaha - most stationary but some moved various directions<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting of ten starlike points of light objects in daytime sky just sse of overhead Ralston, Nebraska (suburb town on southwest side of Omaha).  Sighting lasted about 10 minutes beginning at about 8pm CDT on Thursday, 5 July 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in a lawn chair outdoors at a swing and big band concert offered by the city in downtown Ralston facing south.  The crowd was of about 75 was mainly made up of people in their 50s to 70s years of age and some in front of me began pointing up to the daytime cloudless sky, and I looked up to at first see five bright silver starlike points of light in the sky stationary and in a zigzag like pattern.  Within minutes I counted 7 and then I counted 9 and then 10 in all stationary across the sky of various intensities and all silver in color except one fainter one which had a reddish tint.  None blinked or pulsated but looked more like how Venus currently looks in the western sky vs a twinkling star affect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the sun was low on the horizon, the brightness appeared to be reflection.  Knowing how bright the International Space Station can be after sunset when its orbit is just right and how bright satellites can be in the early evening, these objects could have been at a very high altitude and hence could have been seen across a widespread area and hopefully others have seen something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not evenly spread out but some were alone and some were in somewhat close groups of two or three in no particular pattern.  After about 5 minutes, three of the lights moved in all different directions and the group farthest to the southeast made a  tight triangle around the reddish light.  After a few more minutes, in this same area, four lights moved close to one another to form a rough letter C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes after first seeing this strange event, a high flying aircraft flew across the sky from east to west and when it did, coincidentally all but one of the lights vanished and by the time the airplane crossed that area to the west, the last light was gone as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have nor did I see anyone there with a camera or video equipment to record this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no more starlike items in the sky until after sunset an hour and a half later when Venus was visible and by 9:45 several of the brighter stars came out as normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with planes and satellites and what I saw was not those.  I am familiar with the brightness of white-breasted geece flying and how the sun can reflect off them and what they look like and what I saw was not birds.  I have always been interested in astronomy and earth sciences and am a meteorologist by profession.  I have never seen an object in the sky I could not reasonably identify until late Thursday the 5th.   I made a report to the Omaha World Herald news tip line an hour after the event and they said no one had called about the lights but they would check with the Ralston Police Dept (I had not notified them, just the newspaper).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came across your website today with the phone number and called.  No one at work on Friday when I posted an e-mail on the bulletin board responded as having seen it and I took a good bit of ribbing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the individual who submitted this excellent report.  He describes his background, which clearly qualifies him as an excellent witness, who should be quite familiar with observation of the sky.  PD))<n>

Then it seemed to change direction and turn west and started to pull towards us at quite high speed, perhaps around 400-450 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then shot over some houses and fields in nearby Springville and over the interstate about 250 ft. behind our truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I clearly saw it, it was dark gray and was an oval shape.  When it crossed the interstate, it was probably only 400 or so ft&#39; above ground.  Also, the disk made no noise and on the bottom of the disk there was a blue-metalic cross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it crossed the interstate, the car radio changed frequency and ever since this accident, the radio keeps playing up.<n>

My office is on the 15th floor and faces NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking out the window at a more northerly angle, watching planes making their approach to O’Hare when I noticed a dark gray cloud, for the lack of a better word, hovering near the airport.  I say &#34;cloud&#34; because the edges did not seem well defined.  From my vantage point, I would estimate that the &#34;cloud&#34; was about a quarter to half mile south of the airport, at approximately 500 ft off the ground.  The &#34;cloud&#34; was  about 150-200 ft in length and 50 ft in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a strange cloud at first, but watched because it was so odd looking and just a little out of place.  There were high level clouds that day but nothing anywhere near as low.  After a minute, another identical cloud approached the first from the north and hovered at the same height about 100 feet away.  The first cloud then slowly moved off to the north, followed by the second cloud about 15 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have kept an eye on that area since and have not seen anything else out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ------------ ]           ] ] ohare     ] ]           ] ------------  O objects     O  Oakbrook tower<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I assumed it was a late firework, and ran around to her side of the table.  There was a grouping of lights in the dark sky.  There were five, yellowish-white round lights in the sky.  They were traveling at a slow gliding pace through the dark sky.  There was no noise.  There was a sixth light following closely behind.  Further back a seventh light followed.  We ran through the house to the front door to continue seeing them.  We ran, excitedly exclaiming, &#34;It&#39;s a UFO&#34;.  We opened the front door and were able to continue watching them travel through the sky.  i immediately yelled for my husband to come quickly, that he had to see this.  He came out and also watched them as the went through the sky, the first five, then the sixth, and ultimately the seventh.  The first grouping made a wide turn to the east and the sixth and seventh made the same wide turn heading east as if following.  There was no noise outside at that time.  it was very quiet with no sound of any kind.  The objects were not at a high enough level for aircraft and certainly had no corresponding sounds.  They were not fireworks as they stayed on the same level trajectory and same consistent light.  Embers from fireworks would have died down and gone towards the ground. We all three are certain we did not see any type of aircraft or fireworks.  The objects were lower than aircraft but much higher than birds would fly. We can not explain what would have caused this unusual sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it seemed to be sitting still and emitted off two orange objects that then turned into what seemed to be fireworks. We originally thought that it was a plane and then realized it was hovering. The object seemed to be gaining altitude while moving in a southern direction. While it was moving upwards, it emitted four more orange objects, although, they did not turn into &#34;fireworks&#34; this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object seemed to be losing altitude at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then disappeared completely.<n>

I was looking at the fireworks in the distances when suddenly I noticed some sort of aircrafy coming from the right of me. I don&#39;t know the cardinal direction. I believe I saw what is called a &#34;Black Triangle.&#34; The craft was moving slowly, low to the grounds at least by 2-3 miles and with no noise coming from it at all. I describe it as having white lights at the corners of it and alternating red flashing lights. It was SO CREEPY, I&#39;m telling you. It disappeared behind the rooftop of my house. I back up to continue looking at it behind the rooftop, then decide to go in the front of the house. I was too late as it disappeared, most-likely behind the neighbors house in front of me. It flew in a straight path sorta leaning in my direction as it flew. There isn&#39;t any aircraft I know that could fly that low and not make any noise. It had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first a fireball near about a thousand feet high. It slowly moved away then was unseen. As we were leaving another showed then was gone just as fast. As we turned down a street a block away we noticed two fiery balls this time. About eight hundred feet above us this time.( nothing like I’ve ever seen, it was like you could really see flames pulsating off of the craft) As they were moving closer the one trailing the other moved down amazingly fast then swooped in front of the other. One would speed up fast then the other and on and on. Never once could you hear a noise coming from any direction it was a quiet night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year the fire works in the neighborhood we were in were going amazingly high with bright beautiful colors this year. We watched them soar above all of the fireworks going off for about seven or eight minutes. When they got close enough you could see a fireball in the center and a beautiful orange haze like you get around street lights when it rains. I’ve heard stories and seen videos before but this made me a true believer, I’ll probably never see anything like it again in this small town. We’re pretty much smack dab in the middle of the US.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing that could move like these objects did but a UFO. They were right above us and in less than ten minutes they were tiny little specs in space. We counted five fireballs in a time span of twenty minutes, the weirdest thing is I took some video of the second one we saw and when I went to show my mother there was nothing on the screen. It just wasn’t there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a light high in the sky followed by 3 dimmer lights. They moved from southwest to northeast then dissapeared from view. They appeared to be very high in the atmosphere, perhaps in space. About 5 minutes went by and I saw them or another set of lights again in the same part of the sky. One rather bright light followed by 3 dimmer lights moving from southwest to northeast. Then they dissapeared from view. This happened in exactly the same way about every 5 minutes for 20 minutes or so. People around me either didn&#39;t see them or just were watching the show. My mother was another witness to this. I don&#39;t know what these lights were but they were very high, perhaps spacecraft. What struck me as odd was that I saw the same lights every 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw an orange fireball move right to left, than hover. I am not the only one to see it yesterday July 4, 2007. I was inside helping my girlfriend cook, when my brother says come outside there is a strange light in the sky. I  ran outside to see what it was. I looked up and saw an orange fireball moving south west. Almost like a meteor without a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, my hole family came outside and saw it, as well as my next door neighbors. I was astonished when the fireball like light stopped and started to move backwards towards north east. It then stopped again and hovered for about five minutes. I could not believe what I was seeing at this point. Everyone on my street, outside at the time, saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering, the light then changed direction again. It start to head east. I watched it move off in the distance and become real dim. It looked like it turned into a star and then disappeared. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before. It was so odd that I got goose bumps all over my body. I was actually freaked out by the strange orange fireball looking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/07 22:15|Loveland|CO|Other|30 minutes|Crescent shaped bright object with green and red edges seen through telescope.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58341.html|394|ndxe200707| Crescent shaped bright object with green and red edges seen through telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fireworks display on July 4th, my husband and I were headed home a short distance away.  I happened to look toward the mountains in the west and saw what appeared to be a huge star perhaps 3 fingerbreadths above the foothills which are about a mile and a half from where we are located..  I alerted my husband and he saw it too. At first I thought it might be a planet, but I had been observing Jupiter recently which is the brightest “star” in the night sky, and this object was about twice the size and brightness of Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were headed to a party 2 houses down the block where we live but after 10 minutes or so  I went home to watch from my backyard, hoping perhaps to set up my telescope and be able to discern its shape.  I looked toward the west again and watched it for another 10 minutes or so.  It was stationary to my eye but just as I decided to lug out my telescope, the light from this object became dimmer until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night it was there again at about the same time  but I was only able to watch for about 5 minutes before is disappeared again.  I surmised that  the object was stationary and had not actually vanished but slowly disappeared behind the mountains due to the rotation of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the third night (July 6th)  I saw it again in  what appeared to be the same place.  This time I immediately got out my telescope.   With the naked eye, although it was very bright, I could see that it wasn’t exactly circular in shape, seeming to have a couple of sharp points.  When I focused my telescope I was amazed to see an object which was roughly crescent shaped, with the rounded side facing downwards toward the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One edge had a reddish hue and the other edge was greenish but the colors and the entire object seemed to be shimmering or more accurately, waving.  I thought that perhaps I was visualizing an atmospheric distortion so I focused my scope on Jupiter which was more southerly.  I could see the planet very clearly and distinctly with no distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the lens of the telescope this UFO was approximately 3 times the size of Jupiter and the light from it was not the almost pure white light which emanates from the planet Jupiter.  The light from this object was slightly warmer with the red and green edges as I mentioned.  I am sorry that I didn’t think to get my video camera out to film it.   After the 6th,  I have not seen this object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I don&#39;t drink), I was putting my boat up when a &#39;amber colored light&#39; caught my eye, moving from south-to-north. I yelled at my wife to look up, she did. We both saw an object, amber in color, the shape of a cylinder .. it was a darker amber on the edges and as you looked toward the center, the it was still amber but more lighter than the edges. There were no red and green light, there were no blinking lights at all. There was no sound. From the time I saw it moving toward me, then right above me, then on to the north and then out-of-sight it took about five minutes. The Stanly County Airport in New London, NC is the closest airport. Is there any way their radar can be checked for that time and see if you can see any thing, perhaps a blimp that passed over my address between 22:15pm - 22:30pm ?.. There were hundreds of boats out on the lake (Lake Tillery) on that evening and there had to be hundreds of other people who saw the same thing I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone tell me what this was ?  Thank you.<n>

It had a light so bright it illuminated where we were, and we were in the dark relaxing<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept looking at it amazed, and then as we were looking at it, it disappeared and it was gone!!! I didn’t know what to do; I was in shock of what I had just seen. This was a high area where it appeared, lots of people saw it and all knew it was something else, like a UFO.

From a distance it looks like the light is brighting and fading and turning around, or changing shape so then I think that can&#39;t be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the newely built Firewheel Town Center to watch fireworks and noticed one of these similar lights in the sky and thought I would take pictures since the fireworks had not started.  When I took the pictures I had the zoom on my digital camera on all the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was kind of amazed at what I saw when I zoomed into the pictures on word like it was changing shapes.  The sky was pitch black and there was a smaller star looking thing close by.  The fireworks would have been going off infront of where I was and this light was on my right.  A couple of the pictures look like rockets with no light and smoke trail that accidentally maybe a couple of fireworks, but I don&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is Navy vet and college student. I know the object could probably be anything, but I thought I would send the pictures.<n>

Looked at it through binoculars and it looked like a ball of fire burning steadily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights on it indicating a helicopter or airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it started throbbing in light intensity at maybe 80 cycles per minute. It then started to move on after being virtually still, gaining speed then suddenly disappearing, as if it were switched off. It then reappeared a little further down range moving southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought at first it might be a flare but it did not move like one because it would stop, change in intensity, then move on, slowly at first but rapidly gaining speed, plus it did disappear briefly and suddenly only to reappear maybe 20 seconds latter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us were drinking or using any sort of drugs...size wise it had the same perspective as the planet Venus. It actually was near Venus, as well as Saturn , at one point, and separate from the two, so it was not the planet Venus as I could see both Venus and the object in question. I am super blown away that this has been reported in previous years, consecutively , on the same date.....It was very hard to Gage just how high up it was. We all saw it, it was a real anomaly.....<n>

I had photographed a cigar shaped UFO about two week prior following repeated helicopter flyovers and the sighting of a fast moving disc, which was submitted to your site as well as to MUFON.   This was the same sort of feeling...a powerful sense of presence.    I grabbed my Sony DSC-H5 digital SLR with 2x telephoto and 10x internal optical zoom.   I set the internal zoom to approx. 3.5x and to the automatic setting.   I began to shoot a series of bursts at treetop level...the camera will shoot anywhere from 3 to 5 images in quick succession, usually less than a second apart.   One of the final series of &#39;bursts&#39; captured a V-shaped formation of at least nine objects in the second of five shots.   I did not see anything when I shot the images.   I was making sure to not photograph birds as I first framed the shot and focused through the viewscreen and then visually scanned the skies before hitting the shutter button.   There were no birds in sight.   The fourth image also showed an object sittng just above a branch.   I later put together a rough animated gif (which is being sent to you) in the hopes that I can be told that these are bugs that fly in formation and then do zig zagging maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speaking of maneuvers...the Blue Angels were in SE Michigan that evening, temporarily based at Willow Run Airport approx. 30 miles to the east of my location.   They did a flyover at the start of the Detroit Tigers-Cleveland Indians game at Comerica Park in Detroit.   I did not hear any aircraft when shooting these images...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This series of photos as well as the previous cigar shaped object photographed have occurred in the skies which seem to be a main air corridor for large commercial and cargo jets flying eastward out of Chicago.    These objects are flying around in relatively busy airspace.   I would think that the FAA should be concerned.<n>

We were standing by the car talking about the events of the day when I caught a glimpse of an object traveling at a high rate of speed under the cloud cover of a storm system that was moving in. It was bright red, and round in shape. It was traveling from West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a diameter of about 30ft, and it was not just the color of red, but rather glowed red. I quickly noted the speed and oddness of it and my step father said he was wondering about it too, out of the 4 of us only him and I were facing the best direction to see have seen it. It was so quick that the other two were unable to turn quick enough to catch a glimpse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a light reflected off the clouds, because I saw it in the opening of the cloud cover first then it traveled under the cloud bank as it headed Eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with it and no other affects from it. It did not leave a tail or anything visible behind it. It did not vanish but rather maintained it&#39;s speed and direction and traveled out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minute prior to the passing a shuttle had went over head landing at the local airport. Nothing else was seen in the sky.<n>

She proceeded to walk through our 3 story home searching for the source of the vibrational movement.  Having searched all of the rooms, and finding no one else awake (being that there were 4 other people in the house), and no source for the hum, she returned to her bedroom that looks out over the high desert (i.e. Victorville area) mountains and saw a green ball of light moving at a high rate of speed over the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my dad what it might be and his reply was it was a planet. Thirty minutes later, I stepped outside to take a picture of it and it was gone. It reappeared 3 minutes later across the sky. I noticed it had an orange blinking light a few feet underneath it. It moves upwards in a very slow pace. Twenty minutes apart. It&#39;s very bright and looks like it would be a bright head light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at the sky and I focused on one &#34;star&#34;. After a while I noticed the &#34;star&#34; started moving. I thought my eyes were playing tricks wth me, so I focused on another star. To prove my point the second star didn&#39;t move. I turned toward the first star. It was still there but in a different location. I kept looking at it think it might have been a plane, but I don&#39;t know of any plane that emits a white light and hovers. So then I thought it was a helicopter. But I know helicopters can&#39;t fly that high. Then it moved in a straight line, but it wasn&#39;t no usual line. As it was moving it would shuttered. It would dip down and then back up, while keeping it&#39;s forward momentum. Then it stopped. During this time I was rushing around to find my video camera, but when I found it I couldn&#39;t focus enough on it to get a good picture. I couldn&#39;t see anything through the camera, so I put it down. And in the corner of my eye I saw more movement. I turn towards the movement and I noticed two lights moving in a cirrcular motion. They stopped and then one took off going away from me and as it was leaving it would pulse a white light. It would light up and then slowly die out. It repeated this until I lost sight of it. Then I looked at the other one. It did the same thing maybe a minute later. Then I looked back at the first &#34;star&#34;. It was in the same area but once again it moved in location. Then I saw another light leave from the star I was looking at and I followed that with my eyes. Then I would look at other lights noticing that most of them moved in the way the first one did. I kept watching them, not noticing the almost 2 hours have past. I hated to leave it but I had to go to sleep. But all day today I have been thinking about what I had seen last night. I still don&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was passed by in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, still unable to sleep, I was watching T.V. and saw a light shooting up into the clouds. I do not think this was a firework because there was no sound and it was moving up too fast.

My friend saw the ufo over my head and didnt think much of it. It first appeared like a airplane, a slow moving light, almost a cylinder shape. i saw the light it was very bright and very white. It was moving slow, the speed of a aircraft. Although the ufo wasnt very high off the ground, possibly a mile to 2miles high max. The slow moving light got brighter and shaped more like a cylinder and sped away at a extremely fast speed. The ufo was only in my sight for about 3seconds. The light was bright enough and big enough to know it wasnt a plane, and it wasnt a shooting star because the object was moving slow, then sped away at a very fast pace. It was a awesome sighting, my first sighting i could say without a doubt it was a ufo, very cool. key points about the ufo, it made no sounds. The ufo was very low, and it was very bright. The bright light was white in color, and the ufo changed it shape into a more cylinder shape when it started to speed away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The place was packed with a lot of people cause it was the day before the Fourth of July.  As we were walking towards the ticket booth at the entrance of the Theatre we noticed that everyone was looking up at the sky..taking pictures and using their cells to capture what we saw up in the sky.  It was a Circular object..with pinkish/green lights (about 5)   flying over in the night sky.  At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane since its in the direction of the John Wayne Airport...but the swift hoovering and flight pattern was too quick and very unusual.  It definitely caught my friends and my attention, as well as all the people there at the Spectrum mall in irvine.  It then descended in such a weird and fast fashion and dissappeared behind the buildings.  I haven&#39;t heard anything about it... and although I don&#39;t believe in this sort of stuff...it left my friends and myself wondering... I feel so cliche saying this, but..I Am certain I saw a unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I often stare at the night sky for long periods of time in my pool or hot tub but never before have I witnessed anything like what I saw on the night of July 3rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 11:00pm and 1:00am I saw roughly 8-10 star like objects silently move across the clear night sky.  From my limited research it appears I could have witnessed the International Space Station (haven&#39;t verified it could bee seen from my location at that time)pass over head which I may have but that doesn’t explain the other 8+ objects I saw and they all kind of looked the same with the exception of one shooting star like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting I saw one traveling from my north towards the east horizon followed closely by a similar object trailing a few seconds slightly off the path of the first object. The rest seemed to be traveling roughly in the opposite direction, each traveling from horizon to horizon in a matter of minutes and some appeared to be moving in a less than perfect straight line. During all this I witnessed numerous shooting stars as one would expect however one was unlike any I have ever seen before, much brighter and much slower with a long white tail similar to those I’ve seen on pictures of comets. I must have watched it for about 15+ seconds when it suddenly disappeared low on my horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It paused, made an impossible 90 degree turn, and shot rapidly across the sky, paused again, and then made another 90 degree turn. It then slowly circled around (like reversing direction), then made another impossible turn in the opposite direction at a rapid rate. No noise, was very high in the sky. So absolutely cannot be confused with a firefly, fireworks, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, witnessed a regular plane crossing the sky in the direction of where the object was. Not sure if it was a coincidence or if it was trying to follow the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw a large object that was &#34;parked&#34; on the ground with lights facing down and hitting brush back up. I wanted to take a closer look but my husband had a bad feeling and continued forward. We then saw a hovering light in the sky, too low to be a star but too high to be a light. We where going about 55-60 M.P.H., the U.F.O. stayed stationary and then as we go closer we see another about 20 degrees lower and to the right. We passed the first one then it was in the rear window, saw it lift straight up, stayed still, then zip to the right (if you where facing it. The one that was to the right was then right below. We then see one to our passenger(3 total) window approximately as far as the two out our drives passenger window.

As we are sharing a cigarette, she tells me to look in a certain direction of the sky.  I think I was looking WEST.  I was the same direction as going on Route 124 or 24 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be easier to draw.  But there was a big shiny, what looked to be a star.  Biggest and brightest I have seen.  Then there was a little dot or light to the right of it.  My girlfriend went in and I kept looking at it bc there was something different about it.  As I was focusing on it, I saw, what could have been an orb or something making me realize it may be a shape.  I saw twinkling light appear on this outline where it connected the big shiny star and the other small tiny light towards and parrallel to it.  This last about 10 minutes.  I went back inside to get my girlfriend to see that if you look, there are little light going around and connecting at those points giving it the shape of an oval or disk or something.  My girlfriend was already laying in bed and didn&#39;t want to get up.  I figured maybe it was nothing.  What are the chances?  I went inside, got some money to walk across the street and get some coffee.    When I came back outside, I didn&#39;t see it anymore.  I looked over to the EAST to see if I saw a particular star that was present before and it was moved, but still there.  Most stars were still there as the 10 minutes past.  But didn&#39;t see the object.  Then realized there was cloud cover in that area.  So I chalked it down to it did not move, but was just being covered by some clouds.  It may move some but should be close to the orginal positon bc not much time did pass.  Maybe 10-15 minutes.  After getting some coffee and a dougnut, I headed back, but decided to have another cigarette and see if the cloud cover passes bc I want to find that image again.  I wasn&#39;t that patient and just said, it is the cloud cover.  But then as I am looking in the sky, saying I wish I didnt go to get coffee and doughnuts, I noticed behind the clouds there was some light or haze creating what looked to be a disk or orb.  I counted that every 9 or 10 seconds, the lightt would go around.  Looked like there was searchlights, but it didnt go into the sky.  It was behind the cloud, and looked liked a cir! cle.  I went inside and yelled and my gf to get up and look, but she did not bc I went right back out there.  I rubbed my eyes.  I looked again and confirmed tro myself what I am seeing.  Except the big light that happened on the 9th or 10th second.  Then saw the outline of a disk lighted up expect was not the same in light intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Resembled the shape seen before expect not so visible.  I went back to my house which is about 2 minutes away and found this website.  I first called, but then was requested to write on this site.  I collected my thoughts.   Went back to see what I saw and it wasn&#39;t there anymore.  I went back home and tried calling the FAA in Newark.  The line was busy.  Tried for about 30 minutes.  Wanted to know if they were AWARE OR WAS HAVING SEARCHLIGHT ETC.  I tried to get it with my phone.  Haven&#39;t seen it yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind the clouds  I did see other aircraft that were planes in the area, but nothing like thaT<n>

It did not appear to travel in a straight line, nor was it heading in a usual path that planes travel.

Once I started fillig in this report, it did have a chevron shape as it was passing over.<n>

I started thinking to myself, that I don’t remember that bright of a star being in that direction.  So I watched it through the breaks in the foliage of the tree, when I realized it was moving, very slowly.  I got up and went outside, as I was walking outside, the view of the object was obscured, by more trees, but I noticed it had moved.  I ran out into a clearing of the field and watched it move from near due south to a south-western orientation within about 15 seconds.  The object came to a rest, and did not move (hovering), for a good 30 minutes.  My wife came outside to get me, and then she went out and witnessed it move to a more western position.  So we decided to get in the car, and try to drive towards the location, as we drove to the east for about 15 minutes we noticed that the object had completely disappeared.  The object was very bright white/blue color, brighter than anything else in the sky besides the moon.  It proceed to fade out to a yellow glow and disappear, as if the object was moving further way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are both college educated people, that both work for a software company.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter is quite prominent in the southern sky, currently.

I have owned this family property for over 40+years, and to the Northwest sky, noticed a triangular cluster of lights hovering over the tree tops in the distance.  Firstly, I thought this to be stars, however they were too low to the treetops.  The lights were distinctively triangulated with possibly the bottom row containing lights of color or motion between the two corners of the triangle (pyramid) shape.  These lights were observed for 4-6 minutes.  I told my 17 year-old daughter to come out on the deck and see.  She observed, saying &#34;I was freaking her out with this sighting.&#34;  She went inside with me and when I returned the lights were gone.  There are no towers or residents within this area that are lighted at this elevation.  Furthermore, the sky seemed to become increasingly clearer after this sighting exited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were small and traveled without turbulence easily through the air. A crowd of over 200 people was present, although I am not sure they were paying close attention to the skies. The 4-5 were not in the air all at once - only in 15 min. increments. Many people were yelling out &#34;aliens!&#34;. I don&#39;t believe in UFOs, but this needs to be reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While filling it I stood facing north so that I was not looking directly into the very bright sun to my left (West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started looking up into the northern sky when I noticed an object that was stationary and gleaming in the very bright sun and was at the altitude of normal airliners. After I completed my honeydew chores and rolling up the hose, which took about 15 minutes in total I again looked for the object and I found it was still in the very same spot including that it was still stationary and apparently had not moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my wife thru our patio door and asked her to come and look at some object and tell me what she thought. I pointed to it and she said, “I don’t know what that is, but it is not moving at all and maybe it is a big balloon”. My wife then went and got me our binoculars so we could take a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WoW, came out of my mouth while looking at it, as it was visibly quite large, circular with a weird combination of red-green-silver haze around it. I then gave the binoculars to my wife and said, “You got to take a look at this”. Well, to say we were both astonished is an understatement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary for another 25-30 minutes and then started moving directly north at a very slow pace and in fact so slow that I initially thought it had stopped moving again. As the object moved northerly the red-silver glow was more apparent and the greenish hue totally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for a good 40 minutes and I still do not understand what I was looking at, but I can definitely tell you it was NOT a balloon or any type of man made aircraft including a helicopter at that height.  I am still stunned thinking about it and wanted to report it accordingly. My wife and I have never seen anything like this and we both thought it should be reported, discreetly. I again want to state that this object was extremely large and far bigger than any airliner I have ever observed at that height.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked back at the road and looked up again thinking that I had never seen a bird able to keep afloat for that amount of time without utilizing its wings. As I stared longer I realized it was not a bird at all. In fact it was something that I could not explain. I seem to want to compare it to a submarine that was flying. Or maybe a missile, due to its shape. It was black and long and thin, similar to a cigar. It seemed to have small fins sticking out of its sides. Again I was on my motorcycle and so I could not here any sounds, nor did I see any lights. Its movement was not that of a rocket, because it did not move in a linear manner. I would liken its movement to someone holding it on a string and pulling it up and down, and if it weren’t for the height of the object in the sky, roughly 500 feet, and location, over a heavily wooded area, I would swear someone was holding it up on a fishing line. It slowly moved north and soon was out of my view. I am a former airman in the U.S Air Force and have seen lots of crazy flying machines, but this was like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was between the hours of 1pm and 5pm.  I happened to look up into the sky.  There was a light layer of clouds in an otherwise blue summer sky.  What caught my attention was what appeared to be a shadow in the form of a disk, which was going north.  It was against the backdrop of the clouds.  I watched it move across the cloud formation until it entered the blue sky.  At that point I was no longer able to see it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just wondering whether anyone has reported a similar occurance in the past, or whether this can be explained as something natural?<n>

Several minutes later a second &#34;spot&#34; was sighted almost due north moving in a southerly direction. The west moving object continued on a on a straight path until out of sight before the horizon but the south moving object abruptly changed to a northwesterly heading and appeared to lose altitude (or move farther away) at a rapid pace. Both objects were lost to sight just before noon. The second object appeared to be about the same size as the ISS when viewed in the night sky with the first object appearing slightly smaller. The second object also seemed to be slowly changing brightness (pulsating?).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed very out of place, so i pointed it out to my manager. We watched as is slowly went from east to west, at what appeared to be a very, very high altitude. As it went westward, I noticed another &#34;object&#34; in the sky. It was the same color and size, but this one seemed to be pulsating...light, dark, light, dark. Both objects seemed to be silver in color, but none got close enough to actually make out any details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object began moving to the north, again at a very high altitude. Suddenly, the second object began descending rapidly, while moving in a zig-zag pattern. Certainly not a random movement. After several minutes, the second object vanished over the horizon. The first object, which had become hidden behind a tree, suddenly rose up again, and headed in the direction that the first one went. It quickly followed the other object and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a white plane with red markings in the vicinity, circling the area. I did not recognize the plane, but it was a prop plane with a fixed overhead wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seen near downtown Seattle from the east across Lake Washington approx 4 miles away? Object moved horizontally then vertically within a box/square of space for about 3 minutes. Main object moved through different colors from white, yellow then red/blue - very bright. As the sighting continued, the main object was “buzzed” by very small, round, white light that gave off quick light bursts near the object approx. 5 times, before it ceased. Then, the main object gave off bright light burst and moved vertical slightly before it disappeared completely. GONE!  As background: The night sky was relatively clear with no noticeable wind and just a few high clouds. I used the tree line to measure the object’s unconventional movement. At the same time, I observed several airplanes making their approach/departures near SeaTac airport. I clearly observed aircraft and stars before and after the “EVENT”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above described round orb and little light are like nothing else I’ve witnessed in night sky, not even remotely. I&#39;ve been thinking about this all day, and it&#39;s still with me very strongly. I was just standing on my deck looking at the view and it really spooked me to see something so strange and have it stay with me so vividly. I decided to search online to see if anyone else saw anything unusual in the area to no avail, but I feel obligated to report this. I am an educated individual and for sure skeptical of UFOs. But, this was definitely beyond what I can explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The way this object began to move around was definitely not like any jet, acrobatic plane (I’ve been to many air shows), helicopter or anything I’ve seen. It gyrated, back and forth, sort of wobbling, then scooped down like it was going to crash, shot back up again vertically, hovered a bit, gyrated AGAIN - even moving backwards, and then swooshed down again and so forth. The kids couldn’t believe their eyes and neither could I. I have never seen anything in the sky move like this. I have seen many Vandenberg air force base launches, and this was not anything like a rocket launch. We hope other folks got to experience this unique air show!<n>

We left St. Louis around 7pm. The sighting took place on hwy 17 between licking and success. Anyway it was around 8 or 9pm and was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 7 (i beleive 7) oarnge colored lights that appeared to be on top of a hill side about 4 miles off. However the 7 lights must have stretched 1/2 mile or so and they turned on and off in no specific order. Then we came to a curve in the road and the lights were not sitting on the horizon hillside but they were up in the air. Im guessing the hight of a small plane. The lights were in a straght line, It was too dark to see an outline so I cant say the shape, only that the lights stretched about 1/2 mile. The lights would turn off and on in differnt orders. Some times lights 1 2 and 7 would light up, then all would lights up, then some would go out and come back on. They did not flicker and did not blink. I was in the navy on an aircraft carrier and I also live close to St.Louis airport. This was not a plane, Too big and it had oarnge lights, no blue or red lights, no white lights.  Also I know it was not military flares, do to the way they would light up. Sometimes 7th light and 2nd light would light. Then all would light, then most would turn off and later come back on. I thought it was really cool what we seen, However my wife was not impressed until a show on the history channel. It was a UFO show, UFO over illinois, I showed her what was on and then see was schocked, because the lights they show were what we saw. Also there is a video of UFO I beleive in Mexico, were a huge object is filmed over the city, with a straight row of lights that just turned on, It was very similar to that. I know that there is a military base close to my sighting, Fourt Leonardwood, But again, there is no way this was an aircraft, I don&#39;t know what it was but it was realy something to see.

These creatures were within 20 feet from the bed of my truck about to take the corner of the fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reacted by throwing my truck into drive, drove to the nearest gas station and started crying.

When I turned to where the noise was coming from I saw a big triangle shaped object hovering over the trailers. That&#39;s when I ran inside my cousin&#39;s trailer and called him out. By the time he came out the UFO was over his house. It was about 400 feet over his house and had red lights on each end, with round edges. We watched it for a couple seconds and it went away behind a tree, we didn&#39;t see it after that. It was a grayish black color. We called our parents out when I called my cousin, but they didn&#39;t want to see it because they thought we were lying and were watching TV.

My att|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57397.html|457|ndxe200707| I was walking back from my shop to my house and looked up.  The sky was partly overcast, but no rain, a few stars were visible.  My attention was drawn to an orange/red light coming from the northeast, heading southwest.  It was moving fairly slow, and was below the cloud cover.  There was no visible flashing of the light that I could see, just a steady orang/red glow.  I listened for the sound of jet or prop driven plane, but could not hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife using my cell phone and asked her to come outside.  That was at 21:55 PST.  My wife came outside and just after she did, the object stopped moving.  It remained stationary for roughly a minute.  My wife went to find our digital camera.  The object started moving again, a bit slower than before, but now it had changed it&#39;s direction slightly, now heading more south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, my 13 year old daughter had come outside as well and watched as the light continued south.

At the top of a gentle hill I looked straight down the road running through the condo complex to the Pacific Ocean.  At the foot of the hill there are tall Norfolk pine trees on both sides framing the Pacific Ocean beyond.  Between these trees, over the ocean (cannot judge how far out) in the dark starless sky I saw a gigantic bright emerald green object that looked like a beach ball crushed from top and bottom into a shape like an oval with very narrow sides.  It was deeper green around the edges of the object.  It seemed to be floating over the ocean but I could see no reflection on the water.  I was quite fascinated by the vibrancy of the green color one the outer edges of the object.  I stood there watching it possibly two and a half to three minutes and then it shot off straight out to sea, not up, as best I could tell and disappeared immediately.  No afterglow as it disappeared.  It was just gone!  I rushed inside and called the Santa Barbara Sheriff&#39;s office and asked if they had any reports on green foreign objects in the sky.  Non emergency calls were being picked up in the Santa Maria Sheriff&#39;s department for some reason and I was told I could not get a contact for a non-emergency here in Santa Barbara.  The woman who answered informed me, &#34;Whatever you think you saw it&#39;s three days before Fourth of July.  If you really did see something it was early fireworks.&#34;  I am 79 years old and I&#39;ve seen fireworks all my life from Los Angeles to Washington DC to France to China.  I know fireworks when I see them.  This had nothing to do with fireworks!  I then called a friend who is into astronomy seriously and he contacted people he knows involved in it but none of them saw anything.  I didn&#39;t know where else to turn so dropped it, other than for conversation starter at boring dinner parties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing you on Larry King tonight I decided I would file a report.  I was not drinking, I am a very successful published author and lecturer. still working at 79, who is totally balanced mentally and I have good eyesight.  I know what I saw and it was unlike anything I have ever seen before, outside of science fiction movies and my granddaughter&#39;s cartoon shows on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I felt a &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; of air like a soft air marshmallow sized puff that popped right out of my throat and mouth! It was an orange, marshmallow sized &#34;light ball&#34;  I chased it over the bed and before I could touch it, It flew around my bedroom and darted behind our dresser.  I did not look behind the dresser. I never saw it before and never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a highly respected wildlife artist with feet firmly on the ground.<n>
