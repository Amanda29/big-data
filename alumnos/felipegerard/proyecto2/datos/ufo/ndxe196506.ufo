6/30/65 23:00|Fountain Valley|CA|Sphere|5 minutes|Round orange object with a tail traveling down from the, that stopped in midair and hovered, then disappeared toward the east|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68689.html|1|ndxe196506| Round orange object with a tail traveling down from the, that stopped in midair and hovered, then disappeared toward the east<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened back in the 1960’s over Fountain Valley, CA.  I had just gone to bed, and happened to be looking at the stars from my bedroom window.  I saw what I thought was a meteor….At that point it was traveling from the  south to north. It was orange and had a tail.  I jumped up out of the bed, to see where it was going to hit, because it was close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing happened at that point.  It stopped in mid-air, and the tail appeared to disappear within the object.  It hovered for a few seconds and then turned to the east and disappeared over Saddleback Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran down the stairs to tell my husband what I saw, and of course, he told me, &#34;Go back to sleep.&#34;  Well, I had only been in bed for a few minutes and was not sleeping or dreaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was frustrating not to be believed, but the next morning, the news,  might have been KFI as I like that station, it was that reported a UFO was  seen over Fountain Valley.  I said:  &#34;There, do you believe me now?&#34;  He didn’t say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reported on the radio that there were several military planes in the vicinity, and they attempted to chase it, but it disappeared so quickly over the mountains that they realized there was no way they could follow it at the speed it was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was seen over Arizona, and New Mexico within minutes.  I have no idea what I was looking at, but since I was listening to KFI again this evening, it was urged that I report what I saw.  This is what I saw.  I still am amazed by it. I have never seen the likes of it before, or after that night.<n>

I watched for a long time driving toward it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my friend in the back seat and asked if he seen anything he looked and said what is it?  We both watch as it continued to make its journey to the ground and back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it streaked across the sky at least 90 degrees and started doing same thing.  It wasn&#39;t in front of me any longer so I didn&#39;t watch as I had before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after leaving area (the ufo), three search plane came to area it had been in and flew around in circles.  When I reached Binghamton I found a phone and called the airfoce who denied sending planes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer 1965 is approximate.  PD))<n>

And,|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87271.html|3|ndxe196506| It was a summer night.  While I was walking, going into my house I looked up above my neighbors&#39; house about 30 feet above the roof.  And, I saw a UFO.   It was oval with lights around the outside of it, underneath.  Its size was about 30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a metalic material.  It was silent,  No noise,  It was hovering and not moving.  It was so close I felt it could of been a possible abduction.  I went in the house and came back, instantly it was gone when I came back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all these years I just needed to tell someone before I pass on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in the 1960&#39;s is approximate.

6/30/65 19:00|Elkins|AR|Disk|10 minutes|On a clear night you could see the saucer|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70545.html|5|ndxe196506| On a clear night you could see the saucer<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear summer night in 1965.  I was ten years old and was sitting outside with my parents, our neighbors and their daughter who was about seven years old at the time.  There was a full moon and my dad said, &#34;What is that object that looks like it is coming from the moon?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked up to where he was pointing and there is was, up very high in the sky, a disk shape with colored lights around it.  The lights were blues, reds and a strange glowing green color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all watched this craft, it stayed in the same spot in the sky but the lights moved on the craft in a round about motion.  The adults discussed what it might be and any kind of air craft of the date/time was ruled out.  No air plane no blimp, no helicopter.  You could not hear any sounds coming from the craft most likely due to the distance that it was from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although, it was as if we watched the craft for no longer than a five minute period, when the craft finally moved it took off very quickly flying to the left and disappeared like it had never been there.  When the adults checked the time, it was as if a whole hour had gone by that no one could account for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors left for home my family went to bed and this incident was never discussed again.  I asked my mother about it many times after it happened and she kept saying she did not know what I was taking about.  It was so strange the way everyone acted afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have a small scar area on my upper arm I did not have before that night.  Not painful and not sure how I got it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Deputy Sherif who stood beside me when the Craft was first observed. I told him to get the ---out of here , &#34;Unless you want to be a thousand times more freaked out than youve ever been in you life&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one ocasion I do recal the alen advising me to forget it, after I had repeatadly told him I would remember it , he  told me :&#34;If I thought you would remember this I would have to kill you&#34;. However I do  belive that threat was nothing more than a threat. I mention this only to advise you that I do belive the alens have a very precise way of blanking out an exact amount of time from your memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why but recently my memories have become much more vivid than they were in the past. The alens look very much like the clasic depection that is widly in cerculation {5&#39;,  75 lbs , large black eyes . 4 digets per hand) They are however very much human under the skin . There are also anouther type of alen whom I have incountered only once , (3&#39; 100 lbs, Blue, ) the little blue men are perhaps the sweetest creatures God has ever created ,very gentle in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> {If you call me please identify yourself, because normaly I don&#39;t want people to think I&#39;m crazy so I simply tell them I had a dream of an abduction and leave it at that.}<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the alleged incidents are approximate.

6/30/65 14:00|Mount Shasta|CA|Cigar|30 minutes +|Metallic cigar shaped object, windowless, soundless, motionless, unlighted, daytime/clear blue sky sighting over old Drive-in movie the|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04274.html|7|ndxe196506| Metallic cigar shaped object, windowless, soundless, motionless, unlighted, daytime/clear blue sky sighting over old Drive-in movie theater at the junction of Hwy 89 at Interstate 5.  Very low in the air, 500? It just hung there, sort of tilted to one side.  Many cars and people stopped and watched as this object.  All NB/SB traffic on I-5/Hwy 89, people of Dunsmuir and Mt. Shasta MUST HAVE SEEN THIS!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a 5 or 6 year old child at the time.  We were returning to Mccloud from Mt. Shasta via Hwy 89 at the I-5 interchange.  My mother pulled over at the entrance to the Drive-In Movie theater and I saw other cars stopped and people outside of them looking up into the sky.  I remember my mother being awed, and all the others who were watching.  This cigar shaped, metallic, windowless, soundless, unlighted object was hanging, slightly tilted, in the clear blue afternoon sky.  I know this was the time frame because I remember the sun was behind us as I looked up at it.  I was not overly impressed (at that age) but I could tell the adults were.  My dad and I always watched the space shots, I remember him telling me the news said it was some type of satelite or rocket part falling from the sky.  But it never fell, or moved at all.  I remember even as a small child I knew this was not true and wondered why this explanation was given.  I do not know the duration of the event.  It was actually rather boring after you got over the shock of this strange thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually we quit watching and drove on home.  I do not know the duration of the event but estimate it as 30 minutes +, (about that time is all we watched but it was there when we went on, still hanging.  I have always wanted to speak to others who witnessed this, especially those older than myself (I&#39;m 39 now)  I wrote this because of seeing other, similar descriptions in other locations during 1964/65 ish.  I will send a map, by mail.  I have not looked for microfished newpaper coverage.  Many, many people had to have observed this object as it was in a very visible, high traffic area being over the interchange of Hwy 89 at I-5 on a very clear, sunny day.  The sun was not in the same part of the sky, it was in the west, behind anyone looking at the object.  It was most directly over the Drive-In Movie theater/Mott Airstrip in the triangle shaped area NE of  the Hwy 89 at I-5 junction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/65 14:00|Brentwood (Long Island)|NY||unknown|My neighbor said I disapeared of the front stoop of my house,|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02832.html|8|ndxe196506| Summary:  My neighbor said I disapeared of the front stoop of my house,<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a day during the summer in the mid 60&#39;s when my dad called me over while he was talking to our neighbor across the street.  My father said that my neighbor, ((Name deleted)), was telling him that he was upset over the fact that I literally disappeared from off my front stoop.  I stood there and looked at him.  How could I have disappeared off of my stoop??  I told him that things like that do not happen.  He said it did.  He said he was working in his yard, he saw me sitting on the stoop, he turned his head for a second, and when he looked back I was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said he must have been mistaken.  I said I must have gone into the house.  He said that there was not enough time..he said he just looked away for a second.  He was really upset about it.  I dismissed the entire thing as something he THOUGHT he saw, and forgot about it.  Who ever heard of abductions during the &#39;60&#39;s.  We had sightings, but that was about it. Many years have passed and now the UFO information we have has grown and opened up many new avenues of thought.  One of these is abductions.  As I was first learning about this during the early &#39;90&#39;s, I suddenly had a flashback to that conversation in the street with my dad and our neighbor. But I had no memory of any abduction..I still don&#39;t.  But what I do have is a very strange memory puzzle that fits together..and it has to do with me being on my front stoop.  When I put put these three pieces together, I came up with this strange story.  Piece one had to do with me sitting on my front stoop.  I saw a light coming from out of the north headed in my general direction. I thought it was a jet.  To think about it now why didn&#39;t I see the body of the jet..it was broad daylight on a summer afternoon. I watched the light seem to slow down and suddenly shoot off to the east.  I remember saying..wow,  a ufo. That was the first piece of memory I have had floating in my head. The second was a memory of me being on the stoop,  and suddenly I felt like absolute garbage.  I was nausious and felt a little dizzy.  I had no clue what was wrong. I tried to get up.  I figured I would go lie down on the patio lounge.  As I got up I felt worse..I was completely disoriented. I staggered towards the gate to go into my back yard and wound up in the garage standing by my bike wondering what was the matter with me.  I finally made it to the lounge, and I remember my mother telling me later that I slept for about two hours or so. IF..these pieces belong together, the picture looks like this.  I was on the stoop.  I saw the UFO coming. It slowed down.  I was grabbed and my neighbor witnessed it even though he looked away for a second.  I was returned, saw the UFO leave..and then the sick disorientation set in.  From there I walked in a disoriented state, from my stoop..to the garage..to the lounge chair and slept for hours.  I now know that this has been going on in my life since the mid &#39;50&#39;s.  As a child I had little people in my room that would advance toward my bed...and that was all I remember. I have had visitors in my teens and adult life. I have managed to pull all of these memories that have been floating in my head for years as undefined strange events,  together to make sense of it all.  The only one I did not understand until fairly recently, was the inner nagging drive to study a particular topic. I had no idea why,  since I was 5 or so, that I had to study this topic. The information did not appear in my life until my early 20&#39;s. It continued in dribs and drabs straight to today. All of this info is on my 20 page web site. http://www.((address deleted)).HTM That&#39;s my story.<n>

This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man&#39;s lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the next instant, &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn&#39;t make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn&#39;t believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren&#39;t tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn&#39;t think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that &#34;this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn&#39;t seem to notice or care about me in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind &#34;her&#34;, to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn&#39;t treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I&#39;m not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don&#39;t know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn&#39;t take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn&#39;t make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don&#39;t remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and &#34;things&#34; flying around it. My impression was &#34;war&#34; I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly &#34;If you know all this, show me how I&#39;m going to die&#34; and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, at this point, I feel more like I&#39;m living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was &#34;I can&#39;t believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn&#39;t someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From there, things are very &#34;fuzzy&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped &#39;thing&#39; being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent&#39;s yard to my bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like &#34;nothing&#34;. There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I&#39;m not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought &#34;Oh, we&#39;re going in my window&#34; but we did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me &#34;Its done. There&#39;s nothing you can do about it&#34; My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of &#34;feeling&#34; that I received from him. &#34;Disturbance of the norm&#34;  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this &#34;scar&#34; by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I&#39;m here. I have a devastating terminal disease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80&#39;s.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I&#39;m calmer in one respect(I&#39;m not the ONLY one) but now, I&#39;m very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating &amp; preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type &#34;crew&#34; and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became a life-long loner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children&#39;s trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn&#39;t believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn&#39;t change any of what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I&#39;ve not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln&#39;t be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the &#34;crew&#34; of the shuttle 4-the &#34;explainer&#34; who walked me past the two humans and showed me the &#34;war&#34; pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the &#34;greys&#34; with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can&#39;t tell you what the&#34;crew&#34; or the &#34;explainer&#34; or the doctors looked like at all. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t remember something this important, but in 40+ years I&#39;ve never remembered their faces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from &#34;torsion of the tube&#34;. No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about &#34;the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner&#34;. I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me &#34;insane&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can&#39;t believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Never have I heard of &#34;death by screwdriver&#34; and I&#39;m no handyman. Usually, I don&#39;t even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn&#39;t do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&amp;Ms, instead of strong medications.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yet, I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn&#39;t know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, I&#39;m not very good at suicide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enough of my life has been taken from me by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I&#39;m happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don&#39;t remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike the other stories I&#39;ve been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn&#39;t asked to touch or hold anything or anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe they take children because we are closer to their size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was &#34;yeah, you have had that for a long time.&#34; I don&#39;t know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like &#34;yeah, aliens, no big deal.&#34; No surprise, no questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don&#39;t permit collect calls. I can&#39;t read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was very beautiful to watch. I believe it was covered with a field of plasma like our Sun.

It was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour.  I thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends.  I ran and hid behind the couch away from the window.  I expected an explosion but heard nothing, so I looked out.  I saw the UFO hovering a block down the street over roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO had descended at 22nd Street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and Mount Vernon Street, moving North then stopping at 22nd and Wallace Street.  I was viewing the object from my Grandmother and Grandfather&#39;s 3rd floor apartment window at 643 North 22nd Street, Philadelphia, Pa, on June 25th, 1968.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church.  It flew just feet above the roof tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops.  It was as if it was viewing inside the homes.  It moved slowly traveling at walking pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference.  It was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. The entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the Sun.  These gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas.  The brightness was intense.  It was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange.  It reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint.  It was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point in my life I think what I saw then was a fusion powered ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my Grandmothers walls.  The patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges.  The patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel&#39;s surface.  The only thing I&#39;ve ever seen similar are close up films of the Sun.  In addition to the swirling patterns of light I noticed it was layered in a dimple pattern that covered its entire surface.  The dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet.  This was truly amazing to see!  At times I used my hands to shield my eyes.  It was the brightest light I&#39;ve ever seen and today I&#39;m sixty years old, as of November 2014.  I was alone viewing the object.  My Grandfather was at work and my Grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It approached my location stopping directly in front of me. I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it!  I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes, in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.  The sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time.  So I knew when it was going to move again.  The sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train.  I&#39;m not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the UFO got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and Fairmont Streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to another window on the side facing Wallace Street, so was able to watch it again.  It leveled off, then flew over the walls of the Eastern State Penitentiary, it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying North.  It continued flying North at a level constant speed until I lost view of it.  This craft was definitely controlled by an intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my Grandmother came in I told her what I had witnessed.  We were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on The Bible, which I did.  She was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening or perhaps the next night we watched a TV program that highlighted the vessel I had seen and their closer encounter with it.  The program was &#34;The Arthur Godfrey Show&#34;, or one of his &#34;Specials.&#34;  Arthur Godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Arthur Godfrey and Frank Munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from New York to Washington, DC.  Their flight path took them over or near Philadelphia on the same day of my encounter.  Live on national TV Author Godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft.  He said it matched his course and speed.  He admitted he was scared of the vessel&#39;s close maneuvers until it finally veered off.  Arthur Godfrey was a well know TV producer and TV host.  His TV program was viewed by millions of Americans.  My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen.  An account of Arthur Godfrey&#39;s story c! an be read on Ufodocarchiv.org.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later as an Intelligence Officer I often gave my squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer of the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during the Gulf War.  During one briefing an Aircrew explained to me they encountered a Ball Lightening Encounter, also called Saint Elmo&#39;s Fire.  A sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.  They asked of I entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.  The entire crew witnesses the sphere and actually enjoyed the event.  They asked if I knew of any UFO sightings.  I then told them my story.  This upset my Squadron Training Officer who verbally reprimanded me, I was ordered to never speak about UFO&#39;s again.<n>

I moved to another window and it was still there. I left the window, when I returned it was gone but a small private plane was flying over the location.  It was disc shaped and very bright silver color.  It did not appear to be moving while I was watching.  I did not notice any windows.  It was about the size of a two story house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not realize until later what I actually saw.  It was a clear and sunny day, about 1 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After it passed over us the truck started back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on vacation, late at night, in the desert between Albuquerque and Arizona, headed west on the highway.  From the north a large round disk flew over us, not very high.  The whole thing was lit up with a weird green color (like phosphurescent).  We looked out at it, and as it passed over us the truck stopped all by itself.  It would not start again until the disk had passed over.  I think the whole thing took about five minutes, because it was moving slowly.  We saw one disk.  There was four of us.  At that time I was 14, my brother was 8.  My father and mother were with us.<n>

The causeway had a two story building on it and there were several shipping crates on the deck about 100 yards away from the building.  We were supposed to walk around the shipping crates during our watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was to my left when it was setting. I believe I was walking approximately north and south as I walked around the boxes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had gotten dark and I was standing next to one of the boxes when I saw what appeared to be a white light come out from my left.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter light, but it was too big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came down to the water to my left, and skimmed across the bay from my left to my right.  I would have been facing north-east at this point if my memory serves me right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound, however I could hear the water beating against the hull of the object as it went across the bay.  When it got to my far right, it shot up at a 45 degree angle.  Within seconds it was so small that I could not tell it from the stars that were visible on that night.  It was nearly cloudless and I could see quite well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got over the initial shock of seeing something that I could not explain, I ran to the building as fast as I could.  I got inside and told the clerk sitting behind the counter that I needed to call the corporal of the guard.  I was so excited felt flushed and could hardly talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called and told the corporeal on duty that I had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He immediately cut me off and said that I had not seen anything.  I tried to explain to him that I in fact HAD seen a UFO and he cut me off again.  He told me that I would be given a section 8 if I tried to report this incident.  He told me that for my own good, I had better keep what I saw to myself and not report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reluctantly told him, &#34;Okay!&#34; and hung up the phone.  I didn&#39;t want any trouble and surely didn&#39;t want to be drummed out of the service over it.  A section 8 means that they would send me to the nuthouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t tell anyone about this until recently.  I was 18 when this happened. I am now 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Law Enforcement officer and know what I saw.  It was not a plane or a helicopter.  We did not have any planes on that airbase that could shoot up into the sky like that and disappear that fast.  At the time, I believe we were using the A-4 Phantom Jets, but I could be wrong about their designation.  I was a marine in the airwing at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was just after the sun went down behind me, I was walking around some boxes on the wharf when I saw what appeared to be a bright light coming down from the sky on my left.  It leveled off over the water and slowly crossed in front of me, going from left to right over the water of the bay.  I could hear water striking the hull of the object as it went very low across the water.  There was no sound other than the water hitting the object, I could hear no engine noise at all. I could not see a shape as it was dark and I could only see what appeared to be a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that it traveled perhaps 300 feet across the water. It then went up at approximately a 45 degree angle straight into the sky.  I watched it until it was so small that it appeared to be one of the stars.  I was completely astounded, and just stood there a moment looking into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally ran into a nearby building and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The operator on the phone told me that I had not seen anything, and told me to forget it, as I would be in big trouble if I said anything further. I hung up the phone and never told anyone else about it because I thought I would be called a kook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw was not a weather balloon, or a helicopter, and I have never seen a craft that could go straight up into the sky as fast as this thing did. I was in the Marine Corps air wing at the time and was used to seeing jets take off. I have never seen a jet fly without making any noise at all, so this in my opinion was not a jet either. I simply do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never forgotten that moment. The reason I am reporting it now is because I just got through watching seeing is believing on tv, I don&#39;t feel so stupid telling my story now.  I cannot prove my story, so I don&#39;t expect people to believe me.  I only know what I saw.<n>

I don&#39;t remember the exact date.  The wharf (causeway) goes from north and south, if my memory serves me correctly. Ewakuni Japan has a Marine Corps airbase there.  I was used to seeing the Navy jets and Marine jets and helicopters flying around the base. I never have seen a craft which could go staight up into the night sky like this one did, without any noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the Marine Corps at the time, and was serving on guard duty for several days at this location.  There were several wooden boxes along the wharf, and I was basically walking around them.  To the east was the ocean.  To the west was the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had set about an hour when I rounded the corner on some of the boxes.  I was facing east.  I saw what appeared to be a bright light, (not enough to hurt your eyes, just a bright light.) come down from my left (North) and fly just above the water in front of me ( to the South).  I could hear the sound of the water hitting the object as it flew.  However the object made no sound, no engine noise, no jet noise, nothing.  The area was completely silent except for the splashing of the water. I estimate the the thing flew approximately 2 feet above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew past me, but I could not tell you how far away it was. It appeared to me to be about 100 yards away, but I could be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went across the water, for about 300 feet, and then shot up at a 45 degree angle, and simply kept going up into the night sky.  I remember just standing there with my mouth open as I watched the thing continue straight up until it appeared to blend in with the stars in the night sky. (Incidently there were no clouds that night, to obscure my sight.) I finally turned to my left and ran over to a building (if I remember right it was a two story building, with the front door facing south.) I ran inside, picked up the phone and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen.  When I told the operator that I had just seen what I thought was a ufo. I was told quite abruptly that I did not see anything, and had better not report it, if I didn&#39;t want to be labled a kook.  I was further told that I would be in very big trouble if I did. I hung up the phone and went back to my post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like that since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone but my present wife about the incident, but last night I was watching television and saw the program &#34;seeing is believing&#34; about UFO&#39;s.  Some of the stories were strikingly similar to what I had seen, so I decided to write in and let you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took a lot to write this down for you, as I do not seek publicity, or recognition. I am just reporting what I saw.  Perhaps someone else has seen something similar.

6/15/65 20:15|St. Marys|WV|Disk|about 20 seconds|White disc-shaped object witnessed in West Virgina in mid-1960s|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09755.html|27|ndxe196506| White disc-shaped object witnessed in West Virgina in mid-1960s<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is perhaps the strangest and, to this day, most troubling event from my childhood.  Although I can&#39;t swear to the exact date now, I think I was about eight or nine years old at the time.  Therefore it must&#39;ve been the late summer or early fall of 1964 or 1965.  I remember that my family and I had been sitting on the patio in our backyard and watching shooting stars because the skies were so clear.  Around eight o&#39;clock in the evening everyone else went back inside to watch a television program.  I stayed outside to see a few more of the meteorites. At this point I should describe the physical location of our house and its surroundings at that time.  Our house was at that time approximately two miles north of the city limits of St. Marys, WV (it is now within the city&#39;s expanded limits) on Route 2 in a rather narrow section of the Ohio River valley.  From the perspective of our backyard patio, the Ohio River and the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the river are on the left.  Almost immediately to the right is the ridge of hills on the West Virginia side.  And at that time the backyard faced a large cow pasture.  The barbed wire fence enclosing that pasture marked the boundary of our backyard and was perhaps 15-20 feet from the back of our house.  The owner of the pasture lived in a small white farmhouse a couple of hundred yards away to the north (up-river).  Beyond that, the only other structure visible was the smokestack of what was then the state home for mentally retarded children (the Colin-Anderson Center).  It was perhaps a half mile beyond the pasture.  The pasture itself had a small pond for the cattle to drink from with a large old tree just to the left of it (from our patio&#39;s point of view).  The pond was about 80 yards from the edge of the fence and our yard. Again, as I was waiting for more shooting stars, I was startled by a flash of light that lit up the pasture for an instant like the flash from a camera.  I saw what seemed to be a large, white object shoot across the valley from above the ridge on my right and downward (in a slight arc)until it disappeared from sight behind the ridge of hills on the Ohio side of the valley.  I remember that the object didn&#39;t shoot across the valley at a uniform speed or motion.  Rather, it seemed to lurch by in a somewhat jerky motion.  I thought there would be a sound of big crash but there was no sound.  I remember that I was a little scared and excited too.  Just as I was thinking of running into the house and telling everyone what I had just seen, I was frozen into my chair by what happened next.  Suddenly, from above the ridge on the Ohio side of the river, a white disc shaped thing popped up and zipped (in an erratic, lurching movement) across the river and came to an unsteady stop (it didn&#39;t completely stop moving but seemed to keep inching forward slightly in little jerky movements as if it were a boat trying to maintain its position in a slight current) right in front of my eyes just above the top of the large tree beside the farm pond.  I think I was so frightened that I couldn&#39;t move.  It just floated there in the air, inching forward in little jerks, until it was above the pond.  There was no sound whatsoever.  The object appeared to be white or silvery but it didn&#39;t illuminate the ground.  Also, as it slowed, it&#39;s brightness dimmed to a hazy gray color.  I think I may have ran towards it for some reason but I can&#39;t remember now.  At any rate, after what seemed only a few seconds, I recall seeing the object zip away to the north (up the valley)in an instant.  Again, its motion was lurching and rather zig-zaggy as it climbed away into the sky.  I remember it looked rather like a fat, white star as it became smaller and smaller. Also, I was left with the impression that it looked rather liquid and formless (like a white globule of some sort)as it zigged into the stars and appeared to disappear among them.  After I came back to my senses, I remember that I became very excited and dashed back into the house and told everyone that I&#39;d seen a big white thing zipping around outside.  Nobody bothered to come outside.  My mother still remembers my bursting into the house all excited about something way back then. The most troubling thing, however, is my recollection of an inexplicable feeling of dread and forboding should I ever talk about it.  That feeling lasted for several years.  I suppose that this event is too attenuated in time to be of much interest to anyone.  Nevertheless, I think I&#39;ll feel better by letting someone know what I saw (as incredible as it sounds).<n>

As a boy, I used to love to look at the night sky through my binoculars. Occasionally I would spot a satellite just after dark. Satellites were easily recognized by their steady, fast paced bright light. On this occasion, I spotted a satellite moving south to north in the eastern sky. When I trained my binoculars on the light, the magnification revealed that instead of one light, there were two, one following another. I watched for about ten to fifteen seconds as the two lights moved along the same path. Then, suddenly the rear light instantaneously changed direction and speed and faded to black as it zoomed off in an abrupt turn.  Through my binoculars looking toward the northeast, the two objects were moving from a two o&#39;clock position toward an eight o&#39;clock position. The rear obect then turned toward a one o&#39;clock position. It seemed to do so without any hesitation whatsoever. It was many years later that I realized that what I had seen might be a UFO following a terrestrial satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

(I dont remember if it was June, July, or August) My mother caught site of an oval craft with blinking blue and red lights in the sky to her right.  She was frightened and called out to my father, &#34;Look!! Do you see that?&#34;. My dad was driving and couldnt look long enough.  When we got home a few minutes later, my mom was so scrared, she turned out all the lights and paced around the house looking out the windows.  She called the police and reported it and asked if anyone else had reported it.  Her behavior frightened me because I had never seen her act that way. She was one who didnt believe in those things at all, but she believed she had seen a flying saucer. I wonder if anyone else same time and place saw anything. Personally, I believe it is satan giving people apparations.<n>
6/15/65 19:00|Utica|MI|Disk|10 seconds|I saw 4 disk shapeed objects flying in fighter plane formation|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55970.html|31|ndxe196506| I saw 4 disk shapeed objects flying in fighter plane formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t know how to cut and paste. Will make the report here. Here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: May or June 1964 or &#39;65. Time: Just past dark. Sky: Moonless, no clouds, excellent star gazing evening. My father had recently bought a boat and a pair of binoculars to use on the boat. It was a clear evening. I decided to take the binoculars and stargaze. Happened to meet a neighbor of mine out in front of my house. Every star was out, viewing was great! I happened to see large meteor. I quickly pointed it out to my neighbor. I first saw it appear in the SW sky heading NW and going down at about a 10 to 15 degree angle. Its heading would be about 315 degrees. It was huge and visible for much longer than any meteor I had ever seen. It disappeared on the dead west horizon. At the tender age of 14 or 15 I got the idea that it must have been a fairly good size hunk of rock  hit earth dead west of where we were. We lived 25 miles north of Detroit at the time. I also figured that it hit well beyond Lake Michigan. I believe the next day in the local papers was the story of a meteorite that hit somewhere in Iowa. Had a map in the article and I was right! Do some research, you might find it and then know when it happened. It hit dead west of us hundreds of miles away in Iowa I believe. Less than a minute later I saw something out of the corner of my eys in the SE skymaybe 30 degrees off the horizon. I quickly locked with both eyes and at first thought I was looking at a flock of ducks or geese. The flock  was making an arcing turn to the north and west. As they got directly east they flattened out in a smooth motion and started to pass overhead and go directly west. Didn&#39;t seem like birds flapping wings to me, this was smooth and no wing flap sound. I quickly locked on with the binoculars. They were well focused. About 60 degrees off the horizon, east I saw 4 disk shaped objects flying in fighter plane formation. There was structure to them, not just disks with a dome. I could see wind screens. They, the craft, were luminiscent.Didn&#39;t really have time to see who the pilots were. And traveling fast . I h! ollered Look to my riend. Adrenalin was pumping I was excited to say the least. I quickly gave the binocs to my friend. He got a quick look before they disapeared from sight, going dead west. Stll no sound what so ever. I kind of thought they may head to where the meteor hit. I believe the ufos were 500 to 1,000 agl ( above ground leve). From the time they were directly overhead to the time they were gone from sight was only a few secnds. Fighter jets would take longer and make a hell of a noise. Single engine private planes probably would be visible for a couple minutes Seemed like maybe going about 20 or 22 times faster than say, a Piper or a Cescna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would put the speed about 2,100 mph. This also seems to be a good guess on my part. Next day I told my sisters husband about it. He was in the army in a radar control room at a Nike missle base tat was on a nearby air force base.I told him the time, speed direction. He says they saw them, didn&#39;t know what they were and weren&#39;t supposed to talk about it. Next day while on my paper route I stopped at a local ice cream stand and told a friend of mine the worked there what we  saw. He told me not to tell him, but tell the guy behind me. Turns out to be a guy from another Nike base. He happened to be at in the radar control room at that base at the time and reconfimed what my sisters husband said, including they weren&#39;t suppose to talk about it. In the mean time I read everything I can on the subject of ufos. Lot of garbage out thereWhat is real, what is&#39;t? I learned to talk to very few people on the subject of ufos. Now the whole reason for this report. In a sighting report you wrote,&#34;We do not understand why if the same witness reported to NUFORCin 1993, he has waited until 2005to report his sighting in 1968. Doesn&#39;t make sense to us. PD&#34; I can tell from experience I don&#39;t report all ufos I see. Might want to tell the story annonymusly, or tell the story before time runs out as Maj. Marcel did. I have one better sighting that involved 2 Mich State Troopers. I don&#39;t talk about that one much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a veteran of naval aviation.I worked as an aviation firecontrol bombing radar tech and aviaion electronic technition working on aviation fireconrtol bombing radar systems, aviation radio navigation, aviation communications, early missle warning systems, and electronic warfare systems. Did this Dec &#39;68to Dec &#39;72. Joined the navy to beat the draft. (68 not a good year to get drafted) also spent 1 year on the CVA 67 Joon F Kennedy aircraft carrier, also a couple  air force bases and naval air stations<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/15/65 19:00|New Kensington|PA|Disk|3 hours|3 hours in a UFO|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38259.html|32|ndxe196506| 3 hours in a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 14 at the time, skate boarding with 2 of my friends. We were coming home down an alley in the back of our house. There was an empty lot next to my house with a large elm tree about a 100 feet tall at the far end of the lot. I use to climb that tree a lot because it had a lot of branches where I could hide and spy on the people down below. As we reached the empty lot, we all gazed up, because something caught our attention. It was a real UFO hoovering above the tree line. I could see into it through a window that looked as if the blue,gray metaled UFO had opened by making that part of it transparent. There were no hard edges or frame like regular window. It was if it was all part of the ship but could make that part of it see through. As I gazed up at it, I was unbelivably exited. There were many sighting in our suburbian town through out the years and I was finally looking at one close up. Little did I know, how close up I really would get to see. I started waving at it as if to say, please give me a ride! I really did want a ride in it and I knew that they knew what I wanted. I could see two beings looking out the window at me. They appeared human. One was taller then the other. I could only see sillouquettes though. They appeared to be a darkened gray. They didn&#39;t look like the grays so often described. they just looked like regular humans pearring out at me. I could only see them from the waist up. I felt that they were reading my mind and that I could feel that I was being acknowledged when I was waving both my hands up high to get there attention. My two friends were beside me, one on each side. They were gazing up at it also. I commented to them, we are actually seeing a real UFO! They looked as if they were paralized. They didn&#39;t move at all, just staring up at it. I couldn&#39;t understand why they weren&#39;t as excited as me. They just stared at it with plain faces. I was so excited about it, that I didn&#39;t let it bother me to much. This thing had my full attention and I wasn&#39;t about to let it out of my sight for a second afraid it my dissapear before my eyes. As I shout for joy at it, I examined it close. It was bluish gray in clor except for it&#39;s underside. In the middle taking up about one third of the bottom was a round glowing reddish black, pulsating, what I formulated was it&#39;s engine. It glowed and pulsated every half of a second from a deep red to a deep black,red. It reminded me of a red bike reflector and had the same texture. It portruded out from the rest of the ship, not a lot, but made it distinct from the rest of the ship. It to looked as if it were all one piece with the ship. It was simply beautiful in my eyes. It was completely round with a domed top where the window was located half way down. It was half way down from the top of the dome to where it  blended in with the main body of the ship. I could see no other portholes or marks on it. It was smooth all around and the domed top was about as high as the rest of the body. As the engine pulsated, I could see that the rest of the underside did not take on the reddish glow of the engine. It remained it bluish gray color. It didn&#39;t make a sound. It was a little errie but I was to excited to think was green little Mars men. They made me feel very comfortable as if they were my friends and would harm me. I stood there about a minute or at least it seemed about a minute. I could see both my friend on either side of me still just starring at this beautiful object. Then the next thing I remember is looking at this UFO leaving me. I was completely turned around, my two friend were now together to the right of me still looking into blank space as I was waving good bye to it. My two friends, Craig and Joey were just starring up at nothing as if they were paralized. I myself was very saddened by this UFO leaving me. I remember feeling sad but also at peace as I waved good bye to it. I felt a lonely type of feeling as if saying good bye to a good friend or freinds. The UFO was now smaller appearing because it was higher up in the night sky when I first noticed it again. I thought it very strange, because I was facing a different dirrection then my two buddies. I could see them out of the corner of my eyes as I was waving good bye. The UFO was no longer a UFO to me. I could identify it and I saw it&#39;s occupants. I knew that I was a witness to the most extroidenary event I would ever see with my own two eyes. I watched as the ship zipped away going faster a nd faster as it seemed to dissapear around a three quarter moon. It left a tracer behind it as it first went straight the curved around to the dark side of the moon. I didn&#39;t want it to go! I heard them say good bye to me in my mind as if they knew I needed that. I stood there for an instant and then turned to my two buddied. They had just awoken up from this deep trance that they were in. I reminded them again of this spectacular event and all they could say as we didn&#39;t see anything. I thought they were teasing me but they weren&#39;t. They looked at there watches and commmented that they were going to get killed for being so late. They had a curfew, where they had to be in their doors at 7:00 pm. were there at 7:00 pm, because at that time of year it got dark around 7:00 pm., but it was now 10:00 pm. and that&#39;s why they were scarred. I couldn&#39;t believe it was 10:00 pm. ((name #1 deleted))  and ((name #2 deleted)) were both on curfews but I wasn&#39;t. My parents let me stay out till 10:00 If I wanted. It was vacation time from school in the summer so I was always aloud to stay up later except when school was back in. Anyway, They told me that they had to get it or they would be in bigger trouble by their parents. As they were leaving, I said I would come over early the next mourning to talk about it. They, didn&#39;t acknowledge me, they just ran home, which was right across the alley way to their house. I went home thinking did this really all take place. My mother was up waiting for me. She asked me where I was. I told her all about what had happened. Some how we had lost three hours out there and I wasn&#39;t about to forget any of it. My mother didn&#39;t act to surprized but listened intently. I couldn&#39;t wait to get up the next morning to got to my friends house and relive this fantastic experience. I went to sleep and got up early. I went dirrectly over to Craigs house. He got in trouble and wasn&#39;t aloud out the whole day, but he did come to the door. I ask him about the UFO. HE said he didn&#39;t remember seeing it. I was beside myself. I ran over to Joey&#39;s house. He to was grounded and he to said he didn&#39;t remember seeing any UFO. Now, I thought I was going crazy. I ran home, I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy, I knew I saw it and I could notr deny it. It was clear in my mind as if it had just happened. I told my mother that my two freinds don&#39;t remember seeing it. She said don&#39;t worry about it because it had made front page news in the news paper and that several people had seen it going across the sky of our town. I jumped for joy, just knowing that I wasn&#39;t crazy and then I felt at peace again. I said see mom, I wasn&#39;t lying, I really did see it. Later that month, I started to remember other things as clear as a bell. I remembered being inside of this UFO. I was sitting on a silver colored bench. Next to me were two adults, just sitting there, starring, like my freind were when they were fixed on this UFO without moving a muscle. I said Hi to them, but they didn&#39;t say anything. They just starred straight ahead. The bench was about eight feet long and was curved around what seemed to be the roundness of the ship. It was blocked off on one end to the left. On the other side it seemed to go on following the circumfrence of the UFO. I looked up straight in front of me and I saw two humans standing in the interior of the UFO. ONe was a man about 6 feet tall and the other was a beautiful women about 5 foot 8 inches tall. They both had on silver grayish jumpsuits but was formed to their body not to loose or not to tight. I could see that it was all one piece. Even their shoes were a part of their appearal. It had the same color as the outside of the UFO. There was no collar to the suit but it was up to the neck near the bottom. She had brownish blond hair and long and flowing down to about one third her back. It was shinny and very pretty to look at. She was very pretty and she smiled at me. He was very handsome and had blondish color hair. They both had very blue eyes that were warm as they looked at me. I got up off the bench and walked towards them seeing the other two just sitting there starring. As I walked over to them the man was standing across from a wall of the dome. He was moving his hands across and down what seemed to be a panel of some sort. It didn&#39;t have much to it, but what ever he was doing was like a waving motion over it. She was standing to the right side of him and then came around toward me. She gave me a hug, which made me feel very welcome. She then moved back toward the wall and was also doing something like waving her hands over a panel. He moved away from the panel and motioned me with his hands to move to the left. As I did I could see a window. it was panoramic in shape and about waist high. I guess it was about 4 feet by 15 feet across. I could see stars. Millions of them. They were very clear, clearer then I&#39;ve ever seen them. I walked closer to the window. I felt as if I were watching a movie in a movie theatre but much more clearer. I felt like I could touch these stars as they slowly moved across my view. I knew we wer moving in outer space. We must have been going very fast because the stars moved to the left and right of me as we went forward. They were like diamonds. The window was deffinately all one piece of the ship. there were no rivets or bolts of any kind. The window blended in with the rest of the ship. Even though it was rectangular in shape, it had no blunt or deffinate frame, just as it looked to me from outside the ship, looking up at it. I knew I was now in this UFO and the pilots were giving me the ride of my life. I was so excited, I just felt at peace and that these two beautiful people were ansering my request. They appeared to me a perfect people. Now, that I&#39;m a 53 years old and very religeous, I could identify them as looking like two resurrected personages. I could see not one flaw on their faces. They seemed very happy with each other. I had the feeling that they were married and that they were husband and wife. When they looked at me, they always looked contented and that they enjoyed what they do. The window of the space ship contoured around the dome. I could feel the impression that I was in the the same space hip as I was looking at from down below. I felt very comfortable and at ease. I knew they would not harm me in any way, that they just wanted to please me. The next think I remember is waving good bye to them, not wanting to leave. I didn&#39;t even think of my family then, I was to caught up in this great venture I was taking. I often remember this incident over and over again. It ist till this day so very clear in my mind. However, I don&#39;t recall anything else that happened during my three our ride. One day I will and just hope it was a fuylfilling as what I did remember. I will never forget it and since then I have seen many sightings of UFO&#39;s, some golden egg shaped, some ball shaped and others just round. My children also have seen them many times. My daughter also had a very close encounter of one bluish shaped UFO that came right down the street when we lived in the San Bernardino Mountains. It flew right over her and my wifes head, only about 10 feet above. She said if she were as tall as her mother, she could have reached up and touched it. But that is another real story I can tell later. I know they exist. I know who they are and where they come from. I also know more about them, probably then most people know. That doesn&#39;t make me special. I have just been told and it sets my mind free to live a productive, happy and informed life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a warm and sunny day with clear skies all around.We heard a loud steady noise coming from the top of the hill (similar to wind blowing through a pile of irrigation pipe commonly used at that time). We ran to the top of the hill where the noise was coming from but did not see any irrigation pipe anywhere. We were standing in what seemed like a very strong wind blowing straight down on us and the noise was coming from above us. The pasture grass was blown flat as if you would hold a leaf blower down to the ground. The area that was being affected was about 30&#39; in diamater. As we stood there mystified as to what was causing the noise and wind, it started to move to the east away from us and  subsided. We did not see any object in the sky. I really do not remember thinking about this to much but it is something that I have never forgotten. Several years ago I was having a couple of beers with a friend of my that was there that day. I said to him &#34; Do you something that we have never talked about?&#34; and he replied &#34; You mean that day we went fishing?&#34; and he refused to discuss it further. It seems strange that he would know exactly what I was talking about almost forty years later. I talked to a meterologist several weeks ago and described to him what we heard and felt and he did not seem to think it could have been a wind shear.

Our house was the last house at the end of a dirt surfaced street.  There were no houses yet built across the street (very rural). I was sitting on the grass in the front yard our ranch-style home waiting to be picked up by friends to get an early start to go surfing. It was quite dark, as there were no street lights yet in this area, and our house did not yet have yard lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly realized that there were none of the usual night sounds (crickets, far away dogs barking, etc.). It was so quiet in fact that I could hear the blood pumping in my ears. I was suddenly compelled to look up over my left shoulder in a northwesterly direction (I was sitting indian style, facing east).  My eyes rivited on circular black shape that blotted out the stars behind it. Its apparent size would be that of a 33 1/3 record album heald at arms length (large!). It was approximately 20 degrees northwest of the zenith. I do not know how long it had been there before I detected it. After a couple minutes it silently zoomed straight up and dissappeared into the background of stars. I was frozen with fear and never took my eyes off of that portion of sky untill my friends showed up 30-minutes later to pick me up for a ride to the beach. I immediately told my three friends in the car about my experience. They were skeptical, but can all corroborate my story as stated above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in the middle of no where in the country on a piece of land that was deserted.  As the light got close to the four of us in the second car to this site, we screamed, jumped in the car and took off.  The light followed behind us for a ways, then disappeared.  We were to meet another couple there.  The next day we asked why they did not meet us and they said, a white light came right up to the car and they left.  My ex-husband and I just this month talked about this experience.  We were together that night.  He said, I will never forget that as long as I live.  I know I will never forget that as long as I live.  I was eighteen years old at the time and I am now fifty-five years old and I will never forget what I saw that night and the fear I felt.

We lived in College Park, Ga. Only a few miles from the Atlanta Airport.  We lived in a subdivison and in the corner house.  Their was a house next door to us and then a wooded lot and then the rows of houses picked up again.  There were homes across the street from us.  I had been playing with my friends that lived 3 doors down from us and had to go home to use the bathroom. Upon returning,  as I reached the corner of the wooded lot a circled craft came over making not a sound and just at the tips of the trees.  I stood frozen watching it go over and and could not speek a word to ask the other kids do they see this. I looked at them and they were playing not even seeing this.  It was small,  about 8 to 10 feet around and had what I would call today as chaser lights of different colors flashing around the whole paremature of the craft. I watched it as it crossed the homes and just as it was out of sight I was finely able to yell to the other kids if they saw it. Of course they said no.  I ran home to tell my mother and she said that it was a weather balloon. I know it was not.  It was almost flat and circuler with the chaser lights running around it. I moved about, I would guess 5 mph. Very slow and quiet.  The trees did not sway a bit and it was almost touching the tree tops. I was a silver color and looked like it had a darker circle in the middle of the bottom of the circle. Like I said we only lived a few miles from the Atlanta Airport.  I will never forget this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had the habit of getting sleeping with my 2 older Sisters and getting up in the nite to go get in bed with my parents. This nite I awoke and started my trek through the kitchen. I saw bright lights and I hid in the space betwene the Refridgerator and the wall. I saw 2 dull bright figures that were maybe 3 ft tall and gowing eyes. this site frightened me and I put my hands over my eyes and was peeking through my fingers. too my fright I closed my fingers when I peeked again through my fingers I was face to face with them. I sank to the floor and ran past to my Sisters room where I got between my two Sisters and pulled the covers over my head. The next morning we had some Men in Black suits asking all kinds of questions about Lights and fires by the Barn. I told the men a lie and said I didnt see anything . I never saw a ship only the whole house was lite up. I saw something that nite and it scared me alot. I have never heard of anything like the appearance of the little men I saw. am always curious to know if anyone else in the area saw anythong. The closest City would be Beeville Texas. I am grown now and work at Harborview In Seattle. I have spoken to some profesional people about what happened to me and there reply was that they wish They coukld have seen one. to me I wish I never seen anything.   thank you for your time  Please do not contact me by phone . email is fine especially regarding other like little men reports<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness does not indicate that fact.

During a period of about 1-2 weeks then many strange things where happening on the island. I was a teenager (14) then. Black outs, reported sightings etc. We lived in a beachfront condo on Taft Street, Santurce P.R. Because of all the strange things happening around the island, a friend of mine and I slept on the roof top of the condos 12th floor and at around midnight experienced humming sound. We jumped up and had a view of entire city (San Juan). We observed pie shaped slices of city going dark. We noticed a formation of (estimate) 4-6 clusters comprised of about 6 each saucer like craft in a semi V formation going from east to west roughly @ a 45 degree angle up in the sky. Would estimate distance out in the ocean around 2-5 miles and formation at about 2-3000 feet. Very visible, clear, breezy evening. Lots of stars but formation was very evident. Looking down the condo balcony, just about everyone in the building witnessed the event with people shouting to each other &#34;are you seeing this or that...?&#34; Formation flew &#34;seemed slowly&#34; with luminiscent, undulating or pulsating shimmer to each craft. Humming sound also was low &amp; undulating. This was witnessed and then formation seemed to gain speed with sound undulation becomming more compressed and all craft increased angle of attack (like 75 degrees) into heavens and sped off at tremendous speed. Seemed to vanish in seconds into space. I&#39;ll never forget the experience! Numerous reports in the &#34;San Juan Star&#34; newspaper during this time period. No hoax! Always left wondering why not more media attention paid to this formidable event.<n>

My family and neighbors saw red lights (which were perceived to be on 8 individual crafts) in formation over a shopping center near my home.  I can&#39;t be specific as to the shape of any craft but the lights were clearly visible. They moved back and forth in sinc then they started to take off from the formation each craft going a different way. My boyfriend(Mike) and I and my sister decided to chase one.  I don&#39;t remember how we were able to jump in the car and keep track of the craft but now I feel that the craft was somehow waiting for us as if it was going to &#34;guide&#34; us. I remember seeing a pure blue round light shine down on the grass next to the road we were on. (left side).You could see through the light clearly and it illuminated the grass next to the road.  I felt as if we were driving 100mph but the speedometer registered about 35 mph! I remember feeling as if this thing was leading us out away from the city and onto a remote country road which is what it did! I was mesmerized by the light!  I had never seen such a pure bright intense light before! I just remember thinking &#34;pure&#34;.  Mike was trying to look up to see if he could make out any kind of craft and drive at the same time but he told me just recently (he is now my ex-husband) that he was unable to really see it.  I wish I had looked up!I believe my sister was unable to see anything because she was on the passenger side of the car.  After we had followed it for what seemed like awhile I was overcome with intense fear and told Mike to stop.  I realized what it was doing (leading us out into the country).As soon as Mike hit the brakes it shot up into the sky. It was dark which made it difficult to really see but we could see the light disappear and it seemed as though I was able to &#34;perceive&#34; it. At that point we were able to get out of the car and look up into the night sky. It was a dark object. The red lights appeared again. As we watched it bank to the left a jet approached it from behind and followed it. They both disappeared in the distance. The next day the paper said what we had seen was &#34;swamp gas&#34;! I don&#39;t think so. It was so long ago but you&#39;ve stated on the Jeff Rense radio program that no matter when they happened these sightings should be reported.  I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t fill in some of the details but I will tell you that this was REAL and it scared the heck out of me! ! I must t ell you this although it seems a bit &#34;crazy&#34; to me but when I told Mike to stop the car I heard a voice say &#34;You&#39;re not ready.&#34;! I&#39;ve never told anyone that! Nothing since then has happened to me but my ex-husband has seen other ufo&#39;s here in Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While they were looking at it I decided to go through the apartment to see if anything else was coming and sure enough it was another star like light from the north. The second light approached the moon and stopped beside it on the west side. The two lights stayed by the moon for at least five minutes and then de- parted in their north, south routes. These objects were brighter than the satelites I&#39;ve seen and moved at an even steady pace. A police report/newspaper article was filed.<n>

Because the relationship between CCCP a! nd China was hostile.The object was suspected as a spy plane of CCCP.Two fighters were sent to chase the light ball.However because the object was too fast to chase,the pilots tried to shoot it down.Before firing at it the pilots dropped the external fuel tanks of fighters in case that they would engage with the object.They fired at the object but did not work.The object ahead north(the direction of Mongolia and CCCP.It is another reason why it was suspected as a spy plane of CCCP.) in high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I heard this story from my parents some years ago I thought it is a standard and convincible UFO event.Firstly it was chased by two fighters,it means the height of the object was not too high or too low.It is not satellite or bird.Secondly,thousands of witnesses including people in my hometown and military guys, like the two pilots.  Last,it should not be a spy plane of CCCP or other countries.  Because ever right now,no one makes a spy plane as a bright bulb!

This was similar to a &#34;dog star&#34; but they would move vertically down and up then sideways. We then thought it must be helicopters at the naval station because of unusual movement. I went to get binoculars from my pickup and as I pulled them out of the case the pulsating lights became exceedingly bright and left the horizon faster than a &#34;shooting star&#34; The exit speed was phenomenal. I remember that the lights followed the spectrum except that a few of the visible wavelengths were absent. The lights pulsated as opposed to the blinking lights of an air craft. It was as if the light expanded and contracted with the visible frequency. Search the records...I think the carson appeal or reno newspaper had an article on lights seen in fallon, nev  This was not an atmospheric disturbance of a stars light. I think there was intelligent control although the purpose of the up and down movements are puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, before we knew it, the strange sound was directly overhead of us also, and was still producing an extremely bright light.  This sound stayed over us too for four minutes or longer.  The light was so bright that my cousins and I could not see each other for four minutes or so as this thing hovered and flew directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began to shout to try to find each other in the blinding light and noise but couldn&#39;t.  Everyone was totally blinded by this light.  The roaring and swishing sound was so loud that it too was startling, so we all blocked our eardrums.  But the noise was still extremely loud and mind-bogling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, we were all extremely frightened and screeming for help.  Whatever that thing was that flew over us that day had to have been really huge and fast because of the noise it produced.  The noise was loud and screeching, and like nothing I have ever heard before.  It was a strange feeling.  I realize that this story is indeed strange, but it really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After whatever it was had left, we just stood and stared at each other in amazement and tried to gather our senses.  It was no airplane or helicopter because of the hovering and blinding light.  Whatever ! we observed was indeed strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for hearing my TRUE strange story!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We still talk about this case among ourselves quite often, and have shockingly discovered some addition information we know is related to this UFO encounter.  It is unbelievable to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only hope is that people will believe what I am about to tell you.  I am no liar or scam artist.  As earlier reported, the huge UFO hovered straight above our heads, and we were blinded by the bright yellow light which was shining down upon us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to look up but the light was blinding us, and the noise was deafning as well.  The large object made a hissing-swishing sound with a very loud roar to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the new information I am disclosing to you is mysterious, and we are left to wonder what happened to us, and why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all now believe we were indeed abducted by the UFO, and! lost track of our time.  We also have the &#34;Evidence&#34; to prove it.   A few short weeks or so after the UFO encounter we were all in our White Plains Elementary School one day having our classes as usual.   All of a sudden the principal sent out a loud message over the intercom telling us that &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; of us kids in the entire school (close to where the UFO-abduction took place) were going to be inoculated for some flu disease or something etc.  It was in the summetime?   We were to go class after class until everybody was done inthe entire school.   When my class time came my cousin R. was with me and we both went to the front of the school with our other clasmates in the middle isle, stood in line, and waited our turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing was that the doctors, or whoever they really were, hid their faces behind white masks and wore white uniforms and gloves.  I proceeded up to receive my shot and then it got really strange.  A person took out a large machine, like a huge staple gun, held it to my &amp; &#34;forehead&#34; between my eyes and stamped me and said it was done.  It was a &#34;diamond&#34; imprint placed right between my eyes, and I still have the strange diamond imprint to this very day.  My cousin R. got a circle imprint placed between her eyes on her forehead just like I did, and hers is still there today too.  Why were we not given shots in the arm or buttocks like normal?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home and told my father what had happened he said, &#34;What do you mean you got a mark put on your forehead&#34;;  I showed the diamond mark to him and he got very upset and angry.  Then after he contacted the school the next day he never mentioned it again, and I found this strange as well.  I told my current physician a couple of years ago about the incident, and she told me that shots were &amp;quot;never&amp;quot; given in the forehead, and when I showed it to her she was dumbfounded.  We all cannot find any information on getting shots in the forehead anywhere.  Why were we marked?  Why the diamond-circle s! hapes?  We do strongly now feel that these unusual shots-markings had something sinister to do with our neightborhood UFO encounter.  This additional material is &#34;ABSOLUTELY TRUE.&#34;   As stated earlier, we have the proof to prove it, especially R. and I.  I look at my mark today on my forehead &amp;lt;&amp;gt; turned the other way, and it baffles and concerns me.  Today at times I know I am beng watched, and have heard radio chatter outside my bedroom at night.  I hear strange &amp;quot;clicks&amp;quot; in my house occasionally too.  Sometimes I even fear for my safety because &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; know that I know the truth about UFOs and Extraterrestrials.  They are indeed real.  Who are we?  Why were we marked?  Lastly, what does these strange symbols on our foreheads mean for our future?  Are we being monitored for some strange reason or another?  I must remain ananymous about my identity because I feel I might be in danger.  My cousin R. feels the same way.  My story is true, and a! s a Christian I take my honesty and integrity very seriously. ! I now w ork handling U.S. Government material, and trust me; The UFOs Are Real, and I have the material to prove it.&amp;quot;  JG  Kentucky<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/1/65 13:00|Long Beach|CA|Cylinder|5 seconds|At about 4 years of age, I observed a cylinderically shaped object fly over at about 2oclock due west.|4/26/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12667.html|55|ndxe196506| At about 4 years of age, I observed a cylinderically shaped object fly over at about 2oclock due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about four years old I saw something which left a real impact on me.  I have never been able to completely discount this event as explained.  I was playing with a freind in his backyard and looked up - due west and at about 2oclock or 45 degrees - and saw what looked like a cylinder, or as I thought at the time, a missile or a plane with no wings.  Moving left to right, it crossed my field of view in less than ten and perhpaps about five seconds. I must have recently seen something about missiles because I remember thinking that&#39;s what I was seeing...but also that it seemed very strange none-the-less.  It seemed at first to be as high as a commercial airliner, but then it appeared to be much smaller and lower that a jet would fly.  It was silver and without any other appreciable detail that I can recall.  My clearest memory of the event would put the objects length at about 30 feet and with a diameter of about 7 feet...less than 25% of its length.  It&#39;s distance would then be about two or three city blocks.  I sometimes thought about this as a child.  When I was old enough to realize that missiles do not normally fly over peoples houses, I eventually assumed that I had seen a plane banking so that his wings were parallel to my line of sight.  But upon further reflection, I also remembered being quite sure that the object was a simple cylinder having no vertical structures.  I never even made the connection to cigar shaped UFOs until recently...it had just never clicked for some reason.  What strikes me now is the lasting impact that the event had on me.  I don&#39;t mean anything mystical here, simply that even at the age of four I seemed quite sure that this thing was very strange.  It was one of those rare events which imprinted clearly as one of my earliest sustained memories in life - like the first time I saw Santa Clause or when I got my first tricycle.  It is this conviction in memory which motivated me to report this story.<n>

My husband was in the Air Force at the time. At first we didn&#39;t even know what we were looking at.It was oval in shape and hovered about 40 ft. above a lot of stopped cars. It was absolutely quiet.We got out to look at it. It was silver and had flashing red and green lights. We watched it about 20 minutes and went home. The next day they told him at Whiteman that one landed there, Oscar One, and not to tell anyone at all about it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/65 09:00|Laconia|NH|Cylinder|5 hours or more|A large object floated out of the sky, to hover over a cove, emitting a strange orange/green glow,  remaining for hours in Laconia NH.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54979.html|58|ndxe196506| A large object floated out of the sky, to hover over a cove, emitting a strange orange/green glow,  remaining for hours in Laconia NH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite frequently I have checked sites looking for reports of this incident, with no results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about ten years years old, or so.  It was June or July, when my Dad (ret. Navy/Coast Guard) heard a report on the local radio station (WLNH)that there was a strange event occuring over a local cove. I don&#39;t remember which area, but I do recall it not being more than 20 minutes away from the center of town where we lived.  For you see my Dad grabbed his camera, said lets go, and we headed out to the area in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were only able to get within a half mile, where we could see a bright orange light over the area through the woods. There was already a crowd, with many vehicles lining the road, which was blocked by police cars, inhibiting furthur encroachment by civilians.  My Dad walked to a group to talk, as we stared at the odd glow that seemed to sink into the surroundings.  The people my Dad spoke to told him we were not allowed to go any closer as the police had made statements concerning possible radiation.  A local doctor my parents knew was there,as he lived in the area, and he told my Dad that he had seen the object in question &#34;floating down from the night sky, before it took up station hovering just over the water, occasionally emitting an odd green glow from the bottom part, that was nearest the water.&#34; We stayed for hours staring at the glow, with the rest, until the police and fire responders told everyone to leave, as the object was not, and there were concerns for our safety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For weeks after my Dad and I went to the highest point in town, a shopping center heading out of town towards Tilton, to watch for more things floating in out of the sky. My Dad always said he had never seen any articles in the local papers at the time of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People talked about it for ages, but no information could ever be gleaned. After reading of the Guilford Police (around 1964) having not told the public to avoid a panic, I tend to think it was some other reason they were not disclosing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still not seeing anything fitting the description of what my Dad and I saw. But it was real, a reliable doctor actually saw it come out of the sky, and there appears to be not record of it anywhere.  I saw the glow that lit up the forest around the cove, if not the actual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Early in the morning my mother went out to hang clothes, she describe an acorn shape object flying low among the tree tops, it did not make any noise.  It flew about fifty to one hundred feet from our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon afterward, we noticed a large, round, silver object hovering steady to the west of our home.  It was at a stand still for nearly three to four hours clear as can be.  It was very large.  Right in the middle of Deming, n.m.  Then three fighters jets came out of no where and began to approach the object.  To my surprise it went from a football field dimension to a pin in a spit second.  The jet aircraft split in three directions and suddenly it just vanished.  I cannot find anything on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and mother and four of my siblings witness this object for hours, it was very large, I cannot understand how this was not witness by the whole city?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone out there who might add to this sighting?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/1/65 01:00|St. Louis (just outside of)|MO|Sphere|1 minute or more|silverish SPHERE 1960s St Louis|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48486.html|60|ndxe196506| silverish SPHERE 1960s St Louis<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can never forget this as long as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When a young child, around 6-8 years old, I was out back playing in the yard alone during the daytime.  My mother was inside.  Our house and backyard were very small. Backyards were all ajoined by wire fencing; and most had open space in yard between back of house towards the end of the yard, where most had trees for privacy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the left and notice something that I would describe as shiney but dull metal, shaped like a perfect ball. &#34;Silverish or grayish&#34; in color. It was very SLOWly rising up from the ground ... straight up!  I first took notice when it was about 4 feet from the ground. &#34;Superballs&#34; (rubber balls of size from 1 inch to fit-in-your-palm size) were popular then. At very first I shouted &#34;wow! a huge superball...&#34; but realized it kept going up ... and up ... and straight up it kept going! and so slow! I watched it till I decided to yell for my mother before it disappeared.  I remember it getting shinier but not sure if that was due to the sun reflecting on it or not.  My last recollection was a shiney round sphere that ascended very slowly into the &#34;sky&#34;, going straight up, and I do not recall thinking it rotated.  My mother first said &#34;oh that was a weather balloon&#34; but was clearly shaken.  I kept insisting on what I know I saw. I knew that was not a weather balloon. She did NOT let me go out to play the rest of that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: My mother before marriage had witnessed a &#34;cigar&#34; UFO in St. Louis.  (This of course I never knew till I was much older and after talking about the sphere incident now and then when growing up.) So this might have been why she was worried that day.  UFOs were something she never spoke about.  In fact, I remember she would never allow me to watch Outer Limits.  She hated that show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If need be, please edit for posting. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
