8/10/58 21:30|Bellevue|WA|Light|20 minutes|At dusk, a light appeared out of the  SE sky arched down above the E horizon moved NW.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94406.html|2|ndxe195808| At dusk, a light appeared out of the  SE sky arched down above the E horizon moved NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July or August 1958 (could have been 1959) at my home in Lake Hills, Bellevue, Washington.  The time was about 9:30pm.   It was dusk but enough light in the western sky to see the profile of the Olympic mountain range.  I was in my back yard which faced west. Most of the sky was dark, the weather was clear as it often is in the Northwest this time of the year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light suddenly appeared to drop out of the southeastern sky.  It seemed to be more intense than the brighest star.  The light arched down toward the horizon in the southern sky travelled west, then toward the northwest as it stayed low (about 15deg above the horizion).  It then passed behind a local  batch of fir trees, about 6 blocks away.  It came into view again from behind the trees at the same altitude and then it passed over the local hills (Cougar Mt &amp; the hills above Eastgate) eventually moving towards the city of Seattle, passing under or  level with a rising full moon.  The intensity did not seen to change as it moved further away.  It seemed to turn slightly north and finally disappeared from my sight behind local terrain to the northwest of me.  No object was seen, just the light, which was very bright and white, with a very constant intensity.  There were no green or red colors assiciated with it.  It appeared to move much faster than any airplane and there was absolutly no sound.  Any jet powered airplane could have been easily heard as the evening was quiet and the object appeared to be within a mile or two at the nearest part of its flight path.  It moved at quite a high speed and it covered at least 25 to 40 miles inside of one minute.  The light was not a reflection off the object, the object was definately the source.  Never heard about anyone who might have been a witness nor was there a mention of the event in the local press.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The incident occurred  in 1958 or 1959.  Exact date is not known.  PD))<n>
8/8/58 15:00|Scarborough|ME|Disk|10 minutes|I was a young girl around 1958 when I saw a saucer-shaped craft on the ground in daylight resting between two sets of power lines|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42260.html|3|ndxe195808| I was a young girl around 1958 when I saw a saucer-shaped craft on the ground in daylight resting between two sets of power lines<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a long time ago but since I have never seen a report like it, I thought it was time to get it into the record. I wish I remembered more about how old I was and the year, but my guess is I was between 8 and 12 years old, which would make it between 1958 and 1962.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes it different is that my sighting was during the day and the craft was on the ground. I was climbing a tree in a neighbor&#39;s yard. The land sloped downhill from where I was. From that high vantage point, I could see across a forest that was intersected by a meandering power line that was probably 1/4 to 1/3 mi away from me as the crow flies. There were two sets of lines, and there on the ground was a saucer-shaped disk with a dome on top. The craft appeared to span most of the distance between the stantions so I would guess it might have been 50 feet across. It was a sunny afternoon and the sun reflected off the craft, but it was not polished and shiny-I would describe it as looking like brushed aluminum. I could not tell--or I don&#39;t remember--whether it had windows or portholes. The object was not moving at all. After looking at it in amazement for several minutes, I ran home to get my mother. I tried to convince her to come and see what I had seen, but once she learned it involved climbing a tree, she would not come with me. I returned to the tree on my own and sure enough the object was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know why I didn&#39;t try to get someone else to pay attention or to see it.  The site would not have been visible from the road and we would have had to hike the power line. The line ran roughly parallel to the road I was on and bisected a road at a right angle to ours. My mother did not drive and it would have been a long walk for me, and a scary one. That argues that perhaps I was closer to age 8 than 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later at dinner, I told the entire family about it. My father said it was probably a utility truck working on the lines. I remember feeling very hurt that nobody would believe me, and insistant about what I had seen. My grandmother was there, probably to baby-sit that evening, and I asked her if we could go to the library and get some books. I do not recall ever seeing any movies or comic books about UFO&#39;s before that, but I must have been vaguely aware they were being talked about. From that point on, I devoured everything I could find on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has haunted me my entire life. This was not a mysterious light in the sky, but a solid object seen in broad daylight. We are most definitely not alone. Thank you for letting me tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
8/4/58 21:00|Karangaroa (New Zealand)||Cigar|5 minutes|aged 12 in 1958 saw dull silver stationary cigar tube shaped object in clear sky with no markings or sound for 5 minutes.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19669.html|4|ndxe195808| aged 12 in 1958 saw dull silver stationary cigar tube shaped object in clear sky with no markings or sound for 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am a 55 year old white male. when i was about 12 on holiday hunting in the west coast bush i stopped in a clearing, looked up on hearing a high flying piston engined plane and saw a stationary, cigar tube shaped object in the clear sky. the aircraft was much higher, moving from left - right. the dull silver tube with rounded ends was on the right hand side of my veiw. i remember wondering if it was connected with the aircraft somehow, like if this was how waste was dumped from planes, far out in the country(!). i stayed looking up at it for what seemed likes ages, but was probably only something like 5 minutes. during that time i saw no movement nor heard any sound. there were no markings on it. it was a dull silver colour. altho it was a strange sight, i didn&#39;t report my experience to anyone for several years afterwards. it was still there when i gave up waiting for it to do something and left the clearing.<n>
8/1/58 19:00|Derby (New Haven)|CT|Disk|10 - 15 min.|Occurred during early evening hours.  LARGE UFO (witnessed by many in neighborhood) hovered over open field at end of housing project.|9/12/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09108.html|5|ndxe195808| Occurred during early evening hours.  LARGE UFO (witnessed by many in neighborhood) hovered over open field at end of housing project. Loud, &#34;hummimg&#34; sound emitted; no other noise; no white lights but, edge of craft encircled by blue..turning to green ...to red lights. No one in crowd felt threatened..no panic (I couldn&#39;t beleive it!), just in awe..everyone almost frozen. It was directly over our heads in a wide-open farm field.  Do not remember how long it was there...I ran home to tell my parents ( I was 7 yrs. old at the time). Did not see craft &#34;appear&#34; or &#34;disappear&#34;...it was so fast.<n>
