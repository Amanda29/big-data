It was about 1000-2000 feet from the ground.  We were staring at it for about 5 seconds, when it suddenly took off in a massive speed.   It didn&#39;t rise up in the sky, it started flying like an airplane at the same altitude where it was staying before.  It took of instantly like in a sci-fi movie, it flew right over our heads and we could hear the breaking of the sound barrier for about 5 seconds or so.  Massive roar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think IT knew that we were staring at it, coz we were pointing at it and saying, &#34;Whoa what&#39;s that?&#34; when it suddenly took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might have been a secret military plane, I don&#39;t know, but it really moved so fast, like it was a science fiction movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size if the triangle could have been somewhat similar to a Boeing 757 or so..<n>

6/30/93 21:00|Racine|OH|Light|10minutes|Dozens of skittering, zipping, moving  lights in an area of the sky...surrounding a much larger,, stationary, pulsating light.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50668.html|3|ndxe199306| Dozens of skittering, zipping, moving  lights in an area of the sky...surrounding a much larger,, stationary, pulsating light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8pm-10pm back in the early nineties when i was young...maybe ten to twelve years old i noticed several points of light high up in the sky.  i was car sick lying in the back of my brothers vehicle on a trip home from our mothers looking up and out the side window. They appeared to be no bigger than the millions of stars that already light up our sky each clear night. The odd thing was they were moving around....like a group of fireflys way up in the sky...dozens of them. Now they werent moving across the entire sky...they basically stayed in the same area of the sky.   I watched the rest of the trip home and finally got my brothers attention when we got out at home to look up and see for himself.  Not only were there several little balls of light flying around...they seemed to be centered around another light...only this one was much bigger...and it seemed to be pulsating every cpl seconds.  Now the larger, pulsating light didnt move..it appeared to be stationary in the sky...but the smaller ones were litteraly zipping around like a cloud of gnats.  We continued to watch and came to the meger conclusion that it had to be some sort of UFO/S.  And just like that...there was nothing...if you&#39;d blinked you&#39;d missed it...the lights were gone.  I know how this must sound but after talking about it for awhile with my brother we kinda thought it looked like there was some sort of &#39;mothership&#39;...the pulsating larger light....and that the smaller ones were just that...smaller ships doing some kind of manuevers..lol, i know how that must sound..and i did watch star trek every night growing up...but i thought it might help u to understand exactly what i was looking at. Sorry no photos...no nothing really...but to this day the memory is as if it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I respect the fact there are people like you to tell these stories to...and i hope that with every 1000s bullshitters out there...there may be one crediblem, actual, eye witness of a UFO. what i am wondering is if you&#39;ve ever heard any accounts like the one i just told you about before?  I know there isnt much in my story but thats all there was to see...i wish there was more..maybe a saucer..or some kind of E.T....but, alas...there was none.  Have you ever heard of anything quite like this before? Thank you so very much for your time...im sure you spent a few minutes trying to read through my absolute terrible grammer and sentence writing skills...Have a good one!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The 1st of 3 large lights rose above mtn. no sound, it took about 5 min to disappear, straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light could be seen shining threw the trees on the top of the mountain. I thought it was th moon getting ready to come up. Slowely a big light could be seen in the trees. I told wife I thought a helicopter was up there looking at the area of the airplane crash.  However, the light at about a mile away looked about half the size of the moon and was about as bright as the moon on a clear night.  There was no sound, I became more curious as the second light came up.  then the third.   they appeared to be a couple hundred yards apart. they started picking up speed, going almost straight up.  These were big lights, maybe as big a a hundred feet across.  they kept going faster and fast, getting smaller un till they looked like blinking stars and they were gone.--------I did not ever think I would report this, but since I got a computer I have found a lot of things in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I did not see any part of the aircraft.  It blended into the night. what blew me away was the size of this thing.. my opinion I believe this object is man made because the lights look like they came from this earth.  we do have a military base upstate new york and it was coming from that direction south south east.  I do believe that there is life on other planets but I don&#39;t think this is it by the way you make a newspaper is the next day small article and that was it<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/93 19:00|Milan|OH|Triangle|15 minutes|Giant Black Delta Triangle Cut Corner's,3 huge circular white light's underneath.90% silent and very slow|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75275.html|6|ndxe199306| Giant Black Delta Triangle Cut Corner&#39;s, 3 huge circular white light&#39;s underneath.90% silent and very slow<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was bass fishing on milliman rd pond after sunset,when everything got still and that&#39;s when I looked southwest and analyzed a Giant Black Triangle Delta for 15 minute&#39;s,a half mile away,1200 ft high,with 6 side&#39;s and 3 giant white lights underneath.It slowly moved to the northeast at 10 mph and finally had a slight humming noise. It was the size of 6 football field&#39;s on all 3 sides.  The 3 corners were 2 football field across. The height was 1 football field high.A Black Triad is what I called it.I then left milliman pond before dark and went to my girlfriend and her father&#39;s house.  They asked me what I caught.  I laughed and told them I caught a UFO.  I then silently waited to brag the next day.  No news of it!I reported this twice to a sheriff.  He told me he didnt have a computer each time!  The bellevue police seen my picture,my musical lyric&#39;s, all were stolen by a rival band and luckily retrieved by police.  They asked me if I was a bombmaker!.  I got furious at the band for accusing me of that.  I told police my guitar is my only offense and defense I need.  They were scared to death of my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Milan ohio has 3 airports very near the sighting area.  I have been permanantly traumatized to learn I am the only one to see and helplessly report this to everyone,even to this site for many years.  I need someone to Oficially question the airport&#39;s or whomever was involved.  Why is there no official police report site for ufo&#39;s in america?  There is a bunch of satellite video of this craft that noone can buy or see. I want all the Data info on this area for my lawyer&#39;s case  .If they recorded this area and deleted more footage, it will be known.My sighting has much more behind it.  It has consumed everything and everyone around me, and put me in the hospital many time&#39;s during my fringe research.I was not on drug&#39;s.  I did have some sore&#39;s that slowly formed on my face and had to be removed,leaving scar&#39;s.  They didnt say what caused them.I dont go outside much anym! ore.  I&#39;ve never fished since.  This site wont let me choose hexag! on shape  It had six sides. Please upgrade shapes with an picture or a Deltoid catagory.  And call already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While we stopped at the store one of us went into the store. There used to be a pond where us locals used to go swimming in the summer. While one of my friends was in the I noticed a very large light hovering over the pond  I pointed out this light to my other three friends still in the truck we were all seeing the same thing. It was just above the tree tops and sat in the same spot the whole time it seemed to just a bright white light about twenty to thirty feet around.We were at the store for about 7 minutes. When we were leaving I pointed out something else coming down from the sky to my friends it was a red pulsating object moving very fast and are direction.We were headed back to where we had come from work just minutes from the store. We all were watching this thing coming down we went past are driveway and pulled into the next driveway.As soon as we pulled in the driveway this thing was over us i would say twenty feet above the trees and was stopped over top of us all three of my friends were just looking up this thing was triangle in shape and every thing was so quite.I started asking my friends if they were seeing what I was seeing they all said yes then i asked what they saw and we all were seeing this thing. I had the driver shut the truck off and i rolled down the window. It was about 100 feet to each corner of the thing and had a light on every corner red , blue green, and white this thing just sat there no sounds or wind coming from it  was not a helicopter or a plane.I don&#39;t know how long we were looking at this thing I just remember saying lets get out of here because it had gone from interesting to scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/30/93 15:00|Massachusets Turnpike|MA|Other|10 minutes|Immense, perfectly rectangular shaped cloud-like object appears and disappears in a clear blue sky.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59369.html|8|ndxe199306| Immense, perfectly rectangular shaped cloud-like object appears and disappears in a clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this sighting in 1993,  I held an extremely high profile job in law enforcement, and said nothing about it to anyone, however, it has stayed with me all these years.  Since it occurred on the Massachusetts Turnpike in full view of hundreds if not thousands of cars, I decided I would post it here, in case someone else might have seen more of it.  I was driving Eastbound toward New York, late in the afternoon, when I came over a hill and noticed directly in front of me, in a clear sky what seemed to be an immense and dense white cloud-like, that was perfectly formed into a rectangle reminiscent of a white piano key.  Its edges were perfectly formed and it seemed to be low in the sky and perhaps as much as a thousand feet in length. It remained perfectly motionless and radically unnatural in a cloudless, clear blue sky.  As I drove toward it in heavy traffic I debated pulling onto the shoulder of the road to take a photo.  The road dipped into a valley and the object was hidden by trees.  Determined to take a photo the moment I caught sight of it again, I raced the car forward. By the time I reached the next hilltop, the sky was perfectly clear.  I never saw it again, nor have I ever seen anything like it at any time in my life.  As I said, the memory stays with me, along with a great regret for not having stopped my car immediately and taken a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Also it as completely dark, no lights on the craft,and it didnt make any noise.  I watched the object as it was still slowly moving forward towards the four-way stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object reached the intersection, it was now completely visible.  It was grey, looked like a plane, size of a plane.  The object stoppped right in the middle of the intersection, so now i am at eye level with the object  The object then changed its shape, and turned into a star, it glowed a bright red, orange and maybe yellow, then the object changed its shape again to a really small round craft, and took off into the sky so fast headed toward stars.  I followed the object with my eyes,in secounds it was gone dissapeared in the stars, there was a line of smoke in the sky and within secounds that was gone too!  Back in 92-94 I was a pre-teen I did run home and tell my mother, whom absolutly believed me.   Over the years I moved out of state, and my brothers (we have 10+ years in age difference) still report seeing ufo&#39;s all the time over my mothers house!  We think the air space must be something worth investigating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am curious as to why I never heard any report of this sighting on any media, or from any other person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot place the date accurately as it was a deer hunting trip with my two sons a good many years ago.  My guess would be sometime in November around 1993.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning to camp around 08:00 and noticed what I thought was the sun.  But I quickly noticed it was moving horizontal from my right to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hollered to my one son to turn and look at it.  He did see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said it looked to be the size of the sun, but a dull orange color and took maybe 10 seconds before disappearing behind some trees at the far side of a large clearing in the woods.  It appeared to be a good distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I simply would like to know if anyone else saw this object.  I can&#39;t imagine so many people between us and Seattle area during the morning commute not seeing the same thing we did.  But, no report and I never made one myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/93 01:30|Sun City|CA|Light|10-15 seconds|Strange lights move over our heads while releasing bright flashes of light.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100657.html|11|ndxe199306| Strange lights move over our heads while releasing bright flashes of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late one night as I was 15 years of age a female friend and I were chasing one another on the equipment in a playground.  In the middle of our horse play a bright flash that was strong enough to blind us from all other sight was released.  The flash was quick and resulted with no sound and did not leave our vision impaired after it was through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This flash did disorientate me and I proceeded to stop and wonder, losing all track of my friend at that moment.  Not to long after the first flash followed another flash just like the first one before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was looking all around to try to make quick sense of what was going on.  Finally I decided to look up towards the stars.  What I saw next froze my body into a very frightening but awe-struck pose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe it was a pattern of lights that had a soft glow to them, like an infrared light on a security camera you might see at an amusement park.  The lights were arranged in a circle, with another smaller circle of lights with in of different color and 2 to 3 more following with in all of different color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only half of these lights were visible.  The circle dimmed as you looked towards the center (half circles).  Once the lights were seen towards the half way point of the circle they were less visible.  The other half of the circles of lights were not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved together as one although you can see every star in the sky between them.  The lights were proceeding west above our heads slowly, like a helicopter can and during the entire event not a sound was made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened quickly, but before the lights faded as it was moving, another flash just like the ones before was released. Just moments after this flash the lights faded quickly and were gone.  One more flash was released after the lights vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point I felt over whelmed and composed myself quickly and began to look for my friend. I found her staring up at the same place I was looking during the event.  She proceeded to look right at me and her face told me she saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly asked her if she did see it.  Scared to death she nodded yes.  I told her then we should leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shaking and nervous, we hopped on our bicycles and started to go home when a Riverside County Sheriff raced by the park and flung his search light right on us.  He stopped and exited his patrol car very fast and approached us a little nervous himself and asked us with a strong voice what we were doing here.  Both of us were to frightened to answer him right away and he did detect this and proceeded to ask us calmly but fast if we saw anything.  We both nodded no.  Disappointed he told us strongly to go home and rushed back to his car and took off very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back home dazed and confused, talked briefly on what we saw and never spoke of it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20 years later I can not come up with one single ideal of what it was.  Only 4 factors that play in my mind is the Air Force Base not but 20 miles or so north from us at the time, my friend saw it with me, the officer saw something too if not just the flashes and people the next day speaking of the flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It will be posted when we receive the follow-up written report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone camping in the mountains and was awakened by strange noises and an intense bright light that seemed unearthly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an experienced hiker/backpacker having spent more than 250 days out in the last ten years. On 6/26/93 I was back packing alone in Holy Cross Wilderness area. I had set up camp just at tree line in some scrub brush near a rocky clearing approximately 2 miles due north of Mt Holy Cross.  After securing food and smellables I retired to my tent.  I was awakened to the sound of &#34;animals?&#34; scratching the gravel and sand around the tent.  I was not concerned as it sounded like muscrats.. and I quickly fell back asleep. Sometime later I woke abruptly in a cold sweat unable to move or to hear anything (as though underwater).  I was able to open my eyes.  As I did this the sound began to come back but as though through a wall or from far away.  I was scared but thought it a bad dream.  As I lay not knowing what was happening the wind began to pick up and the tent seemed to billow and fall, as though breathing.  The sounds that had been outside previously, had returned and began to intensify.  Instead of one or two small animals though it was as if there were a dozen angrily digging/scratching at the ground all around the tent.  Still unable to move to look from side to side (I was lying on my back) I heard the scratching move from the ground to the tent walls on all sides.  As this happened the wind became more intense causing the tent to sway.  I suppose all of this could be explained by my having a bad dream and a wind storm coming up suddenly.  However, the next part I can not explain.  This whole wind/scratching/tent moving lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Then as though someone had blown out a candle everything stopped and there was complete stillness.  Then the whole tent and surroundings became brighter than daylight.  A complete and encompasing white light entered the tent.  I was absolutely blinding.  I was still unable to move.  I light moved around in some ways but was always intense.  Then as quickly as it became bright it was again dark and as still as any quiet night in the woods.  There wa! s no mor e wind and no more scratching.  As soon as the light was gone I was able to move again.  Needless to say I was upset.  Checking my watch it was almost 03:30:00.  I got up and packed up my things and began my assent of Holy Cross Mtn two hours early.   I did not pass by my campsite on my way out of the preserve.  Rather I took an extended loop and spent the next three nights wondering if it would happen again.  It did not.  I did not see any other hikers during my 5 day outing.  After I left the wilderness area I drove to the nearest town to get some supplies and see if any one had reported any strange sightings.  No one else had seen or reported anything.  I do not do drugs and was not influenced by alcohol during this trip.  I did not see a craft or see any &#34;little green men&#34;  but I can not explain what happened to me that night.  All I know is that it scared the crap out of me and I am not one to get scared in the woods.<n>

Right at sunset while we looking at the view a bunch of lights came together and started to spin around like a strobe light would look. The object had no real definition it reminded me of a chameleon. I looked at my boyfriend and then in an instant it took off. Dark set in shortly and then the real show began. The object danced in the sky in three different locations before it left. The whole event lasted over three hours. Almost a year after the incident my boyfriend heard a radio show where a woman was describing the same three point location of the object from the previous summer. She was calling from Reno, so she would have witnessed the same sky we were looking at. No one has ever believed my story. Even the people in the camping group dont believe. But I do. This wasn&#39;t my first observation of unexplained objects in the sky. When I was 10-12 years of age I witnessed two lights in the sky go to one light and then took off out of sight. This all happened in Mendecino Co.<n>
6/25/93 20:00|Madison Heights|MI|Cylinder|5 minutes|Illuminated cylindrical craft hovers slowly and silently over residences.....|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45222.html|17|ndxe199306| Illuminated cylindrical craft hovers slowly and silently over residences.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a late August night.  The sky had a violet hue to it.  That is how, despite the night fall, I was able to discern the shape of the craft in question.  My mother, my grandmother, younger brother and I were parked in our Dodge Ram Charger waiting for my father to get out of Foodland.  My father had been working a number of years as a butcher in their meat department.  Our station wagon was in the shop at the time so, we used the Ram Charger to run errands during the day and were forced to pick my father up from work each night until our car was repaired.  The Foodland was located on Campbell Rd. where it intersects with 14 mile rd.  The Foodland no longer exists.  There is a large grocery store in it&#39;s place now, and an Outback Steakhouse restaraunt in the parking lot where we witnessed the bizarre aircraft.  We were parked facing the west side of Campbell Rd, waiting patiently for my father to get out of work.  He was scheduled to work until 8 pm that night and that&#39;s exactly when we saw it.  Some bright lights began shining through the treeline above the residences along Campbell Rd.  The lights were very low and they were intensely bright.  Although none of us said a word, I later found out that my grandmother and mother had both assumed, as I had, that the lights belonged to a low flying passenger jet.  Eventually the ascending object came into view above the treeline.  All of us were silent for a moment.  At first, we stared at the object in silence, each one of us trying to determine WHAT it was we were all looking at.  When no conclusion could be reached, my mother exclaimed &#34;Oh my God!&#34; and we all got out of the Ram Charger for a clearer view of the strange craft.  By the time I had gotten out of the Ramcharger, the aircraft was no longer ascending.  It remained completely still for about 45 seconds and then slowly, very slowly began hovering southbound along the west side of Campbell Rd.  The object appeared to be about 4 to 5 homeyard lengths, though it is impossible for me to judge exactly what our distance was.  From my perspective, it spanned the distance of about 5 of the front lawns of the residential homes it seemed to be hovering above.  The object was shaped like a relatively thin cylinder.  The perimeter of the craft was lined with rectangular lights of extraordinary brightness.  There were very thin slits dividing the lights that were the same shade as the rest of the exterior of the craft: black(or at least how it appeared as a silouhette against the violet sky).  The lights did not move along the perimeter of the vehicle.  They did however look like they were bound by a textured or coagulated transparent surface.  Those lights were the most incredible display of illumination I have ever witnessed.  I could not see any specific details along the exterior of the craft.  Under the lighting conditions, it appeared to be a flat black or at least a very dark brown.  Although I must admit, there was the hum of Campbell rd. and 14 mile rd. traffic from our position, the hovering object made no sound that could be distinguished from the passing cars.  It left no kind of trail in it&#39;s wake either.  After about 4 minutes watching the aircraft hover slowly and silently south along Campbell rd, my mother became frightened and began yelling for me to get back in the Ram Charger.  She later told me that she had begun thinking of all of those horrible U.F.O abduction stories she&#39;d heard about and seen on various t.v shows.  At that point, I could only see about one third of the craft anyways.  It had hovered nearly out of sight behind some of the much taller trees.  I obeyed my mother and got back in the truck.  We all waited with inpatience for my father to exit Foodland.  When he got to the vehicle about 5 minutes later, we were all frantically telling him to get in the car and try to spot once more what we had already seen.  My father laughed at first.  He didn&#39;t seem to believe our story at all but after a few moments of him observing our enthusiasm over what we had witnessed, he hopped in the truck and started off down Campbell.  The flying vehicle had not been lost from our sight for more than 6 minutes and yet, as we drove further and further south down Campbell, we found that it was no longer visible in any direction.  Even at major intersections such as 13 and 12 mile, where we looked back to see if the object was flying too close to the trees to be seen from the road itself, we ended up seeing nothing.  It was gone that quick.  As far as I know, no one ever reported sighting the object to the police or any other agencies in that area.  I checked several newspapers the following morning to see if anyone else had shared our bizarre experience.  Given the size, illumination and altitude of the hovering vehicle, it seems completely impossible to me that we were the only people to have witnessed this.  Even as I was glaring at the airborn object, I found it hard to believe that traffic along 14 mile and Campbell didn&#39;t come to a complete standstill when this thing came into view.  Save for the indifference of surrounding citizens, it looked like an incredible effects shot of an extra terrestrial visitor in a blockbuster film like &#34;Independance Day&#34;.  I have never seen this craft again and I also have never seen it photographed or even sketched once during all the time I&#39;ve spent reviewing popular U.F.O sighting since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The river is a couple of miles wide and on the other side of the river is Maryland. This location is about 10 miles from a militray bas, Fort A.P. Hill. We were fishing behind this seafood restaurant which has a couple of peirs to fish from. On the other peir there was a family of 3. Well, while we were fishing I noticed up in the sky probably 1000 ft. up was a white object flying slowy over the river. It was making no sound. The crazy thing about it was, as it was flying over the river it would just fade out and vanish when it was close to the other side of the river. And amazingly after this would occur, it would re-appear back where it started from. This went on for about 20 minutes. I even ran over to the other pier to show the people there what it was doing. We all saw it in broad daylight on a clear day. The other strange thing was, after it had stopped flying over, a few minutes later a fighter jet flew up through the area that this UFO craft had just been flying in. Has anyone else seen anything like this. Please email me if you have.<n>

It was clear and it was just getting dark at the time. We then the next day went to go play some pool at a pool hall and I overheard another table talking about the same thing that they saw the night before. This was never brought up again by any of us. And to this day I know what I saw was real and wasnt no swamp gas, weather baloon or any other excuse that is normaly used to explain these things. This was my 2nd siting both occured in Weymouth and both in the same year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Have you ever seen anything like that???? a few days later another friend and i decided to go to a friends house where we could see the whole capitola and monterey bay and we saw 2 flying disks that evening and 4 black helicopters flew in and surrounded it, they had a stand off for about a half hour then the saucers whent up and flew off at the speed of light and vanished, then the helicopters flew away. it was wierd.

The house I lived in was on a hill with its front porch facing South. The house, called Langdon House, was leased by my employers for we, the hotel and kitchen staff. That evening there were only three of us home out of 13 other housemates. I, on the first floor, and two women on the second floor. At 8:45pm (eastern) I left my room, and to this day I don&#39;t know why I felt compelled to do so, grabbed a pair of binoculars and went out and sat on the front porch, facing south. It was mid to late June and still pretty light out. I remember this like I remember my own name. Due south was a light, midway from the horizon line, that seemed to be pulsating and changing colors. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but when I peered through the binoculars the light looked too close, and its colors too distinct. Red, blue, green and white. I watched it for some time with binoculars. In fact I thought &#34;oh my god, this can&#39;t be what I think it is,&#34; when I heard a buzzing or a humming. I, still seated on the front porch, turned to my right and saw an object moving very slowly and seeming to hover at about 100 feet. It was vaguely triangular because it looked hazy, like orange translucence. But it gets even stranger. In the moment that it took to turn my head to the right, the evening light blackened and I could see no stars. Just the light in front of me facing south pulsing, changing colors and the object moving round my to my right. Right then and there I decided that I was not going to be the only nut witnessing this and ran into the house and up the stairs, where I found two female coworkers and housemates. I blabbered something about lights, my words travelling 80 mph. They followed me outside. When the three of us got back outside, we walked around the right side of the house where there is a driveway and a small side yard. The west side of the house. The island has virtually no street lights. There are no traffic lights. It is 7 miles long and three miles wide. Outside it was dark. There were multiple objects, all orange and hazy looking. They were everywhere. Hovering, bouncing. I also noticed that there was a light pulsating just like the first light I saw, only Due north. The three of us saw at least a dozen odd shapes performing many different feats. During this not one person walked past our house. Not one car drove past. Not one airplane flew overhead. This was strange because the Langdon House is on one of the ONLY main roads on the island. Less than a mile, SW, away is the Block Island Airport. The only way on or off the island is air or sea. It was a weekend and its usually a busy airport. The event ended at 9:15pm (eastern) according to my watch that evening and according to a clock radio in the room my companions shared on the second floor. Being keyed up by this nerve racking experience, the three of us walked less than a quarter mile down the hill to a local tavern, the Yellow Kittens. We left the house within fifteen mins if I recall correctly, after the event ended. When we got to the Yellow Kittens tavern the clock on the wall read 10:45pm. My wrist watch read 9:30pm.<n>

We heard a whirring kind of noise.&#34;  George: &#34;I thought it sounded like air blowing through some kind of metal tube.&#34;  Bob: &#34;I thought it sounded like highly crafted ball bearings rolling, pulsating.  Then it grew louder, we came out to the front of the yard to listen, and then it faded away pretty quickly.&#34;<n>

My military occupation was Aviation Ordnan|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33686.html|24|ndxe199306| I was in the Military at the time stationed at Navel Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington. My military occupation was Aviation Ordnance technician. I was assigned to an EA6-B Squadron. I don’t remember the exact date this happened but it was in the month of June, I remember that because I had just started working &#34;Swing Crew&#34; (that’s the shift that starts at 23:30 and ends at 07:30) at the beginning of June. We were just doing a shift change and there was a heated discussion between the two Petty Officer First Classes that were the supervisors of each shift and it was about something to do with some duties that were not completed by the previous shift. The supervisors had all of the people from my crew and the previous crew leave the shop while they had there heated discussion. Are hanger is on the side of the base closest to the water of the Puget Sound. Are shop was a trailer type building out side the west side of the hanger on the flight line. There is a clear view of the water when on are flight line. On this night, all flight sorties were over and the field and control tower was shut down for the night, which doesn’t happen that often, and it was very dark on the flight line that night, with all the runway lights off and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about five people on my shift. With the exception of my self, they headed to the &#34;Gedunk&#34; (snack-bar) in the hanger. I decided to just hangout out on the flight line and wait for the Petty Officers to get through. I walked over towards the wash rack that was to the west of are shop. It was a very clear night and some times you can see the northern lights. I had seen them from the flight line maybe a month or so earlier. I was also looking up to see if I could see any falling stars or satellites passing over. I had been out there about four or five minutes looking up and facing west, when all of a sudden I saw out of the corner of my left eye what looked like a meteor falling at what I would guess to be around a 70 degree angle towards the earth. I looked right at it and I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. It was bright white and moving very fast, I could clearly see a smoke trail following it and it was so close to where I was standing, that I could actually hear it sizzling. I was waiting for it to impact the water of the Puget Sound where it looked to be heading. All of a sudden it changed directions abruptly at what I would guess to be some where between 200 to 500 feet above the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, it leveled off and headed in a northwest direction. I was speech less, I felt like a panic attack was happening to me. I looked around real quickly to see if anybody was around besides me to witness what I had just seen. I didn’t see anybody and looked back at the light right away. I couldn’t believe I could still see it. I was watching it for a few more seconds now and it turned from a bright white light to a red light. A second latter two more lights split horizontally from each side and there were now three red lights in a horizontal formation moving away from me towards the horizon, a second after it split into three, it did it again and now there were five red lights in a horizontal formation. I watched them until they flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the guys on my shift about what I had just witnessed and they just laughed and thought I was pulling their legs. I asked around the squadron if anybody else had seen it and somebody said that some one else was talking about seeing strange lights in the sky that night, but I didn’t find out who that was. I watched the local news the next day and there were reports of people seeing strange lights in the sky around that time. I can’t explain what I saw that night, but I know for a fact I didn’t hallucinate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Myself and two other friends were standing on one of my friend&#39;s front porch.  I had grown bored of the conversation and was looking at the pine trees to the south.  I was wondering when the city had put a new arc light there.  The color was the same yellow and the brightness the same intensity.  I soon realized that this light was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then went over out heads.  It was a massive black triangle.  My fist at arms length would not have covered the object.  I measured it using my clenched fist and the back end of the triangle was four fists wide.  At the front of the triangle were two huge lights that projected beams into the night, and then down the front two sides were three smaller lights about the brightness of Jupiter in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved slowly south to north, and what sounded like a huge diesel engine could be heard.  Knowing of the missing time phenomenon, I had checked my watch when I had realized what! I was seeing and then after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four minutes had passed.  I know that the object was a solid triangle and not a boomerang shape because the stars were blacked out.  Later, I would say the way it moved reminded me of a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One item of note is the direction it traveled.  Almost all of the air traffic in Salisbury travels east and west; Pittsburgh to Baltimore or New York or DC.  I found it odd that it was traveling south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a helicopter searching the area or something. As I approached it I noticed there were 3 lights not just 1. They were in a perfect triangle spaced apart about the distanceof a baseball game baseline(1st to 2nd eg.). The strange thing was I couldn&#39;t see any craft whatsoever. If I recall correctly the lights were about the size of one of those &#34;coca cola&#34; advertizing &#34;discs&#34;, roughly. I had my eyes glued to it at this point, I slowly hit the brakes and motioned the car off of the road, onto the soft shoulder, I snapped my head to the front to be sure I wasn&#39;t gong into the ditch and spun my head back toward the object. It was gone! No big flash of light, but the wierdest part was there was no sound!!Nothing! I felt sort of dazed for a second or two wondering &#34;how the hell does a thing that friggin big disappear like that&#34;!<n>

They were moving haoticly all the time but keeping same triangle shape then they would disapear and come back again in seconds but far from spot where they blinked out.

I was outside one night smoking a cigarette and I noticed two orangeish / dark yellow lights, maybe 100-150 yards away, traveling together from left to right through the neighboring woods.  One was slightly higher than the other, but both were relatively close to the ground around 8-10 feet or so, and the shapes were spheres.  From where I was the lights looked like the size to that of a cd.  They had a constant steady rate of speed which I would say was about 5 mph but did not illuminate the trees / wooded area where the lights were.  They were just there and nothing else was lit up in the woods.  I spotted the lights in the woods a couple other nights that week, except they were across the yard in a different locations, or were spread out- it was like the lights were there, and then they were gone.  Each time I saw the lights it lasted about 5-10 seconds and then they were gone.  I did not see any other shapes than that of light spheres.  I thought it was strange, and told my parents.  They did not believe me, but the whole thing was spooky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later it was late at night, around midnight, and I was watching tv.  A very very bright white light the shape of a sphere and about the size of a tennis ball passed by in front of the window and was gone.  This was different from the other lights I saw as they were orangeish, and this was a very bright light and scared the hell out of me.  The room where the tv is on the backside of the house that faces the woods.  I had the feeling that it was watching me as it went by. Curious if anyone else has seen orange &amp; white moving lights like this in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My son and I were watching a movie on television; a rental of &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; when I felt a vibration and looked at my glass of coke;it was vibrating.My son sayes he heard something outside but I don&#39;t remember hearing anything. We then went to the front door and looked out and didn&#39;t see anything so we checked the back door and saw a craft in the distance flying away. We just assumed it was a test plane from Ft, Rucker as it is a pilot training center.We then went back to our movie. A few minutes later(15 to 30 minutes). I felt the vibration again so we checked the back door but didn&#39;t see anything.Then we checked the front .While looking strait out we didn&#39;t see anything.This confused us because we knew it was back.I then looked strait up and saw just black.It was a clear night so the stars were visible but I couldn&#39;t see anything but blackness. I touched my son and pointed, we just stood there stairing at blackness. Then a light reflected off of it and I saw a matalic surface above us.I was tempted to throw a rock at it because it looked that close.Slowly it proceeded off towards Ft.Rucker and we went back inside.We realised it was flying really slow and very, very low but at the time didn&#39;t think anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second flyover took apx 5 minutes too clear the house and another five to fly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think about it again till I heard about others on Art Bell.I started thinking again and remembered that it had no lights and no exhaust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate the date of the incident.

I saw a Solid Black FISH shaped object in the sky coming from the southwest or sort of more westerd. It had no lights nor any sound, only silence. It was traveling very slow NorthEastward or sort of more Northward. The object was very low and the size was three times as wide as my house and double in length. A few minutes after the craft/U.F.O. was almost out of sight there came a military aircarft following its path in which it came. Now the military craft was very loud with lights on it.

From my window I saw one dull metallic grey object having no markings of any kind hovering in the sky to the North West of the city. Unable to accurately describe size as I do not know how far away it was. Judging only by it&#39;s clarity I guessed it to be less than half mile distant at about one thousand feet altitude. Size at a guess about 30 feet in length and approximately 8 feet in width. It was floating horizontally, stationary at first for about 10 seconds then slowly moved South East out of my view. It was cylindrical with rounded ends, the same shape as a medicinal gelatin capsule. I am  a licensed pilot (fixed wing)and a retired police sergeant. I would estimate my observational ability as very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Didn&#39;t really ever want to tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving my friends house and proceeding down the driveway, I heard the crows in the tops of the tall pines raising heck. I turned to look because the noise was like that of/or if 1 of their own was wounded. While watching them in the tops of the trees fling around squalking wildly, with a clear blue sky in the farthest background, I noticed a round blue circular object coming into view underneath the high cirrus clouds. Immediately I was overwhelmed as it came closer and to my dismay, began to project the clouds over top of the craft on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was easy to follow while moving down the peninsula with the constant movement of the clouds in the path of the craft being seemingly plucked from the sky and projected on the underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft only stopped two times while traveling down the peninsula, once over apparently Ft.Eustis, the second being apparently over ths James River bridge area, before uplifting at an incredible pace and dissapearing above the high cirrus clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two times the craft stopped it was extremely hard to see. 1 point that I called frantically for my friend or his 2star Admiral father to come see what i was looking at, i looked away for a second while it was stationary, only to have a hard time seeing it again when i looked back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still stationary, the craft seemed to have a sheen of a very thin line of colors of the surroundings given at it&#39;s outermost edges. But when it started to move again, it resumed picking up what was above the craft and projecting it below on it&#39;s hull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise from it the whole time, however the crows stopped squalkin when the craft was stopped almost overhead. Weird hugh? The approximate time for this whole ordeal was about 5 mins. The approximate path viewed was form the Colonial Williamsburg - Camp Peary area down to the first stop over the Warwickriver - Ft.Eustis area then down to the James River bridge - Newport News shipyard area. When leaving upwards and outwards the craft seemed to go towards Chesapeake - Soffolk direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wondered over the years if they had the techonology to project what was above to below, what a perfect camoflauge if the could project below to the above so as not to be spotted if overflown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ll to sum it up whatever or whoever they were they made me wonder how small we really are. Still, with my faith in Christianity, I guess one day, God will let me know!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

One night in July ( could of been June) we happened to notice some sort of craft hovering over the tree line due east of our house . The exact distance was hard to estimate and could of been one mile away. I had a powerful set of binoculars at the time and focused as best as I could on the object trying very hard to steady my hand . The craft was dark in color and all I could make out were lights, both green and red, blinking in a sequenced triangle pattern. What ever it was slowly moved from left to right several times but never changed alltitude . I was so convinced it was a UFO that I called the williamsburg police department and reported the incident . After I had hung up the phone I noticed the UFO had disappeared from where it had hovered for about 30 minutes. I was in the process of telling my wife about my conversation with the Sheriffs office when a blinding light flashed directly above our two story house. The light was so bright that the yard lit up like it was day time . There was not a cloud in the sky that night,  no chance of rain , and the flash of light was brighter than lighting . My wife and I became a little frightened at that point because there was no sound like lightning and if there was no lightning just exactly what caused the flash of light.  Has anyone else experianced anything like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date  in June 1993 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was never completely sure about what it was that I actually saw, but I know what I saw was real.  I did not want to sound like a nut case, or someone that was trying to get attention through sensational happenings.  However, after years of watching programs about UFO sightings and reading testimonials of others that have described over and over almost exactly, in most cases what I witnessed, I have finally decided for sure that I saw a UFO that did not seem to be anything that could be designed and operated by people from Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving home after checking on our employees that worked late shifts.  We were heading North on I-405 through Kirkland WA.  My wife was sleeping.  It was about 4:30 am when I saw a bright fluorescent sphere moving very slow from east to west.  It had just cleared over the top of a hill to my right and lowered to a few hundred ft. above the road.  Then it stopped directly above the road and hovered there for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my wife to wake up and to take a look at what was right in front of us.  The sphere started to slowly move west across the road.  It kept an altitude relative to the slope of the hillside covered with houses, as this area is heavily populated.  It moved slowly out over Lake Washington.  When it was a few hundred feet out over the lake, it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arms distance the size of the object was relative to the size of a basketball.  The color was about the same as the blue of propane or natural gas when burning.  It made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time my wife was witnessing the event as well as I was.  Then suddenly the sphere slightly expanded and then rapidly shrank into a pin sized dot that lasted for a second or two, as it vanished with incredible speed to the North, almost as if it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both speechless for a few seconds and then we verified with each other that we both saw what we saw and could not put any logical explanation forth to name this as a natural earthly happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I no longer feel like I need to suppress my feeling about what we saw that early morning.  I know I have seen something like all of the others that have reported seeing something similar.  Unless there is a great secret, being well hidden from the masses, what we have witnessed is not from this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

6/15/93 03:20|Peebles (near) (UK/Scotland)||Sphere|APPROX 15 MINUTES|Viewed at 200/300 yards using a rifle telescope it was very close and could not have been one of ours .|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29279.html|43|ndxe199306| Viewed at 200/300 yards using a rifle telescope it was very close and could not have been one of ours<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure on the actual date and time. My elder brother, 2 friends and I were out shooting which on occassions would start at dusk and last all night until just after dawn. We inavariably tried to get some sleep in the FWD from time to time whilst one or the other would keep watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night, absolutely no cloud and I estimate ( very roughly ) that we could see aircraft as far away as 5/10 miles. I was sleeping in the back seat when my brother woke me &#34;Stewart it&#39;s the UFO again - Look !&#34;. I woke up half expecting some prank or another - the guys had been out the previous night when I was not there and had babbled on about seeing a UFO which I had dismissed with a &#34;Oh Really!&#34; attitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked out of my left window and forward towards the forestry commision ground I saw a circular shaped light/ vehicle rise straight up from what appeared to be the forest. I immediately tried to rationalise what I was seeing - I rolled down the window to stop any glass interference but it was still there but had stopped and just hung in the sky at about a 40/50 degree elevation from the ground in relatuion to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that this object was within 300 yards of us. I asked my elder brother to tell me what it was as I was really at a loss to identify it. He said it was the UFO. I screamed at him - I know it&#39;s a UFO but what is it ? &#34;Its a UFO&#34; he said rather infuriatingly. As hard as I could I struggled to reason this one out - could it be a helicopter with a night lamp - but there was no noise and I could see only the object not any helicopter or anything else near it. Could it be a light projected from the ground - no because the circle was not just light it had a physical presence ( and I may ot be describing this well ) a sort of texture - It was definately something real not just a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew by this time that with the best will in the world my friends could not be replicating this. I started at it in awe and then remembered we had the scoped rifles so I took mines out - equiped with a powerful 6X42 scope and started to study it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could determine a circular physical shape , bright luminescent , with a ill defined banding around the center but little else could be identified. I must have studied this object for 3 or 4 minutes at about 300 yards and no higher than 200/300 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the time I was trying to figure out what it was. So far it has risen vertically and quite slowly and then stopped. I knew Helicopters could do this and harrier jump jets but at that distance I would have expected to hear something. There was no wind to block sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then moved from it&#39;s hover position from my right to my left. It moved quickly with incredible speed but stopped instantly. I know we have fast aircraft but I doubt anything can demonstrate this level of acceleration and it came to an instant stop eg from whatever speed to zero instantly. I had only travelled about 200/300 yards and stopped behind but above the corner tree where the two fields meet, still off our ground but only just off. I shouted did you see that and ofcourse they all did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had the night lamps ourselves - these are million candle power lamps and it was suggested by my brother to &#34;Lamp It&#34; eg switch on the lamp and aim it at the object. This was not to increase the view of it - that was not necessary - it was more to provoke it or communicate with it in some way. The eldest chap there did not want us to do this - he was very nervous of what he was seeing and did not want the thing to come any closer that it already was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Behind and below the craft on the horizon I could see an aircraft with its normal navigation lighting heading in our general direction. If the aircarft which must have been 5/10 miles away continued in our direction ( Common site with aeroplanes passing over us at normal height regularly) then it would come close to the bright object albeit the object was still only at about 200/300 ft off the ground. We watched , me through the scope and using the naked eye and the craft just hovered. You could determine some activity eg shimmer/vibration but in was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Aeroplane continued to approach and we stared , transfixed by this encounter and eager to see what if anything was going to happen as the aircraft was on course to fly over the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the aircraft was a few miles distant the object moved again. It shot upwards to the left and stopped instantly again. Then it literally accelerated from zero to disappear in a second heading left and away from us. It&#39;s speed of departing was instant eg almost in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the actual dates and times however within a day or two of our sighting the morning TV programme showed a report on fishermen in cornwall having captured a UFO on video. Whilst I know that video was subsequently disproved or belittled what I can say is that the object we saw resembled what they caught on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To say the event had an effect on me - we wanted to go check out the woods where the object rose from but were frightened to without our rifles and the ground it rose from was not ours. I told a lot of people about this and met with a lot of ridicule but I am a very logical person in my early 40&#39;s , my brother and his friends are about 10 years older and the eldest was a business man who had retired. I would have given a lot of money to have a video camera that night instead of our rifles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For weeks I tried and tried evaluate what I had seen and were there any other possible explanations. For the reasons given below I remain convinced to this day that what I was seeing was either a very specialised and earth shattering new aircraft of ours as yet not made public and has not been made public in the 10 years since or that the object was not man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1] I believe the object demonstrated intelligence in that it moved vertically then horizontally with amazing acceleration and deceleration ( well instantly stopping ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2] I had a clear site of the object and even better through my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3] I am used to seeing british fighters at ground level practising where I used to fish and when they move they make an enormous racket that you can hear for miles let alone 200/300 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4] I had a significant amount of time to study it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5] My brother is army trained and was involved in flying drones etc as well as aircraft recognition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall I do not know what it was but it still facinates me as to what it could have been. I hope this helps anyone who studies these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/15/93 03:00|Memphis|TN|Fireball|few seconds|Blue-ish fireball speeds past the University of Memphis in winter of 1993-1994.|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13809.html|44|ndxe199306| Blue-ish fireball speeds past the University of Memphis in winter of 1993-1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine and I were sitting on the curb of Central Ave at the northern end of the campus of the University of Memphis around 3 or 3:30 am in either November or December of 1993 (although it could be early &#39;94--I do know that it was pretty cold so it was sometime in the winter).  No one was driving on the street or near the area we were at (virtually directly north of were the new university library is)--the area north of the campus is almost entirely residential with no bars, pool halls, or Greek houses, plus most students who are out at the strip are on the other side of campus and usually start to trickle home around 2am.  Essentially, the area my friend and I were in was totally deserted despite the fact that Central is a large 5 lane road when it passes the university. The sighting began when my friend asked for a cigarette: as I held one out to him, he looked in the general direction of my hand (towards the east).  Just above my hand, he later said, and down the street about a mile and a half he saw something headed our way and said &#34;what&#39;s that?&#34;  I turned and looked and saw a blue-ish fireball about a block and a half down the street headed in our direction.  This fireball was maybe 3 or 4 feet in diameter and was travelling pretty fast (approximately 40 to 50 mph) down what looked like the center line of the street.  When it passed above and in front of us, we noticed that it was at a heighth about 5 or 6 feet above the telephone poles that support a traffic light set up for students crossing the street (no cross street). As it passed, the fireball made a kind of &#34;hushed&#34; whooshing sound: similar to that of a cardboard tube when one swings the tube like a bat, but very subdued.  Also, the fireball had a short tail of blue-ish flame (about 5 feet), but left no smoke trail behind it.  The fireball zipped by us and continued down the street to the west until it was out of sight. I&#39;m not sure if what we saw was ball lightning or something different and possibly more exotic, but I thought it might be worthwhile to let somebody know about this just to see if anyone else saw the same thing...I find it hard to believe that my friend and I were the only people to have seen this thing.<n>

At about 2am, I was obseving a small plane being followed by a red ball of light as the plane was trying to land. The plane was invading the UFO.  The plane did not land instead it went full throttle heading towards San Francisco.  The red ball of light went towards the Tracy mountain. I would like to find the pilot of that plane to confirm my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was NO sound.  My friend I simply watched it fly over us and out of view. it was a steady movement and left our sigh shortly after entering it.  As far as we know nothing happened. we just watched it fly over.  From where were the span of the object in the sky was 2-5 meteres across, suggesting it was very very large if we had been up close.  At the time we were both afraid I dismissed it as a government experiment and we slept. (down below it says contacted by an investigator, there isnt much else than this, other than a picture in my sketch book.)<n>
6/15/93 00:00|Des Moines|IA|Rectangle|five minutes|My diesel engine saved me?|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49595.html|50|ndxe199306| My diesel engine saved me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was summer, 1993.  I was driving south on Hwy-69 from Ankeny to Des Moines [Iowa].  I&#39;d arrived at [approximately] the crossroad of NE 66th Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my passenger were listening to an &#39;oldies&#39; radio station on the AM dial, when suddenly in front of us the entire sky lit up white/pink/orange.  The radio went dead - static only.  Upon searching, nothing could be found on either the AM nor the FM dial.  The weird lights on the horizon dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considering the times back then, I think it&#39;s understandable we immediately thought Des Moines had been nuclear bombed.  My passenger and me began sobbing, she hugging me across the console.  Still I continued to drive, but at a marked slower mph.  We approached the area of NE 51st Ave, where on the west side of the road was situated a K-Mart and an Earl May garden center.  Directly behind Earl May was I-80.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is hard to describe, because it was so amazing ... it&#39;s difficult to get my brain around it, let alone find words to do the visual any justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove slowly as we saw *something* behind Earl May.  It was approximately fourty feet high [a guess, judged by the height of the one-story garden center].  It had ... what I can only describe as &#39;sparks&#39; emitting from it&#39;s &#39;roof.&#39; It was, as I remember, rectangular, and silver in color.  But the silver was ... shifty.  Pearlescent kinda.  The &#39;sparks&#39; were of varying colors ... white, pink, orange, yellow ... but said colors were *vivid* and, no joke, hurt my eyes.  At the time my mind thought the &#39;sparks&#39; were emissions from this ... thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that immediate area, just north of the I-80 interchange, and just south, there are stoplights.  Also entrances and exits to and from I-80 [in a clover leaf shape].<n> <n><n> <n><n> At both stoplights cars were stopped.  On the entrance to I-80 westbound too was a car, sitting there, the driver&#39;s door was open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, what we saw behind the Earl May was enough of a mind-jumbler.  Then realizing cars were stopped ... at green lights and on major entrances to Interstate roads ... I was driving *very* slow at this point, as I passed cars ... seemingly empty of drivers and passengers.  But I did make note of semi-trucks passing over the I-80 bridge, as they were apparently the only other vehicles in motion, beyond my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to my passenger/friend&#39;s house, and we woke her father, as we were quite alarmed.  We phoned the radio station to which we&#39;d been listening.  They reported no &#39;outage&#39; that they knew.  Nor did they have any breaking news concerning any sort of ... well, anything that could or would relate to what myself and my friend witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jump to 1992.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sic.  How can the story &#34;jump&#34; backwards in time?  PD))  I&#39;d bought a new Macintosh.  Once I got it set up and connected to the internet, I posted my story to a message group.  Two persons responded, asking what type auto was I driving.  Perplexed (and thinking maybe they were messing with me) I responded I was driving a Chevrolet Celebrity.  One responded immediately asking &#34;... was it diesel?!&#34;  Yes was my response.  Same person responded, again within moments, that the reason semi-trucks were traveling over I-80 was because they were, too, diesel engines ... and went on to say that might have been the reason my vehicle was still operating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t understand *why* that might be ... but I know it created quite a stir within the group to which I posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Then, short, pale men with huge eyes(I can most certianally remember the eyes, they were so dark) surounded me.  They acted as if they were examing me.  Then one pressed his finger against my forhead right between my eyebrows.  I then woke up in my bed, as if nothing happend.  But, I then had a scar right where the one touched me.  I didn&#39;t have it before, but I most cerinally had it then, and it still shows.  I&#39;m sorry, I did not see the spaceship.

I was at a creek in Joplin Missouri. (I moved to Kansas not too long afterwards.) It was on one knee looking at something on the ground and I thought it was a person at first, so I said &#34;Hey&#34;. (It was on an island in the middle of the creek) When it heard me it stood up and looked at me and this is what I saw: Black enormous eyes Skin was like dry looking, white with alittle tint to it No taller than a 10 or 11 year old kid Don&#39;t recall nose or mouth (I may be mistaken) Very skinny, like it was starving Bald headed, large head Long fingers I ran home afterwards and my parents didn&#39;t belive me.

My brother was 7 and i was 9. The rest of the family was downstairs in the guest bedroom. My dad rode a motercylce when he traveled by himself and it was really loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we played up stairs for a good 20 minutes when i thought that i heard my dad coming into the driveway, but the wierd thing was that i didnt hear his bike but i thought he was home. When i looked out the living room window i didnt see anything but the triangular black ufo caught my attention. It was flying right over our house almost touching it. It also made no sound. I called to my brother to look and when he did he was just ammazed. We were both actually. At the time we only thought it was a plane cause we didnt know about UFO&#39;S and Aliens. It was flying like it had no speed at all. As it flew over the house we ran to the back window to look at it. The tip of the craft was out of sight already.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After not too long we just let it go as a plane and went on playing agian. I didnt really get into UFO&#39;s untill a few years ago. Thats when i actually remembered that day and asked my brother about it. For some strange reason he has trouble talking about it, as if he wants to deny that day in all. He is a pretty to-himself kinda guy now. As for me, a while back i didnt soemthing really stupid as a dumb teenager that changed my life. Ill come forward and say that i smoked something that i wasnt suppost to. It was marijuana, but something was wrong with it i guess cause till this day i have panic attacks and just think really weird. It almost seemed like it opened a door in my head that i can&#39;t close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im married now with a wonderful woman and family. Im more open to the unknown and can now except the fact that we arent alone anymore. I can say that i know more about life now then anyone should, or atleast i think i do. After that stupid thing happend to me, i feel that that day with the UFO had something to do with MY way of life. Like i somethimes believe that i could have been abducted cause i think i had missing time that day. Anyway, there is so much more to my life after that day then i should write. thanks for reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a clear sunny morning in June. The sighting began when I noticed a fridge shaped object hanging in the air appearently motionless over the Niagara municipal airport. I stopped the car immediatley. I was about 1km directly north of the airport. The object appeared to be approximately 60 feet tall and perhaps 20 feet wide. Sort of a rounded rectangle, it appeared to be grey in colour. It couldn&#39;t have been more than 150 feet off the ground. At first I thought it may be an unusual hot air balloon. Except it had no basket at all. I then noticed it was moving very slowly away from my position to the south. I watched in amazement for about 10 minutes as it slowly disappeared over the southern horizon, the Niagara escarpment. It&#39;s course would have taken it directly over the Queen Elizabeth Highway, a major artery for traffic through tthe region, no doubt very busy at the hour. I called the airport later that day and was told there was no balloon activity in the area that day .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I just learned of this sight and wanted to share my experience. I was outside, enjoying the few nights of good weather we get, put stars together trying to name constalations and such. I began to notice that a certain cluster of stars i was trying to patternize were not cooperating. From then i observed that there were specificly 3 &#34;stars&#34; that were in motion. they moved at different speeds and didn&#39;t appear to make any specific pattern in their movement but stayed within a certain area. i went inside to look for my binoculers for a better look. it did seem that the quickest one was &#34;in-charge&#34; and the next quickestwas withit but the one that moved fairly slow didn&#39;t seem to fit in but the other kind of gave it space and yet didn&#39;t go to far from it. the binoculars didn&#39;t help much but the lights seemed to all be in a &#34;teardrop&#34; or &#34;triangular&#34; shape.They stayed in sight for about the next 20 minutes and then quickly took off. they seemed to move in a blurred speed and motion but they also seemed to go in slightly different directions and then head the same way.i also notice a slight change in color as they sped away,they now seemed to be an almost redish-orange like if they were burning. I tried to take a grip of what i had seen considering i hadn&#39;t been drinking or anything and wasn&#39;t tired. I never saw them again but do feel strongly about what i have seen considering that a couple months later i was watching the show sighting and a man had video taped a similar occurence in another state.i also checked with the local weather station to see if there were any reports of a metor encounter but they told me that there was no weather report of any metors to have ben seen at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We watched it blink and shimmer for about 10 minutes or so and then it started to move to the south part of the island only it stopped in the middle.  About 45 minutes went by and then it seemed to start getting bigger and brighter.  It was about a mile away and her and I saw what appeared to be green, yellow, blue, red and orange lights oscilating around the object.  Almost orbiting the craft in a way.  Then it moved between the west maui mountains and haleakala (volcano) and we ran down to the waters edge and saw bright orange engines glowing.  We heard this pulsating sound though it was very faint.  We started to question it to ourselves, so we needed to see if anbody else had seen it so we called the local law enforcement and filed a report.  No one had seen it that night....maybe!  There were no articles in the newspaper that day of the prior night.

They had left for the weekend to visit family and I had the house to myself.  No one was home but me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being in the military (Navy) trained me to not need an alarm clock.  I was up by 6 a.m. every day (weekends too) without the use of ANY alarm clocks at all.  I never could sleep in even if I wanted to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should say right now that I am relatively light sleeper and a lucid dreamer, that being said, I don’t believe that my encounter was a dream in any way.  I just wanted to mention that to show that what happened to me that night was something different than ANY lucid dream I had EVER had…  Please do not dismiss what I am about to say based on what I have admitted to.  In fact, I would like to get to the bottom of this once and for all to understand that what happened to me that night DID in fact happen.  So here’s my encounter:   I went to bed that Friday night at around 10 p.m. or 2200 hrs if you wish.  I don’t recall what time it was but at some point in the night I was roused to consciousness by what appeared to be very bright flashlight type lights being shined on my bedroom window.  They were bright enough to light my entire room.  Needless to say, I got up and went to the front door to see who it was shining those bright lights at my bedroom window.  When I opened the door I couldn’t believe what I saw…  I saw a craft, maybe 40’ in diameter that looked like a yoyo only flatter.  By that I mean it looked like two saucer shaped craft that were joined in the middle about two thirds of the way in.  The outer most edges of each half of the craft had a row of lights around them as well.  This may sound strange but I can’t remember whether the lights were multi colored or white.  The craft hung just above the tree line over the dirt road in front of the house and it was giving off the purest of white ! blue light from the bottom of the craft that fanned out beneath it.  There was also a sort of sparkle or electricity to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now THIS is where it gets “different” for me.  Inside of this brilliant light was standing a tall skinny being with very long “bony” for lack of a better word, legs and arms with hands that had long bony fingers that seemed a bit out of proportion to the rest of the body.  I can’t remember if the being was clothed or not (don’t know why but I don’t).  I can tell you that it had a humanoid head with eyes that were VERY human, very thin lips and a thin almost nonexistent nose.  What also struck me odd about this being is that it had what looked like very long hair, only it was real thick, almost like dread locks but not nearly as messy…  So I am standing in my front door looking at this craft/light and being standing on the dirt road looking at ME and I am thinking to myself that I should run!  But where too?!  I don’t know where to go… I am paralyzed with fear.  I want to run so badly…  But then I hear a voice, not out loud, but IN MY HEAD!!! It says to  me, “Don’t be afraid.”  “You have no reason to be afraid.”  And all at once, I was calm.  I told myself, “I have nothing to be afraid of….”  And that was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before waking up/coming to the next morning I had flash backs to when I was a child living in Fort Washington, Maryland and standing in my back yard looking up at the very same craft only this time it had what the voice in my head called  a “companion craft” with it.  All I saw of the companion craft were its lights and that the lights were in the shape of a triangle and that it moved around the main craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Totally unrelated to this story but possibly relevant is the fact that I also suffered from “missing time” while living there as a child)   Anyway, like I stated above, no matter what day it was, whether I had duty or it was an off day or weekend, I ALWAYS woke up at 6 a.m. NO EXCEPTIONS.  I NEVER slept in.  Except for this Saturday, I didn’t wake up this Saturday until 10:30 ish and I felt drugged.  VERY disoriented and a bit unstable (walking wise) and my nose hurt and was a bit bloody.  One nostril more so over the other. I believe it was my left nostril but I can’t recall.  I just know that when I woke up it felt like at some point I had my whole finger shoved up my nose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, some years later, I think it was 2003, I had a full body MRI done just out of curiosity.  No medical reason what so ever, just a company offered it as a means of early detection of heart disease or cancer.  So I paid to have the scan done.  I was shocked to be told that I have a small mass on one of my lungs (I should know which one but I don’t.)  I can get medical records of the scans though as I have had a scan done on the mass three times now to “monitor” its possible growth and it has shown no sign of change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I was told by one doctor early on that they were a bit confused as this mass was not “calcified” so it should be growing in size at least slowly but since it isn’t doing anything they were not going to biopsy it so as not to provoke it…  Anyway, the most recent scan was within the past 12 months and there still has been no change in whatever is in my lung.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if the mass in my lung and the encounter I had are related but I thought I would add that in just as a side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, I hope that my account can be of some assistance to you and maybe someone can assist me in trying to determine if this was a dream or reality.  I would have chalked it up to just a dream if it weren’t for the way I felt and the time at which I woke up Saturday, or the fact that my nose was bloody and sore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Any way, she thought that she had seen some fire in the distance so she nudged me to look up and over the hill that was in front of us.  There wasn&#39;t anything there so I told her she&#39;s just seeing things.  Then allofasudden it happened.  We both heard this high pitch buzzing or humming sound, and when we looked up we saw red and white flashes in the sky which soon formed a &#34;teardrop&#34; shape if you will or you may say it was sort of oval.  It hovered above us for about 10 to 15 minutes.  It was just like so wierd you know. Well anyways there it is, and if  no one believes me then oh well I know what I saw and I&#39;m not crazy.!<n>

NE|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02128.html|60|ndxe199306| Summary : Huge triangular shaped object.  Slow speed and low altitude.  Passed directley over my position. No sound except wind rushing past.  NE direction and never swerved, swayed, turned or changed speed. Light shown on ground, briefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &#34;airplane&#34; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &#34;airplane&#34; was still on it&#39;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &#34;airplane&#34; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &#34;airplane&#34;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &#34;helicopter&#34; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&#39;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &#34;helicopter&#34; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &#34;helicopter&#34; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &#34;helicopter&#34;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow. The object was huge.the night was crystal clear and warm, and I saw it but can&#39;t believe what I saw.  It has taken me this long to report it.  I told this story to Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project and he told me to write to you.<n>

The boxed lights ran along the circumferance of the object and did not move.  They were extraordinarily bright.  The object stopped and hovered in place once it reached the busy street and then slowly hovered south along Campbell rd.  The craft appeared to be about 30 feet above the rooftops of the residences within the neighborhood.  From our perspective which was directly across the street in the Foodland parking lot, the air craft appeared to be the lenght of 4 or 5 of the houses it was hovering above.  After having viewed the strange ship for about 5 minutes, it was no longer within our field of view.  About 3 or 4 minutes later, my father exited Foodland and we attempted to pursue the craft by driving south down Campbell, the same direction it was slowly hovering in.  It was no longer visible in any direction at that point however.  It was as if it had simply vanished.  The ship made no noise that was audible beyond the general hum of the Campbell rd. traffic below it.  It&#39;s cylindrical shape was easily discernable given that the sky was a violet color that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Movement caught my eye and I turned to look behind me (I have wide periferal vision) and it seemed a small lintel shaped cloud was moving in the opposite direction (south) of the plane.  I mentally checked whether the planes velocity caused me to think it was moving if at all it wasnt, but then it made a westerly turn and started on the same northly trajectory as my plane above the mass of clouds below.  There were two colum shaped clouds that formed a kind of gate and I watched the small moving cloud approach them and told myself, &#34; If this flying cloud goes between those colums I&#39;ll know Im not crazy.&#34;  It did and began to gain on us. At that point I turned around to see if anybody else was seeing this except me, but nobody in the sparsely occupied plane was looking.  I watched it fly between the coloums and as it approached to a point in a perfect line with my shoulder DIVE into the cloud mass below at aproximately a 30 degree angle and disappeared.<n>

One &amp;quot;mother ship&amp;quot; spotted above tree tops in McClure, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw one huge (aircraft carrier sized) UFO hovering above the tree tops out in a soy bean field one night. I was the passenger in a car driven by a friend. The craft made no noise - there were no windows. It hovered motionless - There were three large circular red lights that went from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. So one red pulsating light in the lower left corner, one pulsating red light in the center and one pulsating red light in the upper right corner. The craft was every color of the spectrum...light green at the bottom and then more yellowish at the top - but every color represented. Observed the object from a distance of maybe 200 yards.  Suddenly it just disappeared...I looked down for a moment and when I looked up again...it was gone.  Then in the opposite side of the sky four small white orbs of light appeared very high in the sky.  They fell and then rose up again like a yo-yo. They spun around and made circles in the sky.  They foll! owed our car for several miles - and rose higher and higher into the sky as we approached the city of Bowling Green, Ohio. Later when we got back to the dorm room (we were college students at the time) the 4 lights in the sky were still there ...we could see them from the dorm window - we went outside the dorm room again and looked up and witnessed a black triangle floating over the Bowling Green University Campus - It made no sound - very low flying altitude - only one very faint red light on one corner of the craft - the other white orbs remained high in the sky. - We went back to the dorm room and just before falling asleep we noticed white lights beaming into our dorm room.  The lights were wide at first but then segmented into smaller beams of light. - Then the lights started moving rapidly back and forth - Next thing I knew It was 5:00pm the next day - My friend and I slept the entire day - which was highly unusual for either of us… The next afternoon there were UFO r! eports on local t.v. and the sky that next afternoon was filled with a irforce jets buzzing about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occurred in November 1993.

What we did not see that came up alongside our boat was a an oval or circular shaped object (50 ft. elevation) that the helicopter (appeared to be Hughes 500 type) was obviously following 200 yds behind.  The craft made no apparent sound (as claimed by other sighting) and gave no reflection when we pointed our spotlight on the craft.  Both the object and chase helicopter flew off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there for awhile stunned at what we had seen and had no plausible explanation.  The four of us are credible witnesses, one a former Marine, an accountant, a pilot and information specialist.

Exceedingly strange stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had noticed strange cloud formations and lightening earlier in the evening travelling on I40 from California toward Flagstaff as if a storm was pacing us but never quite hit.  As we were a few miles south on I17, right before the Sedona exit we suddnely saw a &#34;fog&#34; across the road. There was no other traffic and I braked to slow up when suddenly we burst through to the other side.  There was a sticky film on the windshield and car.  When we reached our destination a couple of hours south we checked the car and there was a residue. Being late, we decided to check the car out in the morning light.  It rained that night and nothing was left on the car next day.  It still ranks as one of the strangest experiences I have ever had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Matt was driving, Joe was in the front seat and I (Jason) was in the backseat of the Chevette.  Matt was taking me home so we had to drive through Rockford. It was evening and we weren’t on DST back then. It was about 9:30pm-10:30pm when this occurred. Basically I was in the middle of telling them about some orange glowing balls I had, at the time, saw for the last few weeks before when this occurred, which really was strange timing, but unrelated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were rounding the curve just outside of Rockford when I noticed a bright light just over Madden Hill. I convinced Matt to stop the car just about 300-400 feet (maybe more) from the curve. We watched in awe as the light turned into two lights, and then three...and then we all got out of the car. It was amazing because it wasn’t like the lights I had seen previously. The lights slowly kept multiplying, at the time we didn’t realize it was the object moving toward us, and the shape of the object became apparent as a diamond. There was moon light that night and I remember other cars pulling over to watch too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object didn’t make a sound. It had eight lights on it and the lights were staggered evenly. The tip of the object had a light and the rear tip did too.  The other lights were on the edges and seemed to be placed halfway between the center points of the diamond shape. The object was very black and contrasted against the deep glowing blue sky. It flew parallel with old highway 11 and continued on toward town. We all watched it until it couldn’t be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I couldn’t believe how close it seemed, but looking back it must have been really big because of how much of the sky it actually blocked out and how far we watched it travel. I would really like to connect with anybody else that stopped and watched it that evening. There were at least 6 other cars that pulled over and watched. I know there was a red and white truck that was about 100 foot from us pointing in the opposite direction that had stopped and the people got out and watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The other three are now parents; I am single.) I think (based on the Drake equation etc.) that there must be life out there, but still I would need to see it for myself to really know if these lights that we saw were piloted by alien beings; all I know, is I - we - saw these ufo’s - and they were NOT gas, weather, planes, satellites, meteors etc. Either way, whether aliens or human made, it&#39;s incredible the speeds and mobility and hovering abilities of these ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one was seen on a starry night. It was located really far up, at about within our atmosphere; seen from Georgeville, Quebec. It move incredible distances in swirly figure-eight-type, seemingly random patterns, for such high distance relative to us, moving almost as if either testing it&#39;s maneuverability, or maybe even just wasting time, with nothing to do - this is my intuition about the flying patterns that it made; but then stopping on a dime, making right angles, even 180 degree changes in direction - it looked just like a star, a bright white orb, but moved like one of those super fast shinny green flies you see in the country, only, this was happening over great distances and about within or near to our atmosphere, hence the estimate of it moving great distances (100+ KM? in a second)and at great speeds. It lasted so long, over 20 minutes, that even as teenagers we got bored of looking at it, then went back in our tent and drank one bottle of cheap wine and ev! entually falling asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time, within the same year, or possibly within two years of the first sighting, the ufo appeared as an orange-multicoloured light-of-an-orb, about 2-3 KM off the earth, and we saw it from about 5-7 KM away, up on a slight hill, looking over the Magog river valley; it was maybe… 10’-30’ or more in diameter – if it was only just one, as we saw it light up from the dark of the night sky, hovering there for about 2-3 minutes at a time, then going out (disappearing/turning the light of the orb ‘off’) and then reappearing in a slightly higher and off to the side, new position (assuming that it was the same orb) and repeating this pattern several times, before one last time where it directed an arch-like orange laser towards the ground and this laser then reflected back up to the orb -  depicted graphically as one would draw radio waves emitting from a radio tower – and then a loud sonic boom followed a few seconds after it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I was age 13 and we were playing with my friends twin brothers who were 3 or 4 years younger and some of their friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing the part of the robber at the time and hiding out down the street sitting on a fence near the bottom horizontal support beam near the ground.  So while I was waiting for them to come and find me I was looking up at the sky.  Soon what caught my eye was really cool!  	I saw three individual lights which appeared to be the same size as the stars around them flying towards each other.  Two came from one side and one from the other.  I am not too sure the exact flight path because I was looking straight up.  But I was facing West so I think the two lights were from the North and one light From the South.  They stopped in the sky when they met up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I new the lights were not satellites because they didn’t keep on going.  They were also brighter then satellites appear in their orbits and flying as if controlled by something making adjustments and decisions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then flew next to each other for a few seconds and flew around each other a bit as well.  They moved back all together now to the North just a couple of stars over.

6/1/93 21:00|San Jose (Snell Rd / Blossom Hill Rd)|CA|Circle|5 minutes|I eye witnessed a floresent orange object that ended up darted off into deep space at light speed (lightning speed).  It made no sound|3/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12217.html|72|ndxe199306| I eye witnessed a floresent orange object that ended up darted off into deep space at light speed (lightning speed).  It made no sound despite the great feat it managed.  It was some type of unkown to man technology.  It must have been nuclear powered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [This event happened some years ago when I was about 22-23 I am 30 now] I was playing pool with a freind in his garage on a weekend night.  Two of his younger relatives (around 12 yrs old at that time) then came running into the gargage with their hands up in the air yelling &#34;look outside&#34; &#34;look outside&#34; &#34;hurry up your gonna miss it&#34;. My friend and I hurried outside with the two boys and they pointed to a strange object in the sky.  It was a florescent orange object moving very slowly toward us.  We whatched in awe for several minutes trying to figure  out what it was.  I coulnd&#39;t identify it as an aircraft because it didn&#39;t have blinking lights or even resemble anything I have ever seen (my dad used to own his own Aircraft Repair hanger, I have seen many types of conventional aircraft in my time).  I could see a shadow of a structure above the orange glow, it must have been pretty large.  Suddenly it dripped a large tear on fire (similar to orange molten lava dripping) down to earth.  Next it folded over and we could now see two florescent orange glowing circles.  The tear burn&#39;t out before it made it to the ground.  It started to climb rapidly and all the sudden it darted off into space in a straight line at lightning speed (or maybe even faster).  My friend later described the way it darted off as being plucked out from space (imagine a catpult slinging something).  During our entire sighting it made no sound and left no trail.  We were standing in an empty parking lot (Snell Rd / Blossom Hill Rd) behind the grocery store when we saw it.<n>

We were discussing building a fence later that summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw this strange looking triangular object in the sky fly above us.  It was quiet, absolutely no noise heard from it.  It was travelling low and in a south-east direction.  It was about the size of the Good Year blimp but its shape was triangular.  It had about 20 lights all around its edges and they would flash in pairs in a synchronized pattern.  These lights were green, red  and white.  It was travelling slow and just glided over our heads.  It seemed like it was floating also like the Good Year blimp .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued on its way and eventually was gone.  It was consistent in speed, not erratic but slow, and we wished it was not dark out to see clearly was this was.  This all happened in about a 3 minute period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will never forget it.  What baffled us the most was it being completely silent and the lights flashing in this unusual pattern.  We never saw anything like it again.  We still talk about it now and then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

On my street are apartments on both sides kinda like an ally. The street is about 30 to 50 feet wide, and the apartments are two story. ok, now what happen was i walked out of my house down the stairs and onto the street. I then made a right turn and began to walk to my friends house, the next apartment over up stairs - same building,and as I began to turn right and walk up his stairs something caught my eye to the right of me. I stopped to look at it, and it looked like a space shuttle maybe around 100 to 200 hundred feet... maybe up in the sky right smack dab in between the apartments. It wasn&#39;t making any sound, it was moving towards me at about maybe 5 mph and had a grey glow, but not light, just bright grey color, and not from the street lights... my street doesn&#39;t have any, just building lights. I think i must have walked under it as i walked out of my house and onto the street, it was very close!!! I then ran up my friends stairs and pounded on his door, it took him what felt like forever to answer, but when he did i got him and his brother to come outside to look... but it was gone. All we could see was blinking lights off in the distance from plains like you do any other night. I don&#39;t know what i saw, I really wish I knew. I live next to a military base, so maybe they have something to do with it... I don&#39;t know. It sounds funny... a space shuttle looking craft, but thats what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw what we thought were lights on a series of radio towers.  They stayed in place for several minutes and then began to move in unison.  They silently flew in a giant circle from southwest to north east and then back to their original position.  They then went out.  The whole time taken was about a quarter hour, more or less.  There were somewhere between five and seven lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report them because I thought people would think I was nuts.  Then, I saw a program on the Phoenix lights and they were similar to what my wife and I had seen.

I was 14 years old.  My brother and I were walking down our street.  It was a summer night around 7 or 8 PM.  Other people were outside as well but no one else saw what we saw.  By the time we alerted everyone who was outside, the craft was already gone.  It glided over the houses at no more than 200-300 meters above.  It looked like a triangle in shape and it&#39;s color was dark. It&#39;s lights were very dim.  The craft made no noise at all.  It silently glided over the houses.  I looked up by sheer coincidence and saw it.  I alerted my brother who saw it as well.  By the time we let others know, the craft was gone.  To this day I am trying to understand what it is that we saw that night.  I was not an airplane nor a glider.  It was too low not to be heard and it was dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/93 17:30|Colorado Springs|CO|Cigar|15 minutes|Saw a UFO and spoke to a possible alien.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97075.html|82|ndxe199306| Saw a UFO and spoke to a possible alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the fall of 1993 I was working two jobs in order to support my son and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My main job was with the Colorado State Police as an officer.  I worked a second job at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This fall evening I was on my way to work from my home which was in Colorado Springs, Colorado and across the street from the Patty Jewett Golf Course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backing out of my driveway (my house was second from the corner of a tee intersection) and then moving forward the short distance to the stop sign at the tee intersection, I glanced across the 8th fairway to make sure there weren’t any wild golfers playing at the time.  As I came to a stop and while looking across to the other side of the fairway, I saw a group of oaks that had been there for years.  They stood about 40 feet high or so.  Just above the group of trees I also saw what I thought were white landing lights such as on every FAA regulated plane that I know of.  These lights were very low to the ground about 60-80 feet high.  I realized that this plane was going to crash and probably into me or at least my block.  I just sat there like a fool and watched the lights approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that this plane was moving extremely slow and thought sure it would hit the group of trees on the far side of the 8th fairway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it stopped.  It just stopped in mid-air and stayed there for a couple of minutes.  I then knew that this was not a regular plane.  I backed up a few feet and parked my car to the curb and stepped out.  I continued to look at the object as I walked across the street to the chain link fence that ran parallel with the 8th fairway.   I leaned against the fence and continued to watch the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly dawned on me that there was no visible object, just the lights.  I strained my eyes to make out some sort of shape to it but failed to make out the outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around to see if anyone else was watching this thing but couldn’t see anyone.  Nobody on the streets, no one on the course, just absolutely no one anywhere around.    I also noticed that there was no breeze, no sound from any direction, no barking dogs,  just absolute silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the object as it began to move toward me again.  It was only 40 or so feet off the ground and about 100 yards in front of me.  Suddenly it rose above the group of oaks along the edge of the fairway and continued toward me.  Once it cleared the trees it dropped back down close to the ground and just stopped.  That’s when I saw the red and blue lights on the outside of the two white landing lights.  I tried so hard to see some kind of shape but none prevailed.  I could actually see the background and sky right through this, whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes and began to move sideways.  The  lights were still facing toward me but moving sideways.  That’s when I saw the outline of the vehicle.  It was cigar shaped with a red light at one end and a blue light at the other.  The white landing lights were in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I could see the outline is because when it moved sideways I could see the jagged edges of the craft.  (if you have ever seen the movie “Predator”  with Arnold Schwarzenegger the only way they could see the alien was when he moved and they could see the jagged edges of his body)  This is the way it was with this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being raised an Air Force brat and having lived on more air bases than I want to remember I can tell you now this was no ordinary air craft.  It made no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved sideways down the length of the fairway (south) until it reached another section of houses where it stopped, rose above the houses and vanished.  I followed in my car until it was gone and then proceeded on to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s the first half of the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My night job was manager of an up-scale nightclub and restaurant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at the club and entered through the front door.  As you come into the club you find a very large raised horseshoe bar to your left and a raised dining area to the right.  A 3 ft. wall separated the entry way from the dining area and the bar on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came in one of my girls (cocktail waitress) approached to inform me of some issues I needed to attend to ASAP.  As she spoke I looked toward the bar to find 3 or 4 customers sitting and having cocktails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One man was sitting on a bar stool but was leaning back against the bar and staring at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to speak to my girl, this man continued to stare at me.  At first I thought he was going to cause some sort of trouble so I kept a close eye on him as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my girl left the man at the bar rose and came up to me.  He asked if we could speak outside for a few minutes.  I agreed and followed him outside half expecting to be in a fist fight or something.  We stood in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the club and he asked me if I saw something funny on my way to work tonight.  I asked him how he would know about anything funny I may or may not have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This guy told me that they were checking up on me because I was one of the “special ones”.  To this day I don’t know what he meant by that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For twenty minutes he stood there and told me of my entire life from the time I was born to the present moment, reminding me of things I had long forgotten about or just kept secret from anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he asked me if I remembered the night (when I was a young boy playing on the floor of my parents’ house) that a red light beam came through the window of the living room, across the wall and floor and then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him I had no recollection of anything such event.  He then pulled out a business card and handed it to me.  As he did, I looked down at it as he placed it in my hand.  I scanned it quickly and looked up to ask him something and he was gone.  He was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years I kept this information from anyone in fear of being labeled some sort of crackpot and I didn’t want to lose my police position with the State.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In time I moved from Colorado to California.  In June of 2002 my father died unexpectedly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to Colorado for his funeral and came back to California to my home.  In November of 2002 I went back to my parents’ home in Colorado Springs to have Thanksgiving with my mother and other family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After dinner, we all sat around the table telling stories and jokes when I spoke up and said that I had a story to tell.  There were about 20 family members there and they were all chuckling as I told the story of my strange event.  When I got to the part about the red light coming through the window and across the wall and floor, my mother dropped her fork on the plate.  Everyone stopped talking.  It was absolute silent when she said that she remembered that like it was yesterday.  She said that this red beam came through the picture window of the living room, ran across the wall down to the floor and across the floor to the opposite wall.  She also said that dad got up out of his chair and went out on the front porch to see where the light was coming from but there wasn’t anything out front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When mom got done telling her tale of the red light the laughter was gone.  It continued to be silence for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know whatever happened to that business card that guy gave me but I must have lost it during my move to California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed two strange metal objects off in the distance up in the air.  The strongest point I remember about this was that they made NO sound, whatsoever.  We witnessed them fly towards us, then slow way down.  THe two disk shaped objects seemed to have lights all around the edge of it.  I can&#39;t remember for sure how large they were.  But they completely stopped about fifty feet above the tree line above us.  At this point, we all were about to crap our pants, so we ran as fast as we could to our home, and refused to go back outside for hours.

The cloud was split, and from the most eastern cloud side came, &#34;from behind or within I&#39;m really not sure,&#34; a dull, metallic, cigar shaped object, it was moving at a low rate of speed, slower than that of any commercial, or military aircraft I have observed, nor did it resemble, it crossed the gap in the clouds,left my view behind or into the cloud formation, I really didn&#39;t think much of it at this point, but it got me thinking, when the same object came back out and followed its same path back into or behind the cloud formation. I kept watching to see if it was going to come back into view, but it never did. I have never seen anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an opend minded individuale, seeing is believing, this was some years ago, I have told a few friends, my mother, and two brothers about this, an would of reported it to you guys sooner, but I didn&#39;t know a ufo center existed until tonight. There was no noise that I could associate with the object, and there was no chemtrails often seen behind commercial airlines. The skys were clear besides a few cloud formations. I was sober and on the job at the time this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was huvering  about 15 feet above the top of our car and slightly to the left.  The plane was a metallic army green color with no jets or propellers on the large wings.  As I started to panic, thinking that it was an air craft about to crash, my husband rolled down his window and told me to listen.  The craft made absolutly no sound.  I looked up at the cockpit window to see if there was a pilot, but the sun was reflecting of the window, and I couldn&#39;t see anyone.  The light turned green and we drove a block and a half to a Dennys restaurant, where my husband parked the car.  I got out and ran into the restaurant grabbing the first person in sight.  An elderly man exiting Dennys.  I asked if he could come with me out side.  I pointed the plane out to him, which had moved about a block away from where I first saw it, towards JC Pennys, at the Florin mall.  By this time it was about 30 feet higher than when I first saw it. It huverd there for a short time befor it slowly decended behind Pennys.  The man saw the plane making its decent.  I said to him &#34;What is that?&#34; as I pointed to the craft.  He stared at it for a few seconds, and replied &#34;I do not know!&#34; He turned and quickly ran to his car. When I first saw the plane it was huvering in one spot it then moved to the side gradually gaining altitude, huvering there for a few seconds, then slowly decended down like a helocopter would land.    I really need some sort of explanation on this matter.  If anyone has ever seen or hurd of anything remotly close to this incident, that day in Sacramento, or any where else please your info.<n>

I was 15 years old.  It was around 6:30 am.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date or time.  It was day light outside.  I was walking to the bus stop an I saw a craft fly across the sky.  It was shaped like a blimp, but also had some characteristics that are not normally associated with a blimp.  It had a big, orange, oval shaped glow on the bottom of it. It also had lights all over the side of it.  The lights did not all light at the same time.  They each blinked, one at a time, randomly, really fast.  Each light only flashed for a second or two.  They were not in rows or in a pattern.  They scattered all over the side of the craft.  I could only see them when they blinked.  It was a pretty close view.  It was far up in the sky, but definetly closer than a air plane.  It DID make a sound.  I guess it was an engine or hover craft sound.  I&#39;m not sure how to describe it.  I don&#39;t clearly remember the sound.  I wondered about it and immediatly thought &#34;UFO&#34;, but I did not know how to report such an incident at the time and felt shy about it anyways.  This was before people had internet in their homes.  It just flew by.  It was not going very fast, but it was faster than I would imagine a blimp would go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I opened the door I noticed a very bright star in the southeastern sky. It seemed larger then a star should be and it suddenly seemed to grow in intensity as if it had noticed me looking at it. I took a quick second to refocus my eyes and as I did that it arced away upward, like a hook, so fast i could barely see it disapear. The previous night I had been playing with a flash light aiming it up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Passed right above us!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of early 90s I was around 10 years old and my cousin was around 8 or 9 (ages are not exact but more or less) we used to sleep over at each other&#39;s houses and stay late at night outside in the yards usually doing kid stuff like making small fires and such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night he spent the night at my house and it mustve been around 2am or 3am when we went to the front gate which was about 5 feet away from the street and we saw a formation of silent, flying triangles floating slowly (I would guess about 5 mph) parallel right above the street (north to south).  I remember them flying slightly above a light pole (maybe 100 – 150 feet or so?) and slowly passed right in front of us.  They were so close to us.  Imagine standing by a light pole and have flying triangles fly slowly above the light pole passing you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw them we froze and our eyes got locked on these crafts.  Like we were mesmerized by them.  All we could do was stare at them as they slowly passed us.  As soon as they passed us and were out of our line of sight we snapped out of it and both looked at each other with eyes wide open like we couldn’t believe what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I remember, the triangles themselves were in the formation of a bigger triangle, for example, 3 triangles in the bottom, 2 triangles above, and 1 triangle at the top.  They were forming a big triangle, and each triangle was about the size of a minivan.  They flew completely silent.  As a kid my first thought was they were made out of paper, because they flew so close to us and were completely silent, absolutely no noise.  In a neighborhood where almost every other neighbor has dogs any thing out of the ordinary would have 1 dog barking, then 2 then 3 then before you know it dogs can be heard on the other side of the neighborhood barking in the the background.  And this night not 1 single dog barked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a feeling this craft had some kind of psychological device that prevented us from reacting because even if we would’ve had a camera in our hands ready to snap a picture we wouldn’t of reacted.  We just got captured by the sight of these crafts and all we could do is keep our eyes locked on to them and trained on them until they  disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other weird thing is after that night, me and my cousin did not have a single conversation about what we saw.  On top of that we never told anyone.  I never told my parents, friends or anyone and neither did he.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after my cousin moved to Minnesota and for about 10 more years we never even discussed it.  Until one night I was talking to my wife and my other cousin (she was the sister of the cousin I saw the ufos with) and I talked about it to them for the first time.  It was weird because I talked to them like it happened yesterday, it wasn’t something that I had forgotten, or something that I just remembered, it was something that I knew all along what happened but for some reason did not tell anyone.  So I mentioned to them what happened and such and of course they didn’t believe me, so I called up my cousin and just so very casual he described the same event.  My gf and my cousin that was there with me didn’t believe us and thought we had preplanned the conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes at night I still look up at the stars and wonder what it was and where it came from. I wish I could see something like that again.  And to this day when I talk to my cousin on the phone we still talk about what we saw and dwell on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I woke up 2:30am(1993) in the middle of the night without even preceding a dream or a nightmare. It was weird. Then I knew something was wrong. So I got curious to look out of the window. I remember I always used to look at three bright starts in a triangular shape in the sky because I always felt something about them. I was looking out of the window for a few minutes. Then I suddenly noticed one of the stars (I always used to look at) was shining so bright, but nothing happened for a few seconds until I finally saw a bright object appear exactly from that spot with the same size of the star that I was looking, and was inclining in my direction (and growing bigger). I was shocked when I saw the scene. The UFO reached me in just about two seconds with so much speed that the scene was like slow motion and that was the scariest part of the incident. After it came right in front of my face, I was just looking at it (like if I was trying to explore something) without even getting scared. But after three or four seconds it vanished. Then I got scared again and I started crying. I couldn&#39;t believe it because I was a kid (11 years old) But still, I wonder why I woke up when nothing even happened and knew that I had to go by the window and see those 3 stars until a UFO comes out of one of the starts, exactly in my direction and right in front of my face and then it vanishes. At first the object was like a star. But then it turned into a UFO and it grew bigger when it came closer to me. The object was very bright and it had green, red and orange lights. Unfortunately the object was so bright that I couldn&#39;t even see how the body looked like. But after I saw the UFO pictures, I presumed it was like the large pleiadian ship (~20 meter diameter, 18 ports around rim, red/orange bottom)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had just moved some furniture from Mt Shasta and were relaxing before heading back to his house in Redding.  I had witnessed many strange occurrences out there in the past; but this was by far the most unnerving and terrifying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My senses were always heightened out there, way out in the woods, five miles out on a dirt road and 12 miles more to town on the highway.  My intuition told me to look out the window, and I saw a mist forming across the road about 20 yards away.  It was a warm summer night so this was unusual.  Over the course of about ten minutes, I looked twice more and the mist had thickened and expanded to about 3&#39;x5&#39; up on a dry grassy knoll at tree line.  It was not a full moon but the moon was bright that night. We decided to leave and when we went outside the mist had transformed into a chrome or steel colored, metallic, robotic looking, somewhat humanoid form.  It appeare! d to be sitting Indian-style in the grass. Sitting, it was still 5&#39; tall. It had a barrel-like torso but not as round.  It had a head and a face, but is face lacked definite features. I immediately knew it didn&#39;t belong there and I freaked out.  I yelled at it, and told it that it did not belong there, and that it had better leave. I threatened it with violence.  I was too terrified to run inside and grab my shotgun, so we jumped in the old gmc pickup.  For clarification, I asked my friend &#39;do you see what I&#39;m seeing?!  I turned to look at him and could only see the back of his head as he was looking out his driver&#39;s side window and said &#39;I don&#39;t know , I&#39;m watching these ones over here&#39;. I said let&#39;s get the hell outta here! He started up the truck and we high tailed it down the driveway, which turned right along the grassy knoll where I saw the first one. I looked and here is the first one levitating in its Indian style position towards us. It made lurching, lunging actions towards us but never raised any arms or anything; but it&#39;s face h! ad turne d into a terrifying metallic scowl.  I was yelling as I watched this thing through the passenger side window.  I told my friend, &#39;It&#39;s after us!  Haul ass!&#39;  He stepped on the gas but the truck kept lurching towards the deep ditch on his side of the road.  It took everything he had to fight the wheel and keep the truck in the road.  This went on for about 300 yards down the road.  We drove fast for another 2 or 3 miles without incident. I told him to stop the truck just to be sure it wasn&#39;t a broken tie rod or something.  I inspected under the truck and found nothing wrong. We continued to hwy 299 and finally headed towards Redding.  Strange thing is, by now the sun was coming up as the sky turned from night.  Where did 5 or 6 hours go within a frenzied 5 mile drive down the dirt road through the woods?  The next day my girlfriend accused me if having a hickey on my abdomen just above waste line. I indeed had a mark resembling a birth mark or hickey about an inch wide by two inches long! .  It faded after a few days.  My friend refused to ever talk about that night again.  It was the most terrifying night of my life.  I can&#39;t seem to find any other accounts of robotic, levitating, alien beings that seem to teleport themselves to a location.<n>
6/1/93 00:00|Wolcott|NY|Unknown|15 minutes|lights in the sky over Wolcott New York|4/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80727.html|94|ndxe199306| lights in the sky over Wolcott New York<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok what I’m about to say is something that I preferred to keep secret for a long time but its been eating me up inside for many years, not so much to tell someone but more in hopes to better understand what I saw.  I apologize for some of the story I cannot remember for whatever reason I don’t know.  The things I cannot remember are the exact date and time this event happened and how many lights there were.  My mind is also kinda fogged as to what colors of lights were involved.  I always wondered if just being in the presence of this UFO had something to do with my memory being fogged because I generally have a clear memory of events in my life.  What I can say is that I know it was the mid 1990&#39;s and it was late I would guess midnight.  Though it may seem hard to believe but I was a smoker at the age of 12 on up and my parents were very upset about that but I did it anyhow because I was kind of a “get what I want” child.  They did not support my habit but ! I just kinda did what I wanted regardless of consequences. Anyhow, they wouldn&#39;t allow it in the house and I took it outside on the small deck.  I lit a cigarette and began smoking and just listening to the night sounds of crickets and frogs everywhere.  Then suddenly I saw a raccoon running from a hedgerow across the road and towards a barn.  When it got into the night shadows of the barn I lost sight of it and that’s when these huge lights appeared suspended and perfectly still with no movement to them just above the rooftop of this barn.  And just as it appeared I instantly noticed that every night sound I was hearing before came to an erie dead silence.  It was a very chilling moment and I was so scared I could not move and I could not yell or scream.  I tried moving and yelling but it was like my mind was sending my body the signals and my body was not complying to what I wanted to do.  The cigarette I had just lit burned all the way to the filter and died out.  The li! ghts were there for about 15 very long minutes it seemed.  And! during this 15 minutes I had plenty of time to determine that it was not fitting any description of anything man made that I knew of.  I could not hear any noise coming from an engine of any type, if it had an engine that is.  I thought, if it were a helicopter that I would be seeing some movement in the lights even if it were hovering and it too would have an engine.  I thought, what on earth could make all the crickets and all the frogs come to a dead silence.  I thought of the raccoon and maybe it had some part in this things appearance but what would a raccoon have to do with lights in the sky, didn&#39;t make sense.  The lights on this thing were so blinding that I literally could not see what was casting them.  I saw no shape or silhouette behind them because it was a brightness I have never seen before.  I know there were white lights for sure and there was another color light.  I wanna say the other color was red but I cant be sure of that because this is where my memory is par! tly fogged.  And so I stared at it wondering whats to come next and after about 15 minutes it just vanished into nothing and the night sounds of nature came slowly until it was as if nothing ever happened.  Sadly enough I don’t have any evidence of this because I didn&#39;t own a cell phone with a camera on it like I have now days because that technology didn&#39;t yet exist in people&#39;s everyday life then.  I didn&#39;t have any other type of camera either because I had no reason to ever carry one.  Even if I had a camera, I highly doubt I would have photographic evidence of this because I simply could not move my body while it was happening and that’s all I got, thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I appreciate your work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sending you an ancient sighting report for one purpose:  You may be able to compare the description I give with similar ones, or it may stand out as a different one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened in approximately 1993 or 1994 in the summer.  My son, his girlfriend and myself were in the back yard of my house when the girlfriend said “Look at that” and pointed to a plastic shopping bag that had been kicked up by a gust of wind.  When I looked at the shopping bag my gaze was directed elsewhere and I saw 4 or 5 craft that I consider to be not only unidentified flying objects but non-Earthly flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft were gold in color and incandescent, glowing with their own light in the full sun, with no part of the craft shadowed.  The craft had no windows, flight controls or other appurtenances.  They were identical, about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched hand, and were shaped very similar to a football with one exception:  The points of a football are centered between top and bottom, but in these craft the points were slightly lower than the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft maneuvered independently.  I’m not sure of their number because they maneuvered in diverse directions and moved so fast I couldn’t get a count of them.  I watched one in particular and observed it to move very fast, and to make sudden changes in direction, performance unlike any Earthly craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the craft were located to the south-southwest of my position.  The one I watched most intently moved to just about due west of me and then changed direction suddenly and went back to the south.  All manuevers observed occurred in clear sky with no other background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observation lasted only a minute or so.  Eventually all craft disappeared in one way or another.  The one I watched the most carefully went into or behind a cloud.   At that point I queried my other observers and they agreed, yes, they had seen them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area of my observation is a few miles west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  No Earthly craft would likely be in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Phoenix TRACON.  Seconds after my sighting terminated an airliner departed westbound out of Sky Harbor and climbed directly through the same place in the sky that I had seen these gold-colored craft maneuvering.  The airliner made it all the more apparent by it’s difference that the craft I had been observing were not Earthly craft.  The airliner was larger than the craft, moved very much more slowly, and displayed clear areas of sunlit and shadowed areas on the top and bottom of the fuselage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a 20-year career as a Police Officer, was so employed at the time, and consider myself observant and objectively so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you’ve had other reports giving the same description, one that I find to be rare among my casual UFO reading, I’d be interested in knowing about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
