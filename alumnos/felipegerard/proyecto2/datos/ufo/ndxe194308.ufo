Row upon row of crescent moons appeared over the house opposite, this would have placed them over portsmouth naval dock yard, they were so bright that they lit up my bedroom, blackout conditions prevailed at this time, I fell asleep watching them. This scene is still vivid in my minds eye, so beautiful that even some 62 years later, they still have the power to enthrall.My bedroom looked west into the setting sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
