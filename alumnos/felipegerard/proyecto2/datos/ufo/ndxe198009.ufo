PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ufo encounter with missing time<n> <n><n> <n><n> well here we go this happened about 21 years ago on our  way to hudson wisconsin from the east side of st paul me and a friend were travelling east on 94 from the east side of st paul this trip normally takes 30 minutes max  it was about 8.00 pm when we left roccos resturant on the east side to go to hudson harbor resturant to pick up some supplies my friends dad owned both places. we were apporx 5 miles east of st paul when I noticed a light hovering in the sky I said lets get a closer look so me and my freind(he was driving) pulled off on a dirt road to the south approx 1/4 mile off the road and stopped we were right under the light it was about 200-250 feet above the car  and we  sat there for a while when all of a sudden it shot over the highway to the north and when it did this it was so fast that all we could see was a light trial and then shot back over our car it did this approx five times shooting around the sky leaving light trails and always returning back above our car we both just sat there amazed at what was happening we could not beleive it.we sat there for approx 10-15 min observing this strange light in the sky then it shot out and became five lights if you pictured a star on the american flag with its five points threre was a light at every point if you can picture this with the car in the center. then all of a sudden it shot straight up as fast as ever and was gone just leaving a trail of lights as it shot away. well we both decided to get the hell out of there. and go to hudson and pick up our stuff. the strangest thing was yet to come when we got there we walked downstairs to the prep kitchen and it was 10.15 pm this was so wierd because this trip is 20-30 min max and we were on the side of the road 15- 20 min max well we did not know what happened to the other time it was missing I donot remember anything more happening to us but there was for sure at least an hour of missing time. giving my self extra for how long ago it happened. i ran into my buddy about six months ao he does n! ot remem ber anything about it. this is extremly bizarre because I rememeber it all it make me think i am a little crazy but I know what happened and this was for sure a true event<n>

We could hear no sound at all from the object,I saw white lights underneath but I can&#39;t remember in what shape and pattern.It was a clear night,and the object was dark colored ,I would say black.When the object went over us, it went over the field on the left,never getting any higher up,and not changing speed. I am a christian,and I know that my church does not believe in ufo&#39;s and related things,but I know what I have seen,and I know that they are real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I mentioned it to my fiance and he said it was an airplane. I said it couldn&#39;t be an airplane because I had been watching it for a few minutes and a plane would have been over us by then.  As we watched, the light got brighter and, when the craft got close, we knew it was a UFO.  The craft was only about 100 feet over our heads. We called three more family members outside at this point for them to witness what we were seeing.  The craft was HUGE, black and triangular shaped with some lights on the bottom.  The craft made a very low, faint humming noise.  We watched it go over our house.  As it passed overhead, some helicopters and small planes were following it. Five of us witnessed this sighting. We didn&#39;t discuss this until some years later, when we thought how strange it was that, on a warm Sunday evening, on our usually busy street, we were the only ones out to see this amazing thing.  We wonder now if we were maybe &#34;taken&#34; and the memories were erased from our minds. Since then, my son has had sightings where we now live in West Virginia.  After our Connecticut sighting there was no mention in the newspapers or TV news of this craft having been seen.  It was as if the craft was there for us to see and only us.  This sighting occured at about the same time as the sightings in New York state.  We are still profoundly affected by this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we were approaching Elko, Nevada, I saw a sign that said Elko 18 miles straight ahead and a road that went off to the right and straight up the mountain.  I mentioned to my son that the road looked like an interesting one to explore and that we should come back later (we had planned to spend the night in Elko) and do just that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We set up camp in a park on the edge of Elko, ate and then took the dogs with us and set out to explore that curious road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was getting dark as we headed out and was very dark by the time we got up in the mountain.  It was very quiet, very dark and very desolate up there and we decided to abandon our search and turned around and headed back down the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat and the two dogs were in the back.  Suddenly, off to my right a bright light caught my eye.  Both my son and I said at the same time &#34;did you see that?&#34;  It looked like a huge billboard type of thing with aluminum colored glowing squares that were blinking in some strange kind of pattern.  The minute we noticed it, it stopped blinking and disappeared.  I mean disappeared completely as though nothing at all had been there.  There was just an empty meadow where this thing had been.  The altimeter  ((sic.  Please see below.)) light came on in the car and the engine stopped running.  So I told my son to turn the car off and we would sit there for awhile.  Soon we heard foot steps coming toward the car which unnerved us to say the least.  But strangest of all was that the dogs did NOT bark.  I got worried and thought it was best to get out of there and told my son to start the car and let&#39;s go!  He reminded me that the car wouldn&#39;t start and I just told him to try again--it would start (I was kind of frantic).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car did start and we started down the mountain again, but by then I was regaining my composure and told him to go slow, real slow.  I turned around to look and there was an reddish-orangeish round light floating above the road (maybe 10 or l5 feet above)and it followed us down the mountain, almost to the bottom and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to the campground it was around 2:30 in the morning so I do not know where all the time went as it didn&#39;t seem that we were up there for very long.  When we got back we were sitting outside, still in amazement over what we had seen when I looked up and there I was about 5 green lights and they were in some sort of formation that looked to me as though they were dancing to some sort of celestial music!  I know how improbable that sounds, especially after what we had just seen on the mountain, but I swear to God it is the truth.  We were not stoned, not drunk and not crazy.  Straight and totally in awe!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/15/80 22:00|Dam B Lake (Just north of; ntersection of Angelina River)|TX|Light|30 minutes|Two slow moving luminous flying craft observed along a high power transmission line in East TX.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03278.html|8|ndxe198009| Two slow moving luminous flying craft observed along a high power transmission line in East TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the winter of 1980 my older brother and I were camping out at a hunting lease in East TX, located South of Sam Rayburn Lake. It was late in the night and the sky was clear and moonless. We where parked in a jeep cherokee near the edge of a high power line clearing. The area is far away from any cities and is very forested. My brother and I were talking and listining to the radio. We both noticed two low, slow moving lights about two miles away. The lights where visible in the distance because we were looking down (parallel) the high power line. After obseving the lights for a couple of minites we both ask each other if the other had noticed the lights. They were moving parallel with the power line and would soon be very near to us. At one time a beam of light shinning towards the ground came from one craft.We both became very frightend and I cranked up the jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the woods. We both grabbed our guns. I had never been so scared. I was shaking. I turned off the engine and rolled the window down. Looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us. It was about 60 feet above the tree tops. The bottom of the craft looked very different. I recall a triangular pattern of amber lights with some long neon tube type lights also. The craft hovered above us for a few minutes. It made a continuos shhhhh sound. I thought we were about to be ether dead. But the craft moved slowly away keeping the same altitude. Fear left us as we figured, if the craft wanted to harm us it would have when it was above us. Our mood changed from complete fear to courisity. We put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better view. We noticed one craft had stayed back in stationary flight position while the other craft made a circular horizontal flight pattern which had taken it over the jeep and near the club house where the only other people where for a 10 to 15 mile radius. The roving craft returned near the stationary one and both hovered for a few minites. They both looked like to very bright spherical lights aganst a very star filled night sky.No blinking lights where seen. Then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride, they both shot silently into the upper atmoshere like a shooting star in reverse. This event blew our minds. We did not tell anybody for a couple of years. I was 16 years old at the time and my brother was in his mid 20&#39;s. He was a private pilot at the time. He knew the craft where way below stall speed for a conventional non helicopter type of flying craft. I think they used some type of EMF propulsion system.<n>

One evening another coastie and I observed a large round white light near the shoreline, some 10 miles away.  At first we though it may have been headlights of a car, then we thought it may have been a searchlight of a helicopter, but we checked with the base and none were in the area.  After looking at this light for about 3 mins it moved quickly from the shoreline to a point south of the island, it made the approx 15 miles over water in about 5 seconds.  It stayed about 100 feet off the water, hovering some 5 or 6 miles off our island, it then moved away, south, and out of sight in about 8 seconds.  Traveling at least 15 miles in that time, as that was how far we could see from where we stood.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

IT HOVERED ABOVE US FOR A FEW MOMENTS, AS IF IT WERE OBSERVING US AND THEN IT ARCHED UPWARD THE RIGHT OF THE MOON AND FLEW AWAY AT A SPEED UNIMAGINABLE. LITERALLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT. WE WATCHED IT TWINKLE OUT OF SIGHT IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. ASTOUNDED WE CALLED THE LOCAL POLICE, WHO INSTEAD OF TREATING US AS PRANKSTERS, ASKED US TO WAIT UNTIL THEY RETRIEVED THE PROPER FORM (YES, THEY HAD A FORM FOR UFO ENCOUNTERS).

It made no nose nor was there any wind. It hovered over the gas station for about five mts then it moved south and hovered over over the church for about three or four mts then it moved west and hovered over the old fire station for about two or three mts and then moved west to the train tracks it havered there for about two mts then went south and was never seen from again.

9/15/80 00:30|Maynardville|TN|Light|few minutes|A late night viewing of a bright, white light during a camping trip leads to an unusual physical manifestation.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21383.html|14|ndxe198009| A late night viewing of a bright, white light during a camping trip leads to an unusual physical manifestation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred approximately middle September 1980. I was camping in a very rural, secluded area with my girlfriend and her little boy, who was five, and two cats. We were camping in an &#34;authentic&#34; canvas tipi, which was 18&#39; in diameter.  The tipi has a smoke hole in the top, which allows one to build a fire inside. The area where we were made camp was heavily wooded and situated on the flat top of a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was cool in the evenings that time of year, we had built a good fire before bedding down for the night. My girlfriend and I were on one side of the fire in a double sleeping bag and her son was on the other side of the fire in his sleeping bag. One of the cats had curled up next to me in the crook of my arm. My girlfriend, lying to my left, was closest to the fire and I was near the outer wall of the tipi. As we settled down to sleep, the sounds of innumerable crickets nad a multitude of other night insects filled the air. The gurgle of a creek located about ten yards from the campsite contributed to the cacophony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight(the time is approximate), I woke up suddenly. I was lying on my back and when I opened my eyes I was looking up at the smoke hole. The fire was out and the opening was unobscured. A bright, white, light was shining straight down into my eyes. Simultaneously, I realized several things...I could not move a muscle, there was a feeling of electricity in the air, and there was absolute silence. I could feel the bulk and warmth of my girlfriend next to me on one side and the small, furry presence of the cat on the other side. I could smell the lingering wood smoke and feel the coolness of the night air on my face. I could feel the hardness of the ground under my back. All my senses were intact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up into the light it grew brighter and larger, until the top third of the tipi glowed and then suddenly, abruptly, winked out. At the same time I heard a rushing sound and the sudden, loud hoot of an owl that seemed to come from just outside the tipi wall on my right side. Instantly I was able to move and raised up. I looked around and saw nothing amiss. I quietly spoke my girlfriend&#39;s name to wake her. She mumbled something at me, but didn&#39;t stir. The cat next to me stretched and lay back down. I lay back down, as well, and went to sleep almost immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably wouldn&#39;t have given this episode a second thought, except for something that occurred about a week and a half later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning after this episode, I was washing up in the stream nearby. As I washed behind my left ear, about 1 1/2&#34; straight back from my earlobe, there was a raised place. It itched a little, and thought it was probably just a bug bite, as there were lots of noseeums in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;bite&#34; didn&#39;t go away, however, and continued to itch. Over the course of a week, it changed in character from a slightly red, raised area to a black, molelike thing with well defined edges. I thought maybe I had been bitten by a spider. But, there was no surrounding redness or swelling and no pus or other evidence of infection. There was no pain at the site. It never stopped itching, though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I reached up and touched the spot, as I had done many times since it appeared. As i felt it with my thumb and forefinger, it just came off. I looked at it in my hand. It was like a small, round, black disk approximately 1mm diameter. I felt my neck where it had been and there was a small opening in my skin. There was no bleeding or discharge. The edges of the &#34;hole&#34; were smooth and did not appear to be healing, but, intact, as if the skin had had no damage. Except of course, for the fact that there was now a tiny hole there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to look at the little, black &#34;disk&#34;, but it was so small that I had a hard time keeping hold of it and eventually dropped it and was unable to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred over 21 years ago, but I still have the small hole in my skin, right behind my left ear. Even though I can&#39;t remember the exact date, every detail of that night is still as clear to me as when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I said to the others look at that star flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly what looked like a star flew at tremendous speed toward the horizon and suddenly stopped in the middle of the sky.  The object then zig zagged up and down like nothing on earth could do at a great speed.  It then stopped and turned a bright red. The man from Texas said it was taking our picture with infrared light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After turning a bright white again it flew toward the starry sky and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later a ship I worked on in the summer of 1978 disapeared in the Atlantic Ocean.

The shperes were at 11 to 12 o&#39;clock in the sky and were arranged in a pentagon. The spheres would move to the center and form one large sphere then move back to the pentagon. from the angle in the sky they were most likely to be over Lakehurst air station. We and about twenty others were astounded by this we watched for about 10 minutes then left the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They make contact with those that have escaped the matrix. Reality is an illusion--created by your masters in order to conform to their Will to Power. Awake! and transcend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They have be-friended me. I go out into the woods at night to meet Mr. Gray. We converse. They use a phase cloak to conceal themselves; but through the sound of movement they communicate with me. I speak and ask questions and they answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Think of reality as an onion. Where each peel represents a different dimension. You have length width and height as the first three peels (the 1st 2nd and 3rd dimensions) and ours is the fourth dimension. In order to travel through time you have to make a transdimensional shift. You do this by turning matter into pure energy and translating the length width and height into the 5th 6th and 7th dimensions. Gravity bends Light, imagine what a transdimension does to Light. This is also the same technology that is used in a phase cloak by transfiguring matter into energy every microsecond. The ring of gyges. Hence, any beings that exist in the 5th 6th or 7th dimensions--exist as energy (Light). The 8th dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They&#39;re here for research purposes. Earth is a research planet for alien civilizations. They team up with beings of Light (angels) to bring civilization out of barbarity. They&#39;re purpose is not unknown--they go around choosing people and removing the mind staples in order to bring us to a higher level of transcendence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While talking to a neighbor in the front yard, I had a strange urge to look at the sky. From the NE, a odd, multi-colored, box-rectangular object was silently zipping through the sky to the SW. If on the ground,its dimensions seemed to be about 30&#39; by 30&#39;. It appeared to be constructed like a box-kite, with glowing, colored spars, as if they were fluorescent tubes seen on a carnival ride. Green, red, amber, violet, were the colors. The object rotated end-over-end as it flew. It was at a height around 5,000 ft., and was moving at very high speed. I would guess the speed was around Mach 2 or 3, since it travelled from horizon to horizon at that altitude in less than 15 seconds, and disappeared behind a stand of Southern Oaks, from my perspective. There was a peculiarity about the event that I won&#39;t forget: I sensed intuitively that the &#34;craft&#34; was under highly intelligent control, and was a &#34;probe&#34; sent for reconnaisance purposes by someone or something not of this Earth. (Weird, huh?)<n>

Kansas City, Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> As me and my mother was walking back from getting some ice cream....we was looking to the southwest sky and seen a sphere object that was bright gold color with a dome on the top of the sphere with bright lights around the edges of the abject, like a small ring going around the bottom-center part of the craft. It was traveling southeast and made no noise at all. We motioned to 3 guys standing around a car talking. After we finally gained their attention the craft vanished from sight as it passed some tree tops. We never have talked about this to no one as we feared either people wouldn&#39;t believe us or the would make fun of us. I was 11 years old and have never forgotten what I seen. I still occasionaly have nightmares about seeing the craft and sometime dream of being obducted. It sounds funny to say this now, but when I have the dreams. Its very frightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

We were on the sidewalk on the perimeter of the quadrangle.  We saw a light, about the size and shape of a tennis ball,  emerge from behind a bush located on the quadrangle,  fewer than 10 feet away.  It quickly crossed the street separating us from the quad, crossed in front of us on the sidewalk,  and made a slight turn, and disappeared behind the campus chapel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so quickly, neither of us acknowledged it, not sure what it was we had just seen, or even if the other had seen it.  The next night I asked my roommate if she had seen what I’d seen, and she had.  Years later I wonder what it was, and look for reports of similar sightings.  It was not likely a space craft,  as it was so small, but it clearly moved with some kind of intelligence.  I would love to hear more stories of similar sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
