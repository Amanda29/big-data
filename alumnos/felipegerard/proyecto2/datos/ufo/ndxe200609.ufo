I said &#34;there&#39;s a shooting star&#34;, then said &#34;that&#39;s not a star, look&#34;.  We estimate that the object was over the city of Murray or Midvale which is directly east of us by about 5 miles.  There were no obvious lights on the object but it appeared quite large.  It was shaped similar to a teardrop, my wife compared it to a someone attached to a parachute. The object moved very quickly to the north, much faster than the airlines that fly in patterns over our home daily.  It appeared much lower than normal flights of planes.  The shape was a gray or dark outline without obvious lighting.  It moved north, then west, then was lost from our sight. The object made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up at Pleiades and then straight down to the Belt of Orion.  What I saw right between the two was a giant triangle consisting of what looked like 5 stars.  The thing was about 2/3 the size of the dipper [not counting the handle].  In all the years I have been looking at the stars I do not remember ever seeing a triangle in this area of the sky.  I have even taken college level astronomy and no mention was ever made about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can running back in the house and looked up the sky charts in the Night Watch book by Terence Dickinson.  No triangle is suppossed to be there.  There are 3 star triangles in other areas of the sky but no 5 star triangle under the Pleiades.  What made it even stranger is that as the earth rotated, the triangle did not match the speed and location of the other stars.  Sometimes it looked to be out in front of the Pleiades, and sometimes in line with it.  Then again sometimes it appeared to be moving straight and other times tilted upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear and maybe this thing is supposed to be there but it is a first for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At that distance it appeared as a red-whitish light. After 3 to 4 min. of hovering, the craft began to move slowly in our direction. It came to within 1000 ft. of us about 100&#39; ft. in the air. At this time the distinct lights on the craft were clearly visible. Red reqtangle lights in a cross pattern on the bottom along with many white lights. The craft was small. I would think only one or two people could travel in the craft. The thing I was most amazed with was the absence of sound. After it passed us, my brother and I tried to run with it to get a longer look. The craft was traveling aporx. 30-40 mph., so needless to say, we did not keep up with it very long. We lost track of it in the nieghborhood. At 27, 26, and 24 years of age, it was the most amazing thing we have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/06 19:00|Albuquerque|NM|Unknown|seconds|3 UFOs seen in one weekend|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52858.html|4|ndxe200609| 3 UFOs seen in one weekend<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside at about 7:00 pm or so talking to a buddy when I saw something behind him. It was a light in the sky. It moved and changed directions extremely fast and then disappeared. I only saw it for a couple of seconds. The next morning I went outside to go get breakfast and looked in the sky to see a shiny object that appeared to be wobbling. It was hard to make out the shape but everytime it wobbled the sun would reflect off of it differently. It quickly disappeared while I was looking at it for about 1 minute. Later that day (the 1st of oct.) I was staring in the sky outside of my window when I saw airplane fly by. In the opposite direction of the plane was a ball moving through the sky. It was clearly a ball and I thought it was going to hit the plane but it didn&#39;t. It then disappeared out my vision from the window. When I went out side to take a look it was gone. I look out in the sky almost daily for UFO activity and know that Albuquerque doesn&#39;t have many spottings. I don&#39;t think it is a coincidence that I saw three here in that one weekend as well as many other people. I tried to get pictures but they didn&#39;t come out well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I believe it was end of august.  it was chilly enough for jackets. we were standing on the beach .you could see the cove from where we were at. we heard this puttering sound faint.  We could see something dark in the distance. my husband said, something about the motor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> well it came towards us. slow-no-noise rose itself up out of the water.- up over our heads- slow - it was so  (ginormous ) enormous that you could not take it all in. with no cameras, this is disbelief to you and others, but its true- big as a foot ball field- if two or me of me could stand on my husbands shoulders we could of touched it- went so slow you could not take the sight in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> IT CAME UP TOWARDS US- IT MUST HAVE BEEN EMERGING UP OUT OF THE WATER -THAT IS WHERE IT CAME UP AN OUT OF FLEW OVER OUR HEADS MABE 3 STORIES NOT MUCH MORE, ROUND LIKE, PEWTER BLACK,DOME ON TOP!

THIS IS TRUE .WISH HAD CAMERA ONCE IN A LIFE TIME SHOT just wanted to share that little tidbit with you . never seen nothing like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was so much for you to take in. just feet from us, there was a round hole in the middle looked like copper.  looked like it sat on something. had bands around a section . little slots like a brick but bigger. lots bigger like something went in to those Lego looking pieces. when it reached the hill the end was towards us it it looked like the end of a car transmission tore out the back end was open--. the front round, went across the road up over the hill it was gone  like it disappeared.  And yes we did wave.  No response from them though.  my husband said; that cove is about 60feet or more deep.  after we went back to fishing we were talking about what happened.  The puttering must have been it emerging up from the water.  When it came up out of the water and it got above us there was no water coming off of it. it skimmed the hill inches from touching it .<n>

The contrail was at an altitude of 30 to 40 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a small plane, but after I continued to work and then looked up again and it was still in the same area, I knew it was not moving like a small plan would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it awhile longer I called my husband to come see the strange object in the sky.  He brough 9x power binoculars to veiw the object.  It was large and pure shiny white in a disk shape.  We observed the shiny disk hover in place then move West then East then back West again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the jet contail was gone and the disk object was the only thing in a clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had watched it for almost 30 minutes before it just suddenly disappeared.<n>

At first I thought It was a plane but it stayed in almost the same spot for at least half an hourmoving slowly east and then back west.  Then it just disapeared. I took pictures and when I zoom them in on my computer it looks like a silver disk.  I also noticed fighter jets in the air right before it vanished.  My boyfriend and I watched it until it disapeared and then waited a long while and it never came back.<n>

As we were drving east on a country road we noticed what seemed to be a very bright flashing star very high on the southern horizon. At first we ignored it but then noticed something was odd about it so we stopped in the middle of the road. The object was moving very fast towards us while the bluish-white lights were almost blinding. I was trying to point out to my roommate the object but in a few seconds it had bypassed over the car so I could see what seemed to give me the idea that it had a very old space-capsule body (like Gemini)as well as dull red lights that were permanently shining in the center although they couldn&#39;t be seen with the major lights on and facing towards you. The object passed over the car and it disappeared to my vision although my roommate was able to see it. He saw that the white lights seemed to be a pair and that they were maybe of a part of a propulsion system. He also saw that it had some dull green lights also before it moved out of range towards the north horizon. All of this happened without the seen vehicle making any sound for ten minutes. We continued on our way to work and for 7-8 minutes we kept an eye on it before it literally vanished. An hour and a half later in a very close proximity to where we had left it we saw the same type of object at a distance from us. The bright bluish-white lights were rapidly flashing although the vehicle was suspended while moving in a circular pattern. Instead of parking like the first time we continued with our work while keeping tabs on the vehicle which didn&#39;t move from the spot we now saw it at. For a good two minutes we saw it here before driving away towards the south. I do not drink or do drugs while my roommate wasn&#39;t under any influence either; this we were wondering what this was with all ideas flowing from planes, secret service vehicles and satellites but it was too slow, moved in a south to north direction and didn&#39;t make any sound whatsoe! ver the whole time we had an eye on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Figuring it was a plane, it got my attention when there was no noise accompaning them.  I pointed it out to my friend just as one of the lights seemed to pendulum-swing from the light above it and shadow it in a dog-fight like formation.  The lights seemed to almost be connected and seemed to bounce off each other and overlap or collide like two balloons dancing.  The lights went westward over the sky as they appeared to gain altitude until they disappeared straight over ahead within a minute of their first appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My college professor and I were outside having a discussion about Orion and it&#39;s surrounding orbits when something slowly coming from the east caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the nightly police helicopter doing patrol, but this was different.  It didn&#39;t make any sound, but still it had some sort of essence coming from it that gave my professor and I a feeling of ecstacy.   We couldn&#39;t divert our attention from it.   It was almost as if something was purposefully making us continue to stare at it.  When I tried to look away, I felt sick to my stomach, and extremely dizzy, and my professor had the same feelings as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for what seemed like hours, until something happened to this day that makes me sit back and analyze life.  With a sudden sharp shriek almost identical to that of a wounded animal, the craft burst into light did two counter lockwise barrel rolls then dove straight down into the ground, in the fild about 100 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we both gathered ourselves, my professor and I went to the field exactly where it had dived.  When we got there we were both amazed at what we saw, for it was not earthly possible.  There was absolutly no sign of disruption to the ground at all, and the only thing that really seemed out of place was a dense smoke above our heads that honestly smelled quite pleasent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we both got pass the shock, we decided to walk on, and never tell a sole...But walking wasn&#39;t so easy, because the rubber soles on our shoes were melted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The fireball lasted several seconds, before disappearing, but lasted long enough for both of us to get a very good light show. The fireball went from green to white before disappearing. We were standing on the front upper deck of the Washington State Ferry Wenatchee sailing west.  Another couple standing with us also observed the object.

She does wear glasses and i have 20/20 vision. So i guess she couldn&#39;t focus on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things that seemed odd about this UFO was that no noise, it looked almost like a see through shadow.. Oval-shaped and at the least, i could tell its shaped was horizontally stretched more that its vertical stretch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing there in amazement for about 20 minutes after that just peering in the sky, just trying to see if i could get anouther look.. the circumstances did allow because as soo as it flew from the smaller could to the bigger one, it gott abit hazey as its shape ever so slightly kept almost poking in and out of the cloud. I Will never foget this experience in my life. Im utter;y ;eft in amazement and wonder about just what it was that i saw. if only i had a camera.

Kept thinking it would burn out. Couldn&#39;t believe how fast it was moving. Came into atmosphere above me, looked like it was very high. Moved about 60 degrees in 5 sec or less. Seemed to have a slight back and forth movement or it was an eye effect. For as high as it appeared to be it was incredibly fast. Gave me a creepy feeling that this thing wasn&#39;t normal. I&#39;ve seen meteors, a bolide, a green fireball, satellites. I was outside 5 min before and after sighting. After saw a low level airplane moving NW to SE at slow speed.

The officer who took the call jokingly asked if there was a code for &#34;the twilight zone&#34;.  Although I went outside (it was about 11:15 pm, Thursday, September 28th) I was not able to see the light.  Heard nothing more about it on the scanner.  The night, however, was beautiful, the clouds were white and the sky which was visible was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this area we experience on the highline wires a spider web looking substance (much too heavy for it to be spider web).  This substance hangs from the wires until the sun comes up and burns it off.  Any connection to UFOs?<n>

The night was dark, the moon was just over the west mountains and was only giving off a little light because it was just a sliver.  I looked up and there was a black wing directly over head moving at what seemed to be maybe 50-60 miles per hour.  I could see the whole shape of the wing as it passed over.  It was headed west.  It seemed small, maybe the size of a small airplane and it seemed low maybe 200 or 300 feet above the homes.  My first impression was it was a hang glider.  The wing had no lights and made no sound.  I was only able to watch it for 3 or 4 seconds; as it moved away from me I saw the back of the craft and then it simply blended into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Between the rear lamps offset semi center was a red lamp that was blinking. The craft was flying very low altitude. The three main charcteristics that main this craft noticeable was the following: 1)Large white lamps (much larger than other craft) 2)One red blnking lamp no others on wing tips etc 3) Very low altitude and non commerial flight path  I have seen these before and each time it followed the same charcteristics.

9/28/06 05:15|Beresford (Canada)|NB|Light|10 minutes|On Sept. 28th, Two stationary, brightly blinking lights appeared approx. 10 kilometers east northeast. Stationary for about 10 minutes.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52677.html|26|ndxe200609| On Sept. 28th, Two stationary, brightly blinking lights appeared approx. 10 kilometers east northeast. Stationary for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gentlemen,  I live in Beresford, New Brunswick, Canada. Our community is on the southern shore of the Bay of Chaleur. This morning, before sunrise (approx. 5:15am), I was on my patio having a cigarette looking east / northeast towards the bay. High in altitude I noticed a blinking light. At first glance, I thought nothing much as a passenger airline corridor is directly overhead (transatlantic fligts). But I soon realized what I saw was not a jet&#39;s navigational beacons. The light would become very bright (I would say 3-5 times the brightness of Venus at dusk/dawn), stay on for approx. 2 seconds and fade out. Intervals would be approx. 5 seconds, then the sequence would start over. What struck me was the fact the light was stationary. Insofar as altitude is concerned, it is somewhat hard to tell. I would venture a guess as being 35000 - 40000 feet and 5-10 kilometers east north-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this phenomenon for approx. two minutes, I noticed another blinking light, the 1st to my twelve o&#39;clock, the second to my 10:30-11 o&#39;clock. The second light was just as bright, would flash for about the same period of time, however the interval between blinking was closer to 10-15 seconds. These two lights remained stationary, maintaining their respective sequence. These lights were not a reflection, as sunrise is approx 7:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for about 6-7 minutes (from the time I noticed), then the sequence stopped abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a matter of confirmation: these were definitely not navigational beacons. We see a good 30-40 flights daily pass overhead. Further, we can clearly hear the jets as they pass through.There was no sound whatsoever from these two lights, and hey were both located in the flight corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This bright light passed smoothly on a course from West to East, and produced no sound at all.  It did not crash to Earth, but traveled through a valley between two Mountains.  I was up smoking and making coffee that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing this large bright Light, I could not see very well anymore.  My Eyes became reddened, watery, and swollen.  My glasses seemed not to help anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to a pharmacist, who told me to Go see a Doctor about glaucoma.  I did not.  After three Months, my eyes are now better, and do not water.  I can now see well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I heard on the news that miles of trees were blown down in the Jemez Mountain area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However it was way to small to be a jet, finally the sound of the engine came, sounded like a regular private prop plane, no, after it passed it was more of a jet engine sound. It was to small to be a passenger jet, yet not making the right sound for a single prop, It didn&#39;t even look like a private prop, I didn&#39;t really get a good look at it due to the time of day, or shall I say morning. My friend and I were just there kickin it walking around the beach. For lack of nothing better to do. But this one ufo kept circling above us, also it was even weirder that it was circling around O&#39;ryans belt and all the shooting stars seemed to be brightest while traveling through this area in the sky. My friend is in denial, he believes it was just an actual private jet, but I say it was WAY to small it couldn&#39;t be. He was convinced by the lighting screme on it that it had to be a plane. But I still think it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were camped at the long lake dam camp site.  We saw a circle or sphere in the northern sky that was essentially stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere was far off in the distance. We could see its reflection in the river water as well.  It had green red and white lights that appeared to be chasing each other around the perimeter of the sphere.  It remained stationary for a lengthy period of time - or perhaps moved very slightly to the east. Later the same evening we noticed another ufo that looked identical to the first off in the opposite direction - to the south west, that very slowly disappeared below the horizon.  The next night, while camped at the Inlet site on Round Pond one of our group observed four of the same ufos in the very  late night or early morning hours.<n>

When i was removing the dust cap I suddenly felt a drawback of wind, so autimatically I had assumed that the wind was blowing to me at my back. Then I saw a navy blue saucer hovering above some trees. Then the sun had risen from behind me, with great luck. So I was able to make out the red horizontal stripes across the top and bottom of it.It is hard to describe because it was lingring in the clouds-just stationary. It appeared to not be there-as the air around it was swirrled and possibly manipulated.There we&#39;re ports tham seem to make clapping noises as they emit VERY small and dense strings (beams) of tiny white flares that seem to move upon an undifined line, into the sky, at different intervals directly above it. From the moment I saw it from the moment it had left, did I ever make the judgement that it was an aircraft of human nature.While this occourance was happening I was going to go get my camera, but just as that thought entered my head it just floated upward, untill I couldon&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft was moving very fast, when it first caught my eye, I thought it was 3 fighter jets in formation, because of the speed. On closer look, it definately was one large craft and very unlike fighter jets.  It was silent, almost appearing to be gliding, but gliding very, very fast.  much faster then a jet, and flying very low.  Only saw the back - had distict dark 3 cylindar shapes. Two cylindar shapes appeared parallel,with distinct round ends and one smaller cylindar shape below.   View obstructed by buildings and trees, but it was moving so fast it would have been out of sight range quickly anyway. Just wondered if anyone else saw something odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was descending from the flatlands, a farming area where lots of wheat is grown, into an ancient Columbia River bed where the Columbia had flown some several millions of years ago, when some event caused it to redirect it&#39;s flow to where it currently runs. Along the top of a ridge which runs north and south of my easterly direction. I saw an object fly over the highway in front of me approximately 200 yards in front of me. It was flying no more that I would guess 20 feet above the ridge which was approximately another 20 feet above where the highway was cut into it to descend into the river bed. The object was traveling approximately 40 to 50 MPH when it passed in front of me traveling Left to right (North to South). The object appeared to be made up of two identical balls, maybe 5 to 6 feet in diameter made out of either metal or glass. Very shiney and definetely solid in appearence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One ball followed the other. The two balls were connected to each other with a metal assembly which ran straight frome the center rear of the front ball, connected to the center front of the rear ball, kind of like this: O--O. The proportions of my example are a little off. The middle connecting assembly appeared to be about 8 feet, giving an overall length of approximately 18 to 20 feet, and definetely solid construction. The whole sighting lasted about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible it may be a misidentification of a helicopter, but I have never seen one in this configuration and I could detect no sign of the rotors with my sunglasses on and off. I tried taking my sunglasses on and off a couple times while I was observing it to see if I could see a rotor. But I could not. However, I was at about the same height as the object, viewing edge on from it&#39;s side and rotors are hard to see at that kind of an angle from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Next noticed white thing floating high in sky and then what looked like flat bottom of large object high in sky that vanished soon after I noticed it.

It was in our flight space and so close, could be why he didn&#39;t mention it.  I wanted to ask in a loud voice, did anybody see that! Even though it was only there for a few seconds, I have no doubt about what I saw.......<n>

In first photograph, the flying object appears to be a dot in left hand side. And on the second photograph, flying object is on upper right hand side. Finally, on the third photograph, oval-shaped flying object is cleary visible on the photograph. The incident happened when i was taking photographs for my school&#39;s yearbook photos. The photographs were taken within 1 minute time period. Some of my friends insisted that it is an advertisement baloon, but i do not think there is no advertisement baloon that can travel considerable amound of distance within just a minute. My friends also made a good argument on the photograph. On the third photograph, there are two boys looking up to the sky and posing as if they have thrown something in the air. My friends assumed that flying object is an object that those two have thrown in to the air. However, in previous two photographs I could not find those two people carrying any visible and significant oval-shaped object. I do not recall seeing that object because it happend to quick and it happend three months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Triangular would be the nearest to the choice of descriptions, but it was more like the shape of a stingray.  It was dark, brownish in color, and had a slight glow on the edges.  The movement was smooth and silent.  This sighting was made as I was observing the sky from my backyard and having just thought I had seen the ISS pass over from the same direction.  However, when I checked for the ISS sightings from San Jacinto I found that it had not passed over at that time.  This object was similar in description to one I had seen years ago in May 1980 in the area of Shasta, CA.  I am a retired teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sun not up, but when in the brightest blue of sunrise (about an hour before), it disappeared for a few seconds.  Appeared again when out of line from where the sun rises, maintained course and speed. Disappeared again when moving into brighter blue on horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was much like what I&#39;ve heard satelites passing by desribed as, but we&#39;ve never seen this happen, esp not around here (near Waco, which is pretty well lit up 24/7).  We would have dismissed it as a satelite if we had seen one before, but this was a first, so we felt it prudent to report.

Hartford NY|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52642.html|55|ndxe200609| Orangish ball of light traveling quietly near my home, like a wave &amp; bouncy for around 5 minutes. Hartford NY<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live overlooking farmland with treelines and mountains in the background. The night was clear with millions of stars and also a shooting star. No clouds to be seen. There was heat lighting miles away past the mountains. I didn&#39;t hear any thunder. Just a quite night. My bedroom is on the top floor which has sliding glass doors so I can see everything clearly. I noticed this object which was sort of orangish coming our way. It wasn&#39;t moving like a plane or helicopter so I told my husband to check it out. We were baffled because it was roundish, but not perfectly round and was moving slower than a plane and was about the size between a golf ball and tennis ball. It came closer to the house and I was a little scared because I thought it was coming closer and closer to my window. I almost thought maybe it was a comet at first, but then it turned and went towards the cornfield next to us. I did not see any tail on the object and the way it was moving clearly was not a comet. We watched as it just floated quietly but also had like a wavy bounce to it so it didn&#39;t look like it was traveling perfectly straight. It looked like something that was observing its surroundings. We watched it just floating along just slightly above the treelines as it dissapeared over the treelines so we couldn&#39;t watch it anymore. I was told maybe it was a fireball from the lightning, but the lightning was miles away and this thing was hovering in a bouncy wavy effect for over 5 minutes treeline level traveling slower than I would think a fireball would. We could of watched it longer if it didn&#39;t dissapear over the treelines.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept my eye on it as I tried to come up with a rational explanation for what it could be, but the longer I watched it, the more erratic it&#39;s movements became.  It would stop, change directions, hover, and it did appear to move at different speeds.  At one point, it disappeared behind a cloud, but it reappeared momentarily.  It was either too small or too far away for me to actually be able to tell what it was, like I said, I thought it was just a star until it started moving.  I did notice what appeared to be an airplane about 3 minutes into the sighting, although it seemed to be traveling in the opposite direction (NNW) and at a lower altitude.  The &#34;star&#34; was last seen traveling ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was moving at a fast pace from the NE to the SW from as far as we could see in both directions and for approx. 5-10 seconds when it disappeared over the Olympic Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes after the first sighting, we witnessed a second group of lights (maybe a 1/8 the size of the large triangular  object) approx. 5-6 travelling at a high rate of speed in the same direction, also orange in color. They looked like they were bouncing off each other in a irregular formation... Approx. 10 minutes later we witnessed another group traveling East to West...in a strait line with the outer ones weaving in towards the center and another one moving back out taking turns in some sort of pattern .... the second and third set of objects were much larger than the planes we saw flying over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between the second and third set of lights we saw another unknown object flying from a  Westerly to Easterly direction.....that looked like a backwards shaped hang glider... moving very fast.. the bottom of the object was yellowish  in color and silent. we took photos with a 35mm camera and we are hoping they turn out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to be exceptionally capable as a witness.

After this happend I was so confused because I didnt know what it was and then I got my mother and my sister to come outside and check out the sitiuation. We were amazed at the speed and the flight pattterns of this craft. It made a 90 degree turn out of the blue and then came over our house this is where we got the best view of it. The UFO was triangler shap with lights on each end of it, it made no noise. We live near an old Airforce base PEASE so we thought it might be a expermental plane but it then was gowing around in circler motion and then making impossible turns and then went back towards pease about 2 miles from out house and then it came back to our house, and flew over. All of a sudden we all heard noise and it was two jets taking off from pease loud like military after they take off they looked like it was persuing it. The craft then flew back from pease and towards our house and then made another amazing turn and then disapeered. I&#39;m very confused on what happend and to scared to call PEASE and ask them what it was because I dont think they will tell my the truth or tell me i didnt see what I saw. I didnt get any pictures or video footage none aviable at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But I want to make my report in case others in the area saw something, the same thing or more and can confirm it wasn&#39;t a fancy mylar baloon. Would also like to add my husband and I were the witnesses and we both wrote our descriptions of what we saw and little diagrams within 5 minutes after the incident so the details would be fresh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving down Vista way, past the theater area and saw a black object in the sky. It was about 6:30 pm so the sky was still well lit with the sun just only starting to set. I did see a small plane in the area, like one of those itty bitty 2 seater ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black, didn&#39;ty seem shiny in any way, seemed rather small and high up. It looked like it was in my opinion either changing shape or rotatinging and the effect was it looked like it was changing shape. (If this was a mylar baloon maybe it was spinning producung the same effect??) Both of our first impressions was that it seemed like roundish and then more ovalish, flatter, like it was wobbling or changing shape. If it was changing shape or spinning it wasn&#39;t doing it at a high speed but was slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car and looked up at the object. It was then we noticed an orangish spot, or light on one side of the object. I couldnt tell if it was a light or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband&#39;s opinion of the orange light was that maybe it was a reflection off the top of the object from the sun that was low in the sky, but he wonders why the bottom of the object wasn&#39;t orange too if this was the case , and maybe the darkness of the bottom of the object was the actual colour of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both frustrated about not being able to see more details clearly when I remembered we keep a small pair of binnoculars in the glove box, they&#39;re a cheapo pair and don&#39;t magnify very much but would be better then nothing, we were leaning against the car while watching the object so it only took a few seconds to grab the binnoculars, my husband looked away from the sky for even less time then I did and when looked back the object was gone. Just gone, weird timing on the binocular thing but maybe it was a coincidence. If it was a balloon we saw then maybe it popped? We spent another few minutes looking around  to see if maybe we just lost sight of it but never saw it again. The object was sharply defined against the pale sky so it wouldnt have been hard to see if we had just lost track of where it was. Also the object to our eyes seemed to be in a fixed position the whole time we saw it (which made us doubt the balloon theory a bit) It didn&#39;t seem to be climbing in altitude either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Whenever I take that route I look over at Stonehenge because it is a lovely sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at the view, a distinct downward puff of smoke developed over stonehenge, almost like it had been forced out of an exhaust pipe. Being an ex military man, I asked myself &#39;what the heck is the army firing anti-aircraft shells over a public area for?&#39;. This thought occured to me as the Salisbury plains are a major military training area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch a very faint outline of an egg-shaped vehicle appeared to hover above Stonehenge, emitting a faint blue-grey haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am aware that clouds or smoke change shape as the wind or air currents affect it, but this shape remained constant and firm along its outer edges. Very faint signs of round windows or &#39;port-holes&#39; appeared two thirds the way up the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To be honest, it appeared and then disappeared so quickly that only something that could cloak itself could do what it did. At no point in time did it make any attempt to move away or accelerate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a stable man, not prone to hype or hysteria and my military background has given me a keen eye for the hidden or unusual. I found the event quite unnerving to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly I noticed something moving in the middle of where I was looking. It was not obvious at all as it was not emitting any light at all. The only way I was able to see it was due to the fact that the moon was pretty bright that night and the shadow underneath this object provided just enough contrast to see it. It was travelling east to west and held a steady speed comparable to a helicopter. It looked either relatively close (like a helicopter) or very huge. Really, it seemed both big and close. It is hard to tell with no light coming from it though. Either way it would have been close enough to hear if it was a helicopter or airplane or anything with an engine. The shape was large and seemed round. It was absolutely silent and gave me a very creepy feeling. It was dare I say it...camoflauged against the night&#39;s sky. I looked away a few times to make sure it wasn&#39;t a spot on my eye or something in my head and found it everytime I came back to it. I called my friend over after I could make some words out. He didn&#39;t get up in time and it was hard to make out if you weren&#39;t watching it the whole time. I then lost it behind an unavoidable tree blocking our view. I never saw it come out the other side either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had to make a guess as to it&#39;s path it seemed close enough and travelling in the right direction  to be generally following or flying over the bayou. Which would be a very discrete path to take for any object trying to hide. It left me shaken really as I knew something was flying low and big and silent and dark as the sky. It was pure luck I was practically looking at it as it crossed my eye while watching stars. I am not sure as to when this day was exactly as I forgot to post here. But it was last year before it got really cold. Maybe October instead of Sept.

The &#34;star&#34; came out of nowhere stopped and took off and disappeared into thin air.  All I could really tell was that it was a bunch of white lights.  I thought it was a plane that was going to crash but it disappeared.  I am certain that other motorists on the highway saw this occur I just hope someone other than me reports it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Woke husband, went to window with binoculars and we both watched it in sky for 25 minutes - rapid blinking red and blue light, also appeared to have white light shining up.  About 30 degrees up from horizon.  Maybe a helicopter?  But not shining a light down (as in search light) and no noticeable movement.  Stayed in same place in sky for over 30 minutes.  Could not discern shape - just looked like very bright star.   After 30 minutes, dimmed and between 4:55 and 5:05 it got higher in sky. Could be helicopter tracking bear???  We were visiting Montana at approx  48-07-30  by  114 45 00 (homeowner has map) and light was southeasterly - towards Mount Marion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NE to SW, lasting approx. 30 to 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 24, 2006, My wife and I were outside in our backyard taking advantage of a cool, clear night to look at the stars...as we gazed up we suddenly observed a V-shaped craft cross directly overhead...It appeared to be moving in excess of Mach 1 and was totally silent. I asked my wife if she could see what I was seeing and she confirmed and added that it apeared to have a vague, almost translucent disc shape around the craft itself. It moved in a straight line from approx. NE to SW. We estimate that it was anywhere from 1000 feet to 5000 feet, maybe lower and appeared to be the same size a DC-3 or Lear jet would be at the same altitude. Since we were directly under it, all we observed was the bottom of the craft which appeared milky, almost cloud-like in color. There were no lights on the craft at all, either running  lights or spotlights. It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead and there were no clouds to be observed...it was a &#34;severe clear&#34; night. The sighting lasted approx. 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared into the light pollution to the south of us. Again, we observed no sound from the craft and we live in a very quiet part of town so there was nothing to interfere with our hearing anything unusual. There were no other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My boyfriend woke me up to witness what he saw as he walked the dogs early in the morning. It was multi color, extremely bright hovering (not moving) towards the south 0f Yreka ... towards Mt Shasta. The colors were changing. After a while, it had lightening type rays below it (like jellyfish tenticles) then showed a bright ring shape with haze. The colors were bright red, blue, white - changing often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far away to determine any shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were fairly low, as low as most small airplanes in our area fly, but these made no sound at all. They were not flying parallel to each other. The one following behind kind of zig zagged briefly and scooted over to catch up or get a little closer to the other. Then they retained their formation and we watched until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore. They weren&#39;t very bright, kind of hazy. They almost seemed a little irridescent. One more thing, I have never seen a plane in this area flying north, only East and West.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What brought my attention to them was that one of the stars brightend to aprox -3.0 mag. the brightest thing in the sky. The other thing was they didn&#39;t move, at first I thought they maybe planes or a satellite but no movement. I watched them for about 2-3 minutes before one brightened and then they both faded out to nothing at the same time, the thing that struck me was how much they looked like regular stars with a slight twinkle before the disapearing act.The sky was clear, no wind, small city light polution. I was facing North looking at the North star and the Constellation Draco which with the included Strar chart I am sending you shows the exact location of the 2 lights.The color of the objects were that of the stars, when one brightened to a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we noticed it, we knew it could not be an aircraft, as the speed it moved across the sky was just plain way too fast!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren&#39;t sure, and looked in the sky for another aircraft as a reference speed and found one.  When we looked back, we noticed it had started to go from left to right in an upwards direction.  It continued it&#39;s course eastward, then suddenly went upwards moving slightly towards the east much much faster than it moved across the sky, in a matter of seconds it was out of our eyesight. At that point, we realized it could not have been an aircraft, nor a satellite! My brother saw it again the next night, travel the same sort of path, at appoximately the same time. But we have never seen it again. We tried to rule out the possiblity of it being a non earth-like flying phenonmenon, but due to it&#39;s speed it moved across the sky and the fast back and forth manuevers it made, it was just not at all possible to determine it was of this earth. We realized there was no other alternative explaination. We still look for it whenever we are there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had my wife come and look (who was outside with me), but she could not see it.  It was very faint, but very there. I am still jazzed. This is the first &#34;UFO&#34; I have ever seen.  There was no way this was a conventional aircraft it was high and moving fast.  No noise...very faint, very fast flying right over the Southern approach pattern of incoming commercial jets bound for Salt Lake International.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Adolphe down Ste. Mary&#39;s Road in the country when I pointed out to him that there was a light in the sky to our right and that no tower or light of any kind had ever been there before.  We didn&#39;t think anything of it but kept our eyes on it.  All of the sudden the light appeared in the field about a hundred feet in front of us and about 150 to our left.  I started getting a little bit worried, and me and my brother both started to wonder and panic a little.  All of the sudden the light started moving very slowly but straight west from the field toward the road (we were travelling south).  It proceeded to travel at about 30 kilometres an hour (I was going regular high way speeds, but was so fixated on the light that my brother had to scream at me to stay in the right lane).  The aircraft travelled RIGHT ABOVE US!  My brother opened the window and looked directly up at the aircraft, and I stared at it as it went by.  We both said at the same time, &#34;What is that thing!!??&#34;  We both saw that it was triangular, with one main light on the bottom of it in the middle and one small light on each of the 3 sides of the aircraft.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE BEING EMITTED FROM THE AIRCRAFT!!  No whoosing noise, no noise of an engine, absolutely nothing, and the aircraft was so close, only maximum a couple hundred feet up.  It then kept on going towards the river.  We watched it for a bit, it turned right, then went back, then repeated that a couple of more times, and then disappeared.  We have absolutely no idea what it was, but whatever it was, neither of us have ever seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Too wide and bright to be a jet vapor trail, plus as it traveled, nothing was left behind. No object was visible in front of the streak. I told my friend with me and we proceeded to follow it, by truck, as it started to disappear from our point of view. N We only followed it for a short time, as it headed away from us toward north toward Oak Harbor. Never saw anything like this before. First UFO experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both looked up at the peak of the mountain, and suddenly, within a split second, a circle of light came on and off, what appeared to be perhaps 1000ft above the peak, in that split second, it totally lit up the entire face of the mountain, no shadows, and went off just as quickly.  What was strange, I remember that when it went off, &#34;it went within itself&#34;, swallowed itself?  I know it sounds strange, but I&#39;ve not told anyone but my wife.  All I know about the man up there that night was that he was from Reno NV. I noted his name somewhere, I could find it if neccesary.<n>

I was in a parking lot at Walmart when I noticed the crafts. The crafts were oval and looked like chrome oval ships. The ships seemed to not wanting to be noticedWhat I mean is there were some clouds in the sky that day and the ships were traveling between each cloud, one after nother in groups of 2 or 3. They did not fly right out in the open. I happened to noticed them when I was lookng up at the how nice the sky looked that day..thats it. First I saw one silver (chrome) object and thought maybe it was a plane, but then I saw 2 more come out from one cloud and enter another cloud. Now there was enough open space ( without clouds) for me to notice them. and them. But by the way they moved and actually they were moving a a slow rate, they seemed to not want to be seen. The thihng that gave them away was how they traveled in groups. If they had traveled together I would have though a plane but the small groups which were a few seconds between each UFO group, it became easier for me to notice them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

9/22/06 12:10|Brick|NJ|Triangle|two minutes|Very Unusual White Lighted Triangle Zig-zaging Over Barnegat Bay around Midnight 9.22.06|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52582.html|90|ndxe200609| Very Unusual White Lighted Triangle Zig-zaging Over Barnegat Bay around Midnight 9.22.06<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday morning, September 22, 2006, while walking from my car to my front door, I noticed an unusual silent non-blinking white light about the size of an average star moving smoothly at very high altitude across the western sky about 50 degrees above the horizon of Barnegat Bay. Looking up and focusing closely, I realized it was actually three steady non-strobing white lights in a narrow triangular arrangement and seemed to be a single object seen from an angle. The sky was clear and cloudless with a multitude of visible stars. Two airplanes with normal blinking lights could be seen traveling south at different normal altitudes in the distant south-west sky. The unusual white light was moving three to four times faster than a conventional aircraft and it was its unusual speed which first caught my attention. The light then suddenly accelerated moving twice as fast in an upward arc in an &#34;S&#34; shaped manoeuvre as it shifted direction towards the east and south, nearly directly above my head and it headed over the ocean, then it looped again, reversed direction and accelerated towards the south-west, climbing in the sky until it vanished from sight. The entire sighting probably lasted less than two minutes as it traveled from north to south, then east, then towards the south-west, although the extraordinary nature of the event made it seem much longer in duration. It was not a conventional aircraft or a meteor or bolide. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before and I pay attention to the sky. The velocity of its acceleration, its silence, and the graceful ease with which it moved combined with its bizarre trajectory across the sky brought me to immediate full attention and I felt utterly amazed. After it vanished I spent several minutes studying the visible sky above the barrier island where I live, then I went in my house and, very excited, I phoned a friend advising him to go outside and look around. I then grabbed binoculars, went back outdoors and spent several minutes scanning ! the warm , clear, windless sky. The unusual light had vanished and there were no airplanes to be seen either. My friend called back and reported that he had seen nothing unusual from his wooded area 20 miles north of me. I then drew a sketch of the strange light and its bizarre double-loop trajectory and e-mailed it to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I am a non-fiction writer with a college degree in journalism and I am outdoor photographer.<n>

I could not see a shape, just a ripple in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying in bed on the 9th floor at 43rd and 10th facing north looking out the window at birds and planes.  I saw something moving very fast in the sky behind two buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the other side of the building to see the object emerge because I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d seen anything.  I observed a dark dot moving in a straight line going north, north west at incredible speed, like a shooting star but without the trail or the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw other planes in the sky for reference and they looked like they were standing still compared to this object.  I was so startled that I jumped up and ran to the window and stared hard at the object moving throught the sky thinking it must be a fighter jet.  I am an airplane buff and can ID most things that fly but I had trouble even seeing anything and yet, there was something there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression at the time was that I was seeing through the object and it was distorting the background of clouds behind it.  I could not see any distinguishing features.  I thought it might be a floaty in my eye, but it kept flying in a ruler straight line at preposterous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear any roar of engines or a sonic boom, though I could hear helicopters that I could see so I know I was hearing the sounds from outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just flew out of sight at an altitude of about 3000 feet.  I base this on the angle at which I saw it and that it passed in front of the contrails of higher jets and the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my  girlfriend about an hour later and told her about the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am reporting this so long after the event is because I just found my phone bill from that month and worked out when it had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a vacation at the time and did not know about this website.<n>

9/22/06 00:40|Amarillo|TX|Triangle|60 - 90 seconds|Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53185.html|97|ndxe200609| Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The city of Amarillo sits at about 3700&#39; above sea level and if you are in an area where street lighting or other ambient lighting is somewhat blocked, the sky can be fairly dark for a metropolitan area. Such was the location of my sighting; an east-west driveway that is bounded by a seven foot wood gate on the east, my house (roof height of 25&#39; to 40&#39; at its peak) along the south side, my neighbors 6&#39; fence, house and 50&#39; tree on the north side boundary, and the west side bounded by a stand of 30 -45&#39; trees. My house sits in the east to west take-off flight path of our airport which is approx. 10 miles due east. Those planes are normally transiting a bit north of, yet parallel with this driveway. As an avid aviation buff since I was very young (my grandfather had a horse farm right across the highway from the now closed Amarillo Air Base which was a SAC installation), I am always checking the sky. On this particular night at 12:35 AM, I had taken my dogs out one last time for the night and I was standing in the driveway area that is darker than any other area around the north or west side of my house, perusing the sky. For whatever reason, I was looking straight to the east when I noticed three pinpoints of light emerging from the tree line of my neighbors house across the street (this would have been at an angle of about 20 degrees). These three points of light increased in size to the point where I could see that they were each delta shaped and were in a tight triangular formation as well. I was stunned that they were perfectly aligned with my driveway! At about 75 degrees I could see that the back edge of each delta shaped light was blurred. When these objects were directly overhead I would say that they were each about 1 1/2 width of a quarter. The formation remained tight until about 120 degrees (the objects were close to entering the west tree line boundary which would obscure my clear view) when the lights suddenly performed a &#34;shuffling&#34; move and regrouped into the same triangular formation. During the entire episode, I would say that each light&#39;s luminosity remained constant, only the relative size of the object/light increased and diminished as would be expected. Absolutely no noise whatsoever. One final kicker - as I was trying to figure the speed/altitude of the overflight and looking straight up from the same position - I saw a meteor streak from southeast to northwest and flame out right over my head! (obviou sly at a very high altitude because the streak was the length of my forearm and unobstructed by the roof line). Because of the manner in which the lights first appeared I was thinking that they could be at a fairly low altitude (5000 - 10,000&#39;?), but at the overhead apex I just could not get a &#34;read&#34;. But I do estimate their speed to be at least 3-5 times faster than an aircraft if they were both at a relative cruising altitude. But I do have to emphasize the point that while this sighting was very exciting, the orientation of their east to west flight path right down the center axis of my driveway was astonishing!<n>

As I was driving my semi up the mountain a bright white light with a greenish tint came directly down in front and center of the hwy view.  At the time it would have been highly unlikely to see anything in the sky due to the hillside and trees on both sides.  This light came directly down smack in the center and seemingly disappeared into the road(over the hill)  The light was consistent-bright but not blinding- it did not get brighter or duller as it came down.  There were 2 cars about 150 ft in front of me that would have witnessed it as well.  It&#39;s hard to say how far away the light source was (possibly a mile).  I did not hear any sound and it only seemed to last about 2.5 seconds. If you were to hold a quarter out straight at arms length-that would roughly be the size of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Orange light while something was dropped<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw two white lights moving in the sky. The lights were blinking randamly and were bright like an aircraft but blinking randamly. When the light was not on there appeared to be a faint yellow or orange light. The lights moved much like aircraft except the movemebt was more errattic, ie, the lights abbruptly chanced direction and speed. A bright orange light appeared at one of the light location and the blinking light stopped. The orange light was bright, had a bright center and a fringe of distinct rays that ended in a circle around the bright center. Something was dropped while the orange light was on. Whatever was dropped could be seen dropping much like you can barely see a fire works rocket going up prior to it exploding except it was dropping. The orange light then went out and the blinling began again. I believe the orange light was relatively statioary. Shortly thereafter the secund light did the same as the first light relative to the orange light and dropping something. The two lights then deaded off to the Ease and disappeared. As the lights moved off to the East I could hear a noise much like a jet but less turbilent. Unlike a jet plane the noise did not diminish as the lights moved off into the distance. The sound abruptly stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am located in Adams County, and approximately 1 mile north of a large lake, called Barr Lake. I went to my horse barn to check on a sick horse at 9:00pm and noticed a large circle of lights very low in the sky. I thought at first it was a spotlight advertisement from town, so didn&#39;t think much of it, until I started walking toward my house, and the lights followed and remained over my house until they dissapeared at approximately 10:00pm. To the best of my knowledge,the whole configuration was about one-half the size of a football field and consisted of four lights rotating in a circle or slightly oval pattern. They were spaced evenly apart and would rotate once and then all go into the center and touch, and very quickly go out again and rotate. This pattern was repeated over and over during the whole veiwing. I would estimate the constant speed of the circles to be about 40mph or faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of my neighbors also witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very overcast at the time. There was no noise or sound from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am located about 7 miles from Denver International Airport. I did call them this monring to see if anything showed on radar. They were going to check.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also called the police about 9:50pm last night. The lights suddenly disappeared, and I did not see how the object left the area, as I had gone into the house to get the phone. I stepped back outside and it was gone, approximately at 10:00pm, Sept. 21, 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed interested in my movements, as the lights were rotating, but the whole configuration stayed in the same spot while I was working with my horse,for about 30 minutes, near a very well-lit barn. It was only when I started walking toward my house that the configuration also begin moving toward my house and stopped again while over the top of the house, and remained there until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was star gazing and happend to notice what a clear night it was.  Something caught my eye in the west sky  above the tree line- at first I thought it was Mars  it was very bright and had an orage glow to it, but soon realized that was not the case-- i thought this light ball was a huge star, or plane with headlights on  but when it stayed stationary for a while i realized  that was not what I was looking at.  I called my son to come see and just to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  We stood and watched this thing for aprox  1/2 hour,  it seemed to dance a little  side to side  up and down , it also seemed to get brighter and dim  as well as changed colors    then it did a strange thing it seemed like it had a huge High beam of light  for a few seconds then dimmed again.  then we noticed it shooting smaller pieces  up from it - if i had to describe it  - it was almost like a sparkler  but only shooting from the top  aproxamatly  4 or 5 &#34;sparks&#34; came off .  I put my kids to bed at aprox 9:30- i came back upstairs to balcony aprox  9:45  only to see it  &#34;shut off&#34;  it never zoomed away or took off  it just seemed to turn  &#34;OFF&#34;  this is not the first encounter I have had I have seen other &#34;things like this in the past&#34;  but it has been a few years  and nothing as amazing as this-- I actually had a panic feeling to myself  yet I HAD  TO SEE - not sure if anyone has and anything like this  but I felt I had to tell someone..  I can&#39;t give you an exact size  i could only compare sige by  extending my arm full length and then the size of my pinky fingernail was the size  and the sparks shot up about 1/4 inch.

One by one a the lights formed a massive circle in the sky over our town. But once in a while a red light would go up next to one of the white lights in the circle and immediately the white light and the red light turned into all colors again and blinking and communicating whith each other. But then the red light left the circle and continued searching the neighborhood. This setting went on for so long and  eventually my husband and I went in the house - straight to bed - I was so tired and my neck was hurting from looking UP all that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was driving at the speed of 45 mph the weather was clear and sunny with one or two very small low clouds in the sky; temperature was approx. 70 degrees. As I was heading east towards the Garden State Parkway what caught my attention was a very bright shimmering light it was far away in the sky and I would say it would be approx. 10:00 angle. I did not hear any sound, I can describe it as a long cigar shaped elongated and it appeared to be hovering. The object was definitely a solid I didn’t see anything else on the object except for it was a bright shimmering light. I stared at it for approx. 7 seconds then I blinked my eye and it was gone, I have no idea what direction it took or if it had a direction, there was no trail. I surveyed the sky for the object and it was not seen again. “It was a very clear day” On Lacey Rd the road is a two lane road East to West with low trees very much of an open area. I called my husband at that moment to tell him what I have seen. I would have thought that I would seen it an again or even an object if it was a plane or a blimp but it was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I can tell you that Robert J. Miller Air Park runway is directly across from was I saw the object far east possibly near the Garden State Parkway. I understand that planes airlines reflect the sun light but not like this. This shimmered while I was driving then disappeared. I would like to add that I could not explain the sighting I’m just saying it was definitely strange nothing like I saw before. Where we live we have airlines flying over us to Newark Liberty which I would say the flight pattern and I see airlines all day and yes they reflect the sunlight but not for 7 sec’s while I was driving and the plane would fly at the least 200 mph or more I would like to know if any one saw something strange also in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took the dogs outside and noticed the back of a brownish shape slowly passing south behind the 2 story apartment building next to me. I imagine it was a triangle. The back was more or less straight across and tapered forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gliding silenly across the sky. I saw no lights and dropped everything and  ran 25 feet into the street to see more but it was gone. Then drove the car south but could not find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The building is low so it seemed to be maybe the altitude that a helicopter flys in the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it or any where close to the shape and color before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An amazing experience. I will pursue my quest to identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 4:00 AM and still completely dark, the lights appeared to be underwater.  I could see the electric lights of Grand Cayman in the distance, as we approached the island, and first thought that the blueish lights were a boat of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused my attention on the lights and noticed that they seemed to be moving as a group, but also moving individually within the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the group of lights moved with the ship, same direction and speed.  Then the lights sped forward for a second, then again matched our speed.  They seemed to move closer to the ship and I could now clearly see that there were many individual lights, 8 or 10, moving in several different directions or circular patterns within the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds they moved even closer, toward the front of the ship this time.  As the lights approached the front of the ship underwater, they seemed to arrange themselves in single file, before disappearing one by one beneath the hull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I got dressed and went out onto the deck to see if I could see the lights on the other side of the ship.  Nothing.  I finally gave up after a few minutes and returned to my room.  I went out onto the balcony again and saw the lights once more.  This time, the lights were behind the ship and moving away...or we were moving away from them.  I watched until they were out of sight.<n>

My friend and i were just looking at the stars. My friend looked down for a second and i continued staring straight up. Then, an oval shape, yellowish green light appeared in front of me in the sky, and then shot off to the south in a matter of 2 seconds but was visible long enough for me to get a pretty good look at it. Ive seen meteors and comets and shoting stars, it was none of those. It just appeared and then zoomed away silently. I immediatly told my friend but he was too late to catch it. We continued to watch the sky, and about 5 minutes later, we BOTH saw a white light appear in the sky, and zoom very fast off to the southeast from the northwest and dissapear before our eyes. This light though was a round, white ball of light but was visible for about 4 seconds and we both immediatly reacted out loud to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My golden retriever Mia came out with me.  I&#39;m somewhat of a stargazer, I&#39;ve seen odd things in the sky before but nothing worth reporting.  I satellite watch as a hobby, so I know what is an unusual object in the sky.  It was a beautiful night, with no clouds.  Suddenly to the W-NW I saw a brilliant flash of light.  It was way too cold to be lightning.  My dog immediatly reacted, and bolted back to the house.  I could tell she was frightened.  It only lit up the western sky, not the whole sky like how lighting does.  I lasted only a few seconds, but long enough to freak me and my dog out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My background is all security-related including 4 Yrs in the US Army as a Military Policeman during which time I&#39;ve also seen combat. Suffice it to say I&#39;ve seen alotta things but last night&#39;s experience was definately something new.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (09/20/06) I was at the Pearl River Rest Area on Interstate 59 (Southbound) when I witnessed a strange occurrance. I was sitting in my car which was parked facing East. I had my door open for fresh air and was looking to my left (Northward) with a clear view of the sky. I noticed an airplane flying northward and I remember thinking it must&#39;ve recently taken off from New Orleans Airport as I saw its lights flashing red and white as most do. I was looking at the sky not far above the treeline when I saw it, a BRIGHT white object comming from my left (West) and heading to my right (East) at a VERY high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to descibe the object is, picture a block of round cheese (uncut) and lay it on its side. It was flat across the top and the bottom but curved on the sides. As I said it was EXTREMELY bright and pure white, there were no other colors. What was fascinating about the color was that the white seemed &#34;clear&#34; in that as bright as it was, it wasn&#39;t blinding at all. I could clearly define the shape of the object immediately. I watched it as it travelled at a VERY high rate of speed and just as suddenly as it appeared it vanished. The amazing thing about its disappearance is that it did exactly that. It didnt suddenly take off to outer space, or drop behind a treeline. Where the object disappeared there IS no treeline, it simply vanished like it flew behind a curtain. Also of note, the object was travelling parallel to the ground, neither gaining or losing altitude. I have no guess (and guessing is all it would be) as to the rate of speed it was travelling, all I can say is it covered miles in a matter of seconds. The size would be approximate to the 1/2 moon as it appears in the night sky, it was large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this individual, and he seemed to us to be unusually reliable as a witness, and credible in his description of the sighting.

We were on a four lane road.  The Robins Air Force Base is very near by so when I first saw the light I thought that it was perhaps a small light from a jet, yet, it was moving way too fast for even a jet.  The light moved from right to left in the sky and then just took off.  At first I thought only I had seen the object but then my friend rolled down her window and said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  We could not believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I got out the car I looked up at the sky and noticed the sky was clearer that it&#39;s been in quite a while. I immediately noticed a triagle craft floating by with absolutely no sound. I watched it for a few moments and told my friend to look as I pointed. He then says what the @#%* is that!!! The craft had white lights around the perimiter. It was very vivid and low enough to see it was NOT an airplane. By the time I saw it, it was almost directly overhead and had to have passed over the airport or real close to it. It was traveling southeast.<n>

I then noticed it was moving in the sky in my direction. (West to East) It was high in the sky, about as high as an airliner.  Object appeared as a white sphere or orb with a haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought it was an airliner, as our plant is not too far from Bush Intercontinental airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no running lights, port or starboard lights.  I was at a apprx. 45 degree angle to the object.  As the object approached closer over head it appeared to be in a haze.  What was really unusal about this is the way it flew, the object was flying straight but was violently zigzagging back and forth as it flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched in awe as it passed me it split into two spheres.  The second shpere shooting off of it&#39;s port side and to the North, the second object quickly did a loop around the first, returned to it&#39;s original position of being just off the port side of the first and both objects proceeded and disappeared into the night.<n>

It was so close that we couldn&#39;t really see it&#39;s shape, and the lights were very bright. Some of the lights were blinking, and some were scrolling across the bottom. Less than a minute after we passed it, we went back to get a better look -- and it was gone. The following friday night we saw it again at about 9:45. It was a bit higher in the air that time, and my daughter watched it go up and speed off about a minute or two after we passed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it pulsate twice in a 10 second period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my daughter to come have a look and she witnessed it too. It blinked AND was moving to the south. It was not a plane or jet. Maybe the space station was passing over and the sun reflected off it, i don&#39;t know...gonna check space station position at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it in the western sky but looking almost straight up (80 degrees from the horizon)...we observed a white, fuzzy, pulsating light that only pulsated every 10 seconds and it was moving to the south.

It was very bright white and appeared to be twinkling. It moved up through the clouds and to the South very slowly. We took lots of pictures and got 3 video clips. The kids went inside after about 15 minutes and my husband and I were still outside watching. My Husband handed me the binoculars to look at it and when we looked back up it was gone. The event lasted about 20 minutes. The first picture was taken at 6:02 pm and the last at 6:21. I took a few more pictures of the sky afterwards and a dark ball about the same size as the ball of light was in it. Not sure if it was the same thing or just an anomaly in the photo.

I was lying in my bed on Sunday night (early Monday morning) around 2:07 a.m. when I turned my head around to look out the window (my bed is facing away from the window, but is right next to it), I started to notice that I could see some of the major stars that night which was rare. Because it is usually always cloudy here at State, but the last couple of days have been pretty clear sky and ok visibility at night which allowed me to only see the very bright stars in the sky... After looking for about a minute I saw these two lights in the distance that looked like planes at first, but became much similar in size and appearance as the stars around them. But these two objects were coming straight towards my direction (still very far away and high altitude). After flying side by side they satrted to cross paths simultaneously in kind of a figure-8 type motion. while moving very quickly, and traveling very fast.. they stopped in mid-air for about 2 seconds.. At this point, I thought it was just my eyes and maybe I had been sitting for too long. but I adjusted my eyesight, even moved closer and away from the window. I know what I saw.. It was so amazing.. Then the two lights faded into a purple-pinkish color and started moving and crossing paths again in a way that defined the laws of gravity. They would squiggle for a second, then they casually coasted through the clouds and started whisking away parallel with my window (still far away)..and as they flew away they would travel while continuously fly over eachother and then cross paths like they were joy-riding or something. it sounds weird, but it was quite beautiful, it was almost like they were dancing at one point, i was so excited and amazed by it. I followed them with my eyes as they zipped very quickly away into the clouds. There is no way this could have been any commercial or military aircraft because of its color, comlexity, speed, and it&#39;s very odd way of manuevering.. I had never ! seen a U FO in my life until now. I don&#39;t do drugs and I wasn&#39;t drunk. I just had to get my story out. I wanted to know if anyone else saw something similar to this in the San Fransisco Area on September 18 around 2:00 AM....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I jumped on my bed and opened the shades, when I looked out, not two seconds later this bright green light from way up in the sky fell down to somewhere I couldn&#39;t see. I knew it wasn&#39;t some falling star or something like that because it was just..too weird. You know where you just know what you&#39;re seeing is something you just can&#39;t explain for the life of you. Yeah..Anyways, I&#39;ve seen a similar thing in New Jersey with my cousin..only the thing we saw was red and it didn&#39;t fall. But it&#39;s always a light.

When it got close to the shuttle, they could feel a vibration and thought it had possible hit ATLANTIS, but a careful inspection revealed no problem.  The TV news showed an earthbound telescope view of the thing in a highlighted section of the screen--but it appeared to be very small. And by claiming there were several others in the area, and calling them &#34;space debris&#34; they dismissed the matter as insignificant.  Oh well, one day all the truth will be revealed as we welcome exterestrials to the 3rd rock from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just getting to sleep when I noticed a light that was blinking through the 3 broken slats in one of our vertical blinds. I asked my son and daughter (ages 7 and 5 respectively) if they could see anything and they said yes they could see some &#34;blinking lights&#34;. At first I thought &#34;oh how nice, clear night - stars twinkling&#34;..then something really odd happened.  Nothing an airplane would do. One of the &#34;blinking stars&#34; started ascending in a sort of zig-zag pattern then went to the left (Note: we were looking over the range Mount Charleston is on, perhaps North East, more to the East then North).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then two more did the SAME thing. I had to open the blind more and my kids saw the other lights do this sort of &#34;zig-zag&#34; movement and they gasped. I told them I was going outside to look (they did not want me doing that!) and so I did, just to prove to myself I wasn&#39;t looking at some lasers or whatever on my window. Sure enough, there they were, the blinking lights, now a couple of them moving here and there. They are STILL outside the window. My kids are not happy about this for some reason. I&#39;ve never known them to feel scared about stars or lights before. I think it was HOW they were moving, these &#34;dancing light-stars&#34; or whatever the heck they were. I don&#39;t know of any airshows in the area and it was like, they were moving about sort of like how you move a push pin around a map, that&#39;s how I can somehow explain it. Odd, isn&#39;t it? This is not a joke. And my kids do NOT want to snuggle with Mommy in her room at this point. I wish I had a camera but I don&#39;t know what I could point out other then &#34;moving stars&#34; on a video. I wonder if anyone else in the are saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me share.<n>

My husband and I went to the window and looked out, seeing what we at first perceived to be a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our daughter told us that she had seen two other bright objects right next to this one, but that they &#34;left&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained watching this object, as something did seem off about it- it appeared to me to be flashing, a yellowish light then red, alternating in a somewhat pulsing manner. It also seemed a little brighter and larger in the sky than planets I have observed. I watched the object for about an hour, noting that it wasn&#39;t moving (at least not perceptively, I *thought* I might have seen it move in a slightly zig-zag way, but I cannot say for sure). What I *did* notice was what seemed like extra air traffic that night- we don&#39;t get that many planes flying over us, but at one point I counted two about every five minutes. I finally gave up, thinking that there must be a reasonable explanation for this object, and went about getting ready for bed. An hour and a half passed after the first sighting by my daughter when my husband looked once more, and noted the object was completely gone from the sky. I double-checked myself, and there was no trace of the object. I&#39;ve looked tonight once again, and there is nothing in that area of the sky (from my house, it would be located in a Westerly direction) even remotely like what we saw.<n>

Airplanes? They can&#39;t be because these things are lit up all around consistently from every angle as they move across the sky.  Helicopters? Neither because helicopters cannot fly at that altitude.  The only thing that it might be are satellites but, satellites dont just stop in mid air, or they dont zig-zag during travel.  Another thing, they seem to be moving very fast at times and other times, very slow.  They look exactly how the stars in the background look, same color and size, so sometimes it is hard to spot them, and I&#39;m pretty sure they pass by unnoticed.  It is weird because when you tell someone that hasn&#39;t seen them, and you&#39;re out there trying to spot one, when you do, and are about to tell them to look up, they just disappear, as if they know your showing them to someone else.  It&#39;s happened to me a couple times.  They believe me until that person spots them for themselves, at a different time. Last, sometimes after these things disappear, you can spot an airplane or jet that is out of place from normal air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They formed a very tight triangle, then the two lights then passed the spinning lights and all lights lined up in a perfect line, finally the spinning lights vanished leaving the two lights that remained motionless until dusk and then blended in with the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed that above the lighthouse, over the Chesapeake Bay was an object in the sky.  It stood out in the brilliant blue sky. It looked like a metallic object.  When I cropped the picture to get a closer look, it looked pictures I&#39;ve seen of objects identified as a flying saucer.  I had taken another picture from the same location approximately 3 seconds later.  The object was no where to be seen.  There is a couple in both photograhs to indicate the short span in time.<n>

Im 49 yeas of age and  I have live very close to Nellis afb for the past 15 years. Within the past 5 years I have been a regular night sky watcher . While things have been real slow the past 2 years ,it certainly was not the case 3-4 years ago . But I still take time to view at least once or twice a week .That being said , While laying on my back looking and scanning skyward ( I use nite vision due to so much light pollution here and I have managed to darken the street lamps around my location ) expecting at best to view a few satellites or un explained light movements since it is extremly hard to distinguish shape and form at the usual distance I encounter as  I work the sky  in quadrants I was totally taken back when from the NNE I caught the outline of a V shape closing in. At that initial distance I thought it was a repeat of the diamond formation of four indivisual craft That I viewed 3 years earlier ,As it became closer I realized it was a single craft, very large, how large I cannot say as I had no reference pointsbut easily seen with scope  sillouetted against a las vegas night sky . B-2 was a quik second guess as it had more ov a delta shspe but this was quickly elimanated as it passed directly overhead it was more delta shaped leaning more to a boomerrang -V shaped another thing that i found aerodynamically strange was one side being slightly more elongnated than the other, there seem to be darker pod shapes under each side (wing??) still no lights and no sound and no contrails of any kind and was not on a glide slope of any kind as it was definitly under its on power. Also never has there been any commercial traffic use this path that I can recall in all my years here . Its speed seem to be at a pretty good clip my guess is at least 400 knots but hard to say as I had very little reference points as to size, height  only that it covered f! rom my i nitial sighting which was approx 20 deg above the north horizen (darker sky &amp; better viewing) to where I lost sight as it approached the more lit up sky over the strip approx 11 mi away in about 40  to 45sec . Ive seen many strange sights in the late nite early morning skies here bbut not much to speak of in the 2 years until this nite ..And it was good enough to make me want to write this and send for the first time . I have seen some interesting things with multible sightings on many occasions here and would gladly elaborate if interested fill free to contact me via email  ((e-address deleted))<n>

My friend, her boyfriend and i were talking previously about a movie they had just went and seen, just then, my friend looks up into the sky and ask&#39;s me &#34;is that a plane?&#34; i looked up into the sky and i saw a disk shape figure, and it had yellow/orange lights moving from left to right going at a medium speed. i thought to myself that could be a plane, but planes have lights that guide it to where its going. there was no light and there was no movement. it just stayed in one place. and i asked her &#34;is that a u.f.o?&#34; and she kept tellin me she dont know she dont know... so then i looked at it more, i stared at in staying in one place. and i seen the whole shape of it.. it was like a disk with an upside down U on it. i remember i kept staring at it even when the light turned green, i stayed. All of a sudden the shape started lowering, not like it was landing like a plane, because a plane goes to land in strait forward line, this object was hovering in one place with it circleing, and then it started dropping real slow. strait down. my friends boyfriend, in the back seat kept telling us we were lying, but he opened his door and stuck his head out of the car, and saw the u.f.o also. he seen how scared i was and he told me to drop him off where we were, and he got out the car, as i turned the corner out of the gas station, i looked to see if the object was there and it was gone. it dissapeared. i believe this was a u.f.o. I have seen show&#39;s about u.f.o&#39;s and i heard they only go on the other half of the united states.. and they go to farms... but this is oakland, CALIFORNIA... no farms... no open area, just the regular city. and also, there was no planes in the sky, tjere was no noise like a plane, and this object was really close to us... enough to see the exact shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to be diamond shaped.  It was viewed through fairly high powered binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary fairly high up in the sky for about 30 minutes after initial spotting.  It then completely disappeared for about 1 minute and then later reappeared in the same spot.  Other stars could be seen in the background while this object disappeared, so I don&#39;t believe any cloud obstructed it.  It was a very clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in it&#39;s original spot for another 30 or so minutes, during which time a small ball of white light was emitted from it.  This ball of light travelled underneath the main object, in a straight line (left to right) for about 5 seconds and then disappeared instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main object being observed then disappeared from this spot shortly afterward, and then, reappeared about 5 degrees to the right at a much lower altitude and remained stationary.  The object observed in this &#34;second position&#34; was observed by myself about 10 seconds later after it disappeared from original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emitted what looked like two balls of light which shot out to the upper left of it.  These &#34;balls of light&#34; then &#34;merged&#34; back into the main object being observed.  Approximately 3 minutes later the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no further sightings afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 9:45 pm. and I got up to look out of my back door and I saw almost in the same location as my other sightings, a light. This time it was farther away and a lot higher in the sky. To the naked eye it looked like a star. But with the binoccoulars you could clearly see that there were numerous flashing lights on it. I could not see the shape of this craft because the lights were facing in my direction. The lights were flashing red, green, and a white/yellow color. There was no paticular pattern to the lights and the lights were very brightly colored. The craft stayed in the same spot for almost 20 minutes. Then I turned on my flood lights to see if there were any deer in the field and there was. Not that that has anything to do with the sighting other than deer have been in the field each time I have spotted activity . Then to my disbelief.....I looked to my right and going just tree top level there was this craft as plain as day that was .........hmmmm.......lets say a Stella Dora anise biscut shape (lol) no really...take one of those biscuts and look at the side shape of it and that is what this craft looked like and it was totally outlined in very bright lights that were round and flashed on and off. It moved quickly and quietly and I got to see three sequences of flashing lights and then it was gone. Then the other craft that I had been watching slowing moved to the right and away and then up a little and then it was just gone. Like the lights went out or it just dissapeared. I can&#39;t believe that I have seen so much activity or that no one else has seen anything. Oh yeah..one more thing. I do not know if this is related or not but on 9-11 around 2 pm I heard some jets that sounded military so I looked out my back door and there were two jets flying wing to wing , tree top level, and they were sky blue cloud color almost hardly visable. Then about 5 minutes later a big jet flew over in the exact spot that these two j! ets were , now this wouldn&#39;t pique my interest so much but they flew over in the exact spot that I have been seeing these crafts. Now I thought that it might be the Presidents plane because he was in Pa. that morning but if it was his plane entourage why was his group flying so low. Unless that is what they do. Anyway, that is all I have for now. I can&#39;t wait for this sight to get updated. And I hope that all of my entries have been going through........<n> <n><n> <n><n> blu :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

It was too large to be a star &amp; was sort of round/oval shaped. As we traveled west at about 50 miles per hour for about 10 minutes, the light never changed size or direction in relation to us. Then we saw another one further away (it was smaller), in the same direction, with the exact same light and shape. The lights looked odd but we dismissed them until we both saw the larger (closer) object/light suddenly fly to the more distant light at what looked like at very hight speed, and the 2 lights merged. After a minute or so, one returned to the same closer location. A minute or so later, the more distant object/light disappeared. Then the closer one faded to pink and faded out. It didn&#39;t move away or suddenly disappear, it just faded. We were both rather stunned.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up over my head in the sky and noticed a bright light. I pointed it out to my brother-in-law. It wasn&#39;t easy to find because it was very small. Smaller than a planet when you can see it in daylight. The light looked as if it were reflected light from the sun on the object. I could not tell the shape of the object but soon the reflected light turned about 90 deg and could not see the light no more. I could tell that there was an object but it was too far away to discern it&#39;s shape or color. All of a sudden, there seemed to be a billow of smoke. Best described when a vehicle punches the gas and the exhaust billows from the tailpipe. Very similiar to that. Then, it appeared as if the object moved vertically from it&#39;s stationary spot...and disappeared into thin air. This all occured in the clear blue sky and no clouds around. There was a jet flying near by but unrelated to this object (different elevation and stayed on vector). This object did not behave the normal aircraft I have seen. Kinda cool! Never seen a UFO before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not make a difinative descirption of the object.  People were pulling over on the freeway and taking pictures.  And I am wondering if someone else witnessed this object or if the people who pulled over have visual evidence of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just about three miles before the entrance to Ft Ord I saw a large long rectangular silver object off to the left over the ocean. It seemed to be just hovering in one spot and I thought it might just seem that way cause it could have been traveling in the same direction I was. The sky was partially hazy and partially cloudy. I thought I was seeing  &#34;things&#34; as I went past the main entrance to the Fort I was almost parrallel to it and I could see no rotors or wings...It looked like a large bus just floating in the sky. Then it began to turn in my direction and I could see it was almost as wide as it was high. Now I could deffinalely see it starting to move...slowely across my path almost directly overhead but the haze prevented a clear view. It continued over Ft Ord just as I turned into the 12th street entrance to same. I expected to be able to follow it but it went behind a lone cloud in that part of the sky and dissappered cause it was not here as i finally came arount that cloud. I thought it might have actually come down and landed somewhere on Ft Ord. It might have been about three times longer than a 747 and 20% of its lenght in height and about 15% in width with a flat front and a flat back. Silver colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was some type of formation, whether it be a Star,Rock or a UFO, I am still not sure but whatever the object it did have a capitivating glow around it, possibly an aircraft in distress we originally assumed until we drove out to the county airport (with the same kids that were driving us crazy shortly before, and to add to the delima our eldest child, 4 years in age, saw the entire showing in the sky, and came to belive that it was a airplane full of people who caught fire shortly before crashing) My son has abbrivated leters after his name that would make a doctor jealous, but these letters identify his special needs emotionally, he is a very smart and has a imignation with no limits...he asked questions the entire drive to the local airport (30 min) he has told us we need flashlights and paints a childlike graphic image of what he expects to encounter once on the scene. Needless to say we encountered nothing but the same intoxicated, out of state winos. We drove until his nerves were at ease and he was sure that there wasnt a plane on fire. He then fell asleep as his younger brother had shortly before. When we got home and pulled the sleepy kids from the van he told his mom that it wasnt a plane crash that he had belived it to be, that it actually was a shooting-star. The rest of the night into the morning we still felt like the only people who had seen this as there was no news reports and it wasnt until this sunday morning I did a google search for any information and came up with only 1 article, reported by a girl in the TARGET parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There might have been 2 of these things or part of it burned and fell from the main object, I am still not sure  We are still VERY interested in finding out more about this, from others who witnessed it or anyone who may know more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Please stay away if you are a member of any ufo groups that meet often and dress up in space grub!)<n>

I was drive west down old strandherd road when I saw the triangle shaped light appear from the clouds. It stood still then it race south across the sky before disappearing. After about 10 seconds it reappeared where it orignally emerged but then it went north. It stopped and then kept racing back and forth. I stopped thinking it was simply just a powerful light being emitted from the ground after it had been racing back and forth across 120 degree span from where I was watching it. The intensity of the light hadn&#39;t changed as it was moving either, so it couldnt have been an image being emitted from the ground because such an image would lose intensity as the light beam stretched further away from the origin. This racing back and across lasted about 10-15 seconds. I almost got in an accident watching it as i slowed down and the guy behind me nearly hit me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were looking up at the stars as it was a clear and beautiful night. We were sitting in cloth camp foldout chairs and were both sipping Southern Comfort whiskey (I know, here come the laughs and jeers!) and reminiscing old hunting adventures we had shared. We were by no means intoxicated at this point, but I thought it best to include this detail, even if it seems damaging to the credibility of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I noticed a flash of movement in the eastern sky and looked up to see four bright shapes flying from east to west at incredible speed. The four shapes were roughly triangular with the apex of each toward the direction of flight. The shapes were flying in a V-shaped formation (like migrating geese), but lacked the point of the V, being only four in number. The first two shapes were closer together than the back two, but each shape was in exact parallel to the shape opposite it. A cold bluish-white light radiated from the four shapes and was so bright that no other details of each shape could be made out other than color and a rough outline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four objects did not appear to be part of a larger group, nor did they appear to be lights or fixtures attached to a larger craft. No outline of a larger object around the periphery of the four glowing shapes was visible. In my opinion, each shape was a separate entity but flew with amazing precision and had the ability to keep exact pace and formation with its congeners.  Amazingly, no sound whatsoever was audible as the four shapes passed directly overhead at an estimated 1,000 feet above the ground. The objects were visible for roughly 2 to 3 seconds from the first sighting until they had passed out of sight. No Earth-made craft that I know of can move that fast; their speed was phenomenal. As the shapes disappeared from sight I looked to my brother-in-law and discovered that he too was standing up looking skyward. His eyes then met mine as he exclaimed,  “What the hell was that?!” I just shook my head and told him I had no idea. We stared incredulously at each other for a long moment before I had the brilliant idea to uncap the Southern Comfort, took a stout swallow, passed it to my brother-in-law, and then headed for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for some that the mere presence of alcohol in such a story will produce doubt. For those who have had similar experiences, I think these details only add validity to my story. Doubt all you want, I know what I saw. The only problem is I have no idea what it was. My brother-in-law and I have not spoken about this since. This is the second time we have both seen “UFO’s”, if that is what you want to call them. This first sighting did not involve imbibing alcoholic beverages and occurred three years prior in a remote location while camping. If I have time I will try to enter that account as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in-law has a B.A. in education and I have a B.S. and M.S. in biology. We are both solid, reliable, family men with no reason to lie about this sort of thing. I am as curious as the next person to find out just what these various aerial “things” might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

In the sky I noticed 2 lights, that appeared to be stationary, and nearby each other.  They must have been flying at airplane altitute or higher, but were both fairly close to each other to be deemed as airplanes.  Also, there were no white or red lights on them, only a solid orange looking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was interested, so I kept looking, and asked my friend whom was driving if he was seeing this.  He looked over and we began talking about what it could be.  The lights seemed very stationary in the air, as we were driving, probobly at about 60-65 miles per hour.  It was all very odd.  I know the place that they were hovering over was farm land, because I&#39;ve driven by there many times during the day time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we kept driving I was watching, and I could see what seemed like light on the ground directly underneath where the lights in the sky.  The light almost looked like it was orange light that was reflecting in a body of water on the ground, but I know there is no water there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got off the freeway on the Richards exit to go to a friends place, I told him to park at Safeway so we could take a look at the lights first.  When we got out of the car, we saw a light flying by, but it was clearly an airplane.  About 2 minutes later we saw another airplane flying by.  We are unsure that these are the same lights, but we were positive that the first lights we saw were not moving, and were very close to each other, and were completely orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was like &#34;I never seen anything quite like this before. A moving star?&#34; I assumed it was a UFO or something. Couldn&#39;t hear no engine, it was only pure silence. I followed it by foot. Another minute later hear comes a another one that flew very close by. The right side had a light that wasn&#39;t blinking on the right and the other one on the left was. People wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told em&#39; what it was striaght up so I kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see the same blinking red and blue light standing still like it was a star in the sky. It stood there for at least 10 minutes. The third one went at a very odd random speed, It was only a blinking red light-zizzaging into the horizon to my south and west. It looked it was about to land but remained above ground at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was driving for about 10 minutes and still couldn&#39;t tell exactly where the lights were hovering over, by the time I reached my destination. I&#39;m guessing they were over St. Charles or South Elgin. But what I found so bizarre was that they didn&#39;t move at all. At first I thought they might be helicopters doing a search, but there was no searchlight scanning the ground or operating lights on the craft or perhaps light standards like you&#39;d see at a high school football stadium, except there were no supports, and were way too high in the sky. Not only that, but they were just a solid amber colored light, with very little glow around them. I thought for sure other people must be seeing this as there was alot of traffic along Randall road that night. Finally, they just disappeared one by one, from right to left, leaving behind nothing but sky. I contacted the state police, but no one reported seeing anything. Did anyone else see this?<n>
9/15/06 18:30|Caribou|ME|Sphere|10-15 minutes|Pulsating blue softball size lights in yard.|2/28/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96369.html|173|ndxe200609| Pulsating blue softball size lights in yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around late summer or early fall, sometime in the early evening.  It had previously been raining.  The street lights from the end of our block toward the town were all working, but our block leading up towards the weather center were all out.  Our lights in the house had also gone out, first time since we moved there.  I looked out our bedroom window and saw at least a dozen lights moving around in a neighbors yard.  I thought it was probably little children running around playing with flashlights, but I didn´t see any children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched two or three minutes and then the lights all darted upward at the same time, way over the top of their house, probably a dozen or more lights, and all took the shape of a circle of lights going round. I called my husband and he came and watched the circle of lights with me for several more minutes.  Then they started separating and going off in different directions.  One ball of light came over the top of our tree line and ! went back and forth several times along the tops.  It looked like a small sphere, maybe the size of a softball, and it was the color of a really soft but vibrant and pulsating blue.  After a few minutes it came down the side of our trees on the treeline, and then traveled in a very fast motion across the flower garden just under the trees, back and forth, just as it had done across the tops of the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did that for another couple minutes and then came directly across the yard in a very straight and direct line, toward the window where we were standing. Half way between the treeline and our window it stopped abruptly.  It just stayed in place about a foot and a half above the grass, kind of pulsating and spinning at the same time.  We watched for another couple minutes and for some reason I got a really bad feeling.  The window we were standing in was one of those that went nearly ceiling to floor.  My husband stayed watching it there.  I went to the laundry room where ther! e was a smaller window higher up, where I could kind of just p! eek out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it started moving quickly again, back to the flower garden, back and forth a few times, back up the treeline and back and forth over the tops of the trees, for several more minutes. Then all of a sudden it just took off in my direction again and sailed right underneath the window I´d been watching from, out the other side of the house, down the driveway, and just disappeared. We knew by the way that thing acted, it was not any kind of swampgas. It appeared to move with precision and deliberation. Within less than a minute, all the street lights on our block and in the house came back on. We thought about calling the PD, or weather station to ask what it might be, or if anyone else saw or reported anything, but thought they would think we were a nuts or making it up. We really weren´t into much knowledge of UFO things and didn´t really know what to think. We don´t drink, we don´t smoke, we don´t do drugs, and it wasn´t in the middle of the night where we had just woken! up or anything like that, so we know what we saw was real. We just don´t know what it was. We were always the type that believes there is a logical explanation for everything. A couple days later we were talking about what it might have been, and our teen aged son overheard us. He began telling us that at the same time, while the lights had been out the day that same day we saw the lights, he had been up in his bedroom and saw a bunch of little round light, floating around just below the ceiling in his bedroom. He said he thought they were different colors, but since he is color blind he wasn´t sure what colors they werem some were just darker than others. He said he looked out his upstairs bedroom window (his room was on the opposite side of the house) because he thought maybe it was flashes from an emergency vehicle, but that when he looked out, nothing was there, and when he closed the window they were gone, so he had just ignored it all, and hadn´t thought anymore abou! t it. It has been a few years since that early evening,and we ! moved ov erseas, but we have not been able to forget about that experience. If anyone else has seen those kinds of things, we sure wish we knew what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

9/15/06 14:00|Brampton (Canada)|ON|Circle|5 min.|On Sept 16/2006 silent silver sphere passed horizontally overhead slowly, seemed to avoid viewing by rapidly ascending into cloud cover|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60745.html|175|ndxe200609| On Sept 16/2006 silent silver sphere passed horizontally overhead slowly, seemed to avoid viewing by rapidly ascending into cloud cover<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my recollections, as I cannot find my copy of the original report this occurred about 2 pm in Bramalea, Ontario on Friday September 15 2007 and I was sitting outside in my friend’s backyard. That it is near Pearson Int. Airport is surprising to me. The sighting lasted a good 5-6 minutes. When I first saw the object, it was hard to grasp what I was seeing. My second thought was maybe it was some kind of perfectly round and silver coloured balloon, but it could not have been; both by its configuration and its motion. There were 2 lines running horizontally in the mid section as if of windows but of the same silver metallic material. Its look and behaviour suggested intelligence and purpose. It moved silently. When it first caught my eye it was travelling horizontally slowly at approximately 500 to 1000 feet. It was hard to judge height accurately as it was a bright clear sky and there were only thin wispy patches of clouds at around 10,000 feet. As the object passed out of sight over the roof line I moved to continue viewing this phenomenon. As I moved, the object started a rapid right turn; as if to block my view with other roofs, so I moved further. Each time I moved it seemed to attempt avoiding my gaze. Finally I had a full view of the sky at that height. It then suddenly went straight up and within 4-5 seconds had hit the cloud layer and disappeared from view.  As for size I can only guess that it was about the size of a dump truck. Weeks later I noted that a near earth encounter of an asteroid occurred on Sept. 16, and I wonder if this had anything to do with this vehicle being there at that time; perhaps to view the close fly-by. I don’t know. It has remained a profound event to me and I am sure it was either not from our time or not from our planet.   Respectfully, Mike M.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/15/06 11:00|Detroit|MI|Sphere|5 minutes|Spherical type craft seen over Detroit river between the cities of Detroit and Windsor, disappears into small black rain cloud.|2/28/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96429.html|177|ndxe200609| Spherical type craft seen over Detroit river between the cities of Detroit and Windsor, disappears into small black rain cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place in the fall of 2006.  I’m not sure the day or the exact month, it was either September or November.  The time was around 11:00-12:00 noon.  I was at work in Detroit.  My office was at the Renaissance building, with my desk having a window view facing the city of Windsor, over looking the Detroit River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was busy talking on the phone, I noticed a small, bright light that was traveling up the river that had just passed the Ambassador Bridge that connects the USA with Canada.  At first I thought it was a small airplane or something similar, until it was close enough to notice it was a round shaped sphere.  It had a very highly polished metal that was reflecting the Sun and giving the appearance of a lighted craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-worker and I both looked taken back, as this machine was bopping up and down in the air over the river, about 20 feet or more above the surface.  It was about 10 feet in diameter or so it appeared. It made no noise, as all craft that travel on the river or anywhere in our tower can hear just about all noises from vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, etc.  The building is not very good for keeping sounds out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This machine was solid looking all over, no visible portals or attachments.  It had a round, small black little ball that traveled around the object about every second that was not attached.  The sphere turned in front of the Renaissance building and headed toward the Canadian side of the river.  Went up and over the Windsor hotel, still not high in the air, about 20 feet or so.  Weaving, bobbing ever so slightly, not traveling as though it was in a hurry, but rather seemed to be checking things out is what it felt like to us.  It climbed up and went up into a small black rain cloud.  The black rain cloud looked odd to us for some reason.  Also, it was the only cloud visible on a clear blue day.  I could see jets taking off in the background at the Windsor airport.  My co-worker and I watched the rain cloud for a long time, at least 5-10 minutes, until the cloud dissipated.  The machine never came out or went through the cloud to the other side.  I inquired with people in the building ! who would have had a good chance of hearing or seeing anything that goes on in the area.  As far as I know, we were the only people to see it, but I find it rather hard to believe, as this was broad daylight during lunchtime in downtown Detroit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

9/15/06 03:00|Barnesville|PA|Egg|5 seconds|A dual-colored, egg shaped object, streaks into view and hovers directly overhead for several seconds.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109771.html|178|ndxe200609| A dual colored, egg shaped object, streaks into view and hovers directly overhead for several seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To Whom it May Concern:  I am writing you to file a UFO sighting report that is long overdue. Ive always had a great interest in the UFO phenomenon but never actually had a sighting of my own.  Not one that I was 100% certain about anyway.  I really wasnt aware that MUFON had such a widespread network until recently, and I really hadnt considered how important it is for individuals to report such sightings so the data can be documented until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured sometime in the summer of 2006. Im estimating it was around August of that year.  I was at a friends house in Barnesville, Pa which is approximately an hours travel (by automobile) South of Scranton, Pa.  We actually had a small 3 piece band at the time and were practicing late at night in his home studio.  This location was ideal for late night rehersals due to the lack of any really close neighbors.  There arent any street lamps near the area, or at least at that time there werent.  So the night sky was awe inspiring.  I was always taken back when I was there at night because all the stars were so visible with no light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we decided to take a short break and I stepped outside the front door onto the porch area for a ciggarette.  I stepped out from under the roof a few steps and just as a began to look upwards I noticed a streak of light enter my perifreal vision from my left.  As I looked upward it stopped suddenly and abruptly, going from an extremely high rate of speed, to a dead stop in an instant.  It was directly overhead at an altitude I&#39;d have to guess would be maybe 1500 -2000 feet.  At that altitude the object was slightly larger than my thumbnail held at arms length looking upward at the sky. I&#39;d always expected, if I ever was to have a UFO sighting, to see a disc shaped craft.  Well, this was not disc shaped.  It looked more &#34;egg&#34; shaped.  Almost as if you were to take a Tylenol capsule and hold it in the air.  The division of its coloration was also the same.  The rear half was green and the front half was red.  Divided 50/50.  Both the front and rear of this object seemed to &#34;counter&#34; rotate. I got this impression because there was a dry ice like vapor lingering around the rear (greenish) part of the object as it hovered.  The entire length of time it hovered was about 3 seconds or less and seemed to &#34;bobble&#34; ever so slightly during this time.  I just had registered the thought of yelling for my other friend just inside when it zipped off over the horizon to my right.  I just began to get the first uttering of words from my mouth when this happened.  What I was trying to say was &#34;Man, you are not gunna believe this.&#34;  But I never quite got it out.  By the time my friend got outside it was long gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know absolutely what I saw without any doubt. I&#39;ve been an artist and a musician my entire life and pay great attention to subtle details commonly overlooked. I guess you can say a photographic memory to an extent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report and it&#39;s documentation helps you in some way. I&#39;ve always been curious to know if there are other reports like mine, with the same type of description. I myself, haven&#39;t heard many. If you have any information you can forward me of similar sightings in the area I&#39;d be excited to check it out. I appreciate your time in reading my report and greatly appreciate the work you and your collegues do on a day to day basis. If I can be of ANY assistance to you or your cause, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me either by Email or phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I knew it wasn&#39;t a shooting or falling star because it was too large. I immediately called my mother, who believed me because the two of us had previously seen what we knew to be a UFO. Stars don&#39;t move around, zip through the sky and then just suddenly disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 23 of this month of Sept., my nephew and his football coach stated excitedly, they had seen a space ship.

Predominantly reddish in the center with white lights around the main disk.  Described as very pleasing to look at.  As the witnesses continued to view the object two very small figures appeared below the craft and walked just outside the sugar cane field for a few minutes before the object and the two beings disappeared at the same time.  There was never any noise during the entire event just the bright light with the reddish center and the beings walking around as if holding or waving some form of flashlight.  The beings were no more than 1 m tall and were viewed from approximately 15-20 meters away from the shore of the Rio Grande River.<n>

I saw 4 shapes that looked like mini carots with a faint orange glow flying across the sky from the north heading south.  As I watched them zoom across the sky, they weaved in and out of each other at very fast speeds while they were zipping across the sky.  It seemed much too fast and manuverable to be any ordinary aircraft.  They continued to weave across the sky for the few seconds I saw them until they disappeared to the south sky.  I have never seen anything close to this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dormant in the sky, staying in one place and not moving. Suddenly it began, very slowly, to move in a ‘cross’ pattern (up, down, up, left, right, down). We weren’t the only one who noticed because we saw people sticking pointed fingers from their cars and honking their horns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, it seemed to just lower behind the mountains we were headed towards and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, to reflect a date in &#34;Fall 2006.&#34;  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It grew, large.  To put it in scale, if all the other stars were pencil lead points, this grew, within seconds, to the comparable size of a quarter.  It was silent, and seemingly as far away as the other stars.  When it expanded to it&#39;s fullest it blinked out.  It didn&#39;t shrink back, or splinter into sparks, it just ceased to be.  I&#39;ve watched the sky since and haven&#39;t seen even a star in that spot.  There appeared just faintly around the edge of the light, a blue haze, very faint and very thin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed to where i have seen this object before but never thought anything of it. In defiantly the object was still there i was like this is impossible. I said to myself it has to be a cell phone tower at the bottom of the hill here. But the object was no where near the cell phone tower. Then it started to move in a circler up and down motion. The object seem to be appearing over the I-84 and Middlebury area. Then we looked away for a minute to talk and then we turned our heads again to look at the object it was gone. Now i started to get wierd feelings inside me like wow. I always kinda thought there could be someting out there but never in our solar system. Now i think its defiantly true.

It had been raining on and off all day and the rain had stop at this point in the day, but the air was thick and heavy. I was on my way home from work driving south on Somonauk Rd. just a mile south of Hinckley, IL.  An object in the sky just above my truck caught my eye. It was moving across the road from the west side of the road to the east and was almost directly above me. I slowed the truck down and rolled down the window to get a better look at it since I was passing directly below it. It was not very high in the sky, maybe 10 feet higher than the telephone poles and was a triangular shape.  It was moving relatively slow maybe 20 mph. At first glance it looked kind of like the top of a cell phone tower.  It had a very simple structural look to it.  It kind of looked like a silver and bronze metal “I” beam structure in the shape of a triangle.  There was a lot of structural frame work holding the center which was more solid and circular shaped. Each corner of the triangle had a smaller metal looking beam that came down a few feet but angled in towards the center of the object. I didn&#39;t notice any sounds or lights or smoke or anything.  It just was floating across the sky heading east above the corn fields.  I have no idea what it was; I have never seen anything like it.  I stayed and watched it move further away from me until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  As I started to drive on down the road I was kind of freaked out and I had this strange feeling that is hard to describe.  I guess I would describe it as a depression or a sadness that only lasted a few minutes.  It was very strange.  I have gone home from work  the same way the last few days and I have made a point at looking to see if I was just seeing some kind of optical allusion or something, but I can&#39;t find anything in that area that resembles what I saw that afternoon.  I just know that I saw something strange in the sky that I have never seen in my life before.<n>

Aslo you might say this was stars but they dont disepear like that and it was bright blue skies with the sun shining over the mojave desert. They where far away. Also this was on the highway and me and my friend saw it. I can`t confirm that anyone else saw it but as many cars that travel that way somebody else must have seen it! Then after a while they seemed to start descending in a slow phase. It can`t be sure because maybe it was only us coming closer to the mountains so we couldnt see them. I may have a picture but I don`t know yet because it was so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Clear as a bell and very interesting<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was round. It looked as if it was spinning. Silver with flashes of light. Like a ball of spinning mercury. It was hovering over the house on the next rural block. Silent! It was a clear wonderfull morning. The background was the mountains so it shown very clear. This area is well known for activity. It is not the first time I have witnessed activity, but, the most disturbing. This sounds strange, but it noticed me. I noticed it. I felt a bit of mental presure. Sounds crazy I know. I was not scared, just concerned. The object was there for at least 5 min. I had time to call my partner and tell him. At one point it looked as if it was heading my way. This is when I felt the mental presure. My partner yelled at me to get the camera. My dogs had been unusually quiet untill now. All 10 started to howl (I have an informal dog rescue and no we are not trashy people). This is the point it started to head west into the mountains slowly. I went to get the camera and by the time I got it running, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is stranger. I started to get confused soon after this. I had to stop and center myself. I felt strange. I am a person who is never a victim of life, but I started to get confused and a bit forgetfull, like I wanted to, a bit of mental time slipage? I called my best friend. We talked. I felt fine. I then laid down for a nap with my dogs. I am o.k. I did not lose any time, but I did feel affected. I refuse to let them take me from the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect. I think it was doing something over there. Something happened or an exchange took place, something not very nice. My gut is never wrong. I went over to talk to the neighbors. They refused to talk to me. This is rural desert, so that behavior is not unexpected. This is an area next to Goat Mountain and Giant Rock. The Integratron is not far away and 29 Palms Base is right to the east. The unusual weather, paranormal, and sightings are not uncommon during the year I have been here. I have personally talked to people who have been &#34;abducted&#34; in this area. We also see a lot of orbs as of late. I have been told we will have a quake soon by oldtimers. But, that is an other story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I have the stage. I believe something big is going on. That is for sure. To all my friends out there. Hold yourself in the light (I am a Quaker). Center your self. I know people who have been very affected by events such as this and worse. This is our life, our world. Some call it prayer. Whatever, just empower your self. Do not be scared. Bad things are happening, also good too. You are not crazy. Do not be a victim. Best of luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please forgive any grammer and spelling mistakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, DM<n>

I|3/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117516.html|202|ndxe200609| I was sitting on my deck, looking north with my Nikon binoculars (which are sharp enough to make out the Galilean moons of Jupiter).  I was trying to determine whether I could see Polaris or if it was obscured by distant trees, with the intent of calibrating my 10-inch Celestron on a future night, starting with Polaris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was scanning that northern sky with the binoculars, a craft came into view.  It was a triangle, blacker than the background night sky.  There were white lights at each of the three corners and none elsewhere nor any of any other color.  The lights were not &#34;pinpoint&#34; lights but rather appeared to be large flat circles of light that appeared to be flush with the underside of the craft&#39;s body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above that triangular craft, there were two craft that were almost certainly smallish (perhaps military) jets flying a parallel course.  They were flying some significant distance apart but essentially lined up wingtip to wingtip.  Comparing the triangular craft to those jets indicated the craft was simply enormous--easily 2 to 3 times the length of an aircraft carrier.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting it at this late date only because it&#39;s just tonight that I remembered there was an e-mail in my archive where I&#39;d given a precise date to a friend about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 25 years in science and engineering as administrator overseeing many millions of research dollars on a wide variety of projects.  One proposal to DARPA (unfunded) just a couple of years before the sighting was for the construction of a similarly-large but entirely different sort of craft as something of an aerial aircraft carrier.  As far as I know, no such craft has been funded nor built, though I reckon it&#39;s possible and perhaps has not publicly disclosed.  I do know funding was given to a major corporation to explore potentional for such a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I simply do not believe the craft was &#34;ours&#34; as there simply had not been enough time from that allocation of funding for such a craft to be designed nor even a prototype constructed.  I&#39;ve no doubt the two jets were military and shadowing the triangle.  I&#39;d read reports over the years of triangular craft so while I was excited to see such a thing, I was not really shocked or surprised.  I kept my binoculars trained on it until my view of it became obscured by the trees I reckoned might (and do) obscure Polaris from my backyard view.  I have several telescopes and several binoculars and have spent a *lot* of time under the night sky.  I&#39;ve seen a few other unidentifiable things over the years, but nothing like this--an object that was *clearly* a &#34;craft&#34; of some type, obviously under intelligent control, in flight.  (And that flight seemed to be perfectly matched to the two jets overhead with neither the jets nor the triangle lagging or overtaking.)<n>

It’s a shooting star!”  Realizing that when someone spots a shooting star it is usually too late if you don’t happen to be looking in that direction, I was surprised when I followed where she was pointing and actually saw the “star”. It was still traveling much faster than a plane, high in the sky, coming in from my left (from N-W) in a downward arc leaving a bit of a trail.  But what happened next really freaked us out.   The object then slowed down.  It stopped for a fraction of a second (as in hovering) and changed directions going back to the left for another fraction of a second then shot off to the right, made a very brief hesitation, then continued to the right (south-east)  and was gone…no further sign of it.  In all, the Z like movement lasted about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never been a believer in UFO’s but I’ve changed my mind.  There I was with 3 other people and we all saw the same thing.  Then I checked out the internet and found that Channel 5 in Seattle had a news report on a similar sighting around sunset their time and that it was explained away by the FAA as a reflection on a plane.  No way …it wasn’t sunset for me!  Taking into consideration the 3 hour time difference, I’d say if it were the same object, it took this “shooting star” about 1 hour to cross the USA from Seattle to NYC.   I want to be in contact with more people who saw this “shooting star”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know I’m late in reporting this but I just finally had to say something.  It happened almost a year ago but I can’t get it out of my mind. I want to be in contact with other people who may have seen this “shooting star” on Sept 11, 2006.<n>

It trailed sparks and illuminated the space around itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It being september 11th, I thought for a moment it might be a missle, or a distressed plane, but after waiting for 30 seconds or so, and hearing no explosion or impact, I went in to tell the other guards what I&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so excited, I called my mother, as I knew she was the only one up at that hour.  She immediately &#34;googled&#34; meteor and Newtown Square and up pops this web site and a report of the very same thing I saw tonight, only 41 years in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spooky to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing this very moment in the lobby over which I saw the object, looking out over the same horizon.<n>

The pilot reported the &#34;meteor&#34; was at his elevation , in a level trajectory and very slow. Subsequently, several calls to the FAA  control center at Tri Cities  inquired about a burning aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, a witness (who knew nothing about the aircraft report) reported having observed a large dark cigar shaped object hovering  low over downtown Johnson City. She described the object as looking like a &#34;Vietnam helicopter&#34;( we assume a Chinook) with no props. The object was observed for several minutes as the witness drove.  The object it&#39;s self was described as long, blunt , silent and having a white light on top and bottom with a larger light on the end which was hanging some 45 degrees lower toward the ground on this end.  The witness reported that the object ascended and moved off quickly to the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet another  report came in from Carter County from a person listening to a scanner and heard a discussion regarding a &#34; unidentified flying object&#34;, laughter and a request to discuss the subject by cell phone instead of radio. A request to the county 911 office for futher information could find no records regarding this &#34;ufo.&#34; All of these events took place within a 20-30 minute  time frame which lead us to believe thay are possibly related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, former State Director for MUFON for the eastern half of Tennessee, for sharing this report with our Center.

9/11/06 22:00|Nodaway County (SW IA/NW MO)|MO|Fireball|10 seconds|Green fireball in connection with Possible Abduction or Visitation.|7/22/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100222.html|208|ndxe200609| Green Fireball in connection with Possible Abduction or Visitation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to preface this report by drawing attention to the fact that I have a training in Physics and am currently working towards a PhD in the physical sciences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an incident which has long deserved a report with the national UFO reporting center, but I have had a great deal of anxiety regarding the sighting as it involves what I believe to be an encounter with extra-terrestrial beings later that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling on a cross country trip to the west in Iowa on I believe (from photos taken from this trip) to be US Route 30. While travelling,  I saw a large Emerald Green Object alight in the western sky, about 10 degrees altitude above the western horizon.  From my estimation, the apparent astronomical magnitude of the object was in the range of -10 (full moon is approximately -12.94).  This was by far the brightest object in the sky at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, the object (or the green light emitted by the object) was spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was momentarily stationary (1-2s), and thence proceeded to move rapidly towards the North.  The object traversed about 100 degrees azimuthal angle at a rate of 12-15(degress/sec), and then rapidly faded in magnitude until it was no longer visible.  The trajectory of the object seemed both too low, and too slow to be of meteoric origin.  From my estimation, this object was well within the troposphere for the entire course of its trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object traversed the sky, it left a trail of white flecks of light behind it.  The trail was linear, and about 15 degrees of azimuth in length and constant in magnitude.  There was no sound accompanying the traversal of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite shaken by the incident, and pulled off at a local gas station.  I had taken many photos of the gas station in attempt to recall the location of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the sighting, I strongly recall the thought &#34;I should not have seen that.&#34;  After driving from Iowa south into Missouri, I pulled off to take a few hours of rest in the car.  The car was parked on the side of a small county road on a bridge over the Nodaway river (which is a tributary to the Missouri river).  The time was about 2AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was attempting to get some rest, when I perceived a white light around the vehicle along with the silhouettes of three extra-terrestrial beings.  The beings were about 4ft tall as measured relative to the window of the vehicle.  One of the beings was in front of the car, and two were on the left side (I was in the drivers seat of the car).  I had the sense that there was a fourth being near the back of the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then recall &#34;waking up&#34; and the time was 6AM.  I was very tired, and sweaty, as if I had exerted myself physically during the previous four hours.  I a vague recollection of what transpired during this four hour period.  I can unequivocally say that the perception of the beings and the light was not a dream.  This is corroborated by the fact that I have a detailed memory of this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be happy to work with the National UFO reporting center in order to shed further light on the UFO sighting itself, as well as other events in connection with the sighting including details left out of this cursory account.<n>

A very bright and very fast moving object in they sky to my forward-left caught my eye and I watched it for maybe one whole second when it exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that I might have just seen the Shuttle Atlantis burning up and exploding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a ship on fire, burning light of white and a little yellow in a kind of corona around a central mass that was traveling at tremendous speed and then it exploded in the air in a conical fashion. About the time the debris cone got to three times the diameter of the original object the &#39;fire&#39; went out and nothing of it was visible in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can estimate the speed at around 3600 mph because for the second (if that) that I saw the object it traveled the length of a hill/mountain top that is somewhat like a mesa in shape and is a mile in length. However, the object appeared to be about 5 miles beyond the &#39;mesa&#39; and from my perspective about 5 degrees above the mesa and in slight declination... for reference my distance from the mesa was about a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The freeway is pretty much going south-east where I was at, so I guess the object was traveling south, but I can&#39;t be sure becuase the 15 fwy changes direction alot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure the media would have already have the story out if the shuttle exploded, so it wasn&#39;t that. Other possibilities would include a meteor, but I would guess that a meteor that big would cause some major damage, and not be at such a slight declination at such a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left a briefly glowing trail and I heard no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It exploded three times getting larger each time. Them it swept  to the west (parallel to Hwy 580w) and I saw a long red hot tail (which appeared as if millions of small pieces of red all grouped together and emitting from the bright green fire ball)at least four times the size of the fireball which continued to glow and appeared to soar north (north of 580) before dropping out of sight. I see a lot of shooting stars but I was in awe to see this,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a rocket or meteorite or some sort of vehicle breaking through the stratosphere..it lasted a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searced the newspapers, but found nothing mentioned regarding it.

I was lying in my bed and decided to look out my window at the stars so I did and I noticed that there was very odd movement in some of the stars I was looking at. I then decided to go outside for a closer look. I went out site and noticed the stars were slowly moving in the sky... sometime in the midst of all this I saw something drop about 25-50m away on the other side of some trees and I can recall a strange steady beeping noise... beep. beep. beep. beep. then I went inside and came back out for another look this time I decided to look around the corner of the house for some reason and there was this huge thing with lights on it hovering must have been 15ft above the power poles I quickly ran in and got my mom to come see it as soon as we opened the door three flying objects flew through our backyard about 20ft over the trees. These flying objects were triangular in shape, had lights white/yellow and one green light on them. It was weird normally with jets the sound is behind them because light travels faster than sound but with these the sound was in front or ahead of them. During this ordeal I can still remember that steady beeping noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am an ardent skeptic and always maintain that there are rational explanations for UFOs and other strange phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was later evening and I was walking back from the Claremont village area with a friend.  I&#39;m interested in commercial aviation and my eyes followed the lights of an airliner passing overhead flying in a north-east direction, which is a normal flight path for departing aircraft out of LAX over this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the lights recede, I saw a strange oval-like shape that was only a little brighter than the night sky.  At first I thought it was the light of a star that was difficult to see because of streetlights in the area.  However, when we moved out from under street lights, there didn&#39;t appear to be any star, just an oval shaped very-dim light but with very clear definitions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light had no lights on it, and it seemed to drift in a straight line toward the southeast.  It didn&#39;t appear to be moving across the sky very fast.  The light was north-west of my position toward the Mount Baldy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the light for about 10 minutes before eventually looking away because I was so startled by this thing I couldn&#39;t explain.  I assumed it might be a balloon, but it didn&#39;t appear to move or look like a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back up in the sky about 10 minutes later, I didn&#39;t see any traces of the object.<n>

I noticed a formation of lights suspended at what I estimated to be a couple hundred yards to a half mile off the ground, about 50~100 yards north of the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I no longer am positive about the exact pattern or number of lights, but what I do remember is either a cluster of three white lights forming a close triangular at what I took to be the tip of the triangle at the east, or else a single white light at the east--either way I took that to be the front of the craft. At what I took to be the rear--the west end--were a row of about five lights, lined north-to-south. They were not uniform in size or shape, that is, three or four were red, with one of these beings smaller than the others, and one other of these lights was white--I don&#39;t remember its relative size. Between these two &#34;ends&#34; of the object were other lights, reddish or even a little orange; two or three of them, a little smaller than most of the lights at the rear. As an electrician, I noticed that the quality or type of light emitted from all of these lights did not seem the least bit unearthly; they were certainly not flourescent, a little brighter than what one might expect from normal incandescent bulbs, more like the intensity and quality of shine that one sees with halogen lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was navigating the east-to-northeast curve in the highway while looking at this thing, trying to both stay in my lane and make out an outline of the object. I was not able to see a solid shape--just the pattern of the lights. I told my friend, sleeping in the passenger&#39;s seat, to look but he was groggy and not awake enough to understand until we were well past the spot. He did not see anything, and went back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen airplanes fly parallel to I-40 on their way west to land at Will Rogers Airport. But (a) they fly much higher than the thing which I saw, (b) their lights flash, this&#39;s did not, (c) they speed past even at their higher altitudes fast enough to recognize their movement from my truck, this thing was clearly stationary, (d) the pattern and number of lights did not match what I am familiar with from conventional aircraft--for example, the two or three lights I saw in the middle were spread too far apart north-to-south for this craft to have had a standard airplane shape. (e) from the intensity of the light, it was clear that this thing was far lower than any airplanes. (Again, the lights were neither flashing nor moving, and I noticed dust particles floating through the lightbeams immediately below the sources of light.)  While I don&#39;t doubt that advanced civilizations may exist which could travel here from their own worlds, I also don&#39;t necessarily ascribe what I saw to otherworldly technology. Maybe it was a test flight of some fancy new  military plane from the local Tinker Airforce Base. I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was 11 o&#39;clock at night, and there were plenty of clouds in the sky that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For almost no reason at all I looked up into the sky, and immidiately saw a long, straight, and almost entirely flat silver line with a small teardrop on the end of it.  The &#34;tail&#34; appeared to break off and was seperate from the small silver tear, and then both vanished into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not entirely sure it even flew very far, or at all, because the clouds were too thick.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise either, but I am certain it wasn&#39;t a plane or a shooting star.  It was too cloudy to be a star, and far too abnormal to be a plane.  It was the color of mercury, and very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed two similar sightings within maybe 50 miles of my own sighting only a few weeks ago.<n> <n><n> These other two sightings are entries from other people on this website.<n>

At around 10:00 PM on that Saturday night, I was looking out my window in the night sky searching for the space shuttle &#34;Atlantis&#34;, when I noticed right where I was staring a bright blue fireball emmiting &#34;sparks&#34; and a light hissing sound.  Astonished by what I had just witnessed, I jetted downstairs into my living room to explain to my sister what I had seen in full detail.  I excited my sister greatly, so much, that she decided to search for what she thought, were &#39;shooting stars&#39;.  Now, I personally didn&#39;t think that it was  a shooting star, and if it was, it must have been a heck of a bolide.  So I took a shower after that, and when I finished, my sister told me that she saw a purple one.  I am not sure if this is true, since she is young, and has an imagination, but she does not often lie.  This spectacle amazed me to the point in which I&#39;ll never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax from student, we believe.  PD))<n>

They flew out to sea over saltburn.  The lights were orange in colour  and were constant  ~ not flashing. no sound was heard. contacted coast guard later in week was was told they were either flares from a plane  ~  or meteors.  I know this was wrong.  The sighting lasted between 3 to 5 minutes, and the spped was that of a slow aircraft ~ but  no sound or flashing lights ~ so i dont think it was an aircraft.  2 other people saw this.<n>

This particular object was due east from my location, at about 25 degrees elevation, just to the left of Mt. Hamilton, a prominent landmark. It shape was a cyllinder with rounded ends, long axis parallel to the horizon--and fixed in the sky during the 5 minutes I watched. The object subtended approx. 1.5 degrees, and in the evening light shone in the same colors seen in nearby stratocumulus; I judged it to have a reflective surface. The atmospheric effects on the object gave the appearance of considerable distance, perhaps even as far distant as the Mt. Hamilton range. While unproven, I had the impression of considerable size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, when I observe something puzzling, I try to eliminate any conventional possibilities. The only prosaic explanation was a blimp or approaching aircraft, but as there were no visible protuberances, such wings, fuselage, or stabilizers, I&#39;m not satisfied with that explanation. Have observed many blimps before, this distinctly cyllindrical object was quite different from a blimps familiar ellipsoid shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When traffic cleared, I watched this object until it was lost behind the local skyline of rooftops and trees. Since I was near home, I quickly dropped by and grabbed my binoculars for a closer view, then drove to my previous viewing point. The object could not be seen, and upon driving towards Mt. Hamilton and away from ground obstructions, I could not find this object anywhere in the sky. Since only 5 minutes from my last sighting had elapsed, I do not believe a blimp could have left local airspace during that brief time. Local wind conditions were calm. With those details, and a bit of skepticism I submit this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report below was incorrectly entered as &#34;Cupertino, CO&#34;.

It was a biker event for children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting around the campfire (2:00 a.m.) and observed in the sky a light darting around.  At first we figured it was a kite by the darting motions it made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it do other maneuvers we ruled that out.  I took my camera out and attempted to take pictures.  Not knowing whether anything would show up because the object was so high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for at least 2 hours and it was still there in the sky when I went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home I downloaded the pictures and with zoom it appears that there were two crafts not one and in a circular shape.

The large light was approx. a half mile up and blinking in a steady on-off pattern (just like turning a light bulb on and off). As we kept traveling North we could see that we were starting to see the other &#34;side&#34; of it since the light light was facing the road but were were passing it on the with it to our left. As we passed we could see a very large couple of red lights on lower and right of the other. The lower right one was also blinking. As we moved along we could see the light(s) were still just hovering and could make out all of them together. It seemed like it was a shape (possibly triangular) but the lights were too bright to say we saw what they were attached to. We lost sight of it due to trees and distance as we traveled. It looked as though other cars were watching it and slowing down since there was heavy traffic volume that evening heading North on 95. No sound heard - warm night with windows/sunfroof open.<n>

But as I watched this craft I noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving so then,again,I thought that it was a helicopter or I was hoping the same UFO that I saw just a few days ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into my driveway and shut my headlights off and got out of my car to go around to the side of my house where the field is so that I could see this craft better. It had its &#34;headlight&#34;: on like before but this time it was dim like a cars headlight going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hung there for a few moments and when I walked out into the field and put my glasses on to get a better look, its light got bright for a few seconds like it was powering up and then it pivited and took off behind the tall trees like it did before and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it turned it was sort of plane shape and it had a few colored lights on it. It was almost as if it knew that I was there like before and it didn&#39;t want me to see too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And like the last time the field was full of deer grazing......now this field is long like a runway and it is surrounded on three sides with tall trees and my house. It is almost like this UFO is taking pictures of the deer and when I have seen this craft I feel like I am also being watched. This last sighting I felt like there was something that was actually in the field.........like some sort of presence or something.......anyway, that is my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From O.P.N.Y   P.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutly no sound and this was only about 500 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

I had my wife come out and look at it she watched it for about 15 minutes during the which was about 40 minutes we seen several planes fly over I did watch one fly North west of it which was a lot higher in the sky after 40 minutes of watching it it slowely moved toward Onaga. like I said it was not in any hurry. one thing that I notice was the lights were solid there was no flashing.and it moved to slow for a aircraft, in which we have, InSeptember of 1967 I lived in Washington State One evening after scool 4 of us were driving out in the country, we were on a old logging road we had stopped the car and got out I looked up above the Fir trees and seen a flying saucer hovering above the trees, it took of but stayed 30 to 40 feet above the tree tops we chased it for about 3 miles at one point we seen it Hovering over a hill we was winthin 100 yards of it. we stopped the car and one of the guyes in the back seat had a 22 rife he was going to get out and shoot it. by the time we got the car stopped it was gone. we all felt like they knew what we was going to do before we got to do it. we was all shocked. However we did follow it down the highway another 2 to 3 miles it would hover just above the tree tops it looked like it was about 90&#39; in diameter and mabey 30&#39; in depth it had green,red and white lights on it looked like to dinner plates stacked one facing the other it had a metalic finish look. we were never scare! d while we seen it. at the time we had heared of them around the area. What I seen tonight just the way it would move and hover really reminded me of what took place in September of 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/6/06 20:04|Salem|IL|Triangle|approx. 5 mins|Black triangular shaped aircraft sweeping the ground with a spot light over I-57 near Salem, Illinois.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52397.html|249|ndxe200609| Black triangular shaped aircraft sweeping the ground with a spot light over I-57 near Salem, Illinois.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way home from my fiance’s house on the night of 09/06/06. As I merged into the southbound lane of Interstate 57 from the Salem, IL. on ramp, I noticed that the traffic flow was unusually heavy. This caused me to note the time, which was 20:04 central time. As I checked my speed to set the cruise control I scanned the traffic in the roadway ahead of me. I noticed that both passenger vehicles and tractor-trailers were all moving at the posted limit or in many cases well below it. This in itself is unusual for this stretch of I-57. My first thought was that a State Trooper must have been laying in wait up ahead but as I maneuvered into the left lane to overtake a line of tractor-trailers, I saw 2 green lights probably a couple of hundred feet above the northbound lane and I guess about one quarter mile away. The lights were very bright, they sat side by side and as I watched I noticed that they appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. As I watched I noted that the lights were indeed moving to the south at a slow speed and I was rapidly gaining on them. My next thought was, that it was a police agency employing an aircraft with speed detection equipment. I could by this time see that the lights were part of the same object with one being on each side. This object appeared to me to be moving too slowly to be regular fixed wing and appeared too large to be an ultralite type aircraft so I assumed it to be a helicopter. At that point I decided that I had better be watching the road or “that chopper” would be life-flighting me to a hospital in St Louis. Just before I came along side the object I got a very intense feeling of dread. It was an almost sick feeling like when you unexpectedly get incredibly terrible news. As I approached, the object was still over the northbound lane, it was slowly moving south, as I could now definitely see it moving past the trees. The traffic in both lanes was still moving but at what appeared to be below the posted limit. I could now see the lig! hts clea rly and they appeared to be running lights on some type of aircraft but I could not determine just what type of aircraft it was.  The sky had been darkening for a while but there was still some natural lighting available as was illumination coming from a rest area that we were approaching. I could make out a dark shape but it was hazy. By this time my view was of course still from behind and the object was at about my 10 o’clock position and I’m guessing about 200 feet above ground. As it came into about my 9 o’clock position, a bright red light appeared to form an equilateral triangle pointing south. At nearly that same instant two other things happened. The sick dreadful feeling in my gut worsened and the aircraft/object stopped in mid air. Immediately the 2 green “running lights” as I call them, both turned bright red and the object rotated one half turn to the left. It spun itself about, completely 180 degrees in place. It reversed its direction of travel and began moving north very slowly. I slowed my vehicle to a near crawl in the passing lane and watched as the red light that formed the lead corner of the triangle turned a brilliant white. A beam of blindingly white light was projected toward the ground and swept about like a searchlight as the triangle moved northward at a crawl. The beam of light swept back and forth behind a thick copse of trees that line the interstate. I could not see the beam sweeping the ground as whatever it was apparently “searching” for was on the opposite side of the tree line.The entire time I watched the object I looked very closely between the lights to determine just what I was looking at. I could see a triangular outline with length, width and height but could not make out any structural details. It appeared as if it was not completely solid. It was a misty blackish, dark color, darker than the night sky. I could not see through it although again I say it did not look entirely solid. I put my driver’s side window down and stuck my head out as I passed the aircraft,! thinkin g maybe the light factory applied tinting on my vehicle’s glass was interfering with my seeing properly. I heard no sound nor could I see any means of propulsion like props or what might be intake or exhaust ports for a jet. When the object was about 100 feet away to my left and about 200 feet above me I quickly held up my hand to gauge size. The distance between the lights along all 3 sides was a little longer than the length of my left hand. I realized that I was still in the passing lane and I was either going to run over someone or get ran over myself. I felt that I should not stop, the thought of stopping made me nauseous so I changed to the right lane and I watched in my mirrors as the object continued northward, shining its spotlight into the woods with cars passing below it like nothing was wrong. I took my eyes off the mirror and glanced at the road ahead and when I looked back the object was gone. I did not see the object change direction left or right; I did not see it go up or down. I just looked back and it was gone. I turned around in my seat and looked rearward but still did not see anything. By the time I reached Dix, IL. my usual exit, I did not feel like driving the country roads home. I continued on to Mt Vernon at exit 95 and went home on more traveled roadways. I did not sleep well that night thinking about seeing whatever this was. I can’t help but wonder who else saw this. Of all the vehicles on the interstate that night surely I am not the only one that was intrigued enough to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The evening sun appeared. Good visibility distance. Some of low pressure clouds present. Mostly, in west coast (coastal beach) having a lot of huge low pressure clouds with possible thunderstorms. On my way to attend the workshop meeting to a specific place. I parked my vehicle. I saw a motorist and lady passenager stopping their vehicle on middle of street road.  They looked up and tried to take a few pictures of their cellphones. Puzzled. I looked up. My gasp, the yellow sphere-like object about 20 yards away from I stand holding a large drink of iced unsweetened tea at my vehicle parking on a parking space. It was hovering about 10 mph from the west coast to east coast  from 14th street. I called several friends to witness it before it went disappeared. No one had a camera.  The motorist with lady passenager tried to follow it but could not do to go due into congested heavily traffic on northbound.  It went disappeared in northern-eastern area after 5 minutes.  I saw with my own eyes. No ordinary thing as a remotely drone or spy object or weather balloon.  It came from west coast (beach) to east coast (inland) I assumed within 20 - 30 miles distance radius. I drew an art picture of yellow object that might have an electromagnetic supposed to hover with approx 10 mph speed. It may have a hidden windowshield.  It moved slowly clockwise and counterclockwise without sounds like a navigating system to see me standing to look up at flying unknown object in the air about 20 yards away from the ground.  The object was similiar as almost size as ordinary car-suv vehicle . I know no one manufactures a flying strange object but a possible futuristic with advanced technological system? Anyone from Manatee who did witnessed taking same pictures of any cellphone&#39;s built-in camera on Sept. 6, 2006 Wednesday evening 18:15pm?  If no one reports this, keep this classified confidentiality, please. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both knew what we were seeing wasn&#39;t either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started of slow like a satalite then took off like a jet through the sky, the light fading out then grew more intense, we both came together on the rocks out of fear and amazement.

This was it for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one patch fog aproaching us from the east(the only fog we saw all weekend that started to form after the encounter) clinging to the ground looking like it was coming to envelope us at any minute.<n>

It was a cool, clear, pleasant evening so I stood outside in the back yard for a minute or two enjoying the breeze and looking at the stars. It was very dark outside, except for the normal lights associated with houses and streetlights. Living right next to an air force base, I also have the occasion to see and hear many planes everyday, and for a while that is exactly what I thought this object was. As I am standing there, I see what appears to be a white and bluish-to bluish-green light each one flashing alternately very close together way  in the distance up in the sky. At this point I could not see anything structural, it was at a very far distance at this point.  I do not know if this was the top, bottom, or side of the object which had the flashing lights. My first impression was that they were the lights you would normally associate with airplanes sometimes as they come in for a landing. Something about them seemed unusual to me; the weird blue color wasn’t what I was used to seeing, and the speed of the strobe was way off. The flashing lights were much faster and also much brighter than I have ever seen on any airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there watching it out of curiosity at that point, thinking that naturally if it is a plane, it’s heading for the Air Force base, and that meant it would have to generally head in a direction and path that was familiar to me from watching airplanes take off and land in the same place for years.  I thought this might afford me a better look at what kind of airplane it was. As it kept getting closer, I thought for sure that it was going to head toward the base, but instead of turning toward the base, it was proceeding directly toward my general location. When it got within my field of vision and I could make it out clearly,  I could only see the bottom of the object, and the outline of the overall shape, which was triangular, and the color of the triangle was a non-reflective black. It was so black that I could make it out against the contrast of the night sky. The white and bluish lights were not flashing or blinking at this time that I could see, but there were lights on the bottom of the object. A small, round, white light was in each corner of the triangular shaped object, with a larger red light in the center of it, which may have been concave. The white lights on the tips of the triangle remained constant, they did not flash or dim , however the red light in the middle seemed to glow or pulse very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I still did not completely understand what I was looking at, because it was flying very low, lower than airplanes are allowed to fly, I know that.  And it was moving very slowly in a perfectly horizontal fashion. The smooth slow glide of the object put me in the mind of the idea of pushing something heavy on the ice and watching it slowly glide across in a level straight line.  That it what this object appeared to do .  It passed overhead maybe one or two houses east of my location, but nearly directly overhead. It had to be less than 300’ ft in the air, it was so close I felt like I could have hit it with a rock, had I thrown one at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it glided over the houses, I opened the gate and quickly walked to the front yard to continue observing the object. It just continued in a level, straight line in a southeasterly direction, and I observed it until it was out of sight, about 30 seconds to a minute I would say total observation from the time I could first visually make it out until the time that it was out of  my field of vision. I kept thinking that something wasn’t right, and it wasn’t until it was almost out of sight that I realized that not only had it passed lower and slower than any airplane I had ever seen, but it also never made any noise at all. None. Not a single rumble, vibration or hum. Completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was out of sight, I went back into the house. I thought I might hear something about other people sighting the same thing, but nothing was ever mentioned by anyone or any news organization as far as I know. I am an ordained minister, and stay at home dad. I don’t want any trouble or publicity, I just wanted to tell the truth about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first I thought nothing of it thinking they were lights on top of a tower or something. After approximately 15 seconds of driving at approximately 85 miles per hour I noticed that we were not gaining on nor passing the lights. That&#39;s when I brought them to my wife&#39;s attention. For almost 3 minutes at 85mph the lights never changed position in my view out the passenger side window. I pulled to the side of the highway to look at them and they appeared to be motionless. The only thing I noticed is that there may have been a small smoke trail rising up from the center of them. Then abruptly, they all went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short conversation about how freaked out we were with what we had just seen, the lights reappeared again. Only this time there were 2 pairs of lights with one pair slightly rearward from when I had seen them and the other pair were in my view between my inside rearview mirror and the side pillar just under the passenger visor. Without knowing how far away and high up they were, it is difficult to say how far apart they were. But as before, my view of them never changed position no matter how fast I drove. Then 1 pair went away then about 30 seconds later the other pair left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military flares at Gila Bend firing range??  PD))<n>

Two nights ago my husband and I were out on our balcony off of the 8E and 2nd street. We had our telescope out looking at the moon. My husband spots something and he say like what the heck is that? I am looking thru the scope and he says, point it at that, I’m like yeah let me just move this thing, refocus into our atmosphere and see...no luck. They were flying E to W. I am going to say about 200 feet off the ground, but they were big. Not like, I can see the pilot in the helicopter big, but I could clearly see the shapes and the light that emitted from the objects. The light that was coming off of them wasn&#39;t bright or noticeable. It was a grayish red, very low light. Almost like radiance. There were several craft (6 to 7 maybe) flying in almost a V formation (yes, like birds) Then one moved from one point of the triangle to the other, but the movements were not bird movements. Like jet formations more than birds, but these were NOT jets! The constant movement across the sky was very slow, but their movement when one changed its position in the formation was very fast. No wings, birds or bats, no noise either. The bodies of the crafts almost looked the shape of Sting rays (bodies only). We tried to tell each other that they were birds, but we both knew better. Yeah yeah that&#39;s it. Birds. Weird glow...almost too low to notice. We watched them as they appeared over the top of one roof until they past from our line of site over another roof. We see helicopters and planes in that area all of the time and in fact a small plane had just past over that area about 10 minutes prior. Nothing like that either. I have looked at the skies my whole life...over 30 now. I’m not some loopy person that can easily mistake one thing for something it&#39;s not. I am very skeptical and analytical. Both of us are. We didn&#39;t know what to do, we were kind of frozen...we knew if we took our eyes off of them, they would be gone. So we ! just wat ched them until they flew over our roof.

There was no audible sound. If it was an aircraft at this altitude and this proximity we surely would have heard its engine noise. The red flare was not completely solid, it appeared to fluctuate in structure, like the waves that are created from heat. - a pulsation. It suddenly disappeared without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both professionals in our 40&#39;s.<n>
9/5/06 17:00|Livingston|TN|Light|1-2 minutes|Brilliant white light seen in the night sky over a rural area in Tennessee|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52360.html|262|ndxe200609| Brilliant white light seen in the night sky over a rural area in Tennessee<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside of my house.  It had just gone dark.  I glanced up to the sky to the left and saw a bright, white light appear over the tree line.  I would say that it was very similar to the north star, except that the light moved.  It was moving to the right.  It appeared to be heading over my head.  I checked for flashing lights and/or a machine sound, the type that a plane or helicopter would make, and found neither.  It was at this point that I ran inside to get my witness, who is my mother.  When I got back out, the object had continued it&#39;s path, and appeared to be almost over my house.  Then the light made an abrupt change of direction, which took it on a path to the nearby town.    The turn may not have been a perfect right angle, but it was close enough.  It maintained a straight line for a few seconds after the change of direction, after which it began to make small jerky motions in more or less the same direction of the town.  It moved from the left to right fairly quickly, but it&#39;s pace away from my house didn&#39;t seem to pick up.  My mother suggested we go to the other end of the house where we have a deck, and get a better view since it was getting harder to see past the tree&#39;s in our front lawn.  We ran through the house, but by the time we arrived at the deck, the light had vanished.  As for our backgrounds.  I&#39;m currently a student in college, and I would like to NOT mention my mother&#39;s background as she works for the state.  I have not consulted her about posting the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/4/06 23:58|Silver Spring|MD|Light|4-5minutes|birght satellite -like nocturnal light with a distinctly orange color wher no satellite should have been.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52602.html|265|ndxe200609| birght satellite -like nocturnal light with a distinctly orange color wher no satellite should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out walking just a few minutes before midnight, and saw approaching out of the Northeast what looked like an unusually bright and unusually orange satellite. Its motion and appearance were just that, but it was almost midnight, and the light passed nearly overhead and to the southwest until it became invisible behind clouds near the Southwest horizon. Planes nearly always exhibit strobes, are only orange colored when near the horizon, and without exception look a lot different as they change their aspect angle with respect to the observer, and this light didn&#39;t.  I checked the time on my cell phone, and it was 23:58 - nearly midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was just about at +7 degrees declination. From that, I calculate that altitude would have to have been about 2500 km to be visible overhead at local midnight from my location (about 39 deg N). A large rocket body in transfer orbit might well be at such an altitude, but I don&#39;t think it could be that bright at that slant range (roughly 3700 km or more at first), or that consistently orangish/yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it moved from northeast to southwest, if what I saw was a satellite, it would have to be in a retrograde orbit. There have been quite a few of these, but nearly all are low orbiters, well below 1000 km altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to find a candidate satellite. It would need an apogee altitude of at least 1000 km (more likely 2000 km), and an inclination greater than 90 degrees. This really cuts the list down to about 20 candidates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several potentially visible birds at about that time, but all would have been in the northwest and would not have passed anywhere near overhead while illuminated by the sun.  I used both commercial and software and web-based tools to confirm this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was dark and the moon was high and to the left as I faced south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I stepped out of the house, the first thing I saw was not the moon, but a very bright, fast moving, white light in the sky.  It was as bright as the moon and at first I thought it was the police helicopter with it&#39;s searchlight on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took only seconds for me to realize that was not what I was seeing.  My niece, whom I do not count as a witness due to her age, could not stop pointing at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I realized this was no ordinary craft, I yelled in the house for my brother to come out and see it.  In doing so, I alerted the entire house.  In all, 4 adults, an eleven year old, and my 18 month old niece all saw the phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved across the sky from west to east.  It moved in a fairly quick, yet consistent speed.  It only varied course slightly when it appeared to be manuevering to it&#39;s left and right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all, the light was visible for about 1 minute.  At it&#39;s end, it disolved into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then stayed outside for about half an hour to &#34;star gaze&#34;.  In that half an hour we saw several commercial flights at various elevations, a satellite in orbit, and the police helicopter did fly over (without searchlight)and was obvious to us that if the helicopter did fly over we would have definately heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ruling those things out, we came to two possibile conclussions; 1 )it was an outer worldly craft, 2) being that we live in Omaha, we are accustomed to seeing craft from the S.A.C. airforce base (B-2 Steaths, fighter jets, etc...).  However, this craft made no banking turn to where the base would be located and seemed to dissapear once it passed the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are fairly certain that this was no government aircraft and are just curious to see if you have heard of any similar reportings in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my second personal encounter, the first took place in 1990 and was no where near as i! mpressive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n>

I wondered what a plane would be doing hovering above my house, then realized that a plane wouldn&#39;t hover above my house.  I tried to get out of bed but was unable to move.  I wondered if my husband heard it, but I was unable to ask him.  The dog was also asleep on the bed and was completely undisturbed.  I kept trying to get up but it was as though a force was keeping me from moving.  I was never frightened, just curious as heck.  I heard a voice say, &#34;it&#39;s the train.&#34;  The train runs about a mile from my house and you can hear it in the distance, but it has never sounded like that and it does not run at night.  I am certain I was not dreaming this. I tried to believe it was the train and saw a picture of the train in my mind. I felt I was being pushed back into sleep by a strong energy.  I struggled to stay awake, but fell into a very deep sleep.  I awoke in the morning and remembered everything about the incident.  My husband heard nothing and said he had slept very deeply all night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

These lights were stationary.  We got out our video camera and zoomed in on it.  We could not only see one light (flashing), but we saw two separate disc type shapes very close together in the sky.  At first glance it looked like headlights on a car in the sky.  They (the lights) appeared to be spinning.  The two disc shapes had red and green lights which blinked in a radom pattern.  Below the two disc shapes a very small solid color green or blue light would appear and go toward the discs and back. We live within 20 miles of Fort Knox.  We got into our car to drive closer to it.  We drove from Elizabethtown North toward Radcliff.  As we would appear to be getting closer to the objects, they then would move.  We turned and went in West toward Vine Grove.  These objects were moving now rapidly.  By the time we arrived in Vine Grove, keeping the objects in sight the entire time, they just disappeared. In an effort to get closer, no matter how far we would drive it would just stay about the same distance from us.  We drove back to Elizabethtown talking in the car about what we saw.  Too bad we could not get closer to get a better video. As we were one block from home, just over the tops of some one story houses, the object we had been chasing for 2 hours, appeared to our left, VERY CLOSE.  The lights appeared to be less than 100 feet from our vehicle.  My wife grabbed the video camera.  As we prepared to stop, one light disapeared, then the second one disappear in less than a second.   We were on the side of the road looking into a black sky.  There was nothing.  The night was very clear and we had with us three other people who saw the same thing. We never heard any noise with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We arrived just as the sun began to sink below the horizon, and decided to sit and watch the stars come out.  I attempted to take some photos with my digital camera of the sun setting; only to find that when the flash would go off we noticed several small particals, for lack of a better term, all around us.  When the flash would go off we could clearly see these particals, they appeared white.  Upon viewing the pictures taken the particals appeared as multi-colored specks of light. We thought nothing more of it dismissing it as some freak occurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first hour or so it became quite dark and I noticed a bright solid white light moving across the sky, I watched it intently knowing full well it was NOT an airplane (no flashing lights of any kind) and thought it was simply an orbital satalite.  The object flew across the sky in a West to East trajectory and as it crossed over where we sat the light grew in brightness and then quickly vanished. I figured it was just another random sighting, and hadn&#39;t had time to ask my boyfriend if he&#39;d seen it as well, so I though nothing more of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say about twenty minutes later I noticed another solid light, not as bright moving from the North to the South. It flew over head at a high altitude and as it did so my boyfriend pointed to it and asked if it was in fact moving.  As I was about to reply in the affirmative, the light stopped.  It hovered for several minutes and then moved quite rapidly back from the South to North. This light continued to move from N to S and then back again.  It would stop and hover above us for several minutes and then continue on it&#39;s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next several hours we counted at least sixteen more lights in the sky.  All moving in random patterns at different altitudes.  The objects would move, stop, hover, zig-zag, and change direction mid-flight.  They would form triangle shapes with stars and then increase and decrease the sizes of these triangles at will.  At 11:00 p.m. there was a bright light that came over the horizon and proceeded to follow in the same manner, the only differences were this one was closer and much brighter, and along with the solid white light there were mulitcolored lights that flashed in random patterns.  We watched this light for quite some time marveled in the way it danced and at it&#39;s brightness.  It was then that we noticed two pairs of faint lights moving in perfect unison.  One pair was located to the South and the second was to the NorthEast. They seemed to dance across the night&#39;s sky in a most beautiful and random fashion.  None of the lights would stray too far from where they were first seen.  They would move a certain distance and then return to their original location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spent a great deal of time trying to determine if it was simply ours eyes that were playing tricks on us, watching stars to see if they moved; and found nothing.  We spotted planes of vairous sizes and knew that this was not the explaination either.  I have over the years seen many strange lights in the night sky, but this was the first time I had ever seen so many lights at the same time in the same area.  This was also the first time I have ever had a witness with me to collaborate my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/3/06 20:35|Kenora (Canada)|ON||3.5 hours|Stationary white, green and red lights in the northeast sky.  What is it?  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD))|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52353.html|277|ndxe200609| Stationary white, green and red lights in the northeast sky.  What is it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of 8 just returned from a fishing trip to a fishing resort near Kenora, Ontario, Canada.  Saturday evening September 2nd I saw what appeared to be a bright twinkling star to the northeast of my location.  As a former BioMedical Photographer I wished I had my camera and telescope to attempt to take some pictures. As I observed it more I thought it to be unusual due to the fact that the star didn&#39;t so much twinkle as it blinked in color between white, red and green.  I didn&#39;t give it much thought other than wishing I could take some pictures thinking it was Mars being so close to the earth this past August.  Sunday evening the 3rd of September a group of 6 were sitting on the porch at our cabin when a member pointed to the northeast sky and asked &#34;What in the world is that?&#34;  He was stunned at the appearance of what seemed to be a star blinking between the colors of white, red and green.  I mentioned to him and the rest of the group that I had seen the same thing the night before which was on going until I went to bed around 10 p.m.  The six of us sat that evening for hours debating what it could possibly be.  I am convinced it was just a star or planet but I am not convinced it was Mars.  Should Mars have not been more to the east or east-southeast of where we were?  What strikes me is upon observing it at 20:35 on Sunday evening until we all went to bed at 23:00 the position of the &#34;star&#34; had not changed.  The rotation of the earth in a 2.5 hour period should have put the position further west as the evening went on.  I do believe in UFO&#39;s due to the fact that me and my best friend saw one up close in the early 1980&#39;s.  I am not convinced this was a UFO but I am not convinced it is a star or a planet.  Were all wondering what it is.  This has been an on going topic of conversation within our group to this day.  Were an educated group ranging from agronomists, financial experts, successful business owners and a professional photographer.  Were are very curious and are looking for ! an answe r.  I am going out tonight, September 5th to see if I can see it from home in North Dakota.  I&#39;ll let you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD))<n>

This was no ballon.  Taking a guess if it was about the size of a bus, it was about 2 miles up no con trail.  It took about a half hour to go from South to North.

During one 4 day span it captured 112 photographs.  Two of the 112 photographs were of something that we can not logically explain.  Other photographs were taken around the same time but did not have the object in them.  They were taken on 9/3/06 at 8:04 PM and on 9/6/06 at 7:58 PM.  There are no power lines in this area, camera is on a ridge line, closest mountain range is in plain view, I26 and all traffic signs are not visible from this area and are located in the hollow between the two mountain ranges.  The objects are extremely bright, are tilted in different directions on each photo, and seem to be showing directional light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object in question looks to us to be a moth, captured by the camera.  Not a UFO, we believe.  PD))<n>

I thought about what I had just seen and decided to call North Hollywood Police Department to make a report.  They recommended I reach Burbank Airport/Bob Hope Airport Police department.  They, in turn, gave me your contact info.  I already left a msg with the voicemail, but, a move was mentioned so I decided to try the website as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for being around in this random event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They moved in a triangle formation and disappeared when approximately 1/4 way above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend really needed to go to the restroom, but there was no place near in sight, so we just exited in the nearest exit so he can just go in the bushes or whatever. It was completely dark, no clouds in the sky, only the moon and stars, and only the head lights on the car let us see, so we stoped at this stop sign, then the sky, it completely lights up in a bluish dimish light, but it was bright, very hard to explain, it caught our attention, I looked up at the sky to see if it was the moon that might have bursted into light or something, but it wasnt, so i thought maybe a plane really low? but i was wrong planes keep moving have a sound and have distictive light points. but instead there was this orb of somekind, you can look at it, it didnt make your eyes squint, so the light was powerful enough to light up the sky, and we can even see the clearing and trees infront of us, but you can see it without it bothering your eyes. it was about 250-300 ft above the sky, it was there for about one or two seconds, they it started dimming in a really weird way, and moved east reallly fast dimming while it did, and dissapeared almost instantly. we all just sit still in the car, till my friend acknowlged it. i was in awe, we were shocked. it was the strangest thing i had ever seen, it couldn&#39;t have been a flare because this moved to the east and dissapeared and was extremely fast. almost like we scared it off or something. it made no noise, and left no trail of any sort. I&#39;m pretty sure maybe someone else driving on the highway might have seen it. But i know me and 2 of my friends in the car saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/2/06 23:30|Albany|NY|Cross|3 minutes|I saw an extremely slow moving plane shaped object that neither sounded like, nor acted like a normal plane.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52292.html|285|ndxe200609| I saw an extremely slow moving plane shaped object that neither sounded like, nor acted like a normal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:30pm Eastern Time Saturday September 2, 2006 my wife and I saw a very odd object in the sky.  We were returning home from seeing a movie, and we were driving westward on New Scotland Rd, Albany, NY to our home in Slingerlands, NY.  I commented to my wife that &#34;the plane&#34; outside the car was flying really low.  This also seemed odd because the object was is not in the normal flight path of planes coming to or leaving from the Albany International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down my car, turned off the radio and put the windows down.  It was surprisingly quiet, emitting a sound that was similar to a jet engine from far away, but the object was very close.  It was either moving very slowly or hovering in one location.  My wife commented that we were traveling faster than the object and I would estimate that my speed at the time was around 30 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in the general shape of a plane.  It had 2 &#34;headlight&#34; like lights in the front of it, that were emitting beams that could be seen in the overcast skies.  There were several other points of light along what looked like its wing and also several points of light along the fuselage.  The object&#39;s &#34;headlight&#34; beams were pointing in an eastward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was just too bizarre so we had to stop and pull over.  I pulled the car into the lot of a private school, Albany Academy of the Holy Names.  The parking lot curved back towards the east and at that point the object began flying away.  It disappeared from our sight in several seconds, most likely less than 10 seconds.  It appeared to be heading in an eastbound direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited approximately a minute and we could not see or hear the object.  I turned the car around in the parking lot and headed back towards New Scotland Rd.  Just before we turned right onto the road (heading west towards our home), we saw the object very far away heading in a northbound direction.  It was traveling much faster now, like the normal speed of a jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the FAA Flight Service Center at approximately 12:05 am Sunday September 3, 2006 and asked him what the &#34;cloud ceiling&#34; was at approximately 11:30pm in Albany, NY.  He said the latest report that he had was from 11:00pm ET, and the clouds were overcast at 3500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object passed through low cloud and turned extensive area of cloud from light grey to blue, similar to search light effect but with a defined blue tint.  Object made no repeat no sound whatsoever. Object speed uknown but speed was constant , at a guess it covered 3 miles in 30 seconds.  Object witnessed by myself and my partner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No Photo&#39;s :( , at a guess this object was on a defined flightpath and had purpose to its motion, somebody else in area must have seen it, what startled me the most was how it changed the colour of the cloud it flew through to blue when the light it was emmiting was very clearly dark orange similar to car indicator lights. The outline of the object had no wings no flashing lights and was almost invisible beyond the edge we were facing. Hope info helps someone out there<n>

The object seemed to have a &#34;tail&#34;, like a comet, and had the appearance of being on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more objects followed, travelling the same path in succession.  The fourth object followed the same path as the first three, and was closesly followed by the fifth object, which appeared to be closer and/or larger, and travelled east to west on a slightly more southerly path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fifth object was shaped more like a lemon and a small light was visible tracing the perimeter, clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and repeating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several of us reported the sighting to three Conservation Officers at the State Park, who had also seen the objects, and stated that we were among 40 or more people who had reported the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Officers contacted the United States Coast Guard to inquire about the objects, and they were told that no USCG personnel had witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way back to the campsite, one of the Conservation Officers remarked, &#34;Sweet dreams.&#34;<n>

A few seconds later they stopped dead and then crossed paths.  At this time my mouth was wide open and I stood up very shocked because the first thing that poped into my mind was UFOs. After crossing paths the lights almost dimmed and disappeared.  These objects UFOs or not were moving a super high speeds.  If I had to compare to anything i said about 5-6 times faster then you watch an airplane go through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

On the night of the big burn, we climbed an observation deck we’d built to watch the festivities from afar. As the &#39;man&#39; was burning, I happened to look up and saw a set of 5 green lights traveling in a single file line formation from east to west. The lights passed over the burn site. When the lights were directly overhead, they rotated counter clockwise, and then shot off NNW in an abrupt manner. My colleague, his girlfriend, and myself witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other shape was visible besides the green lights. It could have been one craft or five. There was no sound associated with the sighting.  That was my sixth time attending the event.  I’ve seen strange and astounding feats of light and sound many times before.  HOWEVER, There was absolutely no doubt in my mind of what I saw that night.<n>

(I Had read the day before in the &#34;Orange County Register&#34; that a European Satellite was being made to crash land on the moon and that the Impact Flash would be seen from Orange County) Since I did not see anything different with the moon, I scanned the whole night sky for any stars or planes or any other peculiar object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise, I saw a bright Star just north of 90 degrees (from the top of my head)  At first I thougt it Was Mars or Jupiter because It gave out a really bright orange, almost Copper like Glow. As I watched it, all of a sudden it got really bright, and then it seemed to have had a burst of light from one side, and something like fire or some debris seemed to be expulsed from it and began to freefall, and as it did, it began to loose its glow. If you ever seen fireworks as the sparks began to freefall and loose their fire glow, that is almost what it looked like, but this definitely was thousands of feet up in the air. My Significant other saw it too, and she thought it was high enough to have been a satellite, but neither of us have seen a satellite that stays static up in space.  I don&#39;t know if this bright object that we saw, was deploying another object or if it had been hit by something else causing it to be damaged and loose material from it. this happened just in a matter of seconds, by the time it was over, my friend had opened the door, and when we looked up again it was gone. I believe that if whatever came off that object crashed or landed on earth, it must have been happened in the Yorba linda or Fullerton Hills in Orange County.<n>

We were driving by San Leandro California when my 13 year old son, screamed at me to look up at the sky, asking Mommy what is that???<n> <n><n> <n><n> first I did not where to look and he said on the sky.  I saw a saucer-like craft with lights at the bottom, drifting on the sky and heading down, intermitent lights were flashing on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a hat.  The top of the craft was dark but the lights at the bottom were very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for about a minute trying to figure out what it was, I could not make up what type of craft it was and I couldn&#39;t believe how much it looked like what I always  seen in pictures of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the sudden I did not see it anymore.   My son said he was still able to see it a little longer after me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was driving so he could not turn his head to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we came home I told my son to run to go draw what he saw.

I am a retired 56 year old business professional. My hobby is photography.  Approximately September 2, 2006 I was photographing a beautiful rapidly changing sky.  Two days later I was reviewing my photos on the computer to eliminate the undesirable ones when I noticed some rather interesting forms on the photos.  Honestly, through the view finder on the camera, I never noticed anything as I was focused on the colors. None of the other photos have anything strange on them, eliminating the possibility that something was on the lens. I use a 10.0 excellent digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one photo there are two distinct images. One looks cylindrical with a bump in the middle. It actually looks like smoke is propelling it. In the same photo, directly to the left is another object, quite a bit smaller, obviously at a further distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another photo has a round bright dot which is amongst some dark clouds. To the far right you will see a drain pipe that comes from my building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the third photo there is an elongated &#34;something&#34; that is directly above the house in the photo. Proportionately, it is huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were all taken within minutes of each other along with other photos of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be emailing the photos to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We see nothing in the three photographs sent to our Center that is suggestive of a genuine UFO.  Two photos are suggestive of birds caught in mid-flight, and under low light conditions.  The third photo suggests part of an overhang on a nearby house, we believe.  PD))<n>

My neighbor was standing in his yard also and we all saw the object. I ran into my house to get my hunting binoculars as did my neighbor. I saw a purplish oval shaped object very clearly. My neighbor figured it was a balloon. However there was no gondola of any kind nor was there an engine or steering mechanism. I also noticed in quick succession two small white objects in the same vicinity moving at varying speeds in a straight line away from the object. Neither my neighbor nor my wife saw these, having believed it was indeed a balloon and therefore losing interest. I alone continued to watch through the binoculars. However we had all previously seen this object emitting bright lights on one side, my wife believing it was reflection from the sun. There was no mention in the local papers of this nor had anyone else reported seeing this object.

I assumed it was a tethered balloon, but given the variable wind conditions along the coast, from the west around 7 to 12 knots, I would have expected some wobbling or  other motion from a tethered balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing west and the object was about 80° up from my vantage point. I observed it for about 5 to 10 minutes. I never saw any buffeting you&#39;d expect with having a tethered balloon and variable wind conditions. Size was about a pea at arms distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having a tethered object of any kind in that area would be at the very least reckless as it&#39;s common for low flying air craft such as helicopters and ad banner planes to fly through the area. That location is about 2 miles WNW up the coast from the very busy Santa Monica airport and it&#39;s common for aircraft to traverse at or below 500 feet going up or down the coast over the ocean to pass the western part of the airport departure route (typically runway 21).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out of time and had to leave the area. Always been a curiosity. Haven&#39;t seen any thing similar at that location, but I did see a similar object about 2 months ago, 2 miles inland. I observed it through my 10x80 binoculars. It was partially obscured by some clouds. Probably less than 20 seconds of observation time. Similar attitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Took a break and looked up, saw what looked like an all white sheet of paper traveling at high speed over my head approximate size of a quarter at arms length.  Object was heading almost due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object changed shape to an imperfect boomerang shape as it slowed way down, then it changed to an imperfect triangular shape with rounded corners.  Continued to slow down to a crawl as it got much, much smaller.  I am assuming it was climbing very fast not just getting smaller but it appeared to get smaller. Then it appeared to be a perfect round all white dot from below as it came to almost a complete stop at a very high altitude. It may have been a white sphere but there was no dimension, no shadow. It began to speed up again and went near to the sun (from my vantage point). I covered the sun with my left hand and could still see the white dot quite clearly two to three inches from the sun.  It then got smaller and smaller until it was almost out of sight.  It then appeared as if a dark area was surrounding it in a larger flat circle, but this was very faint, just prior to it climbing out of my sight.  What is odd are the feelings I got when observing this object.  First off, it had no apparent dimension, no shadows against itself as you see with an aircraft, it was like a cartoon cell image in the sky yet it was there, not an illusion or a reflection. Secondly, it was traveling in a manner that it seemed that our atmosphere was neither aiding it nor preventing it from climbing out of sight at an incredible rate, again like watching a cartoon.  It was not following the rules that we have to follow in our atmosphere.  Thirdly, when it did slow down and speed up, it appeared as if it was being pulled from behind to slow it down and again pulled from the front to speed it up. This is just a feeling I got, I cannot expalin it.  It moved in a manner that I have never seen.  I am a commercially rated helo pilot and have been to a lot of air sh! ows and NEVER seen anything move like this.  If we have this kind of craft, why are we still using primitive fighters and bombers?  The whole sighting lasted 30 seconds.  It was completely silent.<n>

PD))|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52349.html|306|ndxe200609| A craft that appeared as a flashing cloud hiding in the clouds and created it&#39;s own to hide in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside onto the deck at the rear of the house to let my dog out at 3:00AM.  Like I always do, I looked up to check out the sky.  It was cloudy directly above me but was only 50% cloudy (cumulous) with big breaks in between clouds. In the breaks between the clouds the sky was clear and I could see the stars very well. When I looked up I saw a round dim-lighted area in the clouds resembling a searchlight hitting the clouds.  Then I noticed it was flashing, at the time it was a consistant flash (one second on, one second off)but was inconsistent at times, too.  I was still wondering why a searchlight would be on so late and then it got to the edge of the cloud and was in the clear.  I was surprised though that it still appeared to be a round flashing cloud (pea-sized at arms length).  It was now in the middle of a clear sky with no clouds coming.  That&#39;s when I decided to get a better look at it.  I stepped inside and grabbed my binoculars that I keep in a cupboard right inside the door.  This took less then 5 seconds and when I stepped back out there were swirls of clouds covering it.  These clouds had a cirrus look but had a defined outer edge (multi-curved)and washed out like a smear toward the flashing cloud.  At this point I had to show someone so I went and woke two family members.  They came out and at this point it had moved to the next cloud blowing by.  The cloud it made was just dissapating but still visible.  My family saw what I had been seeing confirming that I&#39;m not seeing thing&#39;s.  We watched it for another half hour.  It never moved more than six to eight inches (at arms length)never making a sound but continuing to flash.  After the half hour it went behind a cloud and we lost track of it.  Twenty or so seconds passed and I heard a low whooshing sound that lasted about ten seconds.  After a couple of minutes of no sign of it my family went back to bed.  I stayed outside and about 20 minutes later I saw it again.  This time it was not flashing and was hiding! on the edges of the clouds until the cloud moved a distance and then it would meander to the next cloud coming.  I saw this with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  It was still visible because a circle sticks out againt a backdrop of blurry shapes.  Anyway I watched it jump clouds for about five more minutes until it disappeared again.  I continued looking for it and about a minute later I heard the whooshing sound to my left (west).  Looking up I saw what appeared to be typical FAA lights of a plane/jet at about the same altitude as what I was watching but a few miles away.  I looked through my binoculars at the lights and could only see lights, no craft.  Then it either turned off it&#39;s lights or took off because I took down the binoculars and it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw but it was definately some sort of craft.  I live about ten-fifteen miles away from Selfridge ANGB and witnessed what I believe to be four Black Manta TR3A&#39;s (another bizarre occurance)back in &#39;94 so I do leave the possibility open to it being a black project.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a star, possible Sirius.

Well early this morning I was outside getting some fresh air and at the end of this field I saw a bright light that was tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that it was a helicopter that was coming my way but it made no noise and it was moving around like a butterfly would. As I watched it I thought that someone had a kite with a flashlight hooked onto it or something because that is what it resembled but then I could also see a few blinking lights onto the side or back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to actually see the craft itself because of the light facing my way. But I could see that there was a dark shape around the light like some wings sticking out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching it and it kept fluttering around in a small area so I debated whether to run inside and get the binoculars or stay outside. Well I started to feel a little creepy being that I was well out in the open field so I came inside to get the binoculars and before I could get them up to my eyes this object took off quickly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved to my right and up and was gone. It went from fluttering to a hard straight move without sound so I know that it was not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also felt that it knew I was watching and at one point I had to look away because I felt that my eyes would burn from the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that&#39;s all for now. Can&#39;t wait for the big to be over to get all of the updates and new entrys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As always....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believer  P.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had an entry a short time ago about a cloud of gas or something that happened a day or two apart from a similar report in the paper in NYC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

It&#39;s speed was approx walking pace as it moved North over the tree line causing the neighbors dog and cows to go completely insane. I have never heard so much noise from either of them in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving about 50 yards north, it changed direction now heading North West at the same speed and was about 80 ft off of the ground.

Its movements were flawless and required no deceleration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about another 1/2 minute we decided to run and get the car to follow it, but after that we were unable to locate it again.  About 30 minutes later we were still driving all around looking for it and decided to go up to a large hill in our area to see if we could see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way there we were coming to our turn when all of the sudden a huge orange ball can rocketing by us above our car heading North just as we were.

First of all i would like to add the fact that i am a 26 year old private pilot that has been studying aviation since about the age of 10. i have extensive knowledge of 90% of aircraft that are on the civilian and military market. i am currently in college and me and a few of my friends were going down to the bolivar peninsula,tx (crystal beach) for labor day weekend. i am from houston so we took interstate 10 east to highway 124 through winnie,tx to get there. around 10 minutes after taking a right on to that highway i saw a helicopter moving parallel to these powerlines that was parallel to the road that we were travelling. what caught my attention was how close he was to the lines and i could clearly see how close he was to them because he was about 350 yards in front of our path.the road made a sway to the right and the farther that me and my friend traveled down this curved road,&#34;at about 75-80mph, we gained alot of headway on the chopper. well, by the time the curve was overwith i had relized that the 350 yds i thought he had on us was really about 100 yds and it was &#34;very&#34; clear that it was not a helicopter...it was a glowing orange ball about  three times the size of a basket ball. it was amazing&#34; and it was moving at about 90 miles an hour parallel to the power lines.&#34;5 feet above them&#34; and my friend was flooring his jeep to keep up with the thing and he did a good job of it too. it never made a sound but we were going so fast with the windows down i would have never heard it anyways. Believe me when i say this, we were hauling ass after this thing. This thing was a glowing ball and it was not emmitting any light at all.it was like a big ball of candlelight but it looked like the size of a basketball from the altitude it was keeping. we followed the object for around 45 minutes when we came to a hill and a small community along the highway in between the peninsula and winnie and we watched the obje! ct fly a bout treetop level over that community and me and my friend watched as people were walking down the street, driving their cars, and were completely oblivious to what was just over their head...one thing that i can tell you is that watching that made the whole thing very erie&#34;...keep in mind that by this time we had been watching this thing for almost an hour .... what i saw that night was not un explainable..it was obviously an aircraft but just not of human engineering...it was of something else. me and my boy knew that nobody would believe us, so for about 20 minutes i tried to get the best picture possible with what we had and that was my camera phone...i t came out as crappy as the the phone camera but it is visible on the picture so anyone that would want to see it could. at the time of the picture the object was about 75yds in front of the truck just above the power lines  until it slowed down and it was above us anywhere from 100 to 200 feet and instantaneously dissapeared...the only way to describe the way it is like someone turning off a lightbulb. it just vanished after almost an hour of following it..truly one of the most craziest things ive ever seen. i didnt even tell anyone other than my girl but i found this website and saw all of the other reports that were almost identical to what i saw and i felt like it was my obligation to write this... i am going to leave my information so i can be contacted just incase somebody wants to hear my story but i have been doing someresearch since this and i have found that these kinds of sightings happen all the time like everyday somewhere in the world...there is obviously not only a presence of unhuman technology but there is a &#34;major presence&#34; and people are always talking about the government and how they are keeping information from their people..i think that is only because they no nothing at all and there is absolutely nothing they can do. i know what i saw that night and there is nothing that an f-16 can do against and object that can move like th! at and d issapear at will...we are simply out of our technological league&#34; that it is why it should be up to the people and private organizations such as this to find answers to questions dealing with this presence...it is obvious that nasa is censored by the national govt so dont think that some liberal elected politician is just going to walk into congress and demand answers to questions that dont exist&#34; sincerely, !#$@% ps.contact information will be given upon request.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought was that they may be hot air baloons. But the night was very quiet and I could not hear the sound of the gas burners which are usually heard. The formation and movement was also to perfect. Over the span of approx. 2 minutes, each light fadded until the last one. I unfortunatly was only able to videotape the last light (30 second tape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be checking with local authorities and medias to confirm similar sitings or reports.<n>
9/1/06 21:00|Kamloops (Canada)|BC|Teardrop|1 hour|small bright light - low in the North over Kamloops - showing red, blue, green & amber lights - teardrop shaped when using binoculars.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52304.html|315|ndxe200609| small bright light - low in the North over Kamloops - showing red, blue, green &amp; amber lights - teardrop shaped when using binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband &amp; I first saw this bright light on Friday evening, Sept.1 &#39;06 - from our deck. At first we thought that it was an airplane ( because of the flashing colored lights) but it did not seem to move. We watched it for over an hour &amp; it only seemed to move slightly - if at all. Then we thought it must be a star. Do stars have different colored flashing &amp; moving lights? Could it be a star whose light was affected in some way by some haze or smoke in our atmosphere? Other stars nearby looked normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looked at through binoculars, this light seemed to change shape slightly ( to become triangular at the top - joined to a &#34;half oval&#34; at the bottom ) &amp; the red lights were along the oval portion at the bottom - while the amber lights were in the centre &amp; the blue /green lights seemed to be more on the left side. The next evening, we found it was still there in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been &#34;The Bell Blimp&#34;? Who knows?<n>

I was using a 3x barlow with a 25mm wide angle lens. The moon was very bright and the sky was totally clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing the moon a tanto shaped long object cruised across the field of vision!  I have no idea how big or long it was and also 2/3rds down the shape was an exact smaller tanto shaped part of the craft that appeared to be attached on the underside (my telescope shows objects actually upside down so the smaller section was on top, yet in reality was on the bottom side, hope this makes sense!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anyone else reported this, I don&#39;t know if this is a &#34;black project&#34; experimental craft, or UFO, but what struck me was the 45 degree angle of the front part of these two front sections, and a slightly rounded rear end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was headed in a westerly direction.<n>
9/1/06 20:55|Yelm (east of)|WA|Light|20 Seconds|Very bright, unmoving object in eastern sky that suddenly faded to invisibility over about six seconds.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52279.html|317|ndxe200609| Very bright, unmoving object in eastern sky that suddenly faded to invisibility over about six seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving eastward, I noticed a brilliant, star-like object about 40° above the horizon with brightness between that of Venus and Jupiter when observed on the local meridian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was unmoving, and I wondered if my dream of seeing a supernova before I died was about to be fulfilled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was unmoving, and I could not discern any other lights associated with it, as with an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing it for about 20 seconds, the light faded to zero in approximately 5-7 seconds.  Prior to this its light output was steady, insofar as I could observe with the unaided eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, Jupiter was low in the west at the time of the sighting, and I saw it, as well as the moon, which was just past first quarter, i.e., in waxing gibbous phase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Venus can never appear where this object did since its greatest eastern elongation is about 47°, as I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sirius, the brightest star, is not as bright as this object was, and, of course, it&#39;s a wintertime object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have a ready explanation for what this object could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The only Iridium flare visible on this date would have occurred at 22:15 hrs.  Therefore, the sighting probably was not of an Iridium satellite flare.  It may have been the landing light on an airliner, approaching from the east, but that is only one of many possibilities.

We watched it pass right over head and it had no obvious shape - just a ball of light with nothing flshing, no exhaust, just very bright. We wondered what it could be for several minutes and then when we turned round, another one approached from the same direction with all the same charateristics. The passing of the two balls of light took about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 44th st.  I was walking on the west side of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking past a Japanese restaurant. I saw two people standing outside, smoking a cigarette (I assume they worked at the restaurant, but didn’t ask), and looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw (and this is from memory so it isn’t great) is a dark grey/black ball, about the size of a basketball.  It was hovering over the building across the street.  The building was about 5-6 stories tall, so my guess is that the object was 70-80 feet above the street.  My first thought was that it was a black plastic bag that had been blown up by wind currents up the side of the building.  But I didn’t see any of the loop type handles or an opening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was that it was a balloon.  I’m still not sure that it wasn’t that, but either a bag or a balloon would normally move in a thrusting jerky type motion, depending on the wind currents.  This didn’t.  At some point after it was hovering, it moved at a slow, but steady pace across/over the street. It took maybe a minute for it to go over say 4-5 lanes of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I lost sight of it as it drifted above the building I was standing in front of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time it didn’t seem like a typical UFO because I would think of those as more of a craft. This didn’t seem like a craft at all because of its small size, but its smooth motion didn’t seem like a balloon or bag either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now carry a small camcorder with me in case I see something again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

9/1/06 08:20|Kingston|PA|Unknown|5 min.|disk shaped object, low whine , 6 flashing orange lights, 3 front, 3 back|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52363.html|322|ndxe200609| disk shaped object, low whine , 6 flashing orange lights, 3 front, 3 back<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always go to my mothers for my lunch break while im at work, because she watches my daughter and this way i spend my lunch with her, besides, my work is only about 5 min away from my mothers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night, as i was leaving my mothers second floor apartment,on her back porch,(10 ft high)my daughter was comming out to tell me goodbye, i happened to see out of the corner of my eye, a very unusual light comming from the west. It was kind of far away, and i at first thought it to be a plane, but there was no sound yet, and its color was a brillant, bluish/white. It flew towards the southwest(to our left) slowly across the sky. By this time, my mother had planned on walking the dog, and she came out and saw it.It moved so very slow, almost like a plane that was coasting,it seemed too big to be moving that slow to me, especially with no wind currents or sound. Then , it turned east in a path directly towards us. We kept watching, and slowly, very slowly, it moved increasingly forward and got about 20 ft away before i could hear it. It was a&#34;type&#34; of jet engine sound i would say, that is, it had a whine like a jet, but this whine was a very low pitched whine, thats the only way i can describe it.Now its even more desturbing to me, because even though i can hear some sort of engine, it was still too quiet. The engine whine did not match to either the slow speed, or the size. This thing seemed to float in the dark sky. Now that it was about to go over the top of the house, i tryed to make out quickly the shape of the thing before it was gone. For the life of me, i could see no shape in the middle.It just had three lights spanning the front, and three spanning the back. It seemed that between the center of these lights, the shape, or craft moved, i could see something wobbling. Another thing is, when it turned to cross over the top of the house, it didnt turn like a plane, based on the movement of the lights, it seemed to lay on its side, then turn, then lay flat again. All the lights ! blinked in unison, which i knew was wrong from the start, and they were all the same color. For a split second, i thought it might be a blimp, but it moved faster than a blimp, and more jerky and irratic.The sound waves didnt seem to reach the ground like a regular jet does, the whine was up with the craft.Ive talked to a vietnam vet that i work with, and he told me that because a jet cant fly, it has to keep a constant speed of 175mph to stay in the air. This thing cralled.As i drove back to work(east)i looked for the continuance of its path, but it was gone. Later at work i realised that i was so worried about getting a look at the shape that i didnt even see what color the lights were, when i got back from work, i asked my mother, she said orange. The next day, my daughter(13) and i were talking about it, and i mentioned that i asked my mother about the color and what she said, and my daughter agreed. I told her i was upset that i couldnt see a definate shape, and she said she saw it, and it was a disk.  These statements are absolute truth and i would be willing to take a polygraph.<n>

9/1/06 01:00|Leesburg|GA|Light|five to ten minutes|Sharp turns and zig zags with this light|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52650.html|325|ndxe200609| Sharp turns and zig zags with this light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could anyone confirm the possibility of a satellite going overhead in the hours past midnight? We have seen this &#34;object&#34; twice and it seems to be as far up as a satellite, it moves just as fast, but it will zigzag or suddenly turn at right angles. There&#39;s no flashing lights and it&#39;s at an altitude much higher than even a military aircraft...like I asked before, it seems to be at the same altitude as a satellite but I don&#39;t think a satellite can make turns that quickly or move side to side as it&#39;s tracking across the sky. The first time we saw it was the night of the Perseud meteor shower and then again about two weeks later. It came from due north and was moving towards the south but when it got almost directly overhead, it took a sharp turn to the southeast. The second time we saw it, it stayed on a &#34;straight&#34; course but started to zig zag very rapidly for about two or three minutes. Once again, there are no flashing lights on it and it looks to be very, VERY high up. It&#39;s about the same size of any average, very bright star in the night sky and we&#39;ve only noticed it (twice) in the wee hours of the morning. We also noticed an unusually high amount of commercial or military aircraft flying around in the sky on the very same night we saw it the first time. We&#39;re avid stargazers and love to be outside at night and the number of aircraft in the area just didn&#39;t look right to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What could it be?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I didn&#39;t know there was an official reporting website until I read an article in the UFO Magazine. I did write a report about this with another UFO website but not this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw in the sky won&#39;t take long to describe....it was what looked like an open rectangle in the sky maybe a mile high. I was looking to the west and determined it was just a little north of Seattle. I had just taken an exit off of I405 and on the overpass bridge heading west I saw it. Plain as seeing a blimp. It was all but imipossible to determine the size of it but it was easy to tell that it was big enough for something to fly through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view of this thing didn&#39;t last long because the traffic was heavy and I couldn&#39;t stop. It was so obvious I thought I would have heard about it on the news that day but there was nothing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 59 years old and have never done a hoax about anything. It&#39;s not my way of having fun. But, this is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
