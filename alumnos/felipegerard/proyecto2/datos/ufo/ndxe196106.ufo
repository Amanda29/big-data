I was a young girl and the word UFO, nor the idea of UFOs, was not in vocabulary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was summer, the windows were open for ventilation and it was later than 10 PM at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t sleep because of the heat, so I moved to the foot of the bed and lay with my head and shoulders in the window.  Our house was stucco, with a flat roof.  There were no street lights in our town at that time.  I had checked out the neighborhood, listened to the sounds and was cooling off.  I heard a soft beep, beep, beep, with the beeps separated by 2 or 3 seconds.  I couldn’t find the source of the sound.  It was new to me.  There were no vehicles, at that time, with back-up beepers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled around inside the window trying to locate the sound and had finally settled on my back, watching the stars in a dark sky.  There was no moon that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the corner of my right eye, to the east of the house, I saw something move.  The beeping sound was right on top of me.  I turned my head and saw a very large silver sphere.  The sphere had spires at equal distances, all over the area I could see, perhaps 10 to 12 spires.  Lights were on the ends of every spire.  Some were blue, some white, some red.  The beep and white lights seemed to pulse in unison.  None of the red or blue lights went out when the white ones pulsed brighter and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I was in about the 5th grade, because I knew about the Russian satellite being launched  and that the United States was about to/or had just launched our own.  I remember thinking, &#34;Oh, that’s what a satellite looks like.&#34;  I didn’t know that a large round ‘thing’ couldn’t fly, telephone pole high, with no motor sounds, no landing gear and no noticeable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled over and watched it go out of sight, over the lights of Roby, ten miles away.  I could hear the beeping sound for about 30 minutes, from start to finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wondered what it was, but only told friends about it 6 years later.  I wasn’t worried about it, just assumed that it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are you able to tell me what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Rotan, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I remember all of us going into the front yard and observing a saucer type UFO hovering, with lights on around the perimeter of it, over the neighborhood.  Some people were screaming.  It left so fast we couldn&#39;t see it leave.

6/30/61 08:00|Greensboro|NC|Cigar|10 seconds|Silver cigar craft came out of the woods|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87585.html|4|ndxe196106| Silver cigar craft came out of the woods<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silver cigar shaped craft just over trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several UFOs in my lifetime and reported them here.  But my first experience with UFOs was when I was around 7 years old and did not see anything, but my father did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time of this sighting is an estimate.  I know where I lived at the time of this sighting and I was probably seven years old.  It happened early in the morning, and I was not in school, so I am guessing it occurred during summer vacation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my Dad and I were riding in his Oldsmobile 88, and we were traveling east on I-85 near Groometown Rd. in Greensboro, N.C.  I know that because we had just left my grandparent’s house on Groometown Rd., they lived just a quarter mile off the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very bright and sunny morning, and the sun was shining directly in our faces.  Suddenly my dad became very excited and started shouting, “Look, look!&#34; and pointing to his right which would have been southeast.  I turned and looked, but I was blinded by the glare of the sun and could not see anything.  I have very sensitive light green eyes and have squinted all my life when in sunlight. I said, “What is it Dad? Where is it?” He kept pointing and said, “Look, just over the trees there!”   Again, I looked in the direction he pointed, but I could not see anything, and again the glare of the sunlight was giving me difficulty seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, my Dad said, “It’s gone, it flew away.” I asked him what it was.  My Dad told me he saw a bright silver cigar standing vertically come up out out the trees to our right, it leveled off horizontally just above the trees, and then just flew away. It was a very short sighting, maybe ten to twenty seconds at most.  My  Dad was very puzzled at what he had seen.  He described it like &#34;a rocket&#34;, a long silver cigar object, about the length of the trees it came up out of.  I am not sure how far away it was, but I got the impression it was very close. We heard no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I did not see this object, but I believed my Dad.  He was a very serious and sober person who did not often joke around. He was not one to make up stories at all.  My Dad (passed away in 2009) was a very intelligent and educated man, he was a radar technician in WWII and served aboard an aircraft carrier.  He worked as a civilian for the military as a radar technician until he retired, so he was also very familiar with military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s about it, this was my first experience with UFOs.  I saw others years later in Florida where we had moved as a teen, and yet more in Connecticut where I have lived the past 23 years.  But this first experience I did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I would say it was about 100 yards above us. It had lights around the outter rim, which were red and green and flashing. It maintained a motionless station in the sky as we continued to observe it. I got the impression someone was looking down on us, I was 15 years of age at that time. After about 5 min. it first moved off slowly traveling in a north easterly direction heading out over lake Michigan then it suddenly speeded up in a flash and was out of sight in a matter of a couple of seconds. The most interesting fact I recall about that day is, after the sighting was completed non of my family members discussed what we saw. Everyone went back to what ever it was they were doing as if it never happened. My father still lives in Chicago at this time at the age of 83 and my two brother&#39;s are now in their fifties, I am 57. My mother passed in 1967. Now this is going to sound strange, the next time I saw the alomst exact same object was in the movie &#34;Close Encounters of The Third Kind.&#34; What we saw on that day looked just liked the first spaceship which first came over the landing area in that movie. If anyone wants to talk to me about it please e-mail me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was with my Cub Scout troop in our back yard when we all noticed a bright light in the sky. It was going very slow. It then began a loop manuver going at the same speed, much to slow for a conventional air craft to accomplish. We watched as 3-4 jets came in from the right as it came out of the loop. As the loop was finished and the jets got closer it took off vertically at a high speed. As I said it was a long time ago and I don&#39;t recall specifics like direction or time of year. As I talk to the rest of my family and get better info I&#39;ll add it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

School was out so this was early in the day. It was a clear day with no clouds in the sky. When a shadow came over us we thought it was a summer thundercloud. We looked up and a large triangular object was just sitting there. It was a matte silver-gray, the tips more rounded instead of sharp, with no lights visible to the eye. There were no seams in the craft, it made no sound at all and there was nothing to indicate there was any type of an entry. It was very close, about 200 feet or so above us. We were only about 10 so the distance is hard to judge. My friend became extremely frightened and went home. I ran to my back door where my mother was coming out. I told her to come and look but when I turned to point it out, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I remember it like it was yesterday.  It was at dusk, still very much daylight I was busily pedaling my bike from a dead stop ,and looking toward my right.  Suddenly popping up over the eastern horizon directly in my sightline came a moon-like object yellowish-silver in color and moving very fast, it flew right over my house and disappeared behind the tree line on the western horizon.  It probably took 12-15 seconds from eastern to western horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison it was bigger than any full moon I&#39;ve ever seen.  It also had some sort of protrusion at about 2 o&#39;clock resembling an elongated &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot; like tail approx 1/10th the diameter of the body of the object.  I had not even heard of flying saucers at this point and told myself that it was a comet because a comet was the only thing like this I&#39;d ever of which had a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I believed to be a similar object 30 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I am now in my 60&#39;s so it would put my age round 9 or 10 yrs old when this happened and can remember this like it happened yesterday.  I will never for get it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Opa Locka, Florida, at the time, with my two adult sisters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They asked me to please help them by taking the clothes off the line out side before it got dark, so I was in the process of doing that chore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I felt an odd feeling come over me.  As though some one was behind me, and I could feel some sort of heat or some thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned around to look, I saw this object hoovering over top of the pine trees across the street from our house.  I do not know how to judge the distance but I can tell you it was close enough for me to see in side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a clear shield or was &#34;all clear&#34; at first. Blended with the clouds.  Then I could see an out line of some kind of metal.  I thought it was a blimp maybe at first, due its shape, but there was not sound and it was not moving like a blimp at all.  As it materialized It was not a blimp shaped but more like a thin sphere.  Oval like, and what metal I could see was shiny bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see a figure inside which appeared to be a slender male, I could not see the face, or, I just do not remember.  Maybe a am just assuming it is a male figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either standing or sitting by a control panel of some sort.  I could see tiny lights blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The figure was moving its arms as if it was working some kind of controls or some thing.  And was watching me, looking right at me, then looking down at some thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all grey, or had grey like a uniform,(?) with grey military style cap, flat at the top with duck bill. I do not remember any symbols on any of the clothing.  But I do remember the back ground lights on the inside of the craft.  They were diff colors and twinkling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to feel strangely and I became paralyzed like, numb feeling all over.  I could not move at all, nor could I cry out. I felt some kind of pressure on my body like a vibration maybe, and heard a low humm....could see some thing around the craft like it distorted the air around it maybe.  After that I dont remember any thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know. I was walking into the house with out the clothes basket, and my sisters were angry with me.  They had been looking for me for over an hour or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told them I was out side in the back yard, taking down the clothes, but they said NO I was not, and wanted to know where I went, because they went all over the neighborhood looking for me, as well as a neighbor.  I could not answer their questions, but I tried to explain the weird craft I saw, but they did not believe me.  They wanted to know where I went, but I just did not know, so they thought I made up a story to cover my butt.  And I was grounded for few days  HAH!  To this day I cant remember where I went, or what happened, but I can remember the incident like it was yesterday, and have had strange experiences all my life from that point on.  Strange dreams etc...being appearing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some type of sleep paralyses that occur when a male figure appears in my room, like a shadow, wearing long black cape and a large brim hat, among other things that have occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of all the UFO photographs I have not seen one such as the one I saw.  Or maybe I just cant remember all the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the year 2005, in north Fla, I saw a strange light in the sky above our apt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was plane head lights, but it would have been to low to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam of light was triangle in shape, an  then a huge owl appeared out of no where,  flying in front of the light, in the light, looking down right at me, and sounded off with a loud screech, hoovering above me.  I was not frightened, but excited.  My son and daughter were with at the time, so they saw it too.  The light lased for about 1/2 hour or so. A few days later I had a dream that me, my son and daughter, were coming out of the apt, when I noticed a huge round light that at first I thought was a full moon on the rise.  But then I looked to my left and saw the moon. I said to my children, since when do we have to moons.?  Instantly, the light changed into a sphere, of some sort of strange metal that looked almost lead in color, smooth with strange design.like where widows might have been, but no glass.  Just shapes like beveled windows.  I can draw it plain as day. Any ways...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to shine a light from the center of the round sphere, which started off to be like a blue light and turning to a very bright white light with intensity, till you could see nothing but the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it swooped away into the sky with great speed,leaving a cinder like trail.  Reminded me of a sparkler.  Then as quickly as it speed off, it came back, and flashed a very bright light, that was very hot, at me, my son and daughter but they dont remember any thing at all, other than the light and owl incident.  But any ways that light was so bright that we had to turn away from it and cover our eyes.  If it was a dream or reality they cant remember any thing but the owl and light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what all is going on, but I can tell you that I know, what I know, and what has been occurring in my life is real, with out any doubts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch the heavens all the time wondering about it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are just a few incidences I am sharing with you, because they are the most memorable in my mind. Fresh as yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have these things been Alien encounters due to their nature?  Do you know of any one having similar experiences?  Has any one ever seen a UFO that is similar to what I have seen, or the strange shadow man in the night?   It bothers me that I have no answers for even my self, and cant afford hypnotism, much less afraid of the ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have just shared with you is to my knowledge true to the facts presented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my hopes that some one will read this and share their similarities if any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Or some one can help me figure out what the heck is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have photos nor did any one else see what occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were colored lights like fire just illuminating the object like liquid light flashing all sorts of firey colors, but it was contained as it were from within the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were about 500 feet from the object we stopped the car and just watched it for awhile. It all of a sudden shot straight up into the sky untill it became very small, I never saw anything like it, it got to a certain point and then it did a 45 degree angle and it shot out accross the hills and disappeared.

6/1/61 00:00|Alpine|UT|Disk|45 minutes|This sighting was in the early 1960s when I was 14 and had not heard of ufos yet, but watched it with friends for about 45 minutes.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107641.html|15|ndxe196106| This sighting was in the early 1960s when I was 14 and had not heard of ufos yet, but watched it with friends for about 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 14, I lived in a tiny town in utah and had not heard of ufo&#39;s, although this was not my only experience in that town.  We lived in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains.  The cemetery was a high hill in the center of town (still is), and all of us kids liked to meet up (in summer) after the parents were asleep, on this hill to tell scary stories.  We slept out in our sleeping bags in various friends yards, all summer...then would head up to the cemetery when the coast was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was always various numbers of us, never the same.  This particular night, about 5 or so of us..can&#39;t remember exactly who all was there anymore, were telling stories when one of the kids, pointed to the mountains and said, &#34;what is that&#34;…  We looked, it was against the mountains to the east, large, metallic, and saucer shaped, with colored lights flashing off and on in a circular direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we were afraid and stood up to head for home.  One of the boys said, &#34;They already know we are here, so no point in running.&#34;  We sat back down and continued with our stories.  We were not afraid any more, but still occasionally monitored it.  Eventually, after about 45 minutes or so, someone noticed it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finished our stories and went home.  I don&#39;t remember any of us ever talking about it again.  When I look back on it now...I wonder at how we were so nonchalant about it...and how it was that one of us said...&#34;they know we are here...&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our ages at that time were about 14 to 16.  I was 14 at that time and moved away with my family when I was 16...never saw those kids again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other ufos and other phenomenon in other places over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
