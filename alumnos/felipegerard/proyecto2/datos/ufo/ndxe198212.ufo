12/25/82 19:00|High Point|NC|Light|3 to 4 mins|Object appearing to fly in formation with airliner before radically maneuvering away from it.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87534.html|1|ndxe198212| Object appearing to fly in formation with airliner before radically maneuvering away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just outside (west) of High Point, NC, during Christmas day/evening of 1982 at my Grandparents farm.  My parents and I arrived a day earlier than normal for the holidays due to a death in the family just before Christmas.  The funeral visitation was that evening but I elected to stay at the farm for various reasons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an unusually warm night for this time of the year and that area.  I decided to take a walk across a hill adjacent and above my Grandparents house and walk my uncle’s dog.  I took notice that there were a lot of  jetliners on approach to KGSO airport passing over the farm from South to North before banking right base to runway 5 at GSO after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an avid aircraft/aviation enthusiast, I pretty much was able to identify that there were 737-100/200, 727-100/200, and DC-9 jetliners passing over by the landing configuration of each type as well as there being enough residual light to actually see the bottom of each aircraft clearly.  The sequence of separation of the aircraft ranged approximately 3 to 5 minutes at the height of an arrival push of scheduled flights.  I paid only limited attention to the flights except when they were directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I was facing South seeing the airliners coming at me head on. It was at this point that I saw something extremely unusual occur.  I saw two jetliners approaching out of the South and one passed over with another behind it.  The next one appeared to be a DC-9 with its landing lights set far apart near it’s wing tips.  I took one glance and then lowered my head to pay attention to my uncle’s dog. I then looked back up to see why the jet had not passed over (it appeared closer due to the wider separation of the landing lights) and then realized something was off as the jetliner had not passed yet and it appeared to be moving either very slowly or it was larger than I fight thought (larger than a DC-9? GSO normally didn’t service DC-10’s or larger aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on this jet puzzled why it was so slow to approach when suddenly the right landing light(to the left from my perspective) appeared to drop as if the jet was banking very steeply to the right going into a full roll to inverted flight. My first thought was that this jet was in serious trouble and I was about to witness a crash. But the right &#34;landing light&#34; accelerated completely around until it was below the left light and then suddenly accelerated up at a 45 degree angle and sped away until it disappeared (quickly faded away).  It was then I realized that the left &#34;landing light&#34; was stationary(not rolling or connected to the right light) and that the right side light had actually circled the left light before accelerating up and away(Westward).  I also then realized that the other light was still moving towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  ran quickly towards my uncle and aunt’s house about 120 yards away.  As I reached the house, the other light reached me and that light turned out to! be the nose strut light of a 727.  The aircraft appeared as if there was nothing wrong with it and it continued on towards GSO making no sudden changes in turn rate. direction, or altitude.  I did not see any other similar objects in the area that evening or any subsequent evenings after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Characteristics of the object were that it was the same intensity and color as the lights of the jetliner. and it made no sound.  From my perspective, it appeared to be flying in formation to the right of the jet and appeared to have the same forward speed as the jet prior to the &#34;barrel roll&#34; and 45 degree climb to the West before disappearing.<n>
12/25/82 01:45|Kansas City|MO|Circle|40 min.|It came upon a light,on christmas morn.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20048.html|2|ndxe198212| It came upon a light,on christmas morn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December the 25 at about 1:25 in the morning after coming out of midnight mass, my  mother and I was driving back home.At first we thought it was the moon, it was like amber glow.But as we were driving we notice that this so-call moon was following us, since we were alone on this street. We also notice that is amber object was coming closer and closer to us. My mother have the nerve the say, go out there and see what is that,I said,&#34;HELL NO&#34;. I told my mother let&#39;s go home,she wanted,to go down the street to the police station and report it. So as we got near the station another man came by too,and question want was in the sky.So by that time there were about six of us looking and pointing in the air. But someone must have call the police, because there was a helicoper in the sky circling around it. And the helicopher stop circling, and stop in mid-air like helicopher do. And a surreal thing happen it went away, did&#39;nt even break the silent. So I told my mother,if she mention this I would deny it, if course she mention it and I deny it. But after all these years it still bother me. Now my mother has pass on, and trying tell sister,and my sons no one believe me.<n>
12/15/82 21:00|Kingsport|TN|Triangle|30 seconds|Triangular craft with multicolored lights|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72997.html|3|ndxe198212| Triangular craft with multicolored lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a humming sound much quieter than a typical small aircraft but loud enough to get my attention.  I turned in the direction of the humming and saw a vehicle rising above trees at a small park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle had 3 large white lights in the front with many colored lights along the wing edges.  The overall shape appeared to be triangular, delta or perhaps a chevron.  The center white light was pointed straight down as the craft was rising but swiveled up to point straight ahead matching the other two white lights when it was just above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once above the trees the craft started to move forward on a path that took it in my general direction.  At this point the three white lights went out and only the multi-colored lights on the wing edges remained on.  The craft accelerated while gaining altitude and moved out of my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was bobing up and down, making no noies, then moved over to a large building and was hovering above it for a few minutes, it then moved over to a nearby wooded area and was hovering in the woods for a few minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/10/82 22:00|Boone (west of)|NC|Chevron|00:20|I saw what appeared to be a large boomerang shaped craft with pale blue lights along the leading edge.|2/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42105.html|6|ndxe198212| I saw what appeared to be a large boomerang shaped craft with pale blue lights along the leading edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving east toward Boone, NC, along US Hwy 421, which is in the NE corner of the state, at approximately 10 - 10:30 PM, about the middle of December, of 1982.  It was a cold &amp; crisp evening with no clouds, and was a beautiful starry night.  I was looking out my side window toward the nearby mountains which the road paralleled, when something above caught my eye.  There was not any other traffic on the road at this time.  Slowing down somewhat to try &amp; get a better look at what I had thought I had seen, I rolled the window down &amp; looked out &amp; up.  At this time I saw a bunch of pale blue lights in formation overhead moving slowly toward the northeast.  I pulled off the side of the road &amp; got out of my vehicle.  Overhead, at what I guessed to be maybe 1000 - 1200 feet above, I could just barely make out the shape of a large dark boomerang and the pale blue lights were evenly spaced along the leading edge.  The lights did not waver and were constant.  I could easily see the stars behind the object blotted out as the shape passed in front of them.  Shortly after pulling over, another vehicle came along heading in the same direction as I had been.  My lights were still on, &amp; I assume they must have thought I had a vehicle problem, as they slowed down &amp; pulled over a short distance behind me.  They saw me standing by the side of the road peeering up, &amp; they also got out to see what I was looking at.  There were 2 or 3 people in the other car.  I never did get their names, but pointed out to them what I was seeing.  They saw it as well.  The shape seemed to be moving quite slowly across the sky.  There was no sound at all.  I assumed the altitude of the shape above, as I had nothing to gauge the distance by, it being dark.  But looking at the object &amp; holding my arms extended upward &amp; pointing to either side of the boomerang itself, my hands were approximately 3 1/2 feet apart.  This is the only way I can judge how big the shape was, other than that the shape was about the same size as the B-52 bombers, which used to do fly overs on a regular basis over the area during the early days of the Vietnam War, in training missions.  These bombers used to fly at about 1000 - 1200 feet, close enough to the ground that you could see the windows along the side, &amp; could easily make out the markings on the wings.  I watched this object as it slowly passed overhead, until I could see it no longer.  I don&#39;t think it was any kind or type of conventional aircraft, due to the fact that it made no sound whatsoever, &amp; it seemed to be moving too slowly for its size.  I have never seen anything like this before or after this one night, but I will certainly never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

12/1/82 22:00|Nyack (near; I-80)|CA|Cigar|12 minutes|Nyack CA in Dec. 1982, cigar shape, lasting about twelve minutes|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61143.html|8|ndxe198212| Nyack CA in Dec. 1982, cigar shape, lasting about twelve minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in California, on Highway 80 heading southwest just passing the glider airport (I think that’s Nyack-Blue Canyon but if not it’s the one to the east [left] with a wind farm to the west [right]).  It was the early Eighty’s, possibly November or December of 1982 or 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed what I at first took to be a blimp crossing the interstate from west to east.  I noticed it because from my scientific, weather, history, Navy, research and other experience I knew that it was very dangerous for a blimp to be that close to the earth so near a ridgeline so commonly windy, and I wondered if it was in trouble.  As I got closer I realized that it did not have a gondola, then that it was closer to a cigar-shape than the usual teardrop-shape, then that it had what appeared to be windows along the side midline, continuous and extending around the nose and tail as far as I could see (which I verified as I passed).  I saw movement behind the windows (which seemed translucent rather than clear, like looking through sand-blasted glass) that was purposeful, not random, rhythmical or cyclic.  I pulled over and stopped.  There was no sound coming from the vehicle, particularly not the propeller and/or engine sound I associate with blimps.  It continued east at about twenty mph. following the land contours until it rose and disappeared over the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light from the windows was a sandy yellow and was the only light coming from the object.  There were no navigational lights of any kind.  The color of the surface gave the immediate impression of a silvery gray but upon closer examination it was actually metallic silver with some sort of mottled or textured surface.  Given that at that time my eyes were 20/5 and able to see in dim light even better that in bright light, the elements of that texturing had to be less than ½ inch.  I pulled out my compass and did a little trigonometry.  I figured out that it was between 70 and 85 feet long, and between 25 and 35 feet in diameter and that it was maintaining an altitude of approximately 200 to 250 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

12/1/82 02:00|Madill|OK|Fireball|30 minutes|Hwy 99, Madill Oklahoma toward Hwy 377 toward Texas state line|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68326.html|9|ndxe198212| Hwy 99, Madill Oklahoma toward Hwy 377 toward Texas state line<n> <n><n> <n><n> In December of 1982 right after Christmas, I was traveling in my car with my cousin in her car behind me. It was about 2:00AM. We left Tishomingo, Oklahoma and went thru Madill, Oklahoma toward Hwy 377 in Texas to go home from visiting family for the holidays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had left Madill and were on Hwy 99 just west of Madill.  The road has very low rises, gentle slopes it is not flat.  I was the lead car. What I saw ahead of me on Hwy 99 was a huge reddish orange fireball which made me think there was a bad accident ahead.  My perception was as I topped the little slope I could see the fireball, then as I went down the lower part of the road it could not be seen.  This went on for about 5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, realizing I was driving erratically, I pulled over to explain to my cousin to be careful, as I did not want us to drive into an ongoing accident scene.  She said she could not see anything unusual whatsoever.  It was unnerving to know it was just me seeing this.  This light completely covered the width of the road and was about the size of the sun at sunset, yet my cousin could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept on driving slow (thinking I need to be prepared to stop) and never ever came up on the accident.  Finally the light was not seen any more, we had crossed the bridge into Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, we talk about that strange night and she still declares that although she believes me that I saw something, she never saw anything.<n>
