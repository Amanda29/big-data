It is a somewhat rural subdivision outside of down-town Williams Lake.  Our house was located at the base of a large ridge that put us in early shade when the sun gets low on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The house was heated electrically, but we augmented this by burning wood in a big wood stove during the winter.  My dad and I would go hunting on the weekends and usually we would come home with a load of wood for the stove.  One of my chores during the week was to split and stack this wood.  I would sometimes tackle this chore right after school, but more often, it wasn’t until after dinner when I would find the appropriate motivation required to get started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one very typical evening splitting wood when I saw something that to this day, I cannot explain.  It wasn’t so much what it looked like, but rather what it did that has me perplexed.  I am without an explanation and 30 something yrs later, still wondering what that was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this one particular day, things started out no differently.  I had finished up dinner and had gone outside to put a dent in the huge pile of Douglas Fir rounds that had been brought home the previous weekend.  As far as chores go, splitting and stacking wood can be fairly monotonous.  I often took the opportunity to take short little breaks during the couple of hours I would spend swinging the heavy splitting maul.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During these breaks I would do things like asses the pile that I had split; ponder how much was left to do; maybe throw a stick for the dog a few times.  Several times during the previous weeks, I had taken the time to notice the passing of a commercial jet liner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The passing of this jet had become somewhat predictable.  At approximately the same time on certain days, it would pass directly over our house traveling roughly north to south.  Presumably, it was travelling from Prince George to Vancouver, but I can’t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there I was, splitting wood and right on queue came the jet.  Upon hearing the distant roar of jet engine engines, I took the opportunity to take a quick break and watched the passing plane for several seconds.  I remember that it was shinning fairly brightly in the sunlight.  From where I was located, the sun had set behind the ridge.  I was, as was all of South Lakeside, in the shadow of the ridge and it was turning to twilight.  The plane however was high enough that it was still in full sunlight.  It shone brightly and was easy to see.  It was leaving a long thin vapour trail that was marking the progress across the sky.  The vapour trail wasn’t lasting very long that day and had evaporated into nothing shortly after the plane had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet had disappeared over the horizon and the vapour trail had faded into oblivion, so I went back to splitting and stacking wood.  After working for what seemed to be about 10-15 minutes, I took another short break.  I don’t know why, or what made me do it, but I looked up toward the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I glanced up, a movement caught my eye.  I noticed that an object was moving across the sky in a straight and constant trajectory originating from the east.  I say “object” because it immediately struck me as odd.  It didn’t look right.  It was something I didn’t recognize.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was shining brightly in the sky, not like a light, but more so like a metallic object reflecting sunlight.  It wasn’t pulsing, or blinking, or flashing.  It reminded me a bit of a satellite in space.  You know..... those pinpoints of reflected sunlight that transect the sky at night, but this was different.  It was much, much larger than any satellite I ever saw.  It was too early in the day and not dark enough to see satellites anyway.  It also looked to be bigger even than the jet that passed by earlier. It was moving far faster than a satellite usually moves across the night sky, and also faster than a jet liner would travel.  It looked to be very high in the atmosphere and I couldn’t discern any specific shape to it.  There was no vapour trail or any jet engine noise at all.  It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It captured my full attention as I couldn’t identify it.  I quickly thought in my mind all the possible things that I thought it could be.  A plane, a satellite, a meteor, a weather balloon, but nothing seemed to match what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutely transfixed and focussed on this object and as I intently watched, it did something I can’t explain.  At the point roughly were the object intersected the path of the jet liner, it changed its direction of travel.  I say roughly because the vapour trail from the jet had long since completely dissipated.  I am not even sure it was at the same elevation as the jet was at, but it did turn from a heading of roughly west and onto what seemed to be the same south heading of the jet.  It looked like it had changed course to follow the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The manner in which it changed direction however is not possible.  It made a 90 degree turn at full speed.  There was no banking, no slowing down first, no gentle curves involved.  It was a harsh and exact 90 degree change of course.  It was heading west, and then it was heading south, faster than a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can use a hockey analogy to help describe what I saw.  If you have ever watched a game of hockey, you will have no doubt witnessed the “One Timer” slap shot.  This is where a player passes the puck across the ice to another player who, without stopping the puck, and with a fair bit of skill and timing, hits the puck very fast towards the net with his stick.  That change in direction of the puck is akin to the change in direction of the object I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is not all.  The object then started to accelerate.  From the point that it changed direction, it started to increase its speed, and I mean fast.  It didn’t become a blur, it was faster than that.  Shortly after the change in direction, it accelerated to the point where it disappeared completely, almost like it had achieved the speed of light.  It was gone.  The whole incident lasted a minute, maybe two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, while waiting at the bus stop, I met my friend.  He immediately asked if I had seen an object in the sky the night before.  I said I had and as we excitedly exchanged accounts of what we saw, it became clear that we both had witnessed the very same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw that object again and to this day, I have never witnessed anything like that thing in the sky.  What I saw was impossible, even with today’s technology.   Objects in motion simply cannot maneuver in the manner that I observed.  What on earth was that?  I don’t believe in “beings from another planet” visiting earth.  It doesn’t make sense to me.  The universe is huge, how could they even find us?  Why would they want too?  If they had developed interstellar space travel, which is a stretch to think that it is even possible, wouldn’t there be better places to go?  Most of all...why would they go to Williams Lake and follow a plane?  There must be a rational explanation to what I saw, but what is it?  I am still looking for an explanation..... anything to help me understand what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/77 21:00|Heber|AZ|Triangle|10 seconds|Witnessed an enormous black triangle with lights traveling overhead, at a very low altitude at night in a remote area.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27139.html|2|ndxe197709| Witnessed an enormous black triangle with lights traveling overhead, at a very low altitude at night in a remote area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were visiting a friend who lived in a remote area about 1 mile East of Highway 260 between Heber and Show Low, (closer to Heber).  We were standing outside enjoying the stars and interesting conversation when a large craft crossed almost directly overhead.  The tall Ponderosa pine trees did little to obscure it.  Triangular, it had slowly flashing lights red or white at the corners.  From the faint illumination of the lights and some starlight, the shape was very clear, the color was black or flat black.  There was a faint sound that to me was a very slowly turning (idling) turbine engine like a jet sitting still or an APU on a commercial jet.  Distinct, but quiet.  It almost seemed ordinary.  Almost a perfect triangle, with more or less FAA regulation lights traveling at an impossibly slow airspeed.  We all looked up and after 2 or 3 seconds my friend and my brother continued the conversation.  I was in awe.  Impossible to gauge the distance - 300 ft above us or 1500 feet, no visual clues - it was massive.  It was crawling, almost silent, yet almost ordinary looking because there was nothing dramatic about it.  I kept watching it until it was hidden by the ridgeline about 200 yards behind the house.  No matter how high it was, if it was 1500 feet above us  it had to be proportionally bigger than it appeared if it was actually only 300 feet overhead.  Nothing that massive that relies on aerodynamic lift or thrust could stay airborne moving that silently or that slowly.  It was like watching a sightseeing bus coast past a scenic spot at  5mph.  But buses don&#39;t rely on lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is not terrificaly interested in technical phenomena but he&#39;s intelligent.  My friend is a licensed Master electrican and licensed in HVAC, is very intelligent and served in Vietnam.  I worked as a mechanic and worked 2 years as an aerospace machinist before I earned my computer degree from ASU.  I&#39;ve been a programmer for 2 decades, served in the Air Force and the Army, did a tour in Vietnam and am fairly familiar with aircraft.  What I saw defied the law of physics as I understand them.  25 years later the impression/memory is just as strong.  A big part of the reason for this was that, at the time, my brother and my friend did not react at all to what we had seen which astounded me.  I had just seen something impossible and apparently it hadn&#39;t registerd with 2 intelligent, informed individuals who I knew well.  It&#39;s hard to say which part of this event affected me more.  What I had seen, or their lack of response.  To this day, I don&#39;t understand what happened.  In retrospect, it almost seems like the muffled &#34;turbine engine sound&#34; and the &#34;legal&#34; appearing lights were &#34;camaflouge&#34;.  Admittedly this is pure conjecture, but I repeat, nothing that massive can move that slowly and stay airborne.   Interestingly, I looked at your website for the first time today and saw a report about Childs, AZ.  My friend used to tell me about &#34;lights&#34; seen in the sky around the power station at Childs.  But a year later I met someone whose uncle was in the military and claimed that prototype Cruise missles were extensively tested in Northern Arizona, and particularly in locations like the Verde Valley where Childs is located.  I now this episode doesn&#39;t sound impressive but what I saw is burned in my memory and defies logic.  I can still vividly remember this huge black triangle &#34;floating&#34; over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for publishing my 9/77 sighting in Heber, Arizona.  I looked today to see if you &#34;printed&#34; it and then browsed the New Mexico reports because my wife and I plan to move there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really impressed by someone&#39;s sighting on 1/3/94 west of Albuquerque on I-40.  She saw a &#34;huge&#34;  &#34;silent&#34; &#34;slow&#34; &#34;black&#34;  &#34;triangular&#34; &#34;craft&#34;  with lights at a very low altitude.  She couldn&#39;t explain her reaction/response or her husband&#39;s.  I don&#39;t feel like the Lone Ranger anymore.  How similar, even though 17 years and 100 miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure you see this kind of commonality in reports all the time, but it sure impressed me.  No one has given any real credence to my &#34;sighting&#34; so I never talk about it.   I&#39;ve been pretty much a skeptic in spite of what I saw.  I&#39;ve reactivated my email at ((e-address deleted)) since I submitted my report, but I really don&#39;t have anything to add.  My brother probably only vaguely remembers the event.  I brought up the subject a few years after it happened and he didn&#39;t remember it as being significant and I don&#39;t know where my friend moved to.  He was in a branch of Army Intelligence when he was in the Army which makes it all the stranger that he had no reaction to what we saw.  Your guess is as good as mine, but it sure was neat watching this monster cruise overhead like it was in slow motion. I feel sort of privileged or lucky, This obviously isn&#39;t a report but I appreciate your dedication to this topic and thought you might like a little feedback, so to speak, the similarities I saw between my sighting and the one in NM.  I&#39;m becoming a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you care to email me, could you give me a hint as to why you think  &#34;they&#34; don&#39;t formally contact us and just tease/study us, instead?  My theory is it&#39;s because we&#39;re such crude homicidal, genocidal morons.  It&#39;s too soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

We were on the &#34;Upper Field&#34; of our prep school where there were no outside lights. The night sky was bright (good moon out). The craft was triangular. the two sids came to a point in front. There appeared to be two rows of either lights or windows on each side, about ten in all on each side. The back had a series of lights which moved from the outer edge to the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I recall correctly, there were some kind of lighting systems on the under side as well. I don&#39;t recall any sound that the craft made, I believe it was silent. It flew in a N/NW direction. There is no way to determine its speed or altitude given there was nothing to match it against. Once it was close to overhead, it changed direction and moved West. We lost sight of it when it passed the back side of Mt. Monadnock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that this is of interest. Currently, I work for a bioteck company in Greenwich CT. I have a MA from Boston University. My classmates who were with me are all professionals (two other boys and three girls, yes, you can guess why we were on the Upper Field). Even with the opposite sex distractions, we all became immensly intreagued with the craft. We thought it was some sort of experimental aircraft; however, Pease Air Force Base was quite a distance away, and our aircraft in the late 70&#39;s didn&#39;t look much like this. The new B2 Bomber, though somewhat triangular is also a different shape that this craft. Nothing I have ever seen in our inventory of aircraft match what we saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

It was in the fall; as best I remember it was 1976 or possibly 1977.  I won&#39;t go into the details of how I arrived at that date - I do not actually remember the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gone to my parent&#39;s home to pick up my son - he rode the school bus and stayed at their house until I got off from work.  They needed a few items from the grocery store (about a mile and a half from their house) and I volunteered to go get them.  My son was with me.  As we drove down the road, I saw two  ojects in the sky.  They were flying at tree-top level. They made no sound. They were silvery in color.  The looked like two saucers laid rim to rim.  They had red, white and green lights. The white lights were around the middle - windows were also visible around the middle.  I stopped the car - flashed my headlights - and watched them. Nothing happened.  I continued on my way to the store.  I asked the cashier at the store if she saw the UFO&#39;s and she looked at me as if I had two heads (or no brain) and has yet to answer,  I decided at that time not to pursue it any further. I could see no movement inside the closest craft; although it seemed as if I could see in the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day an article was in the Knoxville News-Sentinel relating a similar sighting in a nearby county by two police officers.  They described the lights as patriotic - red, white and blue.  I did tell my parents of the sighting. My mother scoffed.  My father stated he saw them all the time in the back yard in the evening when he was feeding the animals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago, I remembered that after I flashed my headlights (which I had to turn on to do so), and continued down the road that I had to turn on my headlights as it was now getting dark.  I don&#39;t know if any time was lost - my parents didn&#39;t say anything about being gone a great length of time.  They are both now deceased so it will be impossible to get that input.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son says he still remembers the UFO&#39;s - he was about 8 years old at the time - he will be 39 this August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was hunting with a group of friends outside of Beatty, Oregon, but what I saw did not happen over the city of Beatty.  It was a around 12:00 and two of my friends and myself were hunting in the Gearhart Mountains in Eastern Oregon.  It was late and we took my Ford Pickup out to spotlight (young kids). I had a rather bright light mounted atop my truck and we came to a clearing at the edge of the road that overlooked the basin below.  This is a remote area and there were no homes, lights, anything out there but desert at that time.  As we approached the overlook I noticed a bright light in the sky and it was traveling laterally.  We became rather nervous because this light resembled an airplane and we did not want to get in trouble for illegally hunting deer at night so I killed the headlights and turned the truck motor off.  We all got out of the truck and watched this light and as we watched the light very quickly turned a 90 degree right toward us then it stopped.  The light became very bright and we watched it for around 8 minus, could have been less.  No airplane does a perfect 90 degree turn on the fly and stops on the dime in mid air.  Finally, the object just took off very fast and disappeared.  It was gone.  It just flew or whatever directly away from us and we watched and it was gone.  We thought it best to leave so the three of us quickly got back into the truck and headed back to camp.  Here is the weird part.  The light was pacing us in a parallel fashion as we were driving the mountain roads.  We literally watched out the right side window and this damn light was flying seemed to be following us.  Never did the light come close enough for us so that we could get a good visual on this thing.  But at the point when we first spotted the light it did seem to be flying at a very high altitude.  I believe that at or around that time frame dead cattle were being found in Eastern Oregon.  That’s it.......…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We have assigned an artificial date in order to cause the report to sort to the late 1970&#39;s.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to get more info for you on this siting.It was reported in the Verde Independent newspaper in Cottonwood,Az.,but they do not have the info in microfilm form and I started paging through the individual days circa 1976 and gave up.Too slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a particular night,a craft hovered above the Childs hydroelectric plant run by APS (Arizona Public Service).This plant was built around the trun of the century to supply half the electricity for Phoenix.It uses a famous spring source ten miles away that is piped to the vicinity and dropped through a long drop to power hydro turbines.A small group of houses surround the site.Three or four engineers and their families live here and operate the plant.The nearest town is Camp Verde,approx.25 miles of dirt road away.It is literally in the middle of nowhere.A famous hot spring is directly across from the plant on the other side of the Verde river.The date of the event was 1976-1979.I did not keep the article,but it was big local news,on the front page I believe.It hardly hit the papers in Phoenix.Two facts lend corroboration: the people who reported it and were interviewed were employees of the very conservative public utility APS.Just reporting the event could have caused these folks a lot of grief,possibly their jobs.Secondly,on a drive out to this area about a month later,I stopped to help a lady change her truck&#39;s flat tire on this remote road and she was the wife of one of the engineers.This lady had a typical western accent and beehive hairdo.Not a hippie at all.While helping her I asked where she was going and she said that she lived at Childs.I then asked her if she knew the employees that saw the craft hover above the plant.She said that she was one of them and that they not only saw it,they met the aliens personally.It&#39;s hard to discount someone like this,in my mind,unless they wanted to create attention and lose jobs.Not likely.Their report was that the craft hovered above the plant and sucked energy from it,causing the power dials to drop and create a very noticeable change in electric transmission,something they would have to report to APS of course.I am not sure of the time and duration,but the lady told me that she they did not want to cause to much trouble or get too much attention,so they! did not tell the news that in addition to this experience,they not only saw them but met them as well.I did not want to pry and forgot to ask what they dressed like or how they communicated(English?).I did ask what the aliens were like,and she replied,&#34;THEY WERE JUST LIKE HUMANS ONLY THEY WERE VERY NICE,VERY PEACEFUL&#34; or something to that effect.It has been almost twenty-five years since then,but I have always thought about it.Last year I went to the Verde Independent and started paging through 1977,1978 and gave up.It took hours and page-by-page in those large bound volumes was difficult.As much I seem to remember that it was on the front page,it might have been on a subsequent page.I would like to know more and help if possible.I think that APS must have an archive department and could search as well.Perhaps the employees could be located and re-interviewed.The triangular craft sightings last year or so in Az. that was recently covered on FOX news on T.V. mentioned the many sightings of it culminating in F16 fighters going up to check it out over Phoenix.The show said that the sightings began in the Prescott area.Actually I have heard of friends who were out by the Hot Springs that night and saw them in that sky.The Hot Springs and Childs are about the same distance north of Phx. as is Prescott,only about 35 miles further east.<n>

Six amber colored lights were visible.  The craft flew north until overhead, then turned west and headed toward the military test range.  At first, I thought it was a formation of jets, but the precise turn and lack of engine noises, proved otherwise; there was no sign of engine glow (after burners, etc.), only the six amber lights.  Once the object was overhead, I could tell it was a single craft.  I watched it turn, without banking, and immediately head west, until it went over the mountains.  It is difficult to determine the size of the craft, but based on the speed and position in the sky, I would estimate it to be 300&#39; on each size.  Since I was in an isolated area, I was able to hear the slightest noise, but none was created by the craft.  My viewing time was approximately three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Big empty sky. I was driving our motorhome westbound and the sun was behind us. It could possibly have been a bit before one PM. I noticed a cigar shape in the southern sky going north. It was at 10 O&#39;clock and very distant. It caught my eye as it was extremely far away as big as a city moving in a straight line without any contrail. It would seem it was above our stratisphere. My husband had worked on the space program and was aware of more possibilities than I, as to the distance and size. We were estimating by going against the flat surface of earth, distant mountains and such. I pulled off the highway as quickly as I could and we, including our four children, watched it cross the sky. It was amazing. To get an idea of its size to our eye, it was the length of the breath of my fingernail and as thick as my short nail, a grain of rice!!! In a clear sky moving as fast as it was, was a UFO as nothing made by us could achieve the speed in which this moved at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared to be a saucer shape almost on edge. It looked mostly whitish with some darker grey or black coloration on its underside.  The object was either motionless or moved at a very slow speed this being difficult to tell as the low clouds were moving.  The object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had sharp easily definable edges and was perhaps less than a mile from me.  After about 5 minutes it rose into the clouds.  I saw nothing more of it.<n>

I was in back left seat. While standing outside I noticed a dead silence and calm. I looked up to the north at some stars and as I looked to the east it seemed like there might be a cloud blocking all the starlight but then as I stood very still and looked right at the dark spot I noticed the blackness was in a very well defined wedge-like triangle. I told the other three to look at it and we all three tried to figure out the total absence of light in that one spot. After about two minutes we noticed that our chests/abdomens had a kind of low frequency vibration that kinda felt like it took our breath. A light from the front came on very dim then grew incredibly bright. It then seemed like you could see a front portal with some lights inside. From it&#39;s hover position that had not changed at all the shape started to move north very slowly. T! he light, like a trillion candlepower headlight kept growing brighter as the shape sped up to a fast crawl. After about 1/2 to 1 minute the shape was now moving north and slightly up it seemed and was going about 25 miles per hour which seemed like nothing since it looked to be about 90 feet from side to side and about 120 feet long. It kept speeding up to the north and we jumped in the car to follow until we got to Grand View country school and we could see a light out the rear of the craft after it had banked 90 degrees to the east and headed toward Tulsa at an unbelievable speed. It seemed to climb to the upper atmosphere and traveled in an absolutely straight line. We decided not to discuss this with anyone because we knew we would be ridiculed and we never really brought it up with each other. It was a clear night and it seems likek the moon was nearly at new stage because most of the light was from stars. The craft was such a flat black that it&#39;s only shape was the la! ck of stars. The air was crisp and clear and the absence of st! ars behi nd the craft made a very well defined shape. The low frequency reverberation inside my chest was the most noticeable effect of the event. The light that came on at the front almost seemed like a regular Q Beam that was powered by a massive energy source but it did keep an almost laser-like tightness. At about one mile the beam was about as wide as the craft. There was absolutely no noise at all from the craft at any point. The low frequency hum was felt and not heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on our &#34;Upper Field&#34; with five friends when the event took place. I was not the first to notice the object. At this time I don&#39;t recall who actually saw it first; however, what I saw was basically triangular or &#34;an arrow&#34; in shape. It was heading in a Northerly direction. It had a series of lights on both sides (window shaped?)in two rows, over and under. They were somewhat rectangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it passed over (not directly over) I noticed the back had what appeared to be a series of lights moving towards the center from the outer ends. This was continuous. The underside (if memory serves) had I believe three lights. equally spaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also recall that it made no audible sound. At least non that we or I could hear. At first we thought it was some kind of a plane; however, once it got closer it became obvious that it was no plane that any of us had ever seen. We were also no where near an Air Force Base. The closest was Pease which was about a two hour drive east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that this is of interest. I never gave it mush thought after that until recently. I read a few articles on the internet and it reminded me of the occurance. All the best.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate in 1977))<n>

I noticed a white light coming over the visual horizon and heading in my direction.  It took approximately 1 or 2 minutes for the craft to come into closer view and stopped over our complex.  It was shaped like a &#34;top&#34; and had spot lights around the entire circumference of the craft.  The lights were like spot-lights and fanned the ground.  It sounded like a turbine engine and rumbled the building.  My brother was next to me but not at the window.  He heard the sound, but when prompted to come look, he refused and waiting to long before attempting to look and missed it.  I went down to my mom and told her what I seen.  She said she heard it but it was a jet.  She didn&#39;t believe me and neither did my brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning, I discussed the event with a neighbor friend who also verified him and his parents seen the same thing.  Humoring me, my mom called the airforce and asked if anyone else had reported anything.  They said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granted, I was young and only in 3rd grade.  But as a boy, I know what a jet looks like.  I know what a helicopter looks like.  This vehicle had no wings and no props. and yet it sounded like a jet.  Besides the only jet that could hover that we were aware of was the harrier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I had just finished a round of golf at Friendly Hills Country Club in Whittier and was headed of the Victoria Station in Covina to meet friends for dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had not been drinking and I do not do drugs and I was a corporate executive in downtown LA at the time.  I entered the Pomona Fwy just east of the 605 Fwy at Hacienda.  I headed east looking to catch the Orange Fwy North to the San Bernardino Fwy.  i noticed as I got on the Fwy what looked like headlights or landing lights for a jet coming in and it seemed low to me.  The traffic started getting slow and I began to notice the lights closer to the fwy and wondered if not a plane going to LAX if could be lights for workmen or perhaps a movie being made, which is common in the LA area.  As I got close somewhere near the Orange Fwy connection what I was observing was a huge object with many lights on the bottom just hovering about 100 feet over the freeway.  The traffic was just crawling and some had pulled over and were our of their cars including The CHP.  I got a good closeup look as I drove directly under it and seemed to be in shock.  i elected not to stop so continied on and noted that a mile or so away off to the southwest in a residential area in Diamond Bar was another similiar strange vehicle hovering over homes on a hill.  I continued to my destination.  I never heard anything on the news or from another person but at that time of day hundreds if not thousands had to have seen what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Portholes, red light, ion-blue glow on bottom. Craft accellerated into beam of rainbow colored light after interceptor jets from Olmstead Airbase gave chase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home from work, we passed under PA turnpike on Middletown Rd heading south. I saw a red light on an object in sky on left (east) side approx 15 degrees elevation. I am a private pilot, so I knew the object was not a plane or helicopter. To get a better view, thinking it might be a saucer, I pulled the car over and shut off the engine and lights. I rolled down the window and observed a saucer shaped craft. Once I knew what it was, I got out of the car to get better view of object. The saucer hovered motionless above the trees and over the Swatara Creek. The saucer had cupola on top. There were portholes emitting a bright yellowish glow that bathed the top of the saucer. The bottom of saucer had an ion-blue glow.  I observed solid red light (no other lights) on top - very bright, casting a red glow over top of cupola. I looked for silhouettes in windows but observed none. Craft was as big as thumb held at arms length, maybe 1/2 mile distant.  Est size of the saucer was 30&#39; in dia. Sky was overcast. Clg was 1500&#39; or more. Visibility was two miles or better.  Temperature was approximately 55 degrees.  I remember it was damp.  The sun had set and the sky was almost dark. The saucer was positioned 1/4 mile from my residence. I was a little scared but elated, too, because I knew that this was a really rare event.  I wondered what would happen if I waved.  Would it move?  So, I mustered my courage and waved at the saucer and sent a mental message out, &#34;Peace be with you!&#34; but there was no response. My wife said she was too cold and told me to shut car door.  I asked her if she would get out and look at the saucer. She didn&#39;t believe me and said it was just a helicopter. While we argued about that, I heard a roar of jet engines/afterburners from Olmstead AFB across the Susquehana River. When I heard the sound, I saw the saucer dart from my 10 o&#39;clock to 11 o&#39;clock instantly. There was a yellow flicker in the sky from the west as the jets got closer. After two seconds, the saucer darted back to the same position it was in before, only 250&#39; higher. I thought, is it trying to triangulate the position of the jets or get out of their radar beam? Then, the flickering in the clouds and the afterburner noise got very loud. The west side of my sky started to turn yellow, they were so close above the town of Middletown. The saucer had had enough. It shot up at a 70 deg. angle instantly, leaving a rainbow colored trail behind as it went up through the sky.  The jet&#39;s never descended below the clouds, but turned upwards to chase futily after the saucer.  In a minute, the light and sound had faded. I stood for a few minutes, waiting to see if they would return, but they didn&#39;t. I got back in the car with my wife and drove home.  I decided not to report this incident because I knew that the military was involved in a cover-up and feared reprisal and did not want my life interfered with at that time by the government. Years later, I saw the pictures that George Adamski took of his saucer. That was the same saucer I saw. How could what he saw be a fake if what I saw was as real as the car I was driving home in? The chasing of the craft by the AF jets validated my experience for me.  There were no reports in the local papers anytime thereafter. It would be interesting to try to use FOI Act to obtain information from any records kept by the AF from Olmstead AFB during that time period to see if there were any evening chases of an &#39;unknown.&#39;  I do not, unfortunately, remember the exact date of the event, except that it was a week-day because we were coming home from work. The location of the sighting was a few miles from Three Mile Island.  The famous TMI reactor meltdown occurred there the following year.  Was this a coincidence? I think not. In the last 22 years, I have not seen another UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.<n>

Could move in all directions in darting motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was approximately 10 years old, my mother and I witnessed two objects traveling above us as we were driving on 45th ave. in Everett east toward I-5.  They were above us darting just under the clouds and traveling slightly faster than us.  I remember thinking that their shape was like the paper airplanes I used to make with pointed fronts, like elongated triangles, but they were translucent and the light reflected off them, though they looked like they were projecting cloud-like images on their surface. As we turned north onto I-5, they flew over the freeway, still just under the clouds and east, then turned north also and flew at about our same speed for about 5 minutes.  Then when we were between Everett and Marysville, they shot east toward the mountains at a highly accelerated rate.  It was so fast that it took only maybe 2 seconds for them to disappear from sight.  We never reported it because we had no proof, but after listening to a radio show about the UFO center I was encouraged to give my account.  We really aren&#39;t even sure of the year let alone the time and date.  I just remember that it was not very cold, a partially cloudy, partially sunny day.  Until I called the UFO center, I had never heard of anyone else seeing a UFO during the day.  These two could travel forward, backward, and side to side with the ease of a hummingbird.  My mother and I have talked about it through the years and told others, but never recorded it in writing until now.  The objects didn&#39;t really changed color so much as the patterns they projected seemed to vary as they passed under the clouds so as to blend in.<n>

At first I thought it may have been a mylar balloon, but soon realized that was not so.  It glided gently over the tree tops to my left slowly. I told the neighbor who I was on the phone with, to go outside, and see what I was seeing as it was soon to pass over our street; &#34;Raintree&#34;. She met me outside with our children, her two girls and my son, all young. We all watched as the disc crossed over our street a few blocks away and soon hovered in the air for a few minutes. It was amazing.  Then, slowly, slowly it went straight up. Very slowly, until it looked as small as a star in the day sky, which was bright, brilliant sky blue, with no clouds.  We watched it there for many minutes, and then it went back in the direction it had originally come from . Small as a star at that time. I called the naval air base an! d reported it.  They asked me questions. They agreed I had seen , we had seen a real ufo. It had no seams in the silver looking metal, I could see no windows. It made no sound, and I was not in a position to see a shadow.  That is the truth. The whole truth and not hing but the truth. So, help me God!!!!<n>

9/1/77|Middletown|PA|||This is a  comment about this report.|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08802.html|21|ndxe197709| This is a  comment about this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  Olmstead AFB was closed on June 30, 1968, when it became the Harrisburg International Airport. The Pa Air National Guard continued to operate a few planes but not fighters. 2) The airport was not &#34;across the river&#34;, but small planes used the New Cumberland airport, on the York County side of the river.  Some large-scale maps (Rand McNally Road Atlas of US, Canada, Mexico, 1979 Edition) show 1 airport symbol at New Cumberland, location of old airport.  Maybe this report comes from someone not familiar with area, although the mention of Swatara Creek suggests this is not the case. 3) The object had red top and bluish bottom, suggest astronomical object near horizon in conditions of atmospheric refraction. Sun had set, but sky was overcast. 4)  Details remembered, such as exact air temp &#34;about 55&#34;,  yet nine years off in the date, is a puzzle.  Other details suggest fantasy.  Jets seemed to take time to come from &#34;across river&#34;, yet Olstead is at M&#39;town, jets would be airborne and be there already! The Three Mile Island accident occurred in 1979, two years after 1977, not one year later. 5) Size of object &#34;30 &#39;&#34; is simply an assumption, as is the distance.  Jumping from 10 to 11 oclock could have been autokinetic motion of the eyes. Conclusion: the object may have been astronomical.  The event either happened at least nine years earlier or details were imagined or fabricated. The report was made 20 or 30 years after the event. ((name and address deleted)).<n>
