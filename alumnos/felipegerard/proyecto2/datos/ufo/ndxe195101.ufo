Jaeger, a well-known naturalist and reliable observer, records an unusual event in his field notes:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 20, 1951, at 04.30, he wakes in Palm Springs, California, to see a bluish-white, needle-shaped object in the western sky at about 30 degrees. This is between the constellations Leo and Cancer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he observes the object for the next hour and a half, it develops a head and a tail and goes through various worm-like shapes.  He comments: &#34;I never before heard or saw anything like it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> A writer of books on natural history, Jaeger was a scientist and a reliable observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing a book about him and would very much like to comment on this anomalous event.  The curious thing is that I could find no witnesses, no newspaper accounts, or other record of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May I have your guidance and comment on this?<n>
