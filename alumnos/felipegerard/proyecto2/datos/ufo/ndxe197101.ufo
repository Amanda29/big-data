The craft did not change position relative to the monument for at least 90 secs. The size to my eye was about 1 cm and it was at a position 30 degree south of the top of the monument. I could not believe my eyes. Many people were out and about,I looked to other drivers,but they did not see, I was semiparalized by shock. I looked up again, and after a few more secs the craft moved northeast and disappeared in about 1 sec or the same time it took me to turn my head and see it disappear from my sight.Right about then the light turned green. I have not mentioned this to too many people, just family and maybe four friends, because I feared ridicule. It was a very clear site and I cannot forget it. I do not exactly remember the date or year , but I was in my first years attending the University. One of my sister&#39; s friends was an Italian air force pilot and when I asked about UFOs, he said they saw them often and were instructed to pretend they were not there.He said the UFOs would tease the air force pilots by doing circles around them. He was a very serious guy and he seemed to regret saying that much and never said more about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness holds a professional position.  PD))<n>

1/7/71 22:00|Tewksbury|MA||5 Seconds|Nothing in nature or manmade could have produced this light on the same night as other sightings in the area.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14380.html|4|ndxe197101| Nothing in nature or manmade could have produced this light on the same night as other sightings in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is something I never reported before. There were numurous sighting from Stoneham, MA to southern New Hampshire the same night. I was about 12-13 playing in a sand pit a quarter mile behind my house as my parents were saying goodbye to my brother and his wife in the driveway. There was nothing behind our house at the time but woods for about 4 miles. As we began to walk back, a very intense white light hit us from behind. I remember seeing my shadow directly in front of me, so I knew it was behind me, not above me. It only lasted a couple of seconds. By the time I turned around all I saw was the light going out just above the treeline. There was absolutely no sound at all. We got very scared and ran back home. My parents, brother and wife saw what looked like 50 cars in the woods with thier lights on high beam. This made no sense, since there was only woods for about 4 miles. The next day, we read about the other sightings. We walked out to investigate the next day and found nothing. I realize this doesn&#39;t sound like much, but perhaps it could correlate with another sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Nobody was around at that time when suddenly we saw a water melon shape and slightly greenish kind of light with longtitudnal stripes land onto the merry-go-round about 10 yards away from us. We immediately ran towards it and just as I tried to hold it in my arms it flew away on top of a building nearby. It stayed there for a while moving left to right and right to left. I have never seen anything fly with such a speed that one could lose it with the blink of an eye. It&#39;s diameter matched that of the merry-go-round.<n>

Van stalled beside Winery. One block ahead, hovering over an old schoolhouse was bright lights - Red and white circling and pulsating green light on the bottom. Van would not restart. Then gradually five more crafts joined the first and they took off into clear sky in V formation. Then just vanished. Van started as soon as they took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1 a.m. as my boyfriend and I were travelling home from the Falls. We were at Chateau Gai Winery and the Ford Econoline Van stalled. I immediately noticed some bright lights about 300 feet in front of us and at first commented &#34;What is a helicopter doing out here at this time of night?&#34; As I focussed more closely (my boyfriend was frantically trying to restart the van that has never stalled prior) I realized that it was disc shaped - some kind of bubble on top with white and red lights swirling around the middle. On the bottom was a pulsing green light. I was in awe and wanted to go closer. The petrified boyfriend wouldn&#39;t allow me to get out of the vehicle (held my arm tight). A moment later another object joined the first, then another, and another until there were five crafts in all hovering above this old school house. They seemed to steady themselves and then propelled into the sky in a V-formation. My boyfriend again tried to start the van - in hopes of following. It ignited immediately. But within seconds of this the crafts just vanished from sight. It was a cloudless sky - clear, crisp night with lots of stars visible. (New Years Eve) Neither of us had taken anything intoxicating (I was 17 and he was 23). Eleven years later I went back to the sight with a sister and neice to see about the crop circle phenomenon. The old school house was replaced with a Community Centre. Behind it was a barbed wire fence that separated the property from the Hydro Power lines (Sir Adam Beck Generating Station). We hopped the fence and were amazed to discover 5 perfect areas, about 20 feet in diameter, where the grass was growing flat on the ground in a circular fashion. It was electric!<n>
