Glided over beach into large cloud. 10 mins later saw it again come from behind us and heading due south toward us again.  Glided over beach, turned east in the blink of an eye, and headed down the beach line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dull dark grey in colour.  No lights. No windows. Pointed at the front but flat at the 2 back ends.  Very skinny with lines across it, like it was made of sectional squares.  No noise.  No wind displacement.  Absolutely huge. 1/4 mile from us and must have been 300ft across at the back.  Speed was about 40mph.<n>

8/31/14 23:15|Eastport|MI|Unknown|2-3 minutes|Two witnesses see steady red light on silent flying object of undetermined size moving south to north over Grand Traverse Bay.|9/5/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113142.html|3|ndxe201408| Two witnesses see steady red light on silent flying object of undetermined size moving south to north over Grand Traverse Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A buddy and I were enjoying a quiet, clear evening on a west facing deck overlooking the east arm of Grand Traverse Bay in the northern lower peninsula of Michigan.  The moon was less than half full and becoming orange as it was settling down on the horizon mostly west but slightly southwest of our position.  The sky overhead was full of stars and the wind was almost calm though slight, variable breezes would occur.  The waves in the bay were moving from north to south.  You could hear a truck off in the distance for several miles and several minutes until it faded away.  We were waiting for it to disappear so that we could witness complete silence with exception to waves and crickets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 23:15, I noticed a red light above the bay coming from south to north (left to right).  It was common for aircraft to fly along the bay but most often it would be a coastguard helicopter or a care flight air ambulance going from Traverse City to Charlevoix or Petoskey at that time of night.  The coast guard helicopter is red and I thought since the light was red it was probably them but I continued to observe expecting to hear the typical sound made by copters and to see a blinking light.  I estimated the craft to be 4 miles south of us and pointed it out to my friend.  When it had traveled another several seconds, I recalled thinking it was traveling the speed I expected a helicopter to move.  Its course was level and unchanging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was about a mile south, I said that it was odd we couldn’t hear it since it was so quiet outside.  This made me think maybe it was a small plane of some type since they are sometimes less noisy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to monitor its unchanging flight and at the point it passed the directly in front of our location I asked my friend, “What is that?  There’s no strobe light and no sound.”  He didn’t have an answer and neither did I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I estimated the object to be about 300 feet above the bay and maybe 5-7 mil! es out ... which is to say ½ of the way to the Leelanua Peninsula or right down the middle of the bay.  The object never seemed to be definable with regard to shape though it was rounder than any other shape since it was just a fairly bright red light and I guess at that distance it seemed rounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I write this recollection it occurs to me that the object may have been a bit closer, since I really couldn’t determine its size and I had no sound to use as a guide.  Nonetheless, the object continued its heading and maintained the same altitude on its northerly flight.  I changed my position on the deck in order to continue my observation until trees obstructed my view.<n>

I notices a red light through the trees flying south to north over Green Lake.  It was very bright in the twilight, and I pointed it out to another person.  We both thought it looked odd but was probably a plane and we assumed that just couldn&#39;t see the rest of it through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, I was alone on the pier when a second fireball, identical to the first, flew overhead on the same south to north path. It was several thousand feet up.  There was no sound.  The red light flickered like a flare but there were no sparks and it was not falling.  It moved steadily north across the lake at about the speed of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter came out and saw it as it headed away and we watched it until it blinked out.<n>

Because of the way it flickered, we imagined it was a candle fed lantern, but as there is little to no wind near the ground and in the upper atmosphere (the clouds are close to stationary), I can&#39;t imagine that a lantern could cover the amount of distance this sphere travelled in the amount of time it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what altitude or the size this object was so that makes it hard to estimate how fast it was moving but even if it were small and even if it was close I would estimate it was moving hundreds of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response.

Suddenly we noticed through the trees behind my building, a red-orange light rise up, over the treeline, and hover.  It hovered for close to 2 minutes.  We speculated that it looked like the flames in a hot air balloon but it was 9 pm, it had been raining and thundering off and on all day, and fireworks had just ended about 15 minutes ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to record it on my cellphone but the light looks white or even yellow-ish on camera.  As we&#39;re watching, the light suddenly makes a sharply-angled turn (almost like an L), and rapidly flies off and then suddenly just disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later, we see a second red-orange light rise up in the same place where the first one did, but this one did not hover.  It made the same sharply-angled turn and also disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before the second light disappeared, the third one rose--again from the same spot-- and made an ev! en sharper-angled turn and disappeared.  The third light was faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, nothing else in the sky during this, although shortly after the third light disappeared, we did see an airplane because we compared it to what we had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And though in my pictures and on my video, the light looks white or even yellow-ish, it was actually a vibrant, VERY bright red=orange.  We wouldn&#39;t have noticed it and watched it otherwise.<n>

We did not have a camera and didn&#39;t have time to get a pic, we were in such aahhh of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a huge fireball rushing through the sky.

While it moved it seemed to tilt back and forth and up and down while wablleing slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fascinated i ran and grabbed my android phone(model#N800virgin mobile)to take a picture and retured within 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had slowed to a stop and was hovering over what ide guess the lake Harriet area.I took a picture and was mesmerized by how strange it was tilting.It seemed to be in motion while hovering like it was spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the picture from my 3rd floor apt about a mile an a half from craft, west of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be emitting a aura or faint light around it.It was slightly fuzzy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds after taking picture, the object made a 90 degree turn at incredible speed into the unusual cloud formation over mpls(close to downtown).  As it flew it gained altitude.  It seemed to know i had taken its picture, but this could be my imagination.  From my apt, its 5.5 miles downtown and this object traveled into the cloud in less than 3-4 seconds.  The cloud was probably 6-7 miles from object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the background (buildings) as a guide or refrence, i could tell it was at about 2-3 thousand ft altitude range during event.Maybe at about 35 degrees.This object had to be massive,as large as commercial airliner or larger(300+ft)After watching planes at about the same distance,i could tell it was quite large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should have taken more pictures but didn&#39;t get the chance.After blowing up my picture for a better detailed view, it seemed to have a blue outer layer around the perimeter of object.It also seems to have a antenna like apparatus.  The air around craft seemed distorted.  And if you look very closely it seemed to have dome on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m x-military,and can tell you without a doubt that this object isn&#39;t a plane,helicopter,or drone.It gave off no emission, or fuel trail, and made no noise.And the object showed intelligence with maneuvers.  The craft itself seemed alive and not mechanical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud it flew into was odd in itself,and had a circular formation and was massive.  Mother ship?  The object never reappeared,  and the storm clouds rolled in after a short time.<n>

To my knowledge there is nothing up there that would cause a reflection like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After turning a corner and getting back in sight of peak again, object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a clear view of that peak from my patio and have never seen that light before, so I do believe it was something other than a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it wasn&#39;t moving, so unlikely to have been a plane&#39;s landing light.<n>

There was three distinctive lights horizontally in the sky.  At first I thought that they must be stars doing what they do best, even though it was very light outside.  I then decided that these pulsating lights were much to bright to be stars when all of a sudden the one on the far right spit out a orange/peach colored light that hastily went off to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching that happen I went inside telling myself that I was nuts.  I don&#39;t know how long the lights stayed around for, because frankly putting it,  It scared me!  I don&#39;t ufo hunt/watch or whatever and have never been on this website before.

We were just listening to some music and eating food at one of the parking areas at the top of the pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We begin to look at the sky and take in the sights.  I notice one normal luminosity point of light that looked like it was a satellite orbiting Earth, but then it began to move in a curved manner not consistent with orbiting satellites.  The object appeared to get significantly brighter at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t quite believe what I was seeing, but also couldn&#39;t get the words out to my friend to ask if she was seeing the same thing.  Luckily, I didn&#39;t have to.  I heard her exclaim, &#34;Is that getting brighter?&#34; and then I knew I wasn&#39;t imagining it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness increase put it above every other star in the sky, even more luminous than a full moon, but the apparent physical size was smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then decreased in luminosity, before fo! llowing another odd curved path and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened again almost immediately afterward in the same way, in the same spot.<n>

When it neared some thin clouds it seemed to fade to nothing, as if it were going through the cloud.  This light appeared and disappeared alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second two lights were the same color/shape/brightness as the first, but followed each other across the sky and appeared shortly after the first faded out.  They stayed about the same distance apart and traveled in the same straight line, also fading to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a short break between when the first light and the second two were witnessed, approximately 10-15 seconds.  These lights made no sound, moved in a straight line, appeared and disappeared in roughly the same spot in the sky, and traveled at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen plenty of airplanes/helicopters in the night sky and I can say with certainty that this was something different, as I have never seen anything like this before.

However, we both stopped to watch this object and pondered what it could be. For several minutes it continued to shine brightly, stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But suddenly it quickly began to move, within 15 seconds it “zoomed” North, disappearing into a faint glimmer in the night sky.

The object comes to a halt, pauses all movement for at least 20-30 seconds and changes direction exact opposite of its heading, still clearly rotating and displaying an array of colors from white, blue, red and orange.

8/30/14 23:30|Bigfork|MT|Circle|45 minutes|Big balls of light in the sky darting around.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113587.html|36|ndxe201408| Big balls of light in the sky darting around<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, about 2 weeks ago, my husband and I went outside to let our dogs out.  It was probably 11:30pm.  We noticed these weird balls of light in the sky.  There was a light cloud cover and you could tell they were above the clouds.  At first, not knowing what we were seeing we thought maybe it was northern lights, but we were seeing weird balls of light zooming around because of the clouds??  So we got in our car and decided to drive down to a clearing, because we live in the woods, and see if we could see it better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we drove about 2 miles down the road and parked at the clearing.  The lights were gone, and it was dead silent.  All of the sudden the lights appeared in front of our eyes and started moving around.  Sometimes they would blink, and sometimes seemed to move in a pattern together.  We thought someone was messing with us.  We could not believe what we were seeing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the sudden.. one by one.. the balls formed into one big ball!. It sort of pulsed and just sat there in the sky for about 20 seconds. Then one by one the balls came out of the clouds and went down into the woods! NO JOKE!!! You could see a light beam coming down with each one of them, until they all went down into the woods, probably a quarter mile from our car.  I jumped in my car because I was terrified!  And sat there for a few seconds, then jumped back out and stood there and stared.  The whole time you couldn’t hear anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one by one the balls shot out of the woods back into the sky and sort of disa! ppeared.  I was so scared, and my husband was also, that we got in our car and started speeding home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn’t believe what we saw.  On the way home they reappeared and almost followed us.  We got home, couldn’t see them, again everything was so still outside.  We went in, confused, and let the dogs back out.  They appeared again almost above our house. These lights, 5 of them, shooting around in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took the dogs back in and went back out and just watched them.  They moved fast, sometimes together in weird ways, and blinked at times.  Finally I went in and came back out and they were gone. I have done tons of research and I see no natural ocurance that could explain this. There wasn’t any lightning that night.  What was weird also is that all the dogs out here in the woods were barking. You would hear them way off in the distance.  It was all just strange and mind boggling.  I did believe in UFO’s before this happened, but never in a million years did I expect to see something so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I told the story to a few people, and then today, one of my friends I told messaged me and said there was a guy in the Kalispell, MT, yard sale, saying he had also saw something strange and was wondering if anyone else had seen anything weird in the sky. I’m tying to contact the guy now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw sounds completely unbelievable.  I don’t expect anyone to believe me!  I’d be willing to take a lie detector test on this!  It was no joke and my husband and I are still confused and have no explanation.  We tried to take video and pictures but couldn&#39;t capture what we were seeing.<n>

We immediately started to discuss the craft and as soon as we spoke about it, the light dimmed and turned off, as if to camouflage itself from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was still visible even without the light, as it was flying very low and was quite large.  The craft moved rather quickly but made no noise as it moved above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued to fly past and eventually, we lost view of it.  This was not an airplane or helicopter.  This was something much, much different and something I have never seen before.<n>

I first took it for as an airplane or air craft.  I could see the light and noticed it twinkling like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it got brighter though didn&#39;t seem to be getting closer which a plane would.  It stayed in place for about 10 minutes.  I did mention it to my friends but they weren&#39;t paying attention so I kept my eye on it because it kept flashing brighter and brighter.  Imagine a firefly&#39;s light going from high to low, that&#39;s what it was like and it was a combination of yellow/white/orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object made what could have been 3-5 sharp drop moves.  The only way to describe it would be to compare it to the game of Plinko on the Price Is Right, you didn&#39;t know which way it was going until it got there.  Zigzag is another way to describe the drop; after its short sharp descend, it was to the lower left of the star that didn&#39;t move.  From the distance that I was at, it was still far away in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember saying &#34;if I were 30 miles closer we could get an amazing look at it.&#34;   That&#39;s when I got up to get my phone and see if I could photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped away from the camp site in order to walk into complete darkness, but the distance was too high for my iPhone to capture.  It stayed in place for another 10 minutes, blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it made a straight move down.  That&#39;s when I knew I was seeing something other than a plane.  The descend lasted less than 10 seconds (5 maybe) it was fast and noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It dropped all the way down to the horizon and just like that it stopped, and (with me facing East) it made a right turn, now traveling South until it went behind the mounds and woods.<n>

Lights were moving relative to each other and stars could be seen between the lights indicating they were not connected by any solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All lights were moving at generally the same speed in the aforementioned direction.  The first three lights moved only slightly in relation to each other.  The trailing two lights moved at great speed in relation to each other, where one light moved 270 degrees around the other light in approximately 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was not in a perfect arch, again suggesting the two were no physically connected.  While the trailing lights were performing the 270 degree movement relative to each other, one of the leading green lights became intensely bright relative to the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could best be described as seeing a laser pointer that was suddenly pointed direc! tly at the observer.  This lasted approximately 5 seconds.  Lights did not blink and were constant, and their brightness in comparison to each other was similar, with the exception of the sudden brightening of the one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light intensity could be described as that of a slightly brighter than a standard green airplane navigation light at approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet (as compared to known aircraft landing at CHS on most any other night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Absolutely no noise of any kind was heard during the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights were first seen approximately 45 degrees from directly overhead and it took approximately 60 seconds to move to the corresponding 45 degree angle.  90 degrees were covered in approximately 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were seen for another 90 seconds, moving to the NNW, until they slowly faded from sight.  No additional movement relative to each other was seen at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many flights go over the house in the direction of Charleston international airport.  The direction of these lights was different in that it was 30 degrees to the west of the normal flight pattern to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky was clear, no clouds.  No haze was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern below generally reflects the relative position of each light although there were subtle variations of this during the observation.  The distance from the lead light to the trailing light was the distance from the pinky to the thumb with full spread of fingers at arm’s length when the objects were directly overhead.  The distance from the two trailing lights to each other was approximately the size of a half dollar at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> X 		X							X X  						X<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the speed the trailing two objects moved relative to each other, it gave the impression that these objects were not at any appreciable height.  The general speed of the objects across the sky was much slower than an aircraft landing at CHS.  A landing aircraft takes approximately 15 seconds to cover the same 90 degree arch these lights covered in 60 seconds.  However, landing aircraft are only visible for approximately 20 to 30 seconds where these lights were visible for 90 plus seconds before they slowly faded into the distance.  That gives the impression these lights were higher in altitude which contradicts the impression of a lower altitude given by the relative movement of the trailing two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife observed the objects for 10 to 15 seconds before calling me outside to see them.   We were the only two witnesses that we know of.<n>

What I saw looked like a giant snowflake (for lack of better way of describing it) and it had pulsing lights all over the front of it!

My name is ((deleted)).  I’m an Airline Pilot, based in Salisbury, MD.  I’ve flown for three different airlines, and corporate operations since 1988.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight at 2048 local time I witnessed an equilateral triangle shaped object, due north of my position, moving east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The corners of the triangle were defined by reddish-orange orbs of light.  It made no sound that I could hear, and appeared to roll about its longitudinal axis, so that I was observing the object edge on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was observing the object from PGH, the local hospital, and it seemed to be about 5 to 10 statute miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attach a photo.  I hope this helps with any investigation that may ensue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.

It was moving at such a slow pace if it was any slower it would have been stationary, as it moved farther away it blinked 3 time and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object disappeared once again there was a plane that would have been directly in front of it on the course it was traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a plane, a light in a bag, or firework we have seen the identical light 2 month prior my son has a great picture, which we will be sending to Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone traveling south on the freeway had had to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AMAZING!!!<n>

We initially thought they might be airplanes or helicopters which were reflecting light from the setting sun, but they seemed to be too close together.  They were maybe a few miles away to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for at least 30 seconds, and then they simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled into our driveway, got out of are car and stood there for a minute looking for them, and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So our theory of an aircraft seemed out of the question.<n>
8/30/14 20:20|Mukwonago|WI|Fireball|5 minutes|Red object and white craft seen off of Highway 43 in Mukwonago, WI|8/31/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113098.html|52|ndxe201408| Red object and white craft seen off of Highway 43 in Mukwonago, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 8:20 at night.  It was a clear drive home on highway 43 south. Right before the ramp to Mukwonago a very dark red light appeared mid sky.  It looked the exact same color as other reddish ufo&#39;s ive seen in the past.  It was traveling quite fast but it was only about 2,000 FT in the sky.  It just kept coming for about 2-3 minutes without any interruptions!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, of course, came the part when the object disappears.  And what is the reason for this? There is usually a quite logical explanation.  The craft does not want to be seen.  As above with this theory, came an airplane coming out of Mitchel Field Milwaukee.  This airplane was coming at the object at a fairly good distance but a general area.  The craft immideatley started flickering in and out and of course like all reports the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this the end of the night?  No.  Awkwardly, came a bright white light looking like the spotlight of the front of an airplane at night just like it.  It was also in the flight path from the area.  Right when my father pointed this object out and looked at it for about 10 seconds it just sat there; it was moving before he told me to look at this &#34;thing.&#34;  What it took for this object to disappear is nothing but telling me to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happens also quite frequently in looking at these objects.  Once one or more people see it it tends to know and disappear out of thin air.  This all happened in a time frame of about 5 minutes pulled over on Highway 43.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere and sober-minded to us.

I looked to the western sky and seen some lights I asked my wife and kids to look and they also seen them.  We watched 3 light on the far right side of the formation moving together to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stopped after going so far and reverse direction from where they came from and stopped like as they were forming a certain formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was like a check mark, and all of a sudden one light disappears and then another now there is 1 then the lights come back on (like a light switch) then there was 5 lights. the length was very long unlike no plane or hot air balloons they moved too quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and kids were freaked out and let it be known my don’t believe in ufo’s but even she says she can’t explain what we saw.<n>

They where so close, that they lighted up the tops of the houses and trees with a red orange glow. They where about 40 to 50 feet in Diameter &#34;Size of a small house&#34;. The craft at the center where spheres, and had an orange red arch welder like corona around the ships that extended out from the ship about 10 feet or so. These ships approached from the south &#34;Texas Area I Am Assuming As These Exact 3 Craft where sighted in Texas August 28th 2 days before they arrived in Ogallala&#34; and where headed over Ogallala in a northern heading at an extreme high rate of speed &#34;faster than a supersonic jet by far&#34;. Directly over my home, 2 of them came to an almost immediate stop. Amazing to think of the forces required to do this &#34;try slamming on your brakes in your car when your going 40 miles per hour and you will be violently thrown forward into the dashboard, now try to do this while going thousands of miles an hour and slamming on your brakes! Instant human jelly all over the dash board!&#34;. These craft purposely hovered over my house, and for 2 to 3 minutes made percision maneuvers and formation flying. The third vehicle was so low to the tops of the houses as to be actually below the tops of the trees. All 3 craft lighted up the night sky with a red/orange hue and glow. Also cast this glow onto the tops of my house and nearby tree tops and roofs of other houses. Then with utterly amazing speed they shot off north towards the resort lake here in ogallala nebraska, in which many many people must have seen these craft, because they where so bright, and doing such amazing things! Since seeing these craft I have learned that thousands of people have been seeing them over! the last several years in ever increasing numbers! In fact, G! oogle: &amp; quot;Red Globes In Sky&#34; and many hundreds of recorded and reported sightings have been uploaded to youtube and other websites of these vehicles in action! Where is the media and government on this??!! This is clearly happening on a massive scale over every major city in the United States and Globally!!! Clearly a massive media and government cover up of these Red Orange Orb Craft is now underway! The fact that these VERY SAME 3 craft where seen over Texas only 2 days before, means that who ever is piloting these craft ARE PURPOSELY MAKING THEMSELVES SEEN ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES! Who!? Why?! And where is the Government and Media on this obvious MASSIVE DISPLAY over America and Globally!!! And P.S., why in a obscure cow town in Mid-West Nebraska, did these space craft pick the home of the Chairman &amp; CEO of the International Space Agency to specifically hover over! Hmm....?! Very Perplexing! My sighting was co-observed with a local resident of Ogallala who is my Neighbor, whose name is Kenny. This was confirmed by a good friend Les, who is with the Coast Guard on Lake Ogallala, who actually missed this amazing event by leaving my house only 3 to 4 minutes before these events unfolded. These are indeed some kind of ships, and ARE NOT Flying Lanterns or Comets or Helicopters or Aircraft! These craft where so close to us, we saw them very well indeed! And my background of 16 years in Military and Civilian Aviation, I KNOW WHAT IS SAW! Also I am a Scientist and have much knowledge of these things and events, and THEY ARE CRAFT! I do NOT believe they are under Human Control, other than that I am clueless!  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV46wzG5zHCPeVaN433uYLQfeO1VLZtTs  See the above video playlist. I am now searching out these craft on the internet and placing them in this play list. See anything that should be here, please contact me.&amp;#65279; Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they hovered over my house, they Headed Direct North to the Ogallala Lake.

In the ESE, I saw a very bright white light with flashes of green and red.  I thought it was a jet until it started moving in very erratic movements (circles, very jerking motion).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my binoculars, it looked like a circle with four lights (like a flashlight beam) coming out the top and sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched until it went behind some trees, about half an hour.<n>

I had just done that and was going to go back to bed, but remembered that the gated parking garage, adjacent to the short “high-rise” condo complex that I live in, was not gated for the past two days.  Since I have a vehicle in that lot, and the vehicle is exposed to the street, I decided to take a look out of my living room window, which overlooks the parking lot, to check on my truck.  I had been a little worried about the truck overnight, because we have a ton of auto burglaries on our street, and in general, a lot of scuzzy people walking around up to no good late at night, early a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to get a good look at the parking lot, I had to lie down (on my belly), on my carpet.  We have a large window but the shade is always drawn, so I decided to lie down and look out the window.  Truck was fine and I didn’t see anyone around but I noticed some lights on in a dilapidated building kitty corner to ours.  Since I wasn’t feeling sleepy, I went and got my binoculars and took a look.  I was checking out the dilapidated building when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I THINK I heard the low hum first.  The rest, I am absolutely 100% sure about.  I looked to my left, and a GIANT rectangular, flat, object was “floating” slowly in my direction from up high – gliding long side up, and then closer and closer.  It sort of “twisted” slowly, which was a movement that I found incredulous for any manmade air craft.  It made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then hovered for a time (maybe 2 minutes?) and it was “facing” me at a diagonal/slanted  angle.  There was a white light (not blinking) on each corner of the craft.  In the first moments of seeing this thing, my brain was trying to categorize it as an airplane or some kind of military jet and I couldn’t understand why there were only white lights as I know that our aircraft use colored lights to indicate port side or starboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the shape of the object was clear to me.  It was SO CLOSE and SO LOW.  And since it hovered for what seemed like a long time, I had a long time to look at it.  But even so, I feel fuz! zy about what it really looked like with specific details.  I know that at the moment I realized it was absolutely a UFO, I was in absolute shock at what I was witnessing.  Then, it put itself on a more horizontal level, and glided up, and headed in a northern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a part of the city that has heavy construction so I speculate that the craft was interested in all of the construction going on, but I also assume it knew I was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was sleeping in the other room.  I didn’t call out for him because I didn’t want to disturb what was happening by making a huge commotion, and even though I wished so badly I could go grab my camera I didn’t want to miss a moment of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather:  it was very, very dark out (for an urban city).  Our street actually is not very well lit, which is unusual for the neighborhood.  The sky was dark, but I could tell it was clear overhead and I could see off on the northern horizon that there was a heavy band of low fog.  That was the direction the craft took off for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could NOT believe what I was seeing.  To say the experience was shocking is an understatement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions:  practically pitch black with some city lights.<n>

It traveled smoothly and not too quickly across the sky in an easterly direction away from the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and watched it as until its path was prevented from view due to trees.  I went out into the front of my house in the street and watched it proceed off in to the east and increasing in height.  It never changed speed and the color and glow never changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it disappeared amongst the stars very very high in the sky in the distance.  There was no noise at all.  No engine sound.  There was no wind at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation what this was that I saw.  It was not a hot air balloon as it moved too fast and there are no hot air balloons in this area ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the ocean direction as I live just 4 houses from the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.

8/29/14 23:20|Sykesville|MD|Sphere|5 minutes|Reddish-Orange orbs sighted in Sykesville, MD.|8/31/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113048.html|67|ndxe201408| Reddish-Orange orbs sighted in Sykesville, MD<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11:20pm this evening I was driving south on Route 32 in Sykesville, MD, when I noticed strange lights in the sky.  It appeared to me as if they had just crossed over 32 and were heading west.  I quickly realized I was witnessing UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned onto Johnsville Road and got out of the car to observe.  It was eerily quiet.  There were maybe a dozen of them.  They were reddish-orange orbs that appeared to be just sitting in the sky, and then I saw them all move together, but very, very slowly.  They all proceeded together in the same direction up Johnsville Road, completely silent, and suddenly all of them disappeared at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not certain about this part, but I thought that the lights turned white just prior to disappearing.  I did try to get photos on my iphone.  All I have are a few shots of black sky.  In one photo there is a bright light in the bottom left corner of the photo, but I am thinking I may have picked up a street light.  I cannot be sure, it is quite blurry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side Note:  I noticed my car lights were out when I turned around.  I had left them on.  Upon starting the vehicle, the lights immediately came on.  My lights always stay on a few minutes after the car is turned off and then they automatically shut off.  However, when I got home I left my lights on and when I opened my car door all lights shut off.  I have to assume something has gone bad in my car and the UFOs had nothing to do with my lights.  I am going to see if I can figure out why suddenly all the lights go off when I open the car door.  This has never occurred before.<n>

The NY state fair was still going on which I think I saw that someone there saw the same thing as me.  I&#39;m very skeptical on whether people actually see UFO&#39;s and such.  Although that night was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what at first looked like plane over Onondaga Lake.  Although I then realized the &#34;Plane&#34; wasn&#39;t moving anywhere.  It looked to just hover.  This aircraft then started slowly moving away from the lake and towards our direction in the sky.  It passed from the left side of the street we were on and ended up going to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned all of my music off and opened my window and heard nothing at all.  If it were an airplane I would have easily heard it.  It wasn&#39;t as high up as a plane either.  As it got closer to my vicinity,  It looked like a triangle.  There were bright lights lined up on it from the front to the back, unlike planes that have a bright light and then blinking lights on back wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being so much closer than an actual plane you would think it would be moving fast.  It slowly went across the sky while my girlfriend and I pondered as to what it could be. We questioned everything possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;ve seen before.  I bet it was either a government aircraft that no one knows about, or a UFO, even thought I do not want to admit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed a light in my peripheral vision – at first I thought someone had turned on one of the lights behind me and that it was reflecting off my Ipad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the trees [very tall spruce trees] on my left and saw a bright light coming down and towards my house.  The object  stopped in front of my sunroom window – at this point I was standing and looking at it  and it was hovering directly in front of me for probably what I would think would be a good part of a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably about 15 – 20 feet away from me hovering over my lawn.  The object was an ellipse shaped brightly glowing yellow object – it had something that looked like a red glowing wick shaped filament in the centre–the closest that I can compare it to would be a candle wick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had 2 triangular propellers or ‘wings’ – one on each side – smaller than the main object and with the wider part of the triangle attached to the main object – the triangle tapered off to a point.  I could see the propellers moving – the closest description of the movement would be that of a hummingbird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe what I was seeing - if I had thought about it, I would have taken a photo with my Ipad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out of my bedroom and into the living room to tell my daughter and my husband to go outside.  We all rushed out to the deck and as we did so the object turned around and flew at a 60 degree trajectory over the water into the night sky.  We watched it until all we saw was a red dot and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I looked up drones on the computer – none had the shape that I had seen.  I thought that perhaps this was someone’s ‘toy’ but that wouldn’t explain why it hovered in front of my house then took off at a fast speed until it disappeared over the ocean … you would think that someone would want to have their drone toy back.  If this was a toy it would be a very expensive one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were people on the beach that night so maybe there is someone else who saw it.  I can provide a drawing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was probably 20&#39;&#39; long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just re read your letter - just to clarify - this object was hovering about 6 feet above my lawn in front of my sunroom window - which is in front of the beach.

Got out of my car to look up into the sky (it was dark as it was almost 10 pm) and what I saw made my jaw drop!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very large aircraft – probably the size of a football field (or at least half of one!) – Definitely rectangular in shape, dark – probably black.  It had an orange blinking light at the center of the base of it and a few other lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very, very slowly.  In the distance, I could see it turn to the left, almost hovering as it did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might have been military, but in case it is not.  I wanted to report it in case anyone else saw it.  Anyone out that night would have seen and heard this monstrosity in the sky!

They were travelling in same direction at first which approximately would have been coming from the water of Birch Bay and moving slowly inland.  I&#39;m guessing from northwest and head in slowly towards east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were too far apart to be any headlights on a plane, and I thought to myself, that planes don&#39;t fly that distance together- not commercial anyway.  I saw them clearly.  They weren&#39;t planets or stars.  They weren&#39;t laser pointers or search lights. There were many grey clouds in sky but the orange lights were easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they traveled in same direction, they then changed courses and went into the clouds - no longer going in same direction.  They did not descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about that time I wondered if they were UFO&#39;s and went into my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later I heard at least one helicopter, went to my window and watched helicopter flying in near same area of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Birch Bay, Blaine WA  8.29.2014<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It appeared to be red, almost flame-like, moving very slowly from south to north.  As it moved it seemed to slow to a hover, as it was almost overhead, then resume its leisurely motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed overhead, it slowly began to curve to the northwest.  All of this took 1-2 min. and the object kept the same appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, maybe 30 seconds later, the whole spectacle repeated itself.  A second slow moving red light followed the same path as the first one.  By the way, the original light was still visible, still heading very slowly to the northwest.  I do not recall if this second light did any hovering as it came overhead.  It did the same turn to the northwest as did the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then to conclude the event, about 30 sec. after the second light made its northwest turn, a third light identical to the first two came again from the south, following the same path and speed as the first two.  This one, like the first light, appeared to slow and hover for a few seconds as it came overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it resumed its slow pace, turning to the northwest as the others had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their speed was so slow that I could clearly see all three heading single file to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and dark with no moon, but several stars were visible to the west.<n>

We both watched the object move across the sky, over the house, and then directly toward a neighboring house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval in shape, resembling a balloon.  It was glowing from the inside out and moving at a consistent, steady pace.  It wasn&#39;t efected whatsoever by the wind...  It was as though it was on a precise course.  I actually thought it was a balloon...  But because of the glowing factor, the time of night (darkness) and the consistent pace it kept, we both realized it couldn&#39;t possibly be a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was quiet except for the cracling of the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood there watching the object move until it was out of site.

During a commercial break i went out to smoke a cigarette on my front porch, after about three or four puffs, a moving, very bright amber light behind trees caught my attention.  These trees are a small woodsy area about a football field or less away from where I was standing.  This small patch of woods is on a small hill and is in between my neiborhood and the next neiborhood over, and basically separates the backyards of thehouses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amber light first caught my eye as I saw it through the gaps in the trees moving very slowly upward, it was very bright and then it rose above the tree line and was a very bright ball of amber/red light with a pulsing energy field around it, that was translucent and moving around the ball of light. My! adrenaline started pumping once it cleared the tree line because this u.f.o was up close and personal and was less than 300 feet from me, very low and about the size of a big beach ball or yoga ball and was perfectly circular including the energy ring around it. The amber ball of light began to turn red and slowly rose 15 feet above the trees, stopped and hovered completely still for about 2-3 min changing color back and  forth from amber to red I watched the ball of light in complete shock this was basically 30-50 feet above houses across the street but everyone was inside except me. The ball of light was competly silent and after hovering for 3min started to move slowly toward me and once it was on opossite side of the trees it dropped 10 feet lower and started floating left toward a tree on my street then stayed still again, I turned around and ran inside to get my phone to get a video of it and when I came out it was slowly floating behind the tree and the light started to get smaller and the ball of light vanished behind the tre! e on my street while it was only 15 feet off the ground.  I ran over to the tree to see if something fell on the ground or was still there but there was nothing anywhere.  I called my girl friend after I calmed down and she was on the highway on her way home I told her what happened and as I explained it to her planes and helicopters started circling my neiborhood one after another and when my girlfriend was coming down the highway about five min from home she counted 12 airplanes and helicopters flying low above our area, they all had bright lights on them so were clear to see at night especially so low and so many. They circled the area until 2am.  Most profound moment of my life by far, what I saw that day will be forever with me.<n>

As I was looking for it I saw a very bright, very orange light moving much faster than a satellite but much slower than a meteor.  It arced across the sky on a S-N trajectory and finally disappeared rapidly well above the northern horizon.  Then I looked up and saw another one on a what  I would say was a parallel trajectory.  Both were significantly brighter than the brightest view of the ISS I have seen and moving much faster.  There was absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the second one disappear in the same manner.  I went back in the house to tell my wife and was was totally astonished at what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2-3 minutes I went back outside and there was another one moving overhead.  I called my wife to come look and by the time she got to the door it was past the roofline from where she was when she said, &#34;I see it!&#34;  There was another one moving in the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a total of 4 and she saw 1.  There was no trail left by any of the 4.  The bright orange color stayed constant on all 4--no flickering or pieces separating--until they finally disappeared quite rapidly above the norther horizon.  The final two disappeared well above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted the first one at 8:54 PM central time, the second at ~8:56, the third at ~8:59 and the fourth at ~9:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, the correct time is 8:54 pm central time.

My oldest daughter had my cell phone for the past week so I was unable to photograph it.  When I stood at the end of my driveway it was across the street located by the railroad tracks and water plant, it hovered at the tree tops, it was a bright silver with a red light on top and a green light on bottom and remained it that spot for at least 5 minutes, then I went inside.  My mother came over and said did you see that &#34;thing&#34; in the sky and I said &#34;yes, is it still there?&#34;  She replied, &#34;yes&#34;, I went to look at it with her and it was gone.  It showed up the next day around the same time and I have not seen it since.  I have my phone back and I want to see it again so I can get pictures to post.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both heard an odd sound in our normally quiet high altitude pine forest neighborhood.  It sounded like people chanting, but quite eerie.  Then we heard what sounded like gun shots.  We have coyotes and bears in the neighborhood, and so I questioned if our neighbor was scaring some animals off, but these noises were definitely not the typical animal sounds we have heard in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I went out to see if I could see anything.  I walked out the back porch without turning on the light.  I couldn’t hear anything.  I was facing Northeast.  I saw multiple blue lights (orbs?) above me in the sky.  The sky was cloud-free and not much of a wind.  There was no moon light out.  We live away from much light pollution.  These blue lights were moving smoothly, quickly and intertwining.  I though initially someone had shot off a firework or flare, but the sound was quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved directionally, then I noticed they straightened out and shot up toward above the back peak and toward the Reno area.  The blue lights then seem to make themselves look like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time there was a bigger object following slightly behind and amongst them.  If I remember correctly it was round or oval.  I think it was translucent and had various lights on it.  These lights were yellow, red, and blue and seemed to glow.  Again no sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember where it went or if it just disappeared over the pine trees.  I could not judge how big it was but I had a feeling it was rather close to the ground and not too big.  If it were not for the preceding blue lights I would have thought this to possibly be a big drone, but this was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted at my best guest 5-10 seconds.  There was some road construction occurring above our neighborhood on the Hwy 431 and they usually have many lights to help them work, but I could not see their lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can truly say I saw something that was unidentified.  The closest military base is over 50 miles away Northeast of us in Fallon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping others post this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were not satellites.|8/29/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113017.html|108|ndxe201408| Saw blue ball of light fall from sky then craft seem to check it out then skip across sky like a rock on water extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:30pm last night I was standing in my back yard in Sayville, on Long Island, New York with 3 other witnesses having a conversation.   I happened to be facing south with my eyes just starting to drift upward when suddenly I saw a ball of light fall from the sky leaving a trail behind it.  The object was blue-ish in color and large as to say it must have been closer than the stars and possibly even in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped what I was doing and said “ woahh did any one just see that, that definitely wasn’t a shooting star, it looked like something just crashed.”  It happened that this object fell directly over the Great South Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very shocked by what I saw because I have been a bit of a star gazer for quite some time and I know what a shooting star looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 more minutes of staring up to see if anything else occurred, I shrugged it off and walked in side to do something.  I returned to the back yard approximately 6 to 7 minutes after the sighting, my uncle had been still gazing in that direction in curiosity, when about 30 seconds after I returned he said, “There is something else over there.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and I saw a flash of light skip twice on the sky in the area where the other object had crashed or fallen, I was even skeptical at first and said, “No, that can’t be related.  It’s probably fireworks, or something, searching for some explanation,” when all of a sudden, the object seemed to have finished what it was doing in that area and began to make abrupt evasive seeming maneuvers across the sky.  However, it wasn’t just one long flash of light, the best way I can describe it is it was like a rock skipping on water, using some kind of propulsion mechanism which must have been the light that we saw each time it appeared, and with each burst of light the object was propelled tens of miles (from my earthly perspective, and it may have been much longer given the distance that it was into the night sky)<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately one second at a time, beginning its r! etreat f rom the scene of the first object by making an abrupt left turn then headed north and the light appeared about 5 or 6 more times before vanishing into the sky about 60 miles or so in about  7 or 8 seconds, or you might say the light appeared once every second of its journey from point A to point B where it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live close to MacArthur Airport, and I see planes all day every day, and every kind of plane there is, I also worked at a Skydiving facility with seasoned pilots and worked around planes so I have a good sense of what we are capable of in aviation, so a few things I know is that this was not a plane or any known human aircraft, there were multiple commercial airliners in the vicinity to compare it to and this was traveling many times their speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was also too close to the airport for this not to have been picked up on by radar, something crashed or fell into the Great South Bay, and something seemed to have gone to recover it and then tried to escape without being seen, or is it possible that this was the same object recovering from its crash landing and the reason I say that is because it looked as if when the craft was traveling away from the scene it was using some kind of propulsion system thus creating the light that we saw each time it moved another handful of miles across the sky,  but it’s obvious that whatever energy or propulsion system that it was using is not one that is known to the public, because one thrust sent it very far, also being that it was not just one constant light, it felt as if possibly the craft was struggling to escape, however on its final thrust it just vanished into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers consisted of two women in their 50’s and a man in his 50’s as well as me a 25 year old.  The other male observer and I have knowledge of technology, assumed ufos, and the night sky.  I have observed the sky for many years,  I have witnessed many meteor showers, including a shooting star that night, we also saw a satellite pass later that night, and the sky was very clear and cloudless, stars were extremely visible, meaning we had many known objects to compare it to.  I live in an area which is close to Fire Island, which is an area that is well populated with tourists and parties and these objects had to be visible and most likely seen by other people there.  I will add that last week I also witnessed similar lights but much higher in the sky coming from the exact direction that this object disappeared into.  I can not say if it is related but it was very similar although this incident was much more intense and much closer.  Thank you.<n>

My boyfriend first noticed the lights in the sky and it was odd that they weren&#39;t moving.  They didn&#39;t have the same lights that you would see on a helicopter and plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw planes coming in from a different direction as there is a airport near by.  However, unlike the airplanes, there was no movement, no change in size, and they would appear and disappear at the exact same location they had been originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more we watched I noticed another light off in the distance doing the same thing.  The lights also didn&#39;t twinkle the same way as the lights in the city below did, they definitely had.  They seemed to have a more unstable light and more of pulsing light from them.  I would see them appear and disappear and not change location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they disappeared the light became more faint and pulsed more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got in our car and went closer to the bottom of the mountain we noticed that! we were too low to see them (we originally knew they were low because we saw helicopters fly under them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are a couple videos I recorded:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii6tTpMt01s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2L-RCHI40M<n>

It was rather large, perhaps the size of the moon and  a small cloud was in its path.  It passed behind the small cloud, and I could see the lights become covered by the small cloud, but when I expected the object to reappear after passing over the small cloud, it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the vector movement of the triangular object  in a straight line was not related to one point moving forward or one side moving forward.  When the object disappeared, I also noticed that the small cloud developed and became somewhat thicker.  There was no opportunity to visually record the event as it happened so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed any thing like this before.<n>

Right above the cloud line appeared a ball of light, the size of a star but much brighter and closer, we thought maybe it could be the space station going by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed in the same spot for about two minutes then 2 smaller orb looking shapes appeared directly under it. The bright light began to get very dim as if it was moving away. We thought it was gone then out of nowhere the bright orb exploded as if it hit something, there was a large ball of fire in the sky, it happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after, it left what looked like a cloud of smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures enclosed are immediately after it exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to contact the witness, in order to correct the date of the sighting.

We turned onto the road that our apartment complex is on and out of the corner of my husband’s eye, he spied a bright light.  He told me to turn the car around to see the object more clearly.  As I turned the car around, I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving side to side and up and down at a fairly rapid rate.  Then the object seemed to stop and hover.  It then moved very rapidly to the right and hovered again.  It then moved to the left, then up and down and went below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in a parking lot as we were watching the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a bright white glow about it.  We did not hear any noise or sound from it.  We believe it was about a mile away.  Granted, if there was a sound, it may have been drowned by the traffic noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object was below the tree line, I drove in the direction of the object; however, we were not able to locate it again.<n>

I saw 2 long lights, flying east to west, somewhat on the diagonal to each other, one being up front, the other behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was completely solid on each craft.  It looked like a long thin light bulb lit up on both objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as the object in front disappeared in the clouds, and then the 2nd object was still visible to me, and then it too disappeared in the clouds.  It was very high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have aircraft flying over our house all the time on their descent to Philadelphia International Airport.  It wasn&#39;t an airplane that I&#39;ve ever seen before.  The light on each craft was completely solid the entire time I had it in my visual range.  The color of the light was a yellow-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible it was a military craft?  I&#39;ve only seen planes with lights at intervals on the body and wings.  These were 2 solid tubes/lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only sound I heard at the time were 2 approaching commerical airliners that follow the normal flight path over our home enroute to Philadelphia International Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airliners were much lower than the 2 objects I saw heading east to west.<n>

As it turned and headed back east it began to flash red..it shot straight up flashing a brilliant green and that&#39;s when I yelled for my husband to come witness what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there watching this light which had turned red once again going back and forth..east/west...for several minutes before finally turning white and heading straight up only to disappear into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched all night but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hoping to see it this evening and hopefully get some pics of it for everyone to see.<n>

It grew to about the size of a half dollar, as if it were held in front of you at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, it slowly dissipated, leaving a hazy residue behind.  Further away, roughly South East of the first observation, a second spherical cloud formed.  Besides it doing the same things as the first, for a few seconds, it displayed an iridescent hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear, and I remarked to myself how visible the constellations were.<n>

I turned to retrieve something from my car and then returned my attention to the previous spot I&#39;d been watching and was amazed to see another cloud in EXACTLY the same place except this time it was glowing orange.  The glowing was coming from INSIDE the cloud!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near BWI airport, directly in an approach route and have seen all types of aircraft come and go, jets and props, and have also seen the occasional spot lights scan the sky on cloudy or foggy nights.  This was an anomaly and was not lighted from the ground nor was it any aircraft.  Beyond that, I have absolutely no idea what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to repeat, THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER SINGLE CLOUD in the sky, and it was, again, exceptionally clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran back inside my house, woke my girlfriend, and we both were back outside within 60 seconds but there was no sign, nor clouds, anywhere to be seen.<n>

After sitting in the same position for about 20 minutes, it moved slowly left and then back right at half the distance. The lights seemed to be getting dimmer now at which point I thought the object might be heading away from Earth. The light was still there, smaller, but looking at a guide, the position of the light is where the star Capella sits.

The light was moving very fast for how high it was, and it began to slow down.  The light dimmed a little, then proceeded to move in a zig zag motion continuing east. It slowed and zig zagged two more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then grew brighter and started moving faster east, then faded quickly.  It seemed that when the light grew in intensity it was descending and as it faded it was ascending.<n>

We stood in the parking lot, waiting for her to finish her cigarette. The parking lot is located within the city district. The sky was a little bright due to the city lights. The sky was very clear and no clouds in sight, no rain nor lighting. There is was no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first group of lights  A few minutes later as we were chatting, I looked up to the sky. To my surprise, I saw four orange lights travelling very fast and in a very high altitude. They looked like orange dots similar to that of a star. The first group of lights flew in a straight line heading south. Then the first light started to wobble and the 3 lights did the same. Afterwards, the two lights in the front made a straight line, and the other two lights behind made another straight line as if they formed two different segments. They then disappeared in the horizon. At this point, my friend was not able to see it due to the speed they were travelling at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Second group of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second group of lights came within 20-30 seconds after the first. It was composed of 6 – 8 lights in the form which looked like a jet. They did not change formation. The distances of the lights from the others did not change. Neither the lights were blinking. Like the first group, the lights were also travelling fast in a very high altitude, headed a little east of south. This time, my friend saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third group of lights  After a few seconds, another group of lights appeared in the night sky. I was able to bring out my camera phone but to my extreme disappointment, the camera could not focus on the sky so nothing but our reactions to the lights was recorded. The 3rd group was composed of 5-8 lights this time.  They formed a circle, or an ellipse. As they flew towards south at high speed, they slowly converged in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights may have traveled approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute from horizon to horizon. The lights were above us when I started to record with my phone’s camera and ended at the point where they vanished. The video had a duration of 23 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to the north and a glowing red/orange ball of light caught my eye, just coming into view from behind the tree in front yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving slowly to the south, very silent, with a flickering like flame look inside a clear sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued to move slowly to the south, a second one came into view separated but running parallel. They continued moving south in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my partner as another set of eyes.  We came out and the objects were now directly overhead.  They started picking up speed and altitude.  One started changing color to green/blue an takes off faster and changes direction slightly to the southeast.  The other then starts to pick up speed, still heading due south, starts changing color to the blue/green like the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then both objects fade or blend into what looks like a group of stars to the south.<n>

It started out dim and flickering a little, and then grew brighter and brighter as I stared at it, until it was a bright fireball. I thought it might be a floating paper lantern, but the light got too bright, and perfectly round, and it was moving too fast and too straight.  There were no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I realized what it was, I ran back to the apartment to get my boyfriend and his daughter.  Since he had already seen one with me before, only his daughter came out with me.  She saw it with me in the other side of the sky, through the trees, where it had been heading, and now a little lighter orange and flickering a bit again.  And then it disappeared.  I ran up ahead to see if it continued on towards the horizon, but it was totally gone, just like our first sighting a few weeks ago in Cassidaga, NY, on or about July 27th (unreported).<n>

Bright, &#34;glowing-in-brilliance&#34; shining silver/white UFO flew straight up, stayed briefly and then before an eye&#39;s blink was glowing due south (quite a distance from the first sighting); then darted back east to the first spotted location, but much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With each shift of direction it was as fast as the blinking of an eye.  Incredible speed--no sound and glowing a brilliant diamond-like crystal silver/white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then heard a sound and it was a grayish-colored helicopter passing far beneath where the glowing object was, but I could still see the bright glow of the UFO.  It then completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it ranks in the &#34;UFO&#34; category.  To compare the speed it was as fast as a USAF jet might fly (comparing the speed to something I have seen at an air show).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew straight up and stopped, hovering, and within less than a second it was far to the south and glowing brightly, which was what made me think it was not a military jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed (and possibly due to staring into the daytime sky), my eyes were seeing &#34;a lot&#34; of mini-type specs or stars.  I can&#39;t quite describe it, as I noticed it was unusual but I was too preoccupied keeping my eyes on the UFO so I would not lose sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My vision experience, along with the sighting, was very interesting and unusual.<n>

I looked away for one second to flip my cigarette and in that instant it disappeared from view (or so I thought).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted the object hovering on the opposite end of the ridge, where it sat for several more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, I lost interest and went back inside.  They have appeared in the sky like clockwork at 11pm every night since, and are continuing to do so.  I also forgot to mention that I apparently lost more than half an hour of time by my perception when I came back inside the house, although I have no way to verify this.<n>

As I looked to the north, northwest and noticed the big dipper, I told my daughter about seeing the big dipper in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I observed a steady light, which appeared to be a star.  The star was stationary.  While observing the Big Dipper, this particular star started moving.  The star like object had no flashing lights and stayed luminescent the entire time myself and my daughter were observing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i continued to watch, it seemed to move faster.  The lit object was traveling in an east, southeast direction.  There was no noise associated with this object. Myself and my daughter continued watching this object in flight.  In my opinion, and i have seen thousands of planes at night and the speed in which they move....this object traveled at a speed unknown to my eyes and probably 8 to 10 times faster than anything we have in our current military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not guess the altitude in which the object was traveling.  But, it did appear at what some would call a possible normal cruising altitude for a commercial airliner.  As the object traveled about halfway across the sky, all of a sudden it emitted the brightest, most concentrated light i have ever seen in the sky, brighter than any full moon.  The light started as a concentrated beam, then it was as if it gazed directly down on my daughter and myself, then aimed away and off in roughly about 2 seconds.  The object then traveled on in an easterly, southeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed the majority of the sky that I can see from my house in roughly a 15 second time frame.  The angle of travel I would guess, would be about 160 degrees to 170 degrees.  Almost a straight line from the North-Northwest, to the South-Southwest.  And I live next to a wide open field and can see the majority of the night sky.<n>

Then I realize I have never seen anything flying the opposite way of falcon fields mandated flight path allows.  Another detail that had me for a split second assume it was a commercial or private plane was it looked white, and almost textured, but at this time I was looking up at it and may have been looking at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed it was barely swerving slightly back and forth. So slightly that unless you stared at like I did it could appear to be going straight. This is when I was positive it was worth taking a picture at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If my phone wasn&#39;t on verge of dying, I would have taken a video.  As I got my phone ready to take the picture the object was getting further away quickly even though we were traveling same direction.  When I took the picture I wasn&#39;t sure if I would be able to see anything.  And when you look at the picture you almost can&#39;t see anything until you zoom in then you can see it quite clearly.  So the time I observed it was about 2 min. approximately OR The time it takes to travel 2 miles at 40 MPH might be a more accurate way to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I snapped the picture, passed two palm trees, looked back up and the object in sky was gone.  Then I saw a commercial air liner fly by and noticed distinct blinking light on the belly and obvious wing shapes which the object I saw was lacking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned east and by the time I got to my destination 2 miles up the road I observed 2 air force jets both flying straight up with the afterburners on and I remember thinking that they were going much slower than the object they were chasing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the craft appeared to be somewhat cigar shape and with the white I was seeing is why it looked at a glance like a jetliner but it quickly looked different in shape but I think this is because of the angle not that it changed in shape and became very obvious to me it was wingless.  Half round in shape.  The best thing I can think of to compare with is a bike helmet which is kind of funny to me because I imagine both the helmet and the ship were built with aerodynamics in mind.<n>

I asked the wife if she wanted to go out and look at the stars and drink a coffee/tea before going to bed, which we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did see a few falling stars and only one airplane which we thought was strange being planes seem to travel over our airspace almost constantly, at least it seems that way at times, but that night we only seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 12:15 a.m. which would make it Aug. 26, we decided to go in and go to bed.  I know sooner got up out of my chair and looked up in the sky in a SW direction when I seen this bright white light in the sky and said out loud, &#34;What the heck is that&#34;?  The wife then looked in the direction I was looking and seen the same object, she to didn&#39;t have any idea what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being we see so many planes fly overhead here we knew it wasn&#39;t a plane, or at least none like we ever seen before.  The object was triangle shaped and continued flying silently towards us, then amost directly over top of us and made no noise what-so-ever.  I managed to grab the video camera and record a short video of the object as it traveled now away from us in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at the object it seemed as though there was two big white lights side by side in the rear while the whole nose of the object looked to be lighted up which reminded me of the space capsule from the 60&#39;s that the astronauts used to use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video of the object, any movement of the object other then going straight was from camera shake from me being cold, plus I had zoomed in on the object making camera shake even worse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather Conditions: Wind:   Calm Sky:   Clear Temp: L  Low to mid 50&#39;s F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fog:  None that we could see or know of Dew:  Yes<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Nice clear night with very little clouds in the area.  We were looking at the stars and planes and watching for unusual stuff bc last week we had seen something that peaked our interest.  (Last event was witnessed by me, my gf, my mom and dad, 4 witnesses in total).<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, last night while watching a plane we noticed a bright flash.  At first I thought it to be a firefly in the corner of my eye.  However after staring at the spot where we had seen it for about 3 minutes, it went off again, in the same location. It was above the trees and was just a quick on and off flash.  Almost as if someone up in the sky had a flashlight and was signaling.  This happened about every 2-3 minutes. And each time I thought it was done and about to turn to go in, it flashed.  After a while I was feeling like whatever it was, was doing it on purpose to toy with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about the 8th time it went off I went in to get my dad, but when he came out it didn&#39;t go off, which just made us look like we were making it up.  But he believed us bc of what we all saw last week.  Anyway, at first I wasn&#39;t going to report this bc I just reported something last week and I don&#39;t want to appear like I&#39;m crazy or doing this for attention.  Just seems like there’s something going on recently in the Waukesha/Brookfield area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time<n>

They were quite a bit north in the distance, but seemed bright and too large.  They were not flashing the usual red lights as helicopters would, and their flight patterns seemed erratic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister saw one of them as well while driving in San Marcos, which is not too far from Carlsbad and Oceanside, at around the same time.  Sometimes, one would disappear, then reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen one before just like these a few months ago, in the same area.  It was hovering over the freeway.  It appeared bright orange from a distance, but as I drove nearer, it started changing colors from orange, to dark blue, to green, to red.  It looked like a sophisticated LED lighting system that completely covered the surface of the craft.  The color change would start at one point, then spread over the craft with the new color.  It felt as if it was putting a  light-show for me.  I looked at other cars on the freeway in disbelief, but no other drivers were paying attention.<n>

I immediately noticed a bright light in the west about 20 degrees up.  It was flickering, i knew it wasn&#39;t a star.  I got the binoculars and saw it had flashing lights, red, white and an occasional blue  or green.  A few times a bright beam of pinkish light shot out to the side.  The light stayed in one spot except that it occasionally moved a hair sideways and back, or in a small circle.  I couldn&#39;t get the binoculars to focus sharply on it, although I can focus on the craters of the moon or a jet at 35,000 feet.  After a while watching I sort of decided that it was in a triangular shape and was rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down the street to get a better look.  At the top of the beach i noticed another light, same deal, out over the lake.  This was not like any of the lights I&#39;ve seen out there.  When I had a clear view of the sky I saw that there was another one low in the northwest, like over toward Toronto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 11:15 all three were suddenly gone.  They didn&#39;t move away, they went out. I came in the house and was heading into bed when there were five bright flashes in the southern sky, like a flash going off. There was never any noise from any of this.  The flash was bright enough to throw shadows of the trees into the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the middle of the night, around 2:30, wife said &#34;I can&#39;t sleep...aliens&#34;.<n>

Another 5 minutes passed and another light appeared to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another 5 minutes the light before that one flickered and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another 5 minutes passed and the last one flickered and disappeared.<n>

The light increased and decreased in brightness and was the shade of an orange streetlamp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon stepping outside for a clearer look, I noticed it had a primarily orange color with what looked like red lights spread throughout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued pulsating in brightness but appeared to be staying in the same position.  It would grow faint and then bright again until after about 3-4 minutes max, the light slowly faded from view completely while still in the same spot.<n>

We both observed the light and the flashing was erridic, no pattern.  My brother went into the house and brought out his son and wife who both observed the red light.  The light originally moved west to east but then moved east to west, the light would stop and remain motionless while still blinking for 3 to 4 minutes at a time.  We all agreed that there we could not identify what we saw mabee a drone, mabee a ufo.  We are hoping that someone else saw these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I could see what appeared to be smoke rolling of of the top of one of the objects then is just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through the binoculars the other object appeared to be two very large circular shapes almost on top of each other, in the back round I could see faint light in the clouds of the other object.  The circular object that was still in the sky appeared to have lights all around it and a smaller circular object in the middle with lights around it as well then it started to fade and disappeared.  When I was on the south side of town the objects were very high in the sky but on the north side of town they appeared lower still the view with binoculars was more defined that what I saw just looking with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner was astounded and could not find an explanation as to what we were seeing. I took photos with my iphone and the objects just appeared to be small balls of light that were very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they were gone you could see the smoke through the binoculars behind the clouds and faint red balls in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have three photos.<n>

They were traveling south and toward the horizon;  I was looking west, so it seems that were headed on a southwestern trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the lights changed their orientation relative to each other, and then the group as a whole changed their direction abruptly and quickly, away from the horizon, and then they disappeared from my view.  This entire episode happened in five seconds and was not long enough in duration for me to get a corroborating witness.  My dog, however, began to look up at the sky without provocation and continued to look at the sky for around thirty seconds, which is atypical for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this and until now have been skeptical of UFO sightings, chalking up any strange phenomena that other people have seen to atmospheric refraction, military testing or just other aircraft.  Tonight&#39;s sighting has certainly made me more open-minded on the matter.<n>

I was walking my dog on a plot near my house.  I live a few miles from Orlando International Airport, hence I see a lot of planes taking- off, landing and taxiing mainly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A ball of light was sighted flying at a considerably lower altitude (above me) and had no aerial taxiway lights (since it was at altitude for landing).  At the same time I called my sister and asked her to leave the house to see also..  At that time I was running back home with my dog along to see my sister, since I needed another witness (was not the first ball of light that I see here in Orlando-Fl.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are looking at the ball together and the ball of light was flying at a constant speed and then the more strange happens, it begins to rise slowly..  We were able to see the ball of light getting farther up the point we saw the light gradually decrease until disappearing in the sky (remember that was not a cloud in the sky)<n> <n><n> <n><n> at the end of it, I was super excited to have been able to show someone more, and happier still to have been my sister (she&#39;s 21 )<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m lover of planes, helicopters, RC’s planes/Helicopters and virtually everything that flies from when I was a child, so I know exactly what I saw was not any type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank everyone who took the time to read and also saw someone please write here also.<n>

They then moved above and below each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was about five minutes in the first position. After they formed above and below, another same looking object appeared to the right of the two above and below two! Now there was three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The new third object split and become two..

I noticed 2 very bright orange orbs in the sky to my right. They were very bright.  They were horizontal to each other, side by side and the distance between them stayed the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were tall trees along the fwy so from time to time I lost sight of them, but whenever there was a clearing I could see them.  Although I was traveling at 65 mph, I never got closer to the orbs of light, nor did they get any farther.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a period of 3-4 minutes I lost sight of them due to trees but then I got to a point where the sky was very visible.  There they were but now they where in front of me, slightly to my left, but now there were 4 bright orange orbs, 2 that were verticle and next to it 2 that were horizontal.  They seemed to be stationary in the sky, very bright and had to be seen by everyone traveling down the freeway as well as others who live in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are some news reports about it as well as youtube videos.  The news said it was probably flares from Camp Pendleton during a training exercise.  I don&#39;t believe that at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orbs stayed in the same position in the sky for 14-15 minutes.  If they were flares, then they were anti-gravity flares.  Camp Pendelton is @ 35 miles to the south of where I was and if they were flares from Pendelton they would not have appeared so big and bright nor stay fixed in the sky for 14 -15 minutes.  Flares descend, these did not.  I have seen flares in the past and these were not flares.<n>

The object glowed and seemingly pulsed for a few moments but then went black.  It was still visible, so I continued to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it started glowing again and then went black again.  Soon after that, I lost sight of the object, but curiously what looked shooting star flew in the direction of where the object had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, as I approached my home, I witnessed another object that was bright white in color flying slowly but somewhat erratically, again in the eastern sky.  I lost track of this object quickly because of tree cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a link to the video of the first object that I captured on my iPhone 5.

I thought it was a plane on fire but then thought it was flying towards the ground at a weird angle and there were no trails of smoke, or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a small object that wasn&#39;t moving.  There was a single white light with orange around it.  Not nearly as bright as the other.  The first passed the second one and then stopped flying midair and became less bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller one then got brighter and started flying back up.  They both eventually disappeared into mid air.

But I believe I saw two UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a plane fly towards where one object disappeared a few minutes later there were lots of lights in the sky, but I can&#39;t tell if it was lightning but there were lots of lights in the same spot back to back.<n>

It was between 3:34-3:40am with no street lights on the interstate it was pretty dark.  At the time I was the only vehicle on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look up to my rear view and notice what to me looked like a vehicle way off in the distance coming over the hill.  Focused back on the road I decided to look again.  From where I saw that light, to where it was then it&#39;s just impossible to drive that fast in less than a minute. I&#39;m starting to look closer, it&#39;s only one light which then starts illuminating its light in wave like motions around its self. I speed up thinking &#34; This is not happening right now!&#34;. I truly became scared as it increased speed when I did...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My focus was distracted when I noticed a vehicle going south.  The illuminating ball of light seemed like it was going to catch my car until the vehicle traveling south became parallel with the light and then quicker than a blank of an eye, the light beams it&#39;s self in a perfect line straight to the other vehicle. GONE!  No noise nothing just disappears from my view, the light and other vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was pounding. I&#39;m coming up on my exit and what do I see? The light is back behind me brighter and and faster.  I increase my speed taking my chances on the off ramp but as soon as my car turns off it zooms by me like it had targeted the next car it could see .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, can&#39;t explain what but I can describe it to the T.  Those terrifying images will never leave my head and I hope I never have to experience them again!  My entire life I don&#39;t think I was ever that scared.<n>

Most of my neighbors probably were in bed.  I was fortunate to view the mysterious glowing object that seemed to be hiding up in the tree and I partially attribute my good fortune to the fact that it was a new moon - the darknest night of the month!  The silent UFO first was rod-shaped with a glowing blue light on the left end and a pinkish-violet light on the right end.  It was hovering horizontally in a place where a human could not be.  It was not a new-fangled bug zapper and there are no cable-TV or electric lines running near the tree and definitely not at that height.  No logic for the uncanny faintly-glowing lights in the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I stopped and shot video with my iPhone 4S but with no zoom in vid mode I switched to still-shot so I could peer closer.  I took 30 pics spanning about ten minutes and during this time the small anomalous cylindrical UFO/entity? morphed into an orb which sometimes appeared cobalt-blue and other times violet with a freaky purplish core.  Then it morphed back into a rod that was more white colored and appeared to be segmented, reminiscent of a bacterial rod under a microscope. This flying object ain&#39;t one of ours - NOT a drone, stealth bomber, planet Venus, or swamp gas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear any sounds coming from the object that night but later when I downloaded the video I was surprised to discover that my iPhone had picked up some intriguing clicking noises and when I showed the video to my neighbor S-- she said &#34;It sounds like Morse code.&#34;  Not meaning that it actually was Morse code but that it definitely sounded like some form of code and/or intelligently-contrived electronic signal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood motionless and alone on the shoulder of the street for approximately ten minutes, taking video and photos, before continuing my usual walking route home as I already was walking later than normal and did not want to be out after midnight.  The small, glowing, cylinder-orb UFO/entity still was hovering up in the tree when I left the scene and I have no way of knowing how long it may have lingered behind my neighbor&#39;s house that night?  So far, I have not shared this with the people who live in the house where the sighting took place because I did not want to run the risk of freaking them out, but coincidentally enough, they started leaving their back-porch floodlights on immediately in the wake of me seeing the UFO in their backyard.  I did, however, tell one of their male neighbors and B----- agreed with me that maybe his neighbors who live in the house in question saw the object too and it spooked them?  For the record, my neighbor&#39;s back-porch and backyard floodlights again were burning brightly when I passed during my walk tonight, 10-29-2014, before submitting this report to NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching for the UFO/entity ever since during my exercise walks but no encore yet, and I wasn&#39;t even going to submit a report because I didn&#39;t know whether this clicking, glowing, morphing rod/orb was an &#34;alien/UFO&#34; or spiritual entity, but then some other odd &#34;occurrences&#34; came to my attention that made me change my college-educated mind:  1. My sighting in Richmond was at 11:33 p.m. on August 24, 2014 and just four hours later at 3:30 a.m. on August 25, 2014 a motorist on I-295 N near the Hopewell exit, which is only 22 miles south of Richmond, was followed up the road by a bright UFO orb that was moving a lot faster than manmade highway traffic.  Then the orb targeted another car in the southbound lanes and when the sphere made contact with the other vehicle both the orb and car vanished into thin air!  Then the driver of the first car saw the orb reappear, and when it started following their car up the highway again they became &#34;terrified,&#34; put the pedal to the metal, and made a hasty retreat off the next exit in sight.  I learned of this fascinating occurrence at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Then a few hours later around 9 a.m. on August 25, 2014, a seasoned colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve was killed when his F-15 fighter jet crashed under &#34;mysterious circumstances&#34; in the Blue Ridge Mountains west of Richmond near Deerfield, VA.  Coincidentally enough, this was in an area where lots of residents have reported UFOs in the sky and orbs near the ground.  They say it took two days to recover the colonel&#39;s body and the official Air Force story was that he was from Massachusetts on a &#34;routine training mission.&#34;  Synchronistically enough, I also heard  NUFORC&#39;s esteemed Director Peter Davenport mention this odd fatal F-15 jet crash in Virginia&#39;s mountains during his Oct. 17, 2014 appearance on Coast-to-Coast AM radio with host George Noory.  Keep up the good work Peter as the efforts of you and your associates are greatly appreciated by a world starving for accurate, thoughtful information and truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not going to speculate or draw conclusions, but it seems like an awful lot of high strangeness for such a small region in ten hours!  Last but not least, a couple of weeks after my &#34;close encounter&#34; in Richmond, Virginia USA I was prompted to discover a seemingly-credible YouTube video of a small blue-pinkish-violet rod-shaped UFO that a man and woman in Ontario Canada videoed while sitting around a campground firepit and the anomalous silent hovering object looks uncannily similar to the UFO that I photographed in Richmond, VA when it was in &#34;rod mode.&#34;  The Ontario sighting was on August 20, 2014, only four days before my sighting in Virginia, and the Canadian couple was prompted to upload their video to YouTube on August 24 which synchronistically was the same day as my sighting!  Upon request, I will gladly make my photos and video available to Director Peter Davenport and NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ref:  http://nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112877.html  http://www.kait8.com/story/26383364/mass-f-15-fighter-jet-crashes-status-of-pilot-unknown  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21D9jaxNwRc<n>

The surface of it looked like a molten liquid, except for a relatively faint difficult to see grey shape in the center.  This molten appearance reminded me of a NASA photo of the surface of the Sun except that, unlike the Sun, the edge of it was very sharply defined.  The bottom of it emitted a reddish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained level at relatively low altitude for about 15 to 20 seconds and then pulled up at sharp angle and rose at a tremendous rate of climb; it momentarily appeared to stop and then continued to climb rapidly.  The light was so bright that it illuminated very high thin cirriform clouds in the dark sky as it passed through their altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no audible sound. This took place approximately ninety minutes after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold a commercial pilot license and previously worked as a certified flight instructor.

It had weird movements, as it would have semicircle movements at some points, straight line at others.  Once it got close to directly overhead, it had a habit of just staying in place.  It seemed like any of the stars, with nothing remarkable.  I tried to record it with my iPhone, but not even the campfire was showing on the trees(light from the campfire.  Trees were not on fire. Just making sure).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were dumbstruck on what it could be.  I tried to rationalize it every way I could.  I&#39;m an avid amateur astronomer and a total fan of physics in all it&#39;s forms.  I could not find an explanation. I tried to think as it moved, if it could be a satellite.  But to my knowledge, a satellite does not have sudden stops in movement.  I then tried to think weather balloon.  But a weather balloon wouldn&#39;t be visible even at the maximum height it could achieve at that time of night.  I then figured maybe a weird hyper-velocity star.  But to no avail, I could not rationalize anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried blurring my eyes to pin-point what kind of light source.  At one point, I could pick out a total of three light sources from the one source of light.  At one point, seemed as a light source came from it and faded away.  Then another light source(one west and one SSW[being the second one]) came into view.  Once the second one was visible, both came to a sort of full stop.  They made movements, but never left the spot.  They stayed there up until I grew tired of watching them (23:15), and are probably still there since I came inside.   The movements even when they were relatively in one spot just seemed weird.  It&#39;d be weird semicircles and full circles, but not covering much distance.  Sometimes would move different directions, but same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen a couple of strange things in the past, but this is a new pattern I saw.  Usually they disappear after a certain point.  I&#39;ve never seen anything move so fast and cover so much space, to just stay at one point.  I have no explanation for what I saw.<n>

She was looking up at the stars over the airport when she yelled at me to pull over.  I did, and she then pointed out a blue light in the sky over the tree-line.  The light was small at this distance, it hovered in place for a few seconds, then moved right, and immediately reversed direction.  She started filming on her iPhone. I then decided to try and get closer to where it seemed to be hovering.  I sped down a few streets trying to narrow down its location.  We ended up near the Norfolk ice rink, where we found other people filming this light. We pulled over behind one car with two guys filming the light, and there was also a guy out of his van which he left in the middle of the road.  There were 5 of us standing there watching this light hover directly above us, slowly moving towards the woods.  The light was constantly changing direction above us.  After about 3 minutes of filming, the light moved towards the woods and that was last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not make out the shape of the object due to the night sky being the only point of reference behind the light.  We could make out four bright lights that seemed to be on the bottom of the object.  Two were blue and two were red, giving off a purplish hue in between.  The lights were in a square formation.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  Due to all of these factors and attributes, we could not determine the size or distance of the object.  It could have been large and far away, or small and up close.  The whole encounter lasted approximately 15 minutes, with roughly 3 minutes of recorded video.<n>

There was no sound and as I watched them in the sky, the 2 outer lights quickly merged with the one in the center creating a burst of light and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there, thinking that I had witnessed a mid air collision, and that surely debris would begin falling from the sky.  However, there was no debris.  Approximately 5 minutes later, in the far distance just over the tree line I saw a bright flash of light, like that of a camera flash.  That happened twice about 2 minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to hear something of a sighting on the news, but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to file this report but my family thought it was important.

It passed our house and continued straight toward Seatac airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a bright orange color, no blinking strobes.  I am very familiar with aircraft lighting, I have been a commercial pilot for 30 years.  This aircraft had neither red nor green lights required on all aircraft, nor were there any strobes.  The altitude was difficult to judge, but I would guess it was similar to the commercial approach altitude of 10-15 thousand feet in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft passed a mile or so north of our house, it made no noise.

It was dark out but both the lights were quite brillant and very noticable.  Both were reddish in color and maybe a couple to several hundred feet up in the air moving in tandem across the sky at about the same altitude and speed and at about the same distance apart.  There was no noticable sound, and it was moving to fast to be a set of hot air ballons and too slowly for an airplane either assending or desending.  We could not see wings in the dark showing any type of aircraft.  We could not see any fuselage that was attached to the either of the lights.  And, we don&#39;t think it was a helicopter, as we&#39;ve never seen lights on any aircraft that resembled what we saw.  The lights appeared too far apart to be lights on a big plane.  They were just moving across the sky at about the same spee! d together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over to the shoulder of the road to watch the two tandem lights moving across the skyline, and a few seconds later, there was another sphere of bright light several hundred feet up moving from the east to the west after the other ones.  This ball of light, was even bigger than the first two, but  was alone and at about the same altitude as the first two spheres.   The third light was also reddish/orange in color very noticeable and not like anything we&#39;d ever seen quite extraordinary and unique.    It moved in the same direction about 10-15 seconds after the first two that were seen in tandem together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch as all three light spheres drifted and moved west out of our view of site.   This only lasted about 60-90 seconds total.  The strangest thing was there was no sound to hear, as we rolled down our windows and listened for the sound of some kind of engine roar.<n>

The sighting occurred between the Jackson School Road exit and North Plains exit.  I saw a bright golden light on horizon to the NW, over Pumpkin Ridge.  I thought it was a planet due to position and quality of light, maybe Venus.  As I continued to watch, the light began to move and then change color from gold to Orange to red through the spectrum very smoothly, like a gradient.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve seen, very fast and smooth with no blinking lights.  It moved South very quickly, close enough to the highway that I could see it was an uplit, triangular object.

As we continued driving down the highway the light clearly was getting larger, brighter, and looked as if it were getting closer to the car.  At this time now (10-15 seconds) it went from looking like a bright star to possibly a light to a plane of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having never seen a plane light look like what I was observing,  I then asked my wife, &#34;what is that in the sky?&#34;.  The light was brighter than any plane light I had ever seen, and stayed on like a headlight rather than blinking like most planes I see do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife responded, &#34;I don&#39;t know, maybe a plane?&#34;.  I then said, &#34;I&#39;ve never seen a plane light like that&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then continued to grow in size and now was getting much closer our car. As we continued driving down the road, both watching the light, it then started to change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light now was getting very close to our car and was clearly hovering much lower than any plane would be flying.  The bright white light had turned to a more dim version of its previous self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time this was happening the light was clearly visible through our front windshield as we were driving down the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, after maybe 30 seconds, the more dim light was almost directly over our car.  It was hovering, not moving like a plane or helicopter would be doing, and was only about 50-60 feet above our car.  It was almost directly above our vehicle, being slightly on the passenger side of our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the passenger side of the car and was completely in awe of what my wife and I were witnessing.  I rolled my window down so that I could get a clear view of what was now above us.  I could see through the dim orb of light a metal looking craft of some sort. I could see the craft was horizontal and got larger on both ends.  Similar to a traditional dog bone shape.  The metal looking craft also had lines running vertically up and down the sides.  Once again the color started to change as we were passing the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had now just passed the UFO and I continued to watch it from out my rolled down window.  The whole time, even with the window down, the UFO was silent, producing no noticeable noise.  The light has now changed to a deep bright red color similar to a traffic light in color.  The craft was no longer visible due to the brightness of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light stayed on and the craft hovered on over Kennewick, WA, as we continued towards Richland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching the orb of light, now behind us, the light would completely shut off and it would then turn back on.  The light continued to blink on and off for the next 60 seconds or so until it was no longer in our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was our first experience with any UFO.  I have always been somewhat of a sceptic, but now know for certain that UFO&#39;s do exist.  Having been so intrigued and wrapped up in the moment by what we were witnessing, neither my wife or I thought about using our smart phones to try and take a video.  We hope that this post is helpful, and encourage anyone else driving on Highway 240 last night around 9:20 to also post what you have seen.<n>

We observed the flashes of light for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes of light looked like the flash you would see when a camera flash is used meaning the lights would suddenly appear, remain in the same position, and then disappear without leaving any light trails.  The flashes were colored a bright white light with slight bluish overtones.  Overall, we saw approximately 8 to 10 separate flashes in or near the constellation Sagittarius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked Heavens Above.com and discovered the ISS was not in the area at the time of the sighting.  Also, there were no scheduled meteor showers for our location during this time period.<n>

Size, speed and altitude unknown but would assume they were at least some feet across and low,  no more than say 1,000 feet in altitude (my impression).  They could have been more than just a few feet but I do not believe they were small aircraft size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the objects were at some distance from each other and just “floating along,” something like you would expect from a Chinese lantern, which they resembled.  Then the lead object seemed to slow, or the other speed up as they joined up at a point in the sky.  Not conjoined or linked, just close to each other in formation. They then changed direction and moved West in close proximity to each other and we lost sight of them as they passed our house and I had to move from the back porch to the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went out to the front yard the spheres had disappeared.  However, as I scoured the night sky I did see one blacked out sphere (no lights now) silhouetted against the night sky, returning back East from the direction it had come.  I did not see a second, nor did I try to follow the flight of the blacked-out object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidently, shortly after this sighting, my wife saw a rather bright streaking light, likely a meteor, moving low in the sky past the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it is worth, I am an engineer and ex air-traffic controller.<n>

It appeared to me like it had dipped below the cloud cover and then went back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I blinked and almost shook my head thinking I saw something  That wasn’t really there.  But the more I kept thinking about it the rest of the drive I no doubt saw the almost Blacker than black object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t tell you the size of it but from my view from the car window it could have been the size of a quarter moving over the window, at cloud cover height on sat the 8th of august 2014<n>

It lit up the entire woods behind our house.  It seemed like an electrical burst, like something out of a movie.  It was a clear night and there were no clouds for it to be lightning.  We did not hear any cars in the area.  We live in a quiet area so we would have known if a car had driven by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash was way too bright to be a light from a plane.  It was like a large electric burst literally happened 20-50 feet over the top of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this is probably not important but my cat is freaking out right now.  It was sitting outside with us when this happened.<n>

A friend of ours walked up and we were chatting for a bit and then he noticed something in the sky and pointed upward (west direction) and asked: &#34;What is that?&#34;  We immediately looked up and saw approximately 25-30 orbs glowing white/orange orbs flying south along the coast.  They were not planes or Chinese lanterns!  Some of the orbs were darting around (going left and right), but still heading south.  Then suddenly, one orb darted up towards the sky.  It looked like a shooting star, but it was backwards, since it shot up towards the starts.  Seconds later a second orb shot out in the same direction.   The remaining orbs continued south and then split into two directions and alleviated into the sky so high they looked like stars in the distance.   A few seconds later, a plane flew by.  It was at the exact same elevation as the orbs originally were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so flabbergasted and my husband immediately started shouting out to other boaters if they saw what we did.  My husband found another witness who was also astonished and could not account for what had transpired.  My husband asked for his name and number, but he refused.<n>

We were almost halfway between Pueblo and Colorado Springs when we noticed two large bright orange fireballs, suspended in the sky about 400 feet above the ground and perhaps a mile or two away from us over the hills to the west.  We agreed the must have been fairly large at their distance, each perhaps the size of a 2 story house.  These fireballs appeared to be emitting smoke; we could see trails of smoke in the air lit up by the orange glow from the balls.  We commented and started taking video, still driving (we never did pull over or break speed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds, a third fireball appeared, as a tiny dot that cut slightly across the sky but grew in size to equal the other fireballs, over the course of 1-2 seconds.  The three fireballs were, as far as we could tell, hovering in place in the air for 2-3 minutes, casting a glow on the hills nearby, burning bright orange and emitting smoke.  They did not appear to move very much if at all as we drove past the event.  We rounded a bend and lost sight of them behind a hill, and when we came to the other side a few moments later, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ** I will soon obtain the video my passenger took on his cell phone and post in on YouTube.  I will title it &#34;Fireballs north of Pueblo, August 23, 2014&#34;  **<n>

To my wife’s request, I went to the other side of the house, with a beautiful view at the Aegean sea and the islands of Skiathos and Skopelos and took some night photos of the lights at the port of Skiathos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 2 photos I took seemingly had a strong lens diffraction, at least it seemed this way from a glance at the 3 inch screen.  So I continued taking night photos of the lights of Skiathos.  When I got really bored and looked at the sky thinking “maybe a couple more photos of the milky way before sleep,” I saw over my head for about 3 seconds a black disk flying with no sound and going south, towards the village of St. Anna.  When I started feeling my legs again, I remembered the 2 first “bad”photos and reviewed them again using the zoom rocket.  I don’t really know what these lights are, but they kept appearing each night and I kept photographing them.  As I am not a UFO or an X-files fan, I shrugged my shoulders and my life continued with nights out for dinner, walks, playing cards with friends, that is to say I didn’t spend much time sitting in the balcony and shooting in the dark until morning. But every night I devoted half to one hour to this strange occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately as today (August 29) we had to leave and return to Athens, last night was the last photos I took, but I’m pretty sure the lights will continue as we speak.  And since Internet access was limited in the village and we didn’t have a pc, we could only do this here in Athens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I send to you by email 5 photos (including the first 2 I mention above), but I have over a hundred, most of them the same (i was shooting with the &#39;3 images continuously&#39; mode) and some not really impressive.  Some of them are a bit out of focus or maybe a little shaken, most of them were taken with the camera sitting on the top of the wall balcony of the house and trying to lift the view by wedging under the camera the neck hanging cord or the lens protector etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to mention that the lights were not visible by the eye, every image was taken with a 10 seconds shutter speed or more, so as you can understand,  I was shooting at nothing, hoping that the lights would appear on the screen.  I also experimented by taking a couple of images with a 2.5 seconds shutter speed and the lights got really dark.  I have also taken some of the last images using RAW together with jpeg, in a hope to prove that the photos are not manipulated in any way.  If you think that these images are worth considering,  I would be happy to send to you more or all of them, as well as any relevant information i can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time!

I spotted four, large, round, pale green lights in a diamond or cross formation in the relative positions of 2, 5, 8 and 11 o&#39;clock.  The lights were equally spaced from each other and were clearly visible over the downtown skyline of Calgary.  All four lights travelled together at the same rate of speed as if they were tethered by an invisible thread.  The speed was comparable to that of a slow moving traffic helicopter which I see daily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the formation, it travelled horizontally from the west and steadily moved east - southeast, toward the main runway flight path (which runs in a North - South direction) of the Calgary Airport Authority.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon entering this area of air space, the four lights very suddenly and without hesitation, shot upward at approximately a 45° angle to the left (which could have been eastward), then disappeared without a trace or remnant of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event lasted six seconds.  The sky was overcast with possibly some light rain throughout the city, however, no weather anomalies in my area that obstructed my view.<n>

We were nearing our house so I reached in my pocket to get my house keys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I raised my keys up above my head so the street light would allow me to easily identify my deadbolt key. It was at this time that I noticed an orange light high in the sky to the north.  It appeared to be moving steadily from west to east with an even glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my fiancé to look up at the light and she easily found it as it was the only light in the sky.  We continued to watch this light source move for the next few moments, all the while I kept expecting to see some sort of navigation light (red/green strobes) but it remained consistently orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about ten (10) seconds we watched this strange light until it abruptly disappeared.

We were watching the stars and pointing things out to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At close to 11:00 PM, I noted what I thought was a satellite traversing the sky from south to north, so I got my friend on it.  It began fading and jumping to the left and back to the right again.  It would fade then reappear to the left or right – bright as it flashed back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing that eyes can make far objects appear to move, we were crosschecking our observations with each other.  The path also changed while it was jumping – it took a long hook as it went from south – north to east - west.  We were both taken back by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very high altitude event – it certainly could be compared to a satellite in terms of brightness and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is an engineer and a pilot – he was adamant about me not mentioning his name.  I have never seen one before t! hat had that jerky zig - zag motion. The sighting was probably 1-2 minutes long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the object was comparable to a satellite.  It traversed about a 30 degree arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first sighted it was about 45 degrees up from horizontal.  After about 20 seconds of these left to right to left jumping motions it simply faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it was straight out in front of us – still at about 45 degrees from horizontal.<n>

I know the difference between a plane at night in the sky and a satellite way in the distance and this was neither of those 2 things.  I kept watching to see if I would notice additional blinking lights like on a plane and there were none. the shape seemed to be diamond like and bright like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to grab 2 friends and showed them the very bright flying object which made no noises at all.  We all 3 of us stood there going what the hell is this??  Trying to make sense of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just dimmed to orange then disappeared.  It did not get obstructed by anything.

After listening to channel 590, CTVSS Northern Ontario News yesterday to confirm sightings of UFO&#39;s during 2014 in Canada and USA, specifically in Pennsylvania this past week, I&#39;m coming out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had company arriving on August 21st, a Thursday.  A lovely husband and wife team w their 7 month old daughter.  On Friday night, my husband and his friend decided they would camp out on the boat house deck and admire the sky which was filled with stars, not a site u see living in Toronto due to the light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say exactly what time it was but I&#39;m going to assume it was 10:30-ish, when I and my friend decided to go out to the boat house deck to see how the guys were doing, as it was cool and the dew was coming down.  I brought &#39;a&#39; glass of white wine w me to enjoy, my friend has had no alcohol at all as she is a new mom and I know your going to ask how much we&#39;d been drinking!  The boys were enjoying a couple of glasses of red wine, when all of a sudden when the three of them were looking off into the Western Sky at the time looking for the Space Station which can sometimes be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not visible that night, however, I was looking into the North-North East part of the sky when a orange yellow w a hint of red fireball appeared.  It seemed to have just beamed into view and gradually grew larger and larger when at one point it just stood still and then made a U turn and slowly went the other direction as the size grew smaller and then just disappeared!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had alerted my friends and husband when I initially saw the light, so all four of us saw the same thing.  There is no doubt in my mind, my husbands and those of our friends that we had witnessed a UFO sighting first hand!  I am curious as to whether anyone else saw this!<n>

The sky was clear, dark, and surprisingly, for a Friday night.  I could see an unusual amount of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But one light, which appeared to be a star was moving across the sky slowly, but fast enough to recognize it was indeed moving.  I stared at it, looked around, walked onto the street to get a better view, and looked up again.  It was still hovering, at a fairly consistent speed headed southeast from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled out my phone to take a video, but I could not get enough exposure so i put it up.  Then all of the sudden, like the flick of a light switch, it was gone.  I looked all over the sky for another sign, but failed to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i called my friend who I was texting to tell him about what I believed was a ufo, and as I was talking to him, another light, with the s! ame brightness and size sped across the sky, almost as fast as a meteor that reaches the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared in the center of the night sky and flew south over my treeline in a matter of a half a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if that second sight was the same object as the first, but they were two distinct sightings approximately 30 seconds apart from each other.<n>

It looked very strange to be a car or helicopter since I see them all the time along that hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light moved in a horizontal direction left, hovered there for a while and then right. It would pick up speed as it accelerated and then smoothly come to a stop each time it changed course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought that maybe somebody had a sophisticated laser device having some fun.

Report		 8-22-14   4:22  Am, at the Red Light Ritchie Hwy &amp; Jumpers Hole rd.  Take exit onto Md.  Rt. 100  proceed aprox. 1 mile.  4:24 am see what appears to be Jet landing at B.W.I.  Airport, which is about 3 miles up ahead.  Realize it is a large plane coming towards me, straight down the center of Rt. 100 Medium size plane much bigger than Piper cub , figured it was a Cargo plane.  Flying much lower than any plane I have ever seen that wasn’t coming in for a landing.  Since its flying directly at me, I figured I would get a good look to see what kinda plane this is.  It&#39;s very dark with thick cloud cover, no stars or moonlight. As it approached rather quickly, what I saw was a huge Rectangle with Qty :  4 large red and green lights.  Much bigger than traffic lights, I assume as big or bigger than sewer caps. Vividly clear green on front right and back left, and red on front left and back right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was simply Marveling at this technology as these lights had lumins/intensity of traffic signals but emitted no glare, aura, did not radiate downward or illuminate the craft at all. Were not convex or concave but completely flat..  diffused light that had no bright spots, light was evenly emitted so as just one perfectly round flat,  I thought landing lights. Strange that the road as far as I could see in front and behind me was completely empty with the exception of one car behind me about 2 car lengths.  As it got close I was leaning forward on the steering wheel looking almost straight up at the underneath of the vehicle.  Could only see a giant rectangle.  Could see no outline of an object, plane, helicopter. Seemed to be only couple hundred feet above me.  The one thought I was having is that this couldn’t be a plane, the rectangle way too wide for a fuselage of a plane.  At that point it turned clockwise 280 degrees and made a right turn as I am looking at it in 0.5 seconds.  If one was to count out loud “one thousand one”, being one second.  The object spun on an axis completely around by the time you get; one thous out of your mouth.  “And one” the second half of the word, the object had moved right turn 90 degrees and never changed or altered acceleration. 92 degrees actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the object would be passing over top of my truck and I had to look thru the moon roof.  Where I could see it was actually traveling at a slight different angle now that I had a 3rd reference point, my truck roof.  Making a maneuver of 270 degrees plus, there was forward momentum to take into account.  When looking skyward seeing only dark and a rectangle I saw a perfect right turn , but looking thru the moonroof it had turned right but was still sliding a bit forward at the same time, thus explaining the slightly more than a 90 degree turn it made would compensate for the forward momentum after a few seconds, and put it exactly on course. What was the rear of the vehicle, is now the front of the vehicle headed to my! right at 90 degrees.  So it&#39;s like polarity in the propulsion system had been switched simultaneously. Of course at this point my mind going into Shock was thinking only one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What did I just see?  This is certainly not possible,, could this have been a helicopter.  A helicopter could have easily fit inside this rectangle and couldn’t do a maneuver that quick that precise even if it were hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound at all, seemed to be about 300 ft high and must have been cloaked to imitate the sky color as I never was able to make out any object or shape other than a crystal clear rectangle of spectacular lights.  Always dreamed of being lucky enough to see a flying saucer or something.  Never in my wildest dreams thought I would see something like this practically in my face.  The figure was exact shape of a football field. I could fit my house and garage inside its length.  I figure the object was 80 to 150 ft long and 40 or 60 ft wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a shortened version of what I saw and the calculations.  Would love to talk to someone futher about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Area:  Where Upper James and the Lincoln Alexander highway intersect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))  I live in Hamilton Ontario on the mountain.  In the area where Upper James and the Lincoln Alexander highway intersect.  I was on my deck looking towards the south.  There is a large tree to the right of my backyard (southwest).  From behind the tree about 1 1/2 km away, about 1 km above the ground the object first came into my line of vision.  It moved at the speed of a slow moving plane, or helicopter going from south west to south east.  This was no plane or helicopter though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was disc shaped and its color was orange/red.  It was difficult to make out its exact shape because there was some kind of vapour effect that surrounded it.  Kind of looked like it was on fire.  But no flames were visible.  It just had this bright orangy red glow with a fiery mist that trailed behind it and surrounded it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it must have been a meteor.  But meteors don’t move that slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued at the same speed and headed southwest.  But as it was getting further and more of its back was facing me, its appearance changed.  The orange red colour seemed to fade off and there appeared to be this umbrella-like white-ish swirling vortex that seemed to be coming from the front of the object.  Perhaps this vortex was creating its orange red appearance?  It continued on its way until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted only a few minutes.  I do not know what it was I saw.  Let me be clear though.  I was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  I have always been a believer of UFO’s, aliens etc., and have spend 2 decades studying the phenomena.  I have met at least 4 people in my life who are first eye witnesses to UFO encounters.  I always dreamed of having my own experience.  But let me tell you, now that it has happened, my reaction is not what I thought it would be.  I am deeply bothered by it.  I am trying to be as rational as possible as to what I witnessed.  My description is as accurate as I can make it.  I would like some kind of rational explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it some kind of military vehicle?  I don’t know.<n>

I asked her, &#34;What is it?&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She raised her voice at me and told me to quickly run to the window.  Concerned by her actions I looked out the window.

Strange cloud shaped UFO looked like swiftly moving aurora borealis<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9:50pm in Lehi, Ut.  I was laying down looking at the sky and suddenly I saw these floating lights moving swiftly across the sky to the south west.  At first I thought it might be a dimly lit octocopter but I realized it was far to big and moving too fast to be that.  This was in the middle of a suburb neighborhood, a well populated area. I said to myself I think I just saw a UFO.  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe a minute or two had passed and I saw something else moving in the sky.  Moving in the same direction it looked like a mix between a dimly lit (yet palely shining) cloud and the aurora borealis.  Almost like the ‘Nexus’ from the Star Trek movie if it also fit the description of the dimly shining aurora borealis cloud.  It also looked as if you were looking at an extremely large seagull as it flew directly above you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 20 to 30 minutes I saw about 12 more of the cloud shaped UFO’s in various sizes.  I saw only one more of the first described UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all moving in the same south west direction though some of them would jaunt to the left or right but still remain in the main course to the south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was with me for about 5 or 6 of the cloud shaped ones.  She never saw the other kind I described.  Also there were two people walking together, a man and a woman, down the street who we asked if they noticed anything in the sky.  They said immediately they saw what they thought to be a large bird in the sky that had an odd look to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my account. I have never had anything like this ever happen before.  This was my first experience with any kind of UFO sightings and it was the strangest thing.<n>

I watched with my friend and then called my fiancé and 2 neighbors out.  I had said the kids were saying they seen this around 6pm and I didn&#39;t think anything of it.

He said it was the coolest thing.  It was a black triangle, that had a red triangle in the black triangle and a black triangle in the red triangle.  He said it was spinning really fast while flying but thought it was a jet.  He said the lights alternated.  The red light was only that would stay solid and the green would flash bright and it just circled back in forth and the object was spinning.

Immediately we thought it to be a planet but after concluding that it was far too bright to be a planet we continued to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds, remaining in the same location, the light began to dim gradually while retaining its initial color until it was no longer visible, after which it began to immediately glow again, far less bright than before and began to steadily move to the right.  As it moved, the object began to change colors from orange to red and back at about a 1 second interval. It was not the light pattern of a plane as the colors and interval were both incorrect.  The object followed its course until the tree line obscured it from view. After believing the object to be gone, we left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After calling the closest airforce base, only to find out it was closed, we returned to the same spot about 30 minutes later.  To our surprise a faint orange light, in the same position as the earlier one, began to glow brighter and followed the initial pattern, this time moving to the left however until it disappeared behind the treeline.  After this, another appeared more to the right, rising very slowly and then began to follow the original pattern to the right until it seemed to dissappear from view.  After this, another appeared in the orginal spot and the pattern was repeated by at least two others.  These lights appeared to hover for a longer duration than earlier.  During this time, I recorded two videos of the events. Another object appeared far to the right and appeared to move towards our location.  After witnessing this, we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 minutes later, we returned and began to watch the objects from a new location approximately 400 feet from the initial location.  There we witnessed two dim orange lights above the treeline.  One disappeared from view while the other began to glow suddenly, much to our surprise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around this time, a police helicopter flew toward the area of the lights.  The objects and the helicopter did not appear to make contact.  After watching the strange lights for about 15 minutes, one began to hover overhead and it appeared to have a cigar shape or at least what appeared to be a tail, although I am not certain of this.  This was odd as the videos recorded earlier revealed that the objects were in the shape of a circle flashing orange and white at a short interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object now flying near us emitted a strange humming sound, too quiet to be a helicopter as we heard a helicopter only a few minutes earlier.  After this we left the area and I did not see the objects again.  The humming sound however occurred throughout the night and was heard by several people throughout different locations in the forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our group split up and I was told by some of the people that were present during the initial encounter that one of the objects later dipped to avoid a plane.  However I am not sure that this happened and do not know the details as I was not present.  This happened at least an hour later.  At least 9 objects were observed that night by at least 7 people.  The majority of these objects appeared in the same location.<n>

The visibility of the sky was completely clear of any clouds, making all the stars and airplanes visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance of the object my boyfriend and I saw was much brighter, and larger than any star.  The object was traveling at the rate of which seemed to be a fast airplane, but had no blinking lights, as all of the airplanes seen in the sky flying at the same time had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object headed to what seemed to be directly across the sky right over us, bearing no sound, and suddenly appeared to change direction heading  south in the sky; away from us, toward a star in the sky.  We continued to watch it closely, almost in dismay; captivated, as the object still had no sign of any blinking lights and had no change in its form; staying a consistent bright sphere of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to then not just be flying south, but straight up toward the star just south of us.  As we watched my my boyfriend stated “look it’s starting to fade”, and then right before our eyes  the object just disappeared; which happened in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutely dumbfounded, the object appeared to be there in the sky one moment and then what I would describe as it telescoping, farther straight up in the sky, and as it did so, it seemed to have a reddish color as it vanished into the sky.  Something like out of a movie, as a star ship might go into hyper drive, and all you see is the afterburners of its jets. The whole occurrence lasted about 60 seconds, to a minute and a half long.  Regretfully, I have no footage as my boyfriend and I describe  to one another as being memorized, trying to figure out what exactly it was we were looking at, which when the object eerily disappeared in seconds from the sky, we had both agreed that what we had just seen was a UFO.<n>

I absent-mindedly was watching the clear night sky as I visited with my friend.  Looking eastward, approximately 75 degrees, almost straight overhead, I saw a red light suddenly appear, high in the heavens.  If I held my hand in front of my face, the light would appear to be 2-3 cm across in relation to my thumb.  It was difficult to judge the size of the object because it was so far away.  This light was bright red, and it manifested itself for approximately 2-3, seconds before it just as suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I judge the intensity of the light in this fashion, on a scale from 1 to 10:  if overhead blinking red lights on passing airplanes appear to me to be on a scale of 2-3, this light I judged to be an 8 or 9.  It was that much brighter than regular airplane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light disappeared, I then observed, for the next 1-2 minutes, a minute white light (scale: 1-2, barely discernible) moving quickly first due north, then stopping, then moving  at a right angle west, then stopping, and moving diagonally back to the south.  The movements were jerky and non- linear-that is to say, not in the &#34;smooth&#34;  and straight fashion of an airplane.  Then this little light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total amount of time from the sudden appearance of the larger red light until the smaller white light disappeared was approximately 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Special Agent, a Federal Investigator.

Within 20-30 seconds the top of the rip stretched until it was nearly double.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t stop staring and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t because out of nowhere a rocket-shaped object without any visable propulsion system appeared beneath the cloud &#34;rip&#34;.   It was smooth and round on the head of the ship and elongated and tapered off at the bottom in a rounded point.  Strange wings were located on either side (which looked almost like upside-down versions of the ship itself) and were strangely detached but moving with the ship regardless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship speedily moved up and through the rip and then proceeded beyond it but seemed to be dissolving once it had cleared the cloud, and was gone in 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No more than half a minute later, 2 government jets passed nearly over the rip and proceeded on. 10 minutes later a strong wind started blowing (Not even a breeze beforehand) and blew for maybe 15 minutes before dying down completely.<n>

We decided to hike to Grebe Lake, which was about 3.2 miles from the road.  We took off around sun up (6:00 AM) and drove from Fishing Bridge campground to the trail head at Grebe Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hiked into the lake and arrived around 7:40 AM.  There was fog on the lake and we waited for it to clear and set up our fly rods and equipment.  I took three pictures of the lakes and my friends and we moved into position just to the right of where the trail enters the lake.  I was standing ankle deep in the lake and my friend was standing right next to me.  Our other friends stood together on the other side of the trail entrance, about 100 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a sound that made me think it was an aircraft in the distance coming directly towards me from the direction of the trail.  I turned and looked directly over my head and directly behind me.  The sound increased and passed directly over my head and moved towards the lake center.  I saw two objects moving over my right shoulder and directly across the lake from me.  They moved in a tight formation of one slightly ahead and right of the slower one. They looked identical in shape, size and color.  They moved at the same speed.  They seemed to be the source of the sound I had heard, as the sound changed direction with their passing and the sound diminished and stopped as they disappeared.  The movement was faster than any thing I have ever seen.  They did not change aspect as they moved and seemed to be the same shape and color as they went over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was not an engine sound.  It was not a jet sound.  It reminded me of something large passing through the air, more of a pulsating sound.  It was loud, but nothing like a rocket or jet engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects looked round with a somewhat pointed nose.  There was no contrail, smoke or vapor trail.  The angle in relation to the ground appeared to include an impact with the hills directly behind the lake.  There was no impact sound or bang of any type.  It was very quiet when they disappeared.  There was no ambient noise on this desolate lake.  There was no flash or smoke associated with their disapperance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began yelling to my three friends and asking if they had seen the objects.  They said they did not see it but did hear it pass over us.  One friend said it sounded like &#34;incoming artillery fire&#34; when he was in the military.  As we spoke about it we heard the sound again.  This time not as loud and not directly over our heads.  It seemed to be off to the right of the trail head as you approached the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least two separate groups of campers on the lake.  We approached each group as we fished and walked around the lake.  The first group we met was a male and female, couple.  I asked if they had hear anything this morning right after the fog cleared and they said they only heard me yelling.  They asked if I caught a large fish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second group had approximately four young adults.  When I asked if they heard anything odd, they said &#34;No, why&#34;?  When I said I saw something strange, the one young man said was there a flash of light and a song?  I didn&#39;t respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days before we watched an F-22 conducting a close ground practice for an air show or something in Davenport, Iowa.  These things were much faster moving and made very little sound when compared to the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in many small and medium aircraft and helicopters.  I&#39;ve sky dived from 14,000 feet.  I attended and video taped the Paris Air Show in the early 80&#39;s and sold the video&#39;s through the magazine &#34;Aviation News and Space Technology.&#34;  I was a police officer for 32 years before retiring in 2006.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sent from my iPad<n>

Blue lights on the bottom and the lights appeared to be rotating.  A white light emanated from the craft in a spray around the object.  It was just hovering above Copley Square in Boston MA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed there long enough for me to go outside again and take a photo, though it was too distant and too dark for my camera to catch.  All it looks like on the photo is a pulsing star but this was no star and no stars have circulating blue lights on the outside on the bottom that go in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clearly this was some other kind of craft.  One if many I have seen this summer in Boston MA.  Though the others were spheres and multicolored.<n>

A very large green orb fell out of the sky, nearly straight downward, at an alarming rate of speed.  From my vantage point, it appeared to fall all the way to the ground.  I heard no sound.  I looked at the clock inside and immediately noted the time, 2:11 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the possibility that this might have been a meteor, however, this orb appeared much larger than any meteor I&#39;ve seen before and it did not leave a fire or smoke trail like many of the larger meteors I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 minute before I witnessed the falling green orb, there had been an airplane flying directly overhead from west to east.  It appeared to be an airliner flying at cruising altitude with all the standard flashing nav lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting of the green orb, I noticed the plane was no longer anywhere in sight, which I found peculiar because at the speed it was traveling it could not have made it all the way out of my sight within that short time period.  There was no cloud cover.<n>

I observed a bright neon green fiery sphere shooting rapidly across the clear sky traveling from WNW to ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere disappeared from view behind a nearby building. I heard no associated noise and saw no further activity.  At first, I thought it must be some type of fireworks, but it was larger than any firework I’d ever seen and there was no launching sound, traveling sound or any other balls of light.  Unfortunately, I had just minutes before shut off my dash cam which would have been sighted right towards the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I let out an exclamation and my partner asked what was going on.  I asked her if she’d seen what I’d just seen without being specific and she replied no.  We cruised the area for a while looking for signs of fireworks or anything similar and there was nothing and no one in the immediate area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total sighting was no more than 3 seconds in duration and I have never seen anything like it before.  I have absolutely no idea as to what it was I saw.<n>

The lights would do this for about 30 seconds, then stop for about 5 minutes , then start again.  The happened for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:15, I also noticed, what looked like, a shooting star heading in the general direction of the moving lights.  I thought it was a shooting star, until I realized there was some cloud cover in that direction, so the “shooting star” had to be in front of the cloud cover (which I thought was strange)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:30 pm, I got in my car and drove about a mile north to get a better view, overlooking Standley Lake.  However, by this time the lights had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was in the general direction of Rocky Mountain Airport.<n>

At 9:14 pm, we seen a circular formed object that was brilliantly lite up float over our house.  This object looked two hundred feet in diameter, had what looked like white strobe lights going in a circular fashion around the main body.  It was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about three minutes before I decided to call and report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have sworn that it was some sort of blimp, but having an aviation background I have not seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes after the initial call, we saw a couple of what looked like military jets, heading the same direction as the object.  I personally seen one and my wife said she seen a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came out of the Northeast and headed southeast.  Pretty awesome.<n>

It was completely noiseless and kept rising up above our house.  Upon returning outside with more people a mere 2 minutes later, the object was gone, and we searched the skies around our whole house.  It seemed to disappear upon reaching the sky above our house.  The exact location of this was Sanderling, North Carolina.  My fellow observers said they believed it to be 1) a drone, or 2) a Chinese lantern.<n>

Since no Cardinals have been coming around for a while and taking pictures of them are challenging at best, I looked up to see what kind of airplane was passing by.  I noticed a plane going by and listening to the roar of its engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a very slow moving object that had to be 100 above treetop level.  I had a very good look at this object which appeared to be oval shaped, white on the bottom and mid-tone to dark gray on the top.  The object also appeared to &#34;tilt&#34; like a plane would as it turns but then the object tilted back to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately got my camera out which I always carry with me and took 2 pictures of this thing.  I then switched over to video and took 1:10 video of it.  At the end I tried zooming in and also tried getting on the other side of the tree to recapture the object but I was not fast enough.  I reviewed the video later and found out it is out of focus after zooming in.  The pictures I took are crisp and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the video and pictures you can clearly see airplanes near the object but also not aware of it being near them.<n>

Both of us were raised by a retired USAF pilot, and we both know our military airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both spotted an aircraft moving from West to East above the highway in front of us (as we looked South ahead of us).  It moved at the speed of a jet fighter, probably going about 500 mph at 1-2 thousand feet.  Our view of the craft was a look at the side profile.  When each of us saw it we both thought that:  1) the color was black, on a sunny day with no clouds, and 2) The profile was a dead ringer for an SR-71 Blackbird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately discussed it on our CBs and found we had both thought the exact same thing, an SR-71.  I thought they were all decommissioned and went to the internet when we got home today looking for info that they have activated an SR-71.  I know the old  Roswell AFB has a very long runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could the government be bringing one of these to active service based on what has been going on in the world recently?  What a good place to test them.  If anyone saw a test, they could claim its another Roswell UFO nut.<n>

She thought it was a drone but after we looked for awhile decided it was not because we did not see the other parts on it that resemble a helicopter look to it.  It hovered and she said when I kept looking at it it moved away and then back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This walker I did not know.  She had come up from behind me and asked what I was looking at.  I was amazed she was even there because no one is ever on this path up because you have to be in shape.  We stared and talked and she said since we spotted it it was moving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it alone I waved to it and it hovered close but it saw her before I did and it backed up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the hill and she and I agreed it was a drone.

Witnessed 2 objects three minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While using the new camera and looking into the night sky almost straight up.  I saw one image with two luminous trapezium shapes with rounded corners moving slowly from north to south.  The craft was about three fingers wide at an arm&#39;s length and the length of the craft was half as long as wide.  A trapezium shape with quadric corners or rounded corners, one thus and one opposite (two wing shaped craft).  It was unique, it was the first time I&#39;ve ever seen this shapes or associated it with ufology .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later while reviewing my thoughts, the image I saw reminded me of the chrome grill of a BMW almost or close to the shape, a two trapezium shaped wing image.  Must look at the grill of a BMW to relate to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image was self illuminating as if the edge was lit up fluorescently while the area in between was less illuminating.  The color was that of a very dim fluorescent bulb with a blue hue. I didn&#39;t question the validity of the object.  I just knew it was one of a kind and it was physically there in the sky not projected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three minutes later, 11:00pm, another craft exactly the same moved north to south across the sky, making 1 or 2 degree correction turn to the east.  Each pass of the craft lasted about 15 seconds.  There was no sound associated with the sightings. The fluidity and grace of the traveling crafts sent a rush through my body - wow is all I could think- what an experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing came out in the pictures, that&#39;s because I wasn&#39;t experienced with the camera or ready for the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Twenty minutes later, my son and I were scanning the skies.  In about the same location as the 10:57 and 11:00 pm sighting we saw a blinking or solid streaking light that went in 1 or 2 second intervals and that happened 5 or 6 times all in the same area not moving through the sky.  The same blink or streak repeating in the same spot in the sky.  (no sound)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was that of an incandescent light bulb. The size of the blink or streak was the same as a small meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all worth the skeeter bites we endured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on the west side of the Salt Lake City Valley in Utah.<n>

But, suddenly, one light made a left turn leaving the formation. But the three lights stayed in my field of view of my glass (40X10). After some seconds and just before leaving my horizon, the three lights return in they original formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My last observation was 17 August at 10:45 in the night.

Last night me, my girlfriend, and my parents all saw something &#34;unconventional&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing what I saw, I wanted to see if anyone else in the area had seen anything unusual, and that&#39;s when I saw an article by a local reporter on WTMJ about lights over Waukesha. Let me tell you our story:  Last night, Aug 17th, I&#39;d say around 9:30ish, didn&#39;t look at the clock but somewhere between 9 and 10, me and my girlfriend were out in front of my parents’ house letting the dogs out.  I happened to look up at the night sky and it was such a clear night and so many stars.  As I was looking up, something bright and moving fairly fast towards the Southeast caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was positive it was a satellite as I have seen them time and time before whenever I camp.  I ran inside and told my parents to come outside quick to see the satellite moving across the sky.  We went out in the backyard, meanwhile my girlfriend was in the front yard watching the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went out on the back patio, I was surprised that the &#34;Satellite&#34; wasn&#39;t further to the east because of the speed it was travelling before.  In fact, it was still moving but it was as if this thing got real close to us.  At first it was a small little dot, just like how a satellite appears.  But this thing was getting closer to us because the size got bigger and that light was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we knew it wasn&#39;t a satellite because satellites are orbiting around the earth and don&#39;t really change their depth level, at least that I know of.  It wasn&#39;t any plane we&#39;ve ever seen because there were no blinking lights, nothing that you see on planes.  In fact, there was no sound at all.  If it were a plane, it would have definitely been low enough for us to hear the plane roar.  Then it changed course from a straight line, curved just slightly, turned smaller and morphed into a red light as it was passing us and disappeared.  There were no clouds for any plane to have hid behind, ruling out that this was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a meteor or anything like that because there was no tail, or trail of debris behind this thing.  It was an object, very, very, bright.  In fact it was so bright, you could almost see the light beams emitting from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I can’t be positive, but it almost looked like it was a bunch of little lights all making up one big bright light. ! I can&#39;t say I am 100% on that though because it was far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 100% sure though that this was a first that any of us had ever seen.  There was also a shooting star that passed right in front of this thing only going south west.  This bright object was moving south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I just thought it was really, for lack of a more captivating word &#34;interesting&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have a nice day and thanks for your time<n>

It was a ball of light vary bright moving slower than a normal plane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very weird, I thought, so I ran in to the house and got the first person I seen which was my sister in law.  I told her what I thought I seen in the sky.  She came out with me and I went to show her the object but it was to late it was gone.  As I looked for it, she spotted it over South above the elevator.  I told her that it couldn&#39;t of been the same one I saw at first. It had moved to far to be the same one.  We stood watching the object move slow slowly across the sky.  As we followed it moving Southwest it was gaining elevation until it finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She went in the house and got her husband and my wife so they could witness these objects in the sky.  After it was gone we seen 3 more one moving to the east and the other 2 moving southwest in different locations.  They would gain elevation and disappear and reappear in different locations.  The one moving towards the east was flying low and was Just as bright as the others until the brightness went away and turned a red orange color for less than a minute then went back before it disappear also.  It was amazing and weird, at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness did not indicate a time for the sighting.  PD))<n>

I was standing on my back deck which faces eastward.  It was dark outside and very quite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright golden or deep yellow oval shape light went overhead traveling eastward (I know it is east because the sun rises from this same vantage point in the mornings into my kitchen).... I don&#39;t know how high the light was because of the spotty cloud cover but it was traveling slowly - maybe 20mph - 30mph ?...but made no sound and I mean NO SOUND at all.....I was thinking what the hell was that when the 2nd one went overhead in the exact path as the first....and perhaps 10 sec later a 3rd in the same line.....by now I was a little scared  and was waiting to see if a forth light came but none did.... The oval lights (all three of them) were the size of a basket ball but without know how high up they were it doesn&#39;t really help I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this and was a little shaken by the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

She appeared to be shocked by something and had forgotten about the dogs until I slowed almost to a stop; she then reined the dogs in to give my car room to pass by.  I drove into my garage and then my neighbor called me over to show me something in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a large, very bright orange fireball object moving in a straight line away from our position heading North-Northeast.  My girlfriend then came out to meet us and observed the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor stated the object had come from the South directly towards her at a very low altitude.  She stated that right when I was turning in to pass her, the object changed direction just as it was above my neighbor’s house which is directly behind mine.  She repeatedly commented on how low the object was flying towards her (I later asked her if it was as high as a commercial plane flying at approximately 5,000 feet that was very distinguishable and she said the object had been much lower).  I asked her if she could make any features out on the object before it changed direction and she stated that it was circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the fireball object continue on its flight path for approximately 20-30 seconds until it appeared to gain significant altitude and eventually appear like other stars in the sky before finally winking out of view.  I estimate the object’s distance to us at the closest point of approach to have been approximately 3-5 miles away.  There were a few commercial aircraft visible during the flight of the fireball object and immediately after it disappeared.  Regardless of altitude, all of the commercial aircraft displayed lights and a few of them could be heard.  The orange fireball object displayed no lights and made no sound despite the high velocity at which it appeared to be traveling across the sky (I would estimate at least 4-5 times the speed that you would observe a commercial airline pass overhead).  It also did not have any type of visible tail or vapor trail despite its high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a minute after the orange object disappeared, my girlfriend was discussing the object with my neighbor when I observed a blue and white light approximately 600-700 yards away, above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was bright (it reminded me of a firework) and falling towards the ground.  It was visible for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared.  We discussed the fireball object and what it possibly could have been with my neighbor for a few minutes and then went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:00PM (EST), I stepped out onto my deck to watch the sky to see if I would see anything else.  After about five minutes, I saw another bright object traveling from the south toward my position (it was nowhere near as close as the first object so I could not discern any additional characteristics).  I could immediately tell it was not a typical commercial aircraft so I called out to my girlfriend to come look and we both grabbed our iPhones in case it approached close enough to try to record it.  The object appeared to be approximately 12-15 miles away and had not yet reached Phoenixville.  As my girlfriend was trying to ready her iPhone to record video, her flash came on for a few seconds.  At the same time the object changed its flight path approximately 110 degrees to its starboard and flew due east.  It remained visible for only a few more seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned and looked back towards the direction the original object had traveled in and observed what was possibly a third object on the horizon above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was too far away and only visible for about 5 seconds, making it impossible to determine what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went inside to conduct some research and confirmed that the Perseids meteor shower had been most active between August 9th-14th; however, these meteors were supposed to appear to come from the constellation Perseus which was North of my house at the time of incident and not from the South like we observed.  Additionally, most Perseids are estimated to disappear in the Earth’s atmosphere at heights above 50 miles.  The object we observed with my neighbor was significantly lower.  The object also did not leave a tail as one might expect if it were a meteor.  I also have never heard of a meteor that suddenly changed directions, let alone one that gained altitude until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next came across a similar incident that had occurred in the vicinity of Maisfield Road in Phoenixville, PA.  The recollections of that person’s observations were eerily similar to what we saw.  That incident occurred on December 23, 2013.  I did not find anything to indicate there was any type of meteor shower or other phenomena during that time frame.  If anyone is interested in my account, I would strongly advise you to read about this incident as well as it appears to possibly be the same type of object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also discussed the possibility of the object being some type of rocket, but again there was no visible tail and no sound despite the high rate of speed.  Additionally, my girlfriend and I had observed the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) probe launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia from our house on September 6, 2013 and it was a totally different experience than the fireball object we observed.  The NASA rocket launch had a clearly defined tail and was without a doubt much, much farther away.  I do not know of any rockets that would fly so low, yet leave no vapor trails and make no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third theory was discussed of the object possibly being a Chinese lantern or some other balloon type object.  My opinion is the object was too large and bright to be either and that the sheer speed that it moved at (4-5 times faster than the visible planes in the sky) would preclude it from being such an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly we discussed the possibility of the object being some type of drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), possibly out of Willow Grove Naval Air Station (NAS).  I have never seen a drone in flight, but I do not believe it would be bright orange at night to attract unwanted attention, nor that it would not make any noise if breaking the sound barrier.  According to local media reporting, Willow Grove NAS does not physically launch/recover any drones; the base is used only as a remote controlled command location.  The object we observed at close range was circular and did not resemble any known types of UAVs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 13 years of military/law enforcement experience and have worked in environments where I have observed numerous types of military aircraft in operation.  I have also spent many nights out on the open ocean thousands of miles from any land observing the night sky and constellations.  I have never seen anything like the bright orange fireball that I saw on the 16th and I cannot at this point even venture a guess as to what it might have been.<n>

It was scouting/scanning an area of what appeared to be about a 2 miles or so left to right – sometimes making erratic motions.. but mostly hovering at times and then accelerating rapidly – immediately from the point of motionless – to the left or right/ then smoothly and rapidly moving in horizontal directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood – mouths agape – for about 20 minutes staring at this floating object .. and then it occurred to me to observe the other bright lights that were in the sky – because I know that ships have been spotted in clusters – and to my astonishment  - I saw the very same thing off to the right in the sky – closer and more above our heads – closer to the coastline.  I exclaimed “look!  There’s another one!! “and then looked off to the left where we had originally seen what I had thought to be Venus and Jupiter or Mars.  They were closer to each other than the other ones were.  They also, were both moving – side to side – left to right in their respective areas.  Each UFO was in their own area.  Each one was scouting/scanning/moving in their different width of the sky.  The third one we spotted and also the first one we noticed  moving  – had the largest scope of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to cover 2 or 3 miles left to right in the sky. Whilst the second we saw off to the right and closer to the shoreline was more like a mile or so to the left and right and sometimes moved in an oval shape.  Then the other two (the first two originally seen) I studied next.  They were also moving in what appeared to be their own individual parts of the sky (much closer together than the others)…with a back and forth / left to right/ sometimes oval movement.  I would like to note also that they all appeared at some time or another to move diagonally through the sky and then horizontally – immediately after moving diagonally!!  They all made movements of a nature that I have never before seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also extremely bizarre cloud formations to the left.  Not a cloud or star elsewhere in the sky.  Except for massive/ massive clouds that appeared strikingly as an angel / kneeling /head bent / holding an open book.  Very distinct crisp cloud formation – as if a large picture drawn.  The massive “wings “of the angel were a different type of cloud.    This cloud formation hovered for an hour in one spot over the sky.  People brought chairs out to sit and watch it.  Surfers stood and pointed at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seven of these orbs were spotted in all.   There was a bright light over our heads and it was moving in the same fashion as the other ones.  It was the only one that appeared to move – back and forth – in a very small space of the sky…whilst one off over the water moved back and forth in a large area.  That one rippled with colors – almost like the phosphorescence that underwater creatures have.  What appeared to be an odd form of twinkling we believe to be a fading and rippling effect.   These orbs all disappeared gradually at different times.  They would just disappear.  Their brightness and intensity did not seem to be hindered or fade away as the sun rose.  They just vanished one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last one ever seen was the one we had noticed movement from originally (the third one spotted).  It seemed to be more active – color wise for some reason – than the others.  Maybe it was closer to us than the others.  The ones directly over the shoreline- over our heads - just appeared to be bright white light…whilst said orb over the ocean was bright white but with waving colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these seemed to be about a mile and a half to two miles high in the sky.  Four of the orbs appeared to be in a diamond formation.<n>

It was somewhat cloudy, but I noticed between my home and my neighbor&#39;s house 4 disc-shape objects hovering fairly low, as they appeared large, unlike stars.

I walked to the middle of our homes to view it better and  I was trying to figure out if it were spot lights of some sort from a local park or something else but after approx 3-4 minutes the whole formation began to move slowly towards the back of mine and my neighbor&#39;s home between our houses, at which time I ran into my home to get my camera and iphone and ran back out to the front of my home and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to run toward the back of my house in the back yard to see if I could see anything but nothing was noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then checked a bit on line to see if any sightings were reported on long island but found someone him did anyone else call he said no.

I was talking on the phone (speaker) with a friend, when I told him I saw a strange light hovering to the NE of me, near Holt Rd.  I told him I thought it was a UFO, and it looked like the top of a tower, even though I knew there was no tower there.  It was about 300 ft up.  About 10 other cars would have seen this too.  I spotted it right after I passed Rundle Rd..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on it and could tell I was getting closer and closer to it.  I could tell it was right over Holt Rd., as I was now just beside it.  I knew if I turned north on Holt, I could get out to see it, as I was now basically right below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still talking to my friend and told him not to hang up.  I found a place to park just north of the group mail boxes right across from Bob&#39;s towing, a junk yard and a car dealership.  From the time I turned at the traffic lights to park there, took approx. 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out and immediately looked up, but the object had just flown off in an easterly direction towards Bowmanville (3 kms away).  I could see it moving away and then out of sight.  To have moved that fast from Holt Rd to over Bowmanville would require a speed of 300 kms per hr I am guessing.  I have yet to do the math.  I had no time to use my phone to get a photo.  I would have if it had not taken off.  If I had had a gun I would have shot it down just so I could prove what i! t was.  I may never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was hoping it was a Chinese lantern as it would explain things.  I had seen these lit and flown, last year at my sister&#39;s wedding.  But of course they don&#39;t sit stationary in one spot and then dart off at unimaginable speeds.  The object was round and a fiery orange colour that glowed and I was close enough that I could actually see the glow shimmering.  Because it would have appeared as the light on top of a tower, I am judging that it was 300 feet up, and that it was from between 5-20 feet in diameter.  There is no way it was more than 600 feet up.  There was no sound that I could hear either.  This is the typical type of sighting that others have reported since the 1960s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend thought it might have been a drone.  My questions are: do drones hover?  Do they look circular and fiery orange at night?  And can they travel at phenomenal speeds?   I am not a believer in paranormal events like ghosts or alien abductions, but I know what I experienced and I will label it as a UFO.  My family and I also saw one back in around 1980 at Gravenhurst, ON, but that one has already been reported.<n>

I was on Carroll Avenue between Carroll and Ethan Allen Avenue.  The event lasted around 10 minutes from 9:40pm until 9:50pm.  I was not the only one who witnessed these objects there was a women there she looked to be of Ethiopian decent she also saw the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Objects in question were three large bright orange almost sun colored objects with no distinguishable shape.  They really just looked like floating orbs of light. They were moving in a manner that I have never seen before and were impossible for any Earth based terrestrial aircraft to achieve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times the objects would just completely disappear from sight and then reappear in a completely different location to far away for any normal aircraft to achieve with known technology.  At times they would travel in a straight vertical motion in a way that only a rocket would be able to move and move directly at one another one coming down and the other going up and then meeting in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually all three U.F.O left the atmosphere traveling straight up in the air and then eventually the light just disappear not because they were too high to see but just out of nowhere the light just vanished.<n>

We all started looking at it around the same time.  We were very surprised because it didn&#39;t behave like anything we had ever seen in the sky before.  It was moving faster than a plane.  It seemed close; under 10,000 feet.  The quality of the light was warm like fire and it twinkled slightly.  There was also a low hum that accompanied it.  It seemed to be traveling very smoothly and gaining altitude slightly as it moved out of our view.  It then disppeared into what looked like a very black dot; an area much darker than the surrounding night sky.  About 20 min later it appeared again, this time stationary in the sky.  It expanded slightly and again disappeared into a black dot.  Only I saw it the second time.  The rest of the group had already left.  We had no experience of missing time or contact with the object.<n>

I saw bright white dot in the sky just south of the sun and just above it as well, I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it but when I looked back up about ten minutes later and it was still there, I thought it was a bit strange...  Please keep in mind that the moon was also visible in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in my house and watched TV for a bit, and then decided to go out on my front porch to see if the object was still there, and it was.  It had moved to the west a bit but at about the same elevation as before, this was around 0930.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out again around 1000, and it was still there, but it was now due south at about the same elevation.  I checked again around 1010, and it was still present but a few degrees farther west.  When I checked again around 1020 it was gone.  It seemed to track as if it were stationary in space and the Earths rotation was causing the movement.  I&#39;m assuming this was some sort of satellite that was reflecting light from the sun or possibly indirectly from sunlight reflected from the moon.  To my eye and through a 9X rifle scope it was about the size of a .22 caliber bullet held at arms length.<n>

There was an extra light outside the circle to the right.  That light was faded and less defined.   The light  did not look like it was attached to the circle but  it moved at the same time the circle moved.  Then the circle disappeared.

I often go out to do sky watches at a BLM Bocco Mtn. recreation site Lat.39*46&#39;29.35N Long. 106*42&#39;21.14W. Over the years I have received numerous reports from locals who have had good UFO sightings in the area, which is dominated by Castle Peak to the west. There are power lines that run north and south over the parking area, and there is no lights visible at this location. Tonight the sky was mostly clear and I parked with my pick-up truck facing due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:50 hours I observed a bright light rise over the ridgeline to the east over the Muddy Creek area.  The ridgeline is 9-10 miles away and reaches over 8900 feet. At first I thought it could be landing lights of a plane on approach to the Eagle County airport which is about 15 miles west, as I had gotten use to seeing aircraft coming through this area at night before. Actually the airport was closes for flight operations after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still thinking it was an aircraft I was surprised to see a second light rise up over the ridgeline. I thought this was unusual to see two aircraft on approach and watched as the two lights ascended when suddenly the first light switched off. I got out of the truck with my binoculars and I-phone, of which I took four photos. I scanned the sky where the first light disappeared with 7x50 binoculars but could not see any standard aircraft flashing lights. I viewed the second light with the binoculars and also saw no flashing lights. Shortly thereafter the second light switched off. Again no flashing lights were seen. I probably had these in view for 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-12 minutes later a third light appeared to my left and viewed through the drivers side window, which was up. This light was larger and closer than the first two, and I watched it for a few seconds while reaching for my I-phone and binoculars, and was preparing to get out of the vehicle when this light switched off.

He was on I-70 coming down Vail Pass around MM 181-182 at 0530. He saw no flashing aircraft lights, just the pulsating red light.<n>

8/15/14 06:45|Austin|TX|Circle||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MRcY-0V1Y  http://www.keyetv.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/ufo-lights-up-houston-airspace-201|8/22/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112515.html|552|ndxe201408| Military Chopper pursues a UFO over central Massachusetts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, at 9:30pm, a relatively slow moving, large and conspicuous (military?) helicopter flew from southeast to northwest under a moonless, starry sky about 50 knots - half the speed of a typical  &#34;life flight&#34; chopper or news chopper.  It had a signature deep sound to its rotors like a heavy military war helo.  I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it other than noticing its slow speed of travel and bright &#34;red/green&#34; FAA signal lights for civilian airspace.  I assumed it was just a nighttime training mission… It should be noted that this is not heavily traveled airspace by helicopter air traffic -- only rarely do we see any helicopter at all.  Typically, it&#39;s only passenger jets descending into Logan airport at 15,000&#39;, and the occasional weekender in a Cessna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me as odd was hearing the exact same chopper (that signature, deep military sound like a Blackhawk, plus the same signal lights on a black chopper, indicating port/starboard) 20 minutes later coming back from the direction it had traveled initially (this time NW to SE), and on the same vector path and altitude (about 500 feet) and speed...  So... I stepped out from my porch and looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when I noticed it was &#34;chasing&#34; (more like &#34;escorting&#34;) what was first one dim light and then which became two lights, lights which were a bluish color, but obvious and present.. also conspicuous but considerably less bright (exactly similar to the magnitude of a low-orbit satellite in a dark night sky...  Actually I&#39;d say &#34;identical.&#34; The lights were not associated with a visible craft (unless the craft was tiny -- like softball sized?) but they were surely too far ahead of the chopper to be an extension of the chopper:  The lights were travelling about 50ft from each other -- one slightly ahead of the other -- together, at about 1/8 to a 1/4 of a mile ahead of the chopper, travelling at the same speed and vector and altitude as the helo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my experience, the objects were going too fast to be civilian drones, and were &#34;silent&#34; under the sound of the chopper.  They seemed to glide effortlessly ahead of the helicopter as if free from our Earthly propulsion systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was alien craft, you&#39;d think the military would use jets to pursue...unless they were testing a drone system and needed a chopper to pursue because it flies too slow for a jet to follow.  Either way, it felt &#34;planned,&#34; but then again in civilian airspace, even the drone would need proper FAA green/red port and starboard indicators.  They did not.  Something was very wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say the whole episode felt very &#34;off,&#34; and is absolutely venture to say, &#34;paranormal.&#34;  This is a heavily populated suburb, though somewhat rural so stars are bright.  They chose a moonless night to transport or escort *something.*  I believe they were low and slow to glide below the ubiquitous radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a web search I did find a similar report in this database, as follows -- which is how I found your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Related?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred:  3/10/2013 12:00 (Entered as : 3/10/2013 12:00)<n> <n><n> Reported:  3/10/2013 10:17:04 AM 10:17<n> <n><n> Posted: 4/12/2013<n> <n><n> Location:  West Springfield, MA<n> <n><n> Shape: Cigar<n> <n><n> Duration:2 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched a Red and White helicopter follow and stay with the ufo from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ufo was white with no no markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a drone nor a plane.&#34;<n>

The middle light in the arrangement was orders of magnitude brighter than anything in the visible sky.  The other two lights were also brighter than anything else in the sky besides the center light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be about three or four times the size of a radio tower light or about a quarter of the size of a full moon.  I would estimate that the lights were between 1 and 2 miles high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle light in the vertical arrangement appeared to be the center or focal point for the other lights to move around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon closer inspection, I noticed there were smaller, whiter lights that were not connected to the vertical arrangement that would move up, down, left,! and right.  All of the smaller white lights not involved in the original vertical arrangement of lights would move independently but would all return to the center light, which was the brightest, before finally disappearing and then reappearing again seconds later at another point in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took video of this for two minutes before the lights, which were moving south, fell below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed in the direction of the lights and about 4 miles further south (going towards Lincoln County, NC) caught the arrangement of the three main lights through a tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped my vehicle, the three brightest lights were no longer in a vertical formation but a triangular formation. At this point the lights appeared higher in the sky, which I assumed meant I was positioned more “underneath” the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon inspecting the lights, and within a minute of seeing the object at the second location, two of the lights merged and then slowly drifted to again merge with the brightest center light.  I was not able to video this formati! on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then passed below the tree tops and I continued to follow south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three minutes later and two miles further south by southwest I witnessed the brightest main light for a few seconds before it continued to move south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the last visual confirmation of the object(s).<n>

It looked to be about 10 to 12 feet tall by maybe 5 to 7 feet wide.  (I thought it looked like a big jellyfish without tentacles.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate it was only 40-50 feet off the ground when I first saw it come over the neighbor’s house, moving upward and across the sky from North to South.

I saw a slow, silent moving craft with 3 very large round lights in a semi-triangular pattern, flying lower  than a normal	 aircraft, but not extremely close to the ground either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were so bright that you could make out the shape of the craft which also seemed to be semi-triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are lots of trees around my house so I lost complete view after about 2 minutes.  I’ve seen planes at night before but never one like this.<n>

This light also lasted only about a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are not the first lights in the sky our group of friends have seen.  One of my friends has seen numerous lights like the ones we saw last night (the 13th) and I also saw a light appear in the sky a couple weeks ago while we were at a bonfire on the edge of town.  This light looked like when you take a picture of any light source, but move the camera while taking it and are left with a squiggly line of light.  This light also appeared for only a second or two, but was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen shooting stars before but the balls of light were too bright, quick, blue-white and sudden to be shooting stars and the line of light was nowhere near straight (squiggly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The object appeared from my right side at tree top level from up river (my property being on the WV side of the Shenandoah) and at first I thought it to be a helicopter with a search light, perhaps searching for a drowning victim in the river as sometimes happens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as the object approached it was silent, grew larger in diameter, until at closest approach, appeared grapefruit size at arm&#39;s length perspective from me and continued floating along the river valley at relatively high speed--then gained altitude over the mountain range at the Potomac confluence and color began to shift to more of a red yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then continued to float/fly and gain altitude until it appeared to look like a star in the sky and eventually disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could possibly have been some sort of drone, but I don&#39;t think so.  It was too silent and had no searchlights or navigation lights.<n>

The airliner traveled from East to West at a high altitude. It was at this moment when a bright orange fireball in the sky caught my attention.  The fireball appeared as a oversized star and I assumed it could be a possible satellite in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled from West to East.  It moved slightly faster than a commercial airliner.  The object appeared as a orange fireball in the Western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew direct overhead, the light faded away.  Although there was no light or glow to the object, I could see the object continue in the sky to the far East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the object appears to be larger with no lights.<n>

They were flying much lower than most airplanes fly here and about the same distance away from the ground as helicopters fly.

The formation made almost no sound.  on the left-hand side (as i looked up) i counted around 13 lights.  flying right next to that craft to my right hand side was what appeared to be a regular run of the mill airplane.  I watched them fly directly over head and i was very shocked that i had not heard anyone else talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been around 2100 hours because it was dark... the craft were flying rather low, i couldn&#39;t even really estimate a &#39;normal&#39; height for a commercial airplane.  I got the impression that the craft was being escorted and that maybe it was air force 1.  As stated above i often see military craft fly that same route back and forth daily, but I know of no airbase in the direction they fly that is in America.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My grandparents own a small cottage in a semi-residential area with other small summer-houses around them.  The area is beautiful and serene, and every evening we enter the dirt roads of the farms across our main expressway to the town&#39;s center to spot deer.  This tradition has been carried down from generation to generation, as my family has lived in Michigan since the mid 17th century.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The anomaly I witnessed tonight was strange and erie, yet fascinating; an orb of light darted and hovered about 19 miles to the side of of our car for about a minute or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had stopped to watch the sunset, a beautiful one at that, and watched the dazzling colors of maroon and orange descend to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, after the sun set, my grandmother noticed a single orange light hovering in place for about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a little bit, but as we started the car up, the engine made the usual raucus noise that it does.  It was at this time that I noticed the light darting up to the right of its former position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if it was the engine or our presence that startled it, but as it flew away it began to morph colors to match the darkening sky, and within seconds was gone, camouflaged like a chameleon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have alway believed in life beyond our solar system, and even intelligent life.

In the sky at that time there was only two clouds visible and i was walking out my door and something caught my eye and i looked in that direction to see this sight.  The craft appeared to be internally lighted as a light bulb would look with a lamp shade around it.  The two clouds appeared to be around a half a mile from each other and the craft flew slowly from one cloud to the other.  When i first saw the flying craft it was already out from behind or in the first cloud and was making its way towards the second one in a very slow fashion almost stopping several times before proceeding forward.  This craft was huge and i got the feeling it wanted me to see it and almost seemed to be giving me a show if that makes any sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there in my back yard and watched this craft make its way to the other cloud for at least two minutes and just before it reached the second of the two clouds it cloaked and disappeared completely right before my eyes.  I want to make it perfectly clear that this craft didn&#39;t disappear in the cloud or behind it.  It disappeared before reaching the second cloud.I beleieve it wanted me to see it and was making sure i witnessed the event.I have no idea why i walked out into me back yard when i did and i had no reason to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft i saw was cigar shaped pinched at the ends slightly.  No noise could be heard coming from the object and was completely silent.  The time of the incident was 9:30am and the sky was completely clear except for the two clouds the object was clearly using to hide itself in although this object could park right over your house in broad daylight and you would never even know it was there.  I am just puzzled that this sighting was not reported in the news at all because it was so visibly clear and so massive in size and the time of day it was.  Concidering this object was clearly visible in the capitol of California it should have been seen by literally thousands of people but never even was reported in the news.<n>

It was an orange light that was difficult to gain focus on so I put on my glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light slowly changed to a line that was tilted up on the left side to about 50 degrees.  This line seemed to stay in the same spot and changed shape slightly as I was driving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 6 minutes the light seemed to gain momentum as it traveled East Southeast, eventually moving over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This glowing orange line seemed to be reflecting the rising sun which had not yet peaked over the mountain range.  It was not a celestial body as it moved far too fast.  That being said, this line was very high altitude and moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am documenting this in case other saw the same thing, but it could easily have been a very rare anomaly that occurs naturally but I have never seen anything like it.<n>

The lights were red and white, although I did see other colors (green),  I thought it was maybe too far away and I couldn&#39;t make it out well enough....<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next night I ran inside to get my boyfriend who had assured me the night before it had to be a plane, this time he got a closer look and during our observation we watched a minimum of 3 of them.

A huge fire ball the size of a house with a tail and smoke behind the tail it was quite and slow moving.|9/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/113/S113514.html|596|ndxe201408| Triangle craft with three red lights; one on each corner. It also had smaller white lights that flashed along the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were in our front yard watching the Persieds meteor shower between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 12, 2014.  We had a pair of binoculars with us to see the stars better.  I walked inside the house for a moment when I heard my husband yelling my name in an urgent manner so I ran back outside and he was looking up at the sky in Northwest direction.  I looked up and saw a red light low in the sky, moving slowly from North to South directly over a house about 4 houses down.  As it came into my view, a second light was directly behind it.  The distance between the two lights was about four times the distance of the length of a helicopter.  As I watched, a third red light came on next to the second red light making a shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I noticed was how huge the object was. I had never seen anything even close to this size; it was enormous.  I also noticed there was no sound at all.  The object was extremely low so it was odd that it was completely silent.  As soon as I realized this was no ordinary object, I called for my son who also came running outside and witnessed this as well.  I had the binoculars at the time so I watched the object through the binoculars for the remainder of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see that the three lights were large red spheres on the bottom of the craft and there were much smaller rectangular white lights along the side of the craft that flashed on in a sequence.  As I watched through the binoculars all three red lights stayed on at once for a short time and then one of them turned off but I could still see the sphere, it was dark grey or black.  All of a sudden all of the spheres turned white at the same time for a couple seconds and then two of the lights turned off while only one white light remained.  I could still see the spheres with the binoculars, but when I looked at the object without the binoculars I could only see the white light.  At this point the object appeared to be an ordinary aircraft with my naked eyes.  We continued to watch the object for a few minutes until it was too far to see anymore.<n>

It travled in pretty much a strait line until it disapeared beihind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to try and get my wife to come out, but she wouldn&#39;t.

But I do remember it being very clear that night, because as I was standing outside the bingo hall with another person I had mentioned it to her and then looked to my right and saw 3 star like objects in a perfect triangle formation. What struck me odd about these lights was the fact that A)  They were in a perfect triangle formation and B)  They were a yellowish orange color and quite bigger than any normal star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we started to talk I thought &#34;well, I guess it&#39;s just a strange looking star that I have never seen before,&#34; but then something very odd happened.  The &#34;star&#34; closest to us which would&#39;ve been the one at the top point of the triangle shape broke apart from formation and began to move slowly towards us.  It continued to move like this, until it was right above us and out of site beyond the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned.  I don&#39;t know whether this w! as truly a UFO or not. But it was strange that it moved so slowly away from us after staying put for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I don&#39;t know whether anyone can offer me any explanations or similar accounts, but I would be intrigued to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It seemed to be moving to slow  to be a plane ,there were no running lights and it wasn&#39;t shooting a beam of light like a spotlight on a helicopter.  I pointed it out to my friend and we watched it for about a minute together ,agreed it was strange ,and parted ways.

We keep seeing UFO&#39;s in our area at night.  They usually appear as a bright star that moves different directions.  We reported a few years ago a huge craft over our house on this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my son and I were freaked out and stayed up half the night afraid something would happen.  As we were going to bed, I noticed my radio in the bedroom had some serious interference.  I started to feel sick and dizzy and had an over all feeling of being watched, but was going to bed.  I laid in bed feeling really uneasy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later my 17 year old son came running up the stairs into my room, saying he felt like he was being watched and had a feeling like something was about to happen and his chest hurt.  He said his cell phone has no service which was odd because we never have that issue where we live.  I checked my phone and it was not working at all.  We didn&#39;t turn any lights on in our home and crept outside to see if a UFO was somewhere in site.  We didn&#39;t see anything, but both of us were too scared to really get out in the open to check.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said before, we see UFO&#39;s all the time out here.  I don&#39;t even report how many we see. My son and I huddled in my bedroom with the doors locked all night.  The radio interference, cell phone problems and uneasy feelings stopped after 1am.  My son and I were so scared that we stayed awake most of the night.  That has never happened to us before when we have seen the UFO&#39;s, they usually keep their distance in the sky and when we say we see you they will flash colors as if to say we are here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see anything last night, but we know something was out there to cause what we went through.  I have a friend who works for MUFON, so I may reach out to her too.<n>

After about five minutes, the UFO reappeared from my left (West) and traveled to my far right (North) within minutes before disappearing.  The stars in the sky appeared to have a reddish &#34;twinkle,&#34; and the night sky looked active with distant faint flashes of light  surrounding individual stars (I swear I&#39;m mentally sound…)  But the one-second flashes almost seemed to be charging the UFO before taking off.

There were approximately 6 &#34;stars&#34; that shifted from a stem with bulb formation, to a polygon, and a straight line. Meanwhile, in the NE sky and the SE sky, two &#34;stars&#34; were syncing flashes. Red, Blue, Green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then approached the West side of the building, and there witnessed more activity than I have ever seen.  In the NW, there was a red cloud, where 40+ orbs were &#34;dogfighting&#34; and making extreme maneuvers.  As this went on, there was a two light formation that went against the cloud movement at an incredible speed then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, two neighbors came out and asked what we were doing, to which we pointed out.  Needless to say, they were in awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:00 am, the moon started flashing bright white circles in an increasingly fast pattern, till a wave of white crossed the moon and ensconced the moon in a white light brighter than anything I&#39;ve seen.  It was almost as if the moon was &#34;activated&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cloud formations at this time became extremely detailed, to the point 4 people all saw the exact images simultaneously.  These were groups of human faces, most with looks of horror, and always with a Grey face behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1:22 am a triangular shape (think the flux capacitor) flashing in a haphazard pattern red appeared in the WNW sky, and approached us on a SE course.  This object flew at incredible speeds for being that high up, and only produced a low hum.

It was bright out because of the supermoon, so we had a clear view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, who pointed in the air, then told us to look.  3 of the 4 of us saw what looked like a thick blackish-gray disc, hovering in the air a few hundred feet out.  It was not a plane, because we had seen many moving around that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a balloon floating up but my friend and I stood up and approached the edge of the rooftop to get a better view and I quickly ruled that out.  What I personally saw was something that looked large enough to not be a balloon, and it was definitely oscillating.  It made no sound, but I did not expect it to at our distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rationalized at first it was a balloon floating from the light into the atmosphere and thus disappearing, but something was off about that idea.

The first was a red fireball that was traveling over the Winterstown area as seen from Red Lion near Route 24.

It then continued to travel and as it drifted behind the tree line it again ignited a bright red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object was orange, rose from the horizon in the same area, went black as it rose and appeared to go up and around the moon from my perspective.  It then went almost straight down and dipped behind the horizon.  I was able to capture this on my cell phone on a short video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third was again red and rose from a similar point of origin on the horizon.  Although all three had slightly different origin points they appeared to be coming from the same area.  This third and final object rose into the sky and flew in a large arch towards the main town of Red Lion.  Again, this was caught on video.  All 3 objects were accompanied by the sound of a dog barking in the distance, you can hear it clearing on the video of the third object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the video my girlfriend and I are bouncing ideas off each other of what we are seeing.

I was driving around 70mph, so the duration of viewing the lights was probably less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were low, very low and the surrounding trees obstructed my view and I could only see them in clearings of the trees.  But my initial reaction was to try to process what I was seeing for a few seconds until I said to my wife, &#34;What ((deleted)) am I looking at to my left?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then noticed them too.  It was dark out of course, so the lights, which looked orange/amber in color and seemed to almost look rectangular.  I think there were about 7 of the lights, and they first appeared in a staggered formation, with some higher than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the further we drove, they almost started to form a triangular pattern, with the tip of the triangle being at the highest light and the formation widening as the other lights were lower and underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not tell if the lights were moving, but I think they may have been moving towards east, as we were traveling west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen on tv and the internet about the &#34;Phoenix Lights,&#34; and the lights I witnessed last night appeared very similar to that.  I actually asked my wife if they could be falling flares, as I could not explain to myself what I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds, we could no longer see the lights.<n>

We have observed three low flying objects emitting a constant bright red fire like light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first was spotted as I and the other witnesses exited a lake we had been swimming in. We could not see the object, but we were sure that it was neither a plane, an asteroid, nor a comet, and it seemed too near to be a satellite.  The lake in question is about 10 km from Iroquois Falls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The circular red light advanced at a slow and steady pace, not leaving a trail behind it, and followed a half moon like trajectory from the point where we had seen it, and lost it from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We exited the lake and spoke about this strange phenomenon, and as we entered the cottage (we had not been looking at the sky for approximately 5 minutes) one of the witnesses spotted another object reflecting a circular red light exactly like the first one, that followed the exact same trajectory at the same pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we all wondered if it had been a second one or a third.  However, this was disproved because soon after seeing this second UFO, a third with the exact same characteristics, following the same trajectory at the same speed passed over us again.  Now if this third object had been lower than the others I can not say with assurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many questions arise from this seeing, and we have not been able to answer them.<n>

It hardly made any noise and didn&#39;t have the regulatory green and red wing lights.  The bottom was fully lit up.  The craft appeared to be a shimmery charcoal grey.

When I got to him he told me he thought he saw a UFO that was following him and was shooting sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I did not see anything and thought maybe he saw a shooting star or something but he was sure it was not (he is 10).  I left and about a minute later he called me again and this time when I came I “did” see it.  It was to the right of where he saw it the first time and the coloring was a reddish orange glow and looked round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it, it was moving through the sky in a curve (not straight), and as it went around the curve the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then went back to the spot where my son saw it the first time and after a minute or so we saw it again.  That time, I “did” see it shoot sparks but it was not white sparks like I thought he meant.  It was reddish flare looking sparks.  It (shot) about 2 of them, about a second or so apart and after moving a few feet, it did it again.  The sparks didn’t go far into the sky, only a few feet.  They shot down at an angle from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as it rounded the corner again, the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe it was a plane because you can still see the physical body of the plane at night from all the lights on it.  And planes fly straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think it was a helicopter because you can also still see the body of a helicopter from the lights and you can typically hear the sound of one.  And, why would a plane or a helicopter shoot sparks??<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, this object was flying higher than a plane or helicopter would and the object looked round.  However it didn’t move super fast, but seemed to be about the same speed as a plane or helicopter but a little faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to get my binoculars and although we couldn’t see the object as clear as I hoped, you could better see that it was round and you could see more of the actual lights going around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son did try to take a picture from his cell phone and you can&#39;t really see it but just in case you can &#34;expand&#34; it, I asked that he keep it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not for sure saying it was a UFO but what could it have been??  That is the answer I am seeking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you!<n>

Furthermore, all lights were the same intensity and two or three of them began to slowly move towards the south or southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one minute later the two of the objects disappeared.

Not a vessel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my friend’s neighborhood last night around 12:45am (00:45).  He lives in a neighborhood with duplexes, and a public pool.  We were sitting in the pool deck area on pool chairs talking about politics, life, obscure theories, etc.  He was facing me, and just over his shoulder up in the sky, a small glowing disc quickly flew by.  I’ve never had a ufo experience before, and I don’t read up on them much, so I’ll use my limited knowledge to make a description:<n> <n><n> <n><n> This didn’t look like your typical Hollywood UFO.  It was a very small disk in the sky.  At first, I immediately thought it might have been a shooting star, but it was too large, and not out in space.  I’ve seen shooting stars before and they are quick and faint, this was prominent, a little slower, and close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say it was less than 100ft off the ground, it seemed like it just went over the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me confused is that it was VERY small.  Up in the sky it was relative to the size of a Frisbee, and when I described it to my friend, I said it looked like half of the size of the moon in the sky.  So based on its altitude, I’d say it was probly 1/3 the size of a family sedan in reality (it could probably fit in the trunk of a car)   Physical Appearance:  It was FLAT.  It wasn’t a large machine, flying craft, plane, or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a flat disk with a faint ball of light in the middle, and then a bright ring surrounding the ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The space between the ball and the ring were EMPTY.  It was just a ring of light circling a ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another note:  There was NO noise.  There were no engine sounds from a helicopter or airplane.  It was a quiet breeze.  The only sounds that night were my friend and I talking, and the ambient noise of crickets and air.  It passed without a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It quickly flew by in a couple of seconds and disappeared over the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought shooting star, and then I thought it looked like a HUGE firefly.  That’s my best comparison to the light it was giving off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not sharp, it was very glow-ie, and gave off a sphere of ambient light from the two light sources that made a sort of sphere around it.  It was a very faint light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was only a light. It didn’t look like it was a vessel meant to transport anything, and was certainly not large enough for an average man to fit in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe the light&#39;s color as a clean white glow.<n>

The red light appeared to divide into two red lights and the four lights formed a diamond shape.  We had to keep driving but as I was looking, it continued in a zig-zag pattern above the interstate and hills surrounding it.  The four lights converged into one large red light and then separated.  It repeated this another time until it disappeared from my sight behind the trees.  I could see the glowing red light from about one and a half miles down the road because of its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened in an area surrounding the interstate which was hilly and covered with trees. There were some fields.  I&#39;m not sure if the field had crops or livestock since it was dark.  The sky was cloudy, so I couldn&#39;t see any stars. It wasn&#39;t near an airport either.  Someone said it was a helicopter, but the windows were open and I didn&#39;t hear any noise.  It was also flying fairly low.<n>

It came to a lower point in the arc, close to the ocean and stopped, as the white light went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the red light slowly lowered itself towards the ocean surface.  I could see the horizon in the dark and the light was lower than the horizon.  I was about 8 feet above sea level and stand 6 feet tall, so the light was much lower than 14 feet about the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light went on and off a few times and finally disappeared.  I waited there for about 2 minutes but it did not come reappear.  No sounds were heard and the path seemed to perfectly graceful to be a helicopter like object.<n>

Object had lights all over the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness said some lights were white, some lights were orange, some were yellow. Looking at surface of object, on the side witness could see, it had at least 14 lights visible on that side of the object.  Lights about same size as car headlights, or somewhat smaller.  Light intensity was so bright that it hurt witness&#39;s eyes to see it.  Object made a &#34;swishing&#34; sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness could not see any wheels.  Entire surface of object glowed because of the light intensity.  Witness could not say if the light was emanating from inside of object.  Object appeared to travel on road surface.  Witness thought this was a service vehicle, by which witness meant that it was probably military.  Object was moving on road at about 25 or 30 mph.  Distance from witness about 100 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this object passed by, the road was dark again but witness could hear the same sound approaching again from same direction as before.

Brightness still so intense it hurt witness&#39;s eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another witness was not able to awaken in time to see the objects.  Same thing occurred; object passed, with weird swishing sound.  Witness did not think this was a &#34;streetsweeper&#34; but again, a service vehicle, by which the witness meant &#34;military,&#34; and &#34;secret.&#34;  &#34;There are some things we are not supposed to know,&#34; witness said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this second object passed, the road was briefly dark again, and another identical object came by.

We both live in the city (Syracuse, N.Y.) so it’s rare to be able to gaze at the beautiful sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes, I saw a few red lights in a line and, at first, thought it was a plane.  However, it didn’t seem quite right.  There was no noise as in a plane’s engine.  The lights were a little too big and bright to be close and yet be silent.  If it was a plane of any size, it would be making noise.  The lights would go from red to white, red to white.  Then all of a sudden, they just disappeared.  They did not fade away or drift off,  just disappeared.  As if the lights were shut off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing a few more appear above the lake, I went in to tell my friend, who came outside and saw them just before they disappeared.  She, being more of a skeptic, thought it was a plane.  However, the way they just hovered there, moved slowly, three at a time, right across the sky and then to just vanish was unsettling.  If I remember correctly there were nine or twelve.  They were definitely grouped in threes.  They came all in a straight line over the clear sky.<n>

Here we saw multiple light balls going in and out of the clouds and we couldn&#39;t tell how many total there were, they moved in any direction and were very versatile in their movement.<n>

The responding sheriff deputy and I possibly saw the ufo at 90k feet leaving Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the horizon, in the south west, was a bright light; looking like Venus or a star.  This ufo was approaching at about 30 mph.  About 1-2 miles out.  About 3 football fields up from the ground or a 1,000 feet up from the ground.  It almost collided with an outbound jet traveling from the south east and going north west at about the same height.  Paths of the jet and ufo crossed, just about overhead, about a 1/4 mile to the north by northwest.  The jet can be heard in the video I took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo would not show up on my smart phone screen as a videoed.  Only the blink, blink of the jet showed up on my phone screen as I recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo was recorded when I aimed the camera eye at the peak of a 30 foot building with a mercury light on the side of the building.  The mercury light is the size of a beach ball and is seen in the lower left of the video.  The mercury light is about 3 feet down from the peak.  As the ufo passed in the background of the peak I recorded it.  mike Michigan ufo (you! tube) 24 seconds of video taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent as can be.  It never altered its shine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)  lights on the ufo.  No strobes.  It never so much as flickered.  It continued in a straight path going, again, north east at 30 mph.  The jet continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, provided by the witness, and we do not see anything that seems to us to be unambiguously related to the presence of a UFO.

I stopped playing to look at the sky when I noticed I could see the moon in the daylight, and it looked quite beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m looking at the sky, I get the bright idea (influenced by an internet forum) to pulse a laser into the sky as it is rumored to attract strange craft.  Not believing this in the slightest, I pulsed the light about 10 times in a few seconds. I then noticed a craft slowly flying across the sky to the lower right of where I had shined the laser (at least a couple of miles in the air).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the craft I immediately ceased to use the laser, as I was unsure as to if it was a plane, and the last thing I need is to cause a pilot some distraction.  I continued to watch it fly across the sky from west to east at speeds a typical airliner would be flying.  The intriguing part was that I could see no wings, no tail fin, and no discernible markings that you can usually see on airliners as they fly in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved further east, my opinion that it was an airliner went out the window as a large electric-blue ball of light quickly appeared behind the craft, and then in disappeared entirely.  The sky was crystal clear in all directions, and at the speed and direction it was flying, it should have continued to be visible for at least another ~3 minutes.  It simply vanished.<n>

I had just passed the exits for Southcenter Mall and SeaTac Airport a few minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I only saw this object for a second at the very most, I do recall the image of it clearly, and the thoughts that raced through my mind at the time and shortly thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a bluish white sphere that seemed to have an internal light source.  It was flying in almost the exact same direction as I was driving.  As the object quickly moved away in front of me, it seemed to lose some of its blue tint and become more white, but there was still a definite blue tint to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I extend my arm fully and raise my thumb, I would say the object was twice the size of my thumb when it first appeared at the top edge of my windshield.  By the time it vanished over the tree line, or the horizon, it seemed to be only half of its original size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any stars in the sky at this time, and I’m not sure if there was some cloud cover or there was just too much “city light” at this location.  My first thought was “wow, this thing is close”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after this I was thinking “wow, it’s going to hit the ground”. (the object did seem to be losing altitude quickly).  Before I even finished this second thought however, the object had already vanished from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no flash, sound, or other evidence to convince me it did hit the ground, so now I think it just flew so fast that it disappeared over the horizon.  I was asking myself what this thing could have been, but I didn’t have anything to even compare it to.  Then I asked myself what it was NOT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure it was not a plane or a jet of any sort, and I’m sure it was not a shooting star.  At least not like any I have ever seen.  This sighting happened 26 hours ago as I type this, and I’m still clueless as to what I actually saw flying over my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

It went right above and past me and looked as if it landed in the fields of Reeds Ferry Elementary School next to me behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving down the st to the entrance of that school (it&#39;s a very very long road) and i saw the lights at the end of driveway to the school go out.

As i was about a mile from Gilbert Road, i looked to the south towards Mesa, and the best way I can describe what I saw was that there were three orange orb-lights in the sky spaced pretty close to each other really far away (maybe 20 miles away, 5000 ft high) and as they started to dim out from left to right pretty quickly,<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 more lights appeared a little bit further away in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As those started to dim out from left to right 3 more lights appeared.

Once I focused on the two objects I noticed two very black cylinders floating to the west direction.  It may sound dtrange but I have never seen anything so deep in the color black before.  Almost metallic blackish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly floated out of my view leaving me puzzeled as to what they were.  Much too small to be a plane but too big for a balloon.

At 12:36 a.m., I witnessed an orange glowing orb about 50 feet above the treetops and approximately 100 yards ahead crossing the road from north to south.  When I reached the point of the object&#39;s crossing, I stopped and exited the vehicle.  I continued to observe the object while standing in the middle of the road (There was no other vehicular traffic}.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time the object was stationary, hovering at approximately 100 feet in altitude and perhaps 50-70 yards south of the road.  There was no sound emanating from the object. As it hovered, it began to move in a slow, tight, circling maneuver.  As it exhibited this circling motion, I observed a bluish-white light pulsating either from within the orange orb or on it.  The object then began to slowly move to the southwest, maintaining it&#39;s altitude and disappeared from my line of sight behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from the object&#39;s distance and altitude, I approximate it&#39;s size to be that of a small compact automobile.  This was the apparent size of the glowing light, it was difficult to ascertain whether it was actually a solid object.  At 12:39 a.m I entered my vehicle and proceeded home with no further incident.<n>

They were separated by less than 5 degrees vertically and took about 1 minute to traverse about 25 degrees horizontally.  They were approximately 10 degrees below the half moon.  They appeared to lose brightness as they traversed the sky but remained clearly visible in the sliver of sky I was able to see.   No sooner did the tandem lights disappear from my field of view than another single light appear traversing the same piece of sky at about the same position of the lower light in the tandem grouping.  Same bright orange characteristic moving about the same speed.  The apparent magnitude of these lights were brighter than the brightest planet I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not airplanes as I saw an airplane in the same section of sky and was easily able to compare the events.  I am an engineer working in aviation so know the difference.  In fact, I am attributing these lights to satellites reflecting the sun but since I have never seen three satellites traversing the night sky almost simultaneously and at that magnitude of brightness, I felt like I should report the event.<n>

I was at a bonfire on Sand Lake beach when I among up to 5 or so other people i was with saw, and I even recorded video on my vx2100 video camera, UFO&#39;s.  There were 5 in the beginning. Sand Lake is a small lake near kearney in Northern Ontario. I was visiting a family friend and my dad.  It is about a 7 hour drive from Montreal Canada where i live, on the west side of Algonquin park I believe.  And it is some distance north of Huntsville.  The beach i saw it from was just off of the address 3660 Highway 518.  And the UFO&#39;s we were looking at were in the slightly North East direction in the air over the woods across the lake, past the east side of the lake.  So sometime between 11pm and 12am, I along with a young couple from a house nearby witnessed 5 UFO&#39;s. other witnesses came (another young couple i believe and younger 30 something cousin of my Dad&#39;s friend).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 lights that had a redish and some white glow on them.  They disappeared and came back,  only 3-4 came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to wake up my Dad and his freind who were sleeping together, they didn&#39;t want to come since they were sleeping so i also grabbed my vx2100 sony mini dv video camera which is very good in low light and ran to the beach.  I caught on Camera only 3 that came back i believe, and they were moving in motions that were very shifty and changing directions going higher or lower.  A really strange thing that was also occurring, were green flashes coming from the woods in the areas below and near to them, like lighting flashes but that were coming from the forest as the forest would light up green, and there were no clouds it was a clear night.  I&#39;m happy i managed to capture 2-4 of those green flashes on camera also.  Though most people with me were in shock and amusement, one suggested maybe they could be drones, but he wasn&#39;t sure.  But that didn&#39;t explain the g! reen flashes below.  They disappeared for the second and perhaps last time, i didn&#39;t stick around much longer than another 20 minutes to see if the came back.  I was happy to capture that, perhaps i should send/sell the footage to a documentary on UFO&#39;s or Tv station? or as a last resort put it on youtube if that&#39;s not possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An interesting sidenote: a friend of my sister&#39;s who i happen to tell this to also saw objects that had a red glow on the same night as me at roughly the same time,  he said he was in Northern Quebec when he saw them perhaps a 5 hour drive from where i was.<n>

I tried looking for a string or wire they could have been hanging off of, but I couldn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night so I couldn&#39;t make out any stars or planes in sight.  These three lights just sort of hovered above the 25th St. shopping center near Olive Garden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to drive underneath them and I had to turn my head back to look at them (which means they were not moving or they were moving very slowly).  They were pretty bright lights and they did not flicker or flash at all.  They were pretty stagnant as well; they didn&#39;t move around a lot and they kept the triangle shape consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today 8/4/14 my boyfriend drove on Rt. 22 again and drove on the same exact spot that we saw the lights at last night, but they were not there anymore.  They were too low to the ground to be air planes and too high up to be street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried for hours to try and come up with a logical explanation and I couldn&#39;t.  I do not want to jump to conclusions, but it looked like all the stories you hear about UFO&#39;s.<n>

We have a lot of planes that pass over our house due to the military air base next door, I always enjoy looking up at the different planes going by.  I happened to notice a small plane passing over but as it just went by the corner of my eye straight over the hill was what looked like a fireball falling rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all white and no red or orange or yellow. but looked as if an object was falling to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no more as it either became fizzled out, disappeared or actually made contact with the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before we saw this object we had taken our puppy inside because he was trying desperately to get back into the house, whining, clawing and scratching at the sliding glass door.

I pulled over and got out of our vehicle while I handed my wife my iPhone to record the object.  There was no sound that we could hear being omitted from the object and we watched for almost 3 minutes before it disappeared into the clouds.  I must add that I specifically looked for flashing lights off of potential wings, but there weren&#39;t any.

I pulled my cellphone and checked my “PlaneFinder” app, and as I expected, there was nothing there.  The truly amazing aspect of this event is that it occurred once before while I was walking at night, at roughly the same time in August of 2004.  Almost exactly ten years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in northwest Mississippi, 30 mile south of Memphis International.  We get a lot of FedEx traffic in the evenings so I’m quite familiar with their aircraft, their lighting and their sounds.  And helicopters are extremely audible.

I ran into the house to grab my binoculars.  Called my girlfriend out and said &#34;there&#39;s something in the sky that shouldn&#39;t be there&#34;.  Looking through the binoculars....it was an upright cigar shaped craft.  Silver/whiteish in colour.  There was either a white light flashing on the top tip but it flashed in no particular rythm.

The driving range there is at the base of a butte.  The golfers face south to drive balls, looking directly at the butte.  The elevation provides for nice views of the town, surrounding landscapes and the Rocky Mountain peaks to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The afternoon sky was clear above with some clouds gathering in the west over the mountains.  I drove a ball (using a 7-iron) and as it climbed at first it seemed to stop and hover, but I immediately realized I lost track of the ball and my eye picked up another object in the sky.  It looked small, round and white like a golf ball, but much higher in the sky.  I thought perhaps it was a plane, so I stopped to watch it for a minute.  After a minute or so, I realized it couldn’t be a plane because it was not moving forward, it was just hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s not unusual for hawks to be flying around there, but this was much too high and looked rather inanimate.  My gaze wandered to the right (west) where I spotted 3 additional objects just like the original one.  There was another “tandem” object – the top part of that object looked like the other 4 and the bottom one looked like a larger version of it.  They were connected by a vertical line.  To draw it, it would be a small circle directly over a larger one, connected by a line.  There was one more object that looked a little more oval and it was red.  The four small white objects and the red one surrounded the tandem object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away for minute and when I looked back they were still there.

I was awakened by my cat yowling loudly.  I was laying on my right side which was strange as I have not done it in the 16 years since my spinal injury &amp; resulting bad sciatica down my right leg, it was too painful to consciously do.  I turned around to see why my cat was going crazy.  I was startled by a black shadow figure about 5ft tall, slim with a large bald head.  It had green L.E.D. like lights in positions around its body.  As I looked on, it bent over me 2 times looking at my lower back &amp; legs.  It stood upright in between the bends to examine my lower body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this time my cat was still yowling.  The perfectly black figure was lit from behind by a night light so I could see its outline distinctly, doing what it was doing, plus the green lights on parts of its own outline enhanced its shape.  I challenged it by shouting &#34;who are you?&#34; and &#34;what do you want?&#34;  I did this twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise.  It just did what it was doing.  I then plucked up the courage to move towards the lamp switch to turn it on. As I was changing position, it began to gradually disappear.  By the time the light was on, it was gone and my cat stopped his crazy yowling.  I was quite frightened by the ordeal, but I was wide awake after being startled from the time I first saw the black figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week my pain medication was changed from morphine to Suboxone and in the last 4 days I was able to ride a bicycle again in 16 years.<n>

When we came closer we could actually see that this light was in the middle of an open field and that there were two other lights along with it that were orange and blue in color.<n> <n><n> The shape of the lights formed an isosceles triangle, with the red light being on the top (pulsating), then the orange and the blue being at the bottom, closest to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was huge and would have been bigger than a house or barn if it was placed next to one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the lights were moving and it remained stationary as we drove past.  We could not hear any noises coming from it either.  We could not see anything that connected the lights together; it just seemed like they were free floating by themselves making up this pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another car coming in the opposite direction seen the same thing, and they pulled over to try and figure out what it was as well.  We did not stop since this object gave me a very uneasy feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like this and it was so close to the highway (about 100 feet away or so) that if it was a plane or anything we would have been able to tell.

As we made out way down her street, we witnessed an obvious UFO above and in front of my truck just above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that her street is near a major shopping center, but her street is secluded with trees and wooded area surrounding the road.  There are street lights along the road but quite spaced out and are often out/dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a car approximately 500 yards behind me traveling the same direction.  As we approached her driveway, which is on the left, we both observed a UFO with white lights blinking around the rim of the object.  They blinked on and off rotating around similar to the light movement of the arcade game that you have to hit the stop button as it passes the 10 in front of your spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very visible and the craft was just above the trees and about 20 yards in front of us.  The object was moving right to left passing over the road/trees.  As it went over the street we arrived to her driveway which we quickly jumped out to attempt a second sighting of it, however it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She does live within about 10 miles from a small airport, however the craft did not have any green or red lights the the circling white pattern.  It should be noted that we couldn&#39;t see the full outline of the object due to the trees and darkness, however we could clearly see the edge shape due to the lights circling it.  I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 75 to 200 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend is afraid of the idea so she automatically said it was a plane, however there was a plane flying high up in the sky that was clearly a plane with the red, green, and white light. She accepted the fact that we saw what we saw, a UFO.  It should also be noted that for as low as it was there should have been a distinct sound, especially if it were a plane, however we heard none.  My truck is not the quietest in the world especially since I also had the radio on, however there should&#39;ve been a distinct sound for as low as it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time I had ever experienced seeing something of this nature, but I am so glad that I have my own proof enabling me to personally know without question that they are out there.  There is however always the chance it could&#39;ve been a military craft, but it was definitely not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were well above tree line and houses, and were coming from the southwest traveling in a perfectly straight line at a stable elevation, coming from the Sheridan Avenue area in the Edgewater vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us saw them.  They were traveling quietly and perfectly synchronized together. After between 30 and 60 seconds both bright orange glowing orbs kind of flashed brighter one time, then immediately disappeared, both at exactly the same time.  They did not appear to drop in elevation at all, they just disappeared.  They disappeared when they were probably over Yates and 41st Avenue area or a little farther northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess the two orbs, or what ever they were, were traveling about as high as a helicopter flies around Denver, maybe a little lower.  Very bright orange, almost red glowing, appearing to be round / oval in shape.  Pretty good size; smaller than the body of a helicopter but maybe about six or seven feet in diameter, about the size of a hot tub.  It was hard to really ascertain the size or the distance they were from us in the dark night sky and with the bright orange glow they emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Denver skies were partly cloudy, but the area these were in was in a completely clear sky. They were moving at a good clip, completely quiet though and perfectly synchronized together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were probably visible by us for a total of 30 to 60 seconds.  Two of them, perfectly spaced apart and traveling side by side, but not connected to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have both seen Chinese type lanterns in the night sky, but these were NOT lanterns. These were two bright orange objects, separated by space but traveling perfectly together. They appeared together and disappeared at exactly the same time.<n>

I drove car into garage, parked my car, went to the back to remove items.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded back of car I noticed an orange light glowing in the sky, heading towards my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to my driveway area and watched briefly before I turned on my phone video.  I captured the floating object, which continued on a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped video and continued to watch, and it floated for another 10-15 sec before it blinked on/off, then finally disappeared.  I began walking back to my garage, looked again in the same direction and saw another orange object floating in the sky.  I attempted to video tape it, but couldn&#39;t get it in my viewfinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started a NW direction, but soon went north, then north east and did the same blinking, before it disappeared.  Both were at around a 30-40 degree angle from the horizon, with perhaps a 500&#39; height above ground.<n>

It was quiet and as it approached, I noticed it sort of shimmered orangish-yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was passing directly over us, and I told my partner, &#34;Look at that, what is that?&#34;  He thought it was plane or helicopter at first, but it made no sound and was just a ball of glowing light. &#34;I have no clue, but look over there, there&#39;s another one.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just approaching over us was an identical shaped glowing ball of light, not very far behind the first one.  They were moving very slowly, almost like they were getting slower and slower the nearer to us they got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw a third appear, all three lights were in a row, almost equal! distance from each other, looking completely the same.  The lights weren&#39;t pulsing, more like glowing or pulsating, between orangish and a golden yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and followed the three lights to the end of the yard, where they became obscured by trees.  I tried to find them again but didn&#39;t see them anymore.  The whole event took less than 10 minutes.<n>

Then a black shiny polished looking orb flies over in a perfect trajectory flying S.E. (like the ISS, I see it fly over at night alot)  The elevation could be around 2 - 4 hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been affected by the wind as it seemed to be in an orbit like the ISS.  Did not make a sound and I continued watching until it went out of sight in the far S.E. and I know it wasn&#39;t ISS because this was under the clouds, black and much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear to change in elevation during the 30 seconds it was viewable.  Again it was black and had a shiny polished look to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was not large from my perspective about the size of a half dollar at arm&#39;s length at its closest from my back yard it was just a bit east of my position in west Spokane but almost straight over so I got a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it got smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found hime to be both eloquent in his description of the sighting event, and sincere.

The lights came half the distance closer to my patio at one point, staying at the same height then went back to the other side of the tree and went behind, then it went up real fast like it was propelled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m from England but moved here 12 years ago and have gotten used to heavy airplane and helicopter traffic and this was neither because it was only a block away and didn&#39;t hear anything.  It went on for several minutes I thought it was longer but can&#39;t remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems as though it was looking for something in the tree the way it went back and forth and behind it.

Our balcony faces due East; and our coordinates are N 43.00184 X W -82.40941.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed a couple of birds flying much higher in elevation than we normally see - there were storm cells developing in the area to the South of us, so likely some updrafts for them to ride.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, Lynn noticed, over the lake (Huron), a small object (once again, with her naked eye) and attempted to find it with the binoculars.  She did, and it appeared to her as a hat shaped object with rounded corners, but just barely discernible - perhaps only a millimeter or two in size if held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was pretty much due NE (45 degrees true North) from our position, and approximately 40 degrees up from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She handed the binoculars to me (I could not find nor see the object with my naked eye) and instructed me to follow a certain cloud pattern upwards to find the object. I did, and watched it for several minutes, until my arms got tired.  It did not move at all,  appearing to hover motionless in the sky above the lake below.  Not knowing the size of the object, I have no idea how far away it was, though we both had the idea that it was a great distance away.  Being so small, we could not detect colors, and it did not have any lights on it that we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took turns watching it through the binoculars, but eventually the cloud cover (shifting from south-to-north) obscured our vision and we lost sight of it after about 30 minutes.<n>

I witnessed a blue meteor directly through my front windshield just to the left of my rear view mirror.  I started to point and tell my wife there was a meteor and then it stopped in place.  She asked me why I was pointing at a star and I told her it could not be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to have come from the northwest and traveled across the sky rapidly like a typical meteor only it stopped suddenly.  It stopped in the western portion of the sky about a quarter of the sky up from where the sun would set before I lost visual.  There was no fluctuation in the light at all and no tail.  There were no blinking lights only solid blue like a bright star.  I told no one about this except my wife who was with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day on Facebook a few friends mentioned seeing a blue light in the sky behaving oddly so I knew it was not just a onetime fluke.<n>

From the point of view on the pier to the beach, a blue ball of light streaked above the left side of the beach.

It moved very fast and I expected a crash or some kind of noise but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The guy fishing right next to me witnessed it at the same time.  We asked around but no one else seemed to see the blue object that we saw.  It was witnessed by an Oriental male and an African-American male.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, a man came on the pier and claimed to have seen a red UFO on the opposite side of the beach around the same time.

I saw three thick yellow lights go across the dark sky together.  The light were kinda weaving between each other as the distance between each of the lights changed.  I jumped up out of the hammock and walked across my deck to track the three light but they quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights covered a large section of the night sky as they travelled.  The three lights travelled from 11 o&#39;clock to the 1 o&#39;clock across the night sky in like 5 seconds, then they were totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterward I looked around the sky and I could see two airplanes.

I noticed in my peripheral vision a very bright light, heading north, directly above me.  It was brighter than any star visible, and I watched it fade into sight from the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In full sight, I watched the light began to fade away quickly, when another UFO appeared nearly exactly where the other disappeared, traveling south-west, directly above me.  This one was not as bright, but I knew it was not an airplane, nor satellite, I also watched this sprout from the blackness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third I saw also faded into being from the blackness of space, but this was not like the other two. It was a faint orange light, with a blinking red light.  The light was not flashing in a pattern, like you would see on any other aircraft, and the UFO was not moving smoothly.  It was almost &#34;jumping&#34; or stuttering on its path.  Eventually, it flew into a treeline and I was unable to tell if it faded away or not.<n>

It was flying at a low altitude and it passed right above me, overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling south and it was descending at a very slow speed.  It appeared to be under intelligent control, it was not free falling or flying erratically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted about a minute and then it faded out to black in the nightime sky and completely disappeared, almost like it had become cloaked by turning invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no visible flashing lights,it was only bright red in color.  There was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was mostly cloudy and it had just rained about 40 minutes prior to the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a plane spotted to the west of where the ufo was located at the same time.<n>

Looking up, I saw two stationary objects.  One obviously a large helicopter (what I assumed to be military) facing east referencing the position of its navigation lights (no head or search lamps apparent ).  The other was a large round ball of light reminding me of the color of amber jewelry or a head lamp from a sixties automobile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were separated by some space, as the dark sky was visible between them.  No sound was heard from the Light Ball however the helicopter was very loud.  I watched for ten minutes with no movement but did observe the Light Ball seemed to pulse from the outside in becoming less bright toward the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once, I thought I could see three balls of light forming the big ball but I am not certain.  The helicopter moved forward and seemed to become one with the Light Ball but I am thinking the light intensity of the obscured the helicopter as I could still here it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my iPhone 5s from my pocket (will attach photos) and snapped a couple of pictures with flash.  Immediately the Light Ball/not visible helicopter began to move north on a western angle in my direction.  I became uneasy and crossed the street to hide under a tree and as I was doing so the combined objects changed direction more towards the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the phone was still lighted so I clicked it off and stayed in the shadows observing the Light Ball between the leaves.  I may have been there for a few minutes and saw my next door neighbor (two ladies) pull in their drive way and get out of their Tahoe phones in hand taking pictures.  I walked over to talk with them (their comment was they were wigged out) and turning to look,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the Light Ball and helicopter as two separate objects again with the Light Ball west of the helicopter and both were stationary and hovering.  The neighbors went inside as I observed The Light Ball slowly start to move west/slightly southwest and the helicopter followed.  I watched until they were completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I heard the same helicopter sound again and looking up and left, I saw exactly what I just witnessed disappear in the western sky.  The Light Ball was east of the helicopter and the helicopter seemed to be facing east.  Both objects were stationary and hovering but the helicopter sound was not as loud and no sound was heard from the Light Ball.  I did observe they seemed to be on the same latitude as the others were but further east.  I watched for approximately five minutes and took a flash picture.  The Light Ball moved toward my direction followed by the helicopter.  They stopped after some north/west directional movement and hovered again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the Light Ball headed southeast (North Scottsdale) with at a must faster rate of speed than the first sightings.  The helicopter seemed to not keep pace and I watched until they were out of sight, but the Light Ball was out of sight much sooner than the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first UFO experience and what was most unnerving was the possible military involvement along with the objects movement seemingly in response to my camera flash.  I sent a text with picture to a friend just in case there was a Men in Black visit.  This text was sent at 20:40 hours so this occurred over forty minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo timestamp can be determined once I upload into my Mac.<n>
