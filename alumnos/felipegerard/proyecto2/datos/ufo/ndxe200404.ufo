Driving home late from the office, when a flash of blue light lit up the SE sky. So bright i do not think man could duplicate it. Light it up for a good solid second, then disappeared. Other drivers on the highway must hv seen the same thing as it was in a very populated area of Houston. Also a few brake lights lit up after the flash occcured, so it seems i was not the only one that saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Light stayed constant, and did not appear to be a strobe light.  Curved down rapidly at about 30 degress toward land and then dissappeared from my sight.  Appeared as white as Jupiter appears in sky; however may have been 20 times the size.  Looked similar to a large comet moving across the sky without a tail.  Very white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my one passenger on my left side were almost to the peak of the road when I noticed a large shining light to my left. I asked my passenger &#34;what the heck is that thing?&#34;. They responded with &#34;I don&#39;t know?&#34;.  We pulled over and viewed the object with two very bright lights, whiteish blue, flashing on an offset pattern horizontally from one another with no visible shape in the middle and flying very quickly and at a very low altitude coming towards us. It was at about 10:10 p.m. EST and was very clear and dark night with a few stars out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned around in a drive way and started to ascend down the mountain. I pulled over and looked back and the object was a minimum of 300 meters off the ground at the peak of the mountain hovering with both lights now staying on at the same time very brightly. We then drove away quickly to the bottom of the hill and turned right. This was 5 minutes into the viewing. I asked &#34;where is it?&#34; but it was nowhere in sight. Twenty seconds later as we were driving towards Melmerby Beach Road I saw the object again, both lights flashing offset again coming towards us at a very low altitude and quite rapidly. I have no idea how the object got from the top of the mountain to in front of us in that short amount of time and with such grace. I periodically asked my passenger &#34; are you seeing this?&#34;, &#34;do you believe this?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned into a road on the left to park to again view the object coming towards us it was getting larger and larger, the closer it came. Both lights were now flashing at the same time and both were still bluish white. This was viewed in a heavily populated residential area but no other vehicles or people were visible to us. It was about 1000 meters away now and I turned left to go down the Melmerby Road back towards Fraser Mountain. I looked back, the two lights now vertical from one another (one on top of the other with a space in between of darkness) as it the object went straight up in the air. The radio began to crackle at this time. This was about 8 minutes into the viewing. We took a right and were in downtown New Glasgow and then took another right and were on the road heading towards the power station in Trenton. This is about 10 minutes after we first saw the object, we both looked to our right in the sky and the object was now visible in the sky at a quite low altitude. Once again the blueish white lights were flashing offset they were horizontal from one another again with the shape in the middle not visible. As we drove down this road both me and the passenger rolled down our windows and there was no noise whatsoever. The object slowed to a halt, it flipped vertically so the lights were now one on top of one another and for the first time we saw a very smooth, grayscale shape in the middle not very wide at all, like a dumbbell. The object the fly away very quickly and that was the last we saw of it. The viewing ended at about 10:23 PM EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

I asked my sons, &#34;What is THAT&#34;, and we watched the objects. They were high overhead and completely silent. They had straight cylindrical bodies and wings curled slightly downward. There were no lights and nothing on the objects moved or changed, they all glowed with the same faint greenish white glow, hazy around the edges. They swooped together and milled about, then formed a clumsy &#34;V&#34; type formation and shot off together to the north. They were not planes, birds or firefles. (Planes have lights and make noises, birds move their wings and fireflies do to. Besides, they were too high up for the objects to be as small as birds or fireflies).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time any of us have ever seen anything odd in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lindsay and I sat on the dock in Riddles Bend over the dark waters of the Coosa River beneath a spray of stars, mystified.  I do not remember the moon.  As the lighted craft approached, we wondered to each other why a boat would be cruising down the river at nine at night.  Its light was brighter now, concentrated on the opposite shoreline like a spotlight.  A police cruiser, perhaps?  But it was so huge.  Maybe forty yards long.  And there was complete silence.  No whirring of a boat motor.  No helicopter blades chopping and stabbing at the air.  There was no frothy wake smacking against the dock.  This lack of natural physical effects was eerie considering its great size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) and I were immobile as it moved past us.  It seemed to hover above the water as opposed to gliding through it.  Three ovular white lights on the bottom barely illuminated the river below.  Frightened yet astounded by the sight, we understood the boundlessness of the galaxy.  At that moment we became the hostesses of this planet.  We had been visited.  Walking back to my grandmother’s house, I could feel the hair erect itself on my arms, the back of my neck.  Shaken and bewildered, we whispered of the possibilities.  To think that we remain the sole occupants of the universe is arrogant and absurd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I had that experience last spring and I don’t know why I never wrote anything about it.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Just at sunset he glimpsed a light in the field behind our house.  He went outside.  As he opened the door his cat ran inside apparently scared.  He stepped out onto a porch and looked east and down the property.  He saw a light object flash briefly (like the speed of lightning).  It was very bright, about the brightness of the moon.  It was about 350 yards from the house. Shortly again he saw the same type of object appear about 30 feet away next to the barn.  It was a solid object which gave off light.  It was approximately 10 ft. wide and 12 feet high.  It was spherical and clearly defined in shape.  The color of the light was white.  Before the last sighting he felt the air as breezy and cool then it suddenly changed to very still and warm.  He was very startled by the experience  He ran back into the house, turned on all the lights and played loud music until his brother returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS&#39; MOTHER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Correction - (mother speaking) I am sorry about the date on the previous 2 submissions.  I should explain.  I went to a movie on the night my son saw the object.  When I made the report I looked up the date on my ticket stub then I submitted the report.  But then I looked at the data base and saw the report for Cotati on the next night.  Cotati is only 3 miles to the north of our house.  I  looked up the date my ticket purchase was recorded by the bank and it was ofcourse the next day.  However, if the date on the ticket stub is correct, the sighting must have been on the 30th. I&#39;m very sorry for muddling up the issue.<n>

It did not seem to be moving.  We kept our eye on it for several minutes, and it remained still.  We were making trips in and out of the apartment building, and we kept checking on it, trying to frame it at the same spot between a tree and a balcony in order to judge if it was moving.  Unfortunately, we did not see it take off.  We made another trip, and when we came back to the parking lot, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event probably lasted 10 - 15 minutes. Another airplane passed above the object during this time. &#34;6:30pm&#34; is an estimate.  We were facing towards the east not far from Union Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, I did a search on the internet to see if anyone had reported something strange.  I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was certainly weird, and I just wanted to report it just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approaching Holgate street I spotted 3 brown cylinder shapes hovering over 4th avenue 800-900 feet in the air.  They were bronze and I could see the sun reflecting off the metal.   I took off my sun glasses for a better look and couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  I exclaimed to my passengers, &#34;Can you see that?&#34;  No one heard me.  There was one large one and two smaller ones trailing beside it and behind. The large one was rounded in front much like an overturned canoe would look. There were deep lines carved in it forming a design. It appeared to be made of a rich bronze like metal highlighted by the sun. I looked well ahead to see if they were being towed by an aircraft.  There was nothing, they just hovered and appeared to be moving very slowly like a blimp. I kept driving and then came up on the side of a building which blocked my view. As I cleared the building and got a clear shot of where they had been, they had disappeared.  It was really strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day I drove back to the area I had seen them in. There wasn&#39;t anything there which would account for what I saw. The area they had been in were between Holgate and Lander street moving very slowly, west, over 4th avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be more sure of the exact time, but I was working on a screenplay all day and was a little but pre-occupied with my own thoughts. At any rate, ust off the 80&#39;s of the west side of central park there is a large field with three baselball diamonds. I rested for a while looking at the game, when as I stood, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a child&#39;s balloon (the silver kind) floating away, above the trees. It was clearly evident. However, it seemed to change shape, and flatten slightly, then round back out again. And it was pulled in a consistently western direction. This didn&#39;t seem to me like the normal behavior of a floating balloon. As I recall, they usually wobble from side to side as the tie at the bottom swings the weight around. There was nothing like this that I witnessed. It seemed to be moving deliberately. to see it clearly for more than about a minute and a half necessitsated walking over the baseballe diamond, which I neglected to do, as there was a game playing. Or, more accurately, a man was hitting balls for practice and others were catching it. So I only saw it briefly. The object was silver, I could not judge the distance accurately, and so cannot judge the size accurately. It seemed like a blimp, at times, which it may have been. but it appeared to flatten and behave more like a balloon. I could not identify it, hence I&#39;m entering this report. It changed shape as it moved, or at least it seemed to. There was a lot of light in the sky, it was overcast but not directly sunny, with a white, bright sky. It read as silver to my eyes, not emmenating light. It must have been either a blimp, far away, but moving very quickly to cover the distance it did in the sky, or a balloon, moving very slowly, but deliberately. Or something else, I suppose. If anyone else saw this, I would like them to tell me what they observed, just for my own curiousity. Thanks! - J<n>

It had to be huge, more tham 75 feet in length and at least 10 ft in diameter, it was shaped like a glossy black sausage casing, and it would periodically go into a formal V-shape and then speed up in that direction of travel.  As it crossed in front of me  on Wood ave/Oak tree Rd The sun would also glint of this sausage shaped object, and two smaller spheres were observed , one attached  at each end. This object would also rotate end over end  stop and go ram-straight  vertical, HOVER for a few seconds after bending in the middle from a v-shaped profile, and maintain this attitude for a few seconds before going on. it also maintained a tru and straight attitude and height, for if it was a balloon, it  would have risen while in my view. I pointed it out to a few passer-bys, but they said it was a balloon. The object then drifted in a stop and go manner out over the Garden State Parkway  and then I lost sight of this wierd object. It was 60 degrees in temp, partly sunny and the wind was calm.  It is also 1 year to the day when I saw a similar changing object in the vicinity  and wonder if this is some kind of probe or alien craft  sent to gather data. (see report for Woodbridge, NJ   (5-1-03) Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got up to do my paper route with my friend who was staying the night. I went out to get the news papers when out of the corner of my eye two bright lights to the north above my tree caught my eye. I quickly got my friend and we looked at them for a few seconds until we went in to roll papers. On the route we kept looking at the crafts dismissing them as Venus or stars,along the way they began to move in sparatic patterns nearly missing each other. We were amazed. And when we were nearly done with the route the crafts got closer apearing to be cylinder shaped with a clear to yellow light in the center of the crafts that was fading brighter to dimmer. When we finished went in the house and got the bonoculars,The sun was nearly up when we started watching the crafts again for about three minutes until each craft straffed to the right and took off towrad the east with a sound like tire on wet pavement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I approuched I noticed that it was not moving. At this point I was scratching my head wondering what it could be. Then as I almost got under it, I noticed that it was just hovering not moving,(maybe about 1000&#39; off the ground), so I pulled over and got out of the car looked up, it had 2 Bright white lights aiming straight out and was shaped like a stop sign with just 5 sides, dark in color maybe grey or black, and was silent not a peep of sound. Started to get a little nerves and had a delivery to make right down the street, so I jumped back in the car, made my delivey.When I was going back to the area I pulled over again to look, but it was gone, wanted to see how it moved.First time in my life I have ever seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object travelled from north to south, noticed it at about 80 degrees and it faded/disapeared at 50 degrees as I was facing south. Seemed very high and very massive, vaguely triangle/rectangle shaped, three irregular shaped very dim glowing areas - low red/amber, appeared similiar to an after-image from viewing a light source; I am, after testing and evaluation,certain that it was not a after-image from looking at the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The features were not similiar and after looking away and back again with a little scrutiny I found it again. There was no noise and no flashing lights. At all times it was hard to discern. It seemed to pause at 50 degrees then continued and then I could no longer find it - but this is more subjective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression was of a aircraft-carrier floating across the sky but again this is very subjective.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unfortunatly, i do not remeber what day it was. Though it could n ot have been more then 2 weeks ago. I was driving from bethlehem to naugatuck. Crossing route 6, i saw this thing. that looked similiar to a plane, it was really low, REALLY LOW and going down at an angle. When i got to route 6 not even 30seconds later i looked to the right and there was nothing. My boyfriend was behind me and he told me it was an Helicopter. Well i got to middlebury where westover was and i passed westover and i looked up and i saw the same thing! but this time it did look like an helicopter because it fast across the road.. &lt;---- like that. Then it went up the side of the trees.. toward my direction. It was REALLY REALLY low. Like above the trees. I slowed down to see what it was.. It was just sitting there. I couldn&#39;t really see a body shape at all. I could only see the lights.. which made a shape similiar to a plane...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had wing lights on the very edges and a light on what seemed to be a tail. but there was nothing else then that and it was just SITTING THERE and then it started to move away.. very very very slowly. So by now i am freaked out.. i called my boyfriend who went another way and when i drove by hop brook in naugatuck, he called me. He said there was one over his head where he was in nauagatuck. He said it was real low but he rolled down his window and it sounded like a plane but he wasn&#39;t sure. I just think its really strange and bizarre. We saw 3 of these &#34;things&#34; within 30mins, in 3 different towns. All in the same vinicity. I do not think it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

(in South Carolina) 4-28-04 in Varnville at 11:35 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday night April 28,2004 around 11:35 p.m. I saw what appeared to be an unidentified craft to my eyes. At first from a side view, as it was coming from the west heading towards a north eastern direction it looked like a normal plane. The object had two lights blinking on and off on the side,(one was green and the other red) on what seen to be the bottom of the aircraft were three big white lights forming a triangular shape. The object was moving very slow at about ( I would guest 30-45 miles per hour). As I kept looking at the craft it tilted a little bit to its side where I could see only the three big glowing light at the bottom. I was amazed to see this unusual object go by almost in a non noise making movement. No sound came as it was coming towards my direction and none was heard as it passed almost on top of where I was standing, just a couple of hundreds of feet away. Dispite the distance this thing looked huge. AS it went on its direction and I could not see it anymore I went back inside my house and tried to go to sleep. I tossed and turn and could not sleep. However the times I did go to sleep felt like it was a long time to me. But as it turned out to be it had just been 30-45 minutes of sleep. I don&#39;t know what caused the lack of sleep but I could not do it. In the morning, I told my wife what I had seen last night. She told me that it could have been a airplane. My responce was that if indeed it was an airplane it must have been a huge one with those kinds of lights on the bottom. But the more I remembered what it looked like the more it did not look like an ordinary airplane as she had claimed. I did not call any authorities to the scene because it was late and they would have dismissed it as a late night practical joke. This is the second sighting I have seen since moving tothe state of  South Carolina. Can someone explain what this object was.And by explaining it to me, I do not want to know that it was an weather balloon because it did not look like a weather ballo! on. If s omeone else saw this at the same time in the state of South Carolina please tell me about your expirience with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

There were two other ones similiar but they would change shape as they moved back and forth , up and down . I have been trained to know the difference between planes, satellites and stars ...and these were none of those . They moved within milliseconds of any activity in the sky that I have ever seen . This is not the first time for me in witnessing ufo activity , but this was the first time they got this close where it felt like they were right on top of me, watching me as I watched them.  If you stared into binoculars , you could see almost every turn they made and as they did , it changed from almond shape , to disk shape to something that seemed perfectly round , as though it hovered right over my house . There was a design ion the bottom of this one craft , almost looked like that of a phoenix or some type of fancy geometrical design . The one that came the closest was mostly grey that would shift into a bright blue , white and then it would flash something red once in a while . It had an aura around it and it would move towards the other two in the sky (which were farther away then the one I was observing), when that happened then the other two would seem to move rapidly and disappear at random moments and then reappear . As I watched this one come closer , I could feel a &#34;pull&#34; that is hard to explain unless someone knows or has experienced what I am talking about . I was outside when this happened and these objects were appearing in the eastern skies . I stood there studying them for about 3 hours . I lost track of time and then became too tired to continue . I remember before walking into the house around 3 am , there was a huge thing that swept right under it (the object)on my final glance and I am sure how to explain that one . Out of all the &#34;suspected&#34; ufos I have seen , this one concerned me most .<n>

The large object was circular in shape, bright white and filled with what she described as darker dots. In the center of the object there was nothing, or one would be able to see through it. The object was also rotating and had two smaller objects flying around it. One of the crafts was reported to be triangular in shape and the other again more circular. The triangular craft would move a distance away from the larger object, makes sudden turns and at times they were able to observe the full triangular structure and at other times see if being flat. The smaller circular object would travel around the triangle shaped object and also move around the circumference of the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses were facing west when observing the three objects and added that whatever these things were .. they seemed to be at a good distance from them.

Included with the report is the photo you see below, plus a 2 mb video clip of the object moving slowly across the sky. As it moves through the sky it changes the most brilliant colors, or for a better word it flashes at a fast rate of speed. The footage is truly amazing. In the photo the witness made a large number of still shots from the video clip and this is what you see below in the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0  Hello Brian,  Here is something which you may want to get out to a wider audience in whatever format can be done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last week in April skies were fair and clear around these parts, in Portland, OR. On several nights between 9 and 11 pm I saw some apparent star-like objects on the east or west horizon which seemed to strobe in multiple colors. I could remember seeing red and blue strobing lights with white either accompanying or alternating with the red and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this was, I thought, an uncommon occurrence, I also took some photos with the digital camera. The object did not show much in the photo, even though 10x optical zoom, because the strobing light was not much bigger than a small point of light. On to Plan B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also have a 127mm diameter x 1250mm focal length Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to which the camera can be mounted. With the camera-telescope combination , I can zoom from 31x to 310x power, all of this is optical zoom. At this level of zoom you can begin to see more than a speck of light. I took some regular digital photos, and some short video segments to show the strobing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camera &amp; telescope was on a tripod so did not move (except when I kicked it or made camera adjustments). I have attached the short video here, and also the first 48 video still frames which were cut and pasted into a single image. The top row of 8 images are the first eight frames, the 2nd row the second 8 frames, etc. All told there are about 3.1 seconds of time represented by the 48 still frames, one every 1/15th second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the movie, the object appears to move to the upper left. Since it is viewed thru a telescope without any mirrors, it has to be rotated around 180 degrees so as not to appear upside down and backwards. It actually moved to the lower right before me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular object was taken at 9:32pm local time on 4-30-04. The object was on the WSW horizon. I had to constantly track it by moving the scope to the right in small increments. That would make it&#39;s path travelled proceeding approximately to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 48 frame composite photo, the blue outlined frame in the lower right corner is a copy of the very first frame, and I pasted it there as a check for my printer to be sure that it reproduced all the colors. This composite of 48 images has also been resized to 2048 x 1536 to show more detail than the original still frame size of 320 x 240.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an amazing array of colors and shapes displayed, much more than could be seen even looking through the telescope. The reason I believe this is so is because the eye-brain connection cannot process all the data so quickly as can a video camera. The brain only reports back what limited data that it can process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some questions I have are,  1. What is it?  2. What is it doing?  3. What is signified by the different colors?  4. Is it in our atmosphere (below 200 miles), or beyond it?  5. The object seems to be flinging something off of it. What could this be?  6. There seem to be traces of apparent gaseous matter around some of the frames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. How big is it? It covers about 12 pixels of width in the 320 x 240 pixel frame, at 310x power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. Has anyone else captured pictures of a similar object?  9. Could it be a satellite?  10. If we knew how far away it was, a good estimate could be made of the object&#39;s size and travel rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11. What kind of technology can strobe this fast continuously?  12. Whose technology is it?  Thanks for looking,  Thank you to the witness for the report, video footage and still photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

Through binoculars we could just make out an oval shape and a slight glowing purple mixed in with the blue. It was like looking at both a star and an oval-shaped, lit, flourescent black-light tube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of sighting: 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction (best guess): 290 degrees W by NW from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location in sky: 17 - 20 arc degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: Unusually windy - very gusty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO behavior: Zipping, darting, sharp and rounded/sharp sudden changes in flight, lazy zig-zag pattern, abrupt descension and ascension, inverted arcing patterns (opposite of &#34;Falling Leaf&#34;), sudden speed changes, long and short bursts in a direction. All the while a liquid smooth flight that was a testimony to the mastery over gravity. We eventually stopped watching only due to the fact that the UFO had eventually made it&#39;s way far enough North/West that the dust in the air (due to all the winds that evening) made viewing almost impossible at that distance. When we went back inside it could just barely be seen by us but, was still doing it&#39;s thing. We went back outside 10 minutes later and it was still there, barely visible. I went back out alone another 15 minutes later and both the UFO and the gusty winds were completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Special Note: I have FIVE MINUTES of video footage! Yes it&#39;s your typical &#34;grainy footage/blurry light&#34; evidence BUT, what makes this video stand out is that on three seperate occasions I had a stationary refernce point (power lines, tree tops and a plane that flew by) to be able to campare and signify the UFO&#39;s movements!!!  Opinions: Considering the duration of this sighting (and the fact that the only reason we stopped looking was that the UFO had moved off to another location for others to witness), I still can&#39;t believe at the time of the filing of this report (two days later) that I still haven&#39;t heard anything on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May my UFO footage be a testimony to the fact that there can, indeed, be a UFO &#34;right in front of our faces&#34; and no one would even know because most of us are too preoccupied with trivial things and we have forgotten to look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel fortunate to have witnessed two events, now, in my life (first sighting was late November, 1994 in San Jose, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel even more fortunate that this time I caught it on tape!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We surmised that the witness might have been looking at Venus, but he took strong exception to that suggestion.  We include some of his comments below.  No other sightings reported from this area of the country for the same time and date.   We believe that the description of the location of the anomalous object matches the location of Venus in the night sky, but the witness strongly disputes that fact.  He claims, after the fact, that he could see Venus, as well.  The video would resolve whether there was one, or two bright objects in the northwestern sky.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pardon my bluntness but, IS THIS A JOKE?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and I know EXACTLY what Venus looks like and I know EXACTLY where it is every evening. Along with - as far as all the other naked-eye planets that can currently be observed - Saturn, then Jupiter and in the Eastern sky, Mars, all seen as of 9:00 p.m. every evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lets say we are up in the sky looking down at the land and setting Venus in the west is in the 12:00 position, making north in the 3:00 position. The UFO would have been between the 1:00 and 2:00 position. Like my report said, about 290º west by north west. A significant difference in position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can imagine you have to be extremely cautious about screening people who think this whole UFO/Contact subject is a joke and I can respect that but, please DO NOT treat me like half of the populace on this planet (opinions may vary) - too uneducated to know the difference between a planet and a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video evidence, I mentioned that in my report. All someone has to do is view the footage I shot and the evidence is clear. Three times I caught the UFO on tape flying &#34;next to&#34; (as seen on a one demensional screen) stationary objects. These three objects were across the street from my location so it&#39;s not like I could just move the camera around to make a stationary object in the sky look like it was moving around. I have the UFO flying behind POWER LINES, around TREE TOPS and sharing the same section of sky while a PLANE FLEW BY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> God, almighty! I take the time to try and share my experience with the organizations that can benefit from this (one problem has always been a lack of proof) and I actually HAVE some proof that can help support and legitimize this highly controversial subject and I get the typical Project Blue Book treatment. &#34;You saw Venus&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t mean to be rude or disrespectful, Peter, but, REALLY. You know darn well the description of the movements of the UFO in my report doesn&#39;t even come CLOSE to describing Venus or any other planet. Nor did it look or behave like any type of plane, helicopter, balloon, remote controlled object (which still has to obey the laws of physics as the big objects like a jumbo jet and can&#39;t turn on a dime), flare, meteorite, fireball, comet, satellite, the International Space station or any kind of bird, bat, or owl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is VERY frustrating and I could understand when I had my first sighting in San Jose back in &#39;94 why very few believed me. Evidence is key. Otherwise you hear, &#34;Do you live next to an airport? Di dyou have anything to drink tonight?&#34; That is why I bought my $1500.00 digital camcorder two years ago. I told myself I would never forgive myself if I didn&#39;t at least try and be prepared for another sighting (although I never expected to see another one). I just couldn&#39;t take the chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a massively bruised shin from hitting the door jam when cutting the corner too close when running into my bedroom, and a door to my balcony who&#39;s bottom hinges now &#34;knock&#34; whenever I open or close it due to the fact that I slammed it open too hard when I came in from my balcony to scream at my girlfriend to &#34;Get out here and look!&#34; all in the name of trying to get my digi-cam as fast as I could. I truely expected the sighting to be over by the time I got back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please reconsider this. You&#39;re passing up a legitimate sighting with video evidence!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the video, or excerpts from it, but they have not arrived.

I saw the aircraft north of the road just outside Gold Canyon.  At first I thought I was seeing single sparks from fireworks, but then I noticed that there were lights (not illuminating) evenly spaced and rotating then it left my view.  I called my wife on my cell phone and she thought I was crazy.  Then about 15 minutes later I saw the same craft as I was beginning my assent of Gonzales Pass on the south side of Highway 60.  This time it was lower in the night sky and I got scared.  Again it appeared as single sparks of fireworks but it was certainly a craft of some sort and the &#34;sparks&#34; were light.  The lights did not light up the sky they seamed as though they were running lights.  This area is notorious for military training flights for f-16&#39;s.  I wonder if the government is testing new aircraft or if it was something else?<n>

I continued to drive and he watched, and it disappeared. There was no sound. It was suddenly gone. It had appeared to be moving but very slow, as like a hover. My husband and I were on our way home from shopping and had taken the exit to our town of Keeseville and had just gotten off the Northway ramp and noticed the bright object to our left up in the sky. We have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, it was sent to us on April 27th, and the witness to the alleged events indicates that the sighting occurred on the 28th of April.  This leads us to wonder whether it is a serious report.  To the best of our knowledge, an Air National Guard unit would not fly Grumman F-14 &#34;Tomcats,&#34; which are a jet flown by the U. S. Navy.  An ANG unit probably would fly F-16&#39;s or F-15&#39;s.  If there were other witnesses to this event, we would very much like to receive additional reports.  We will forward the report to Beverly Trout, State Director for MUFON/Iowa for follow-up investigation.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iowa Air National Guard and 727 watched by UFO in West Des Moines Iowa<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The IOWA AIR NATIONAL GUARD, including 4 or more F14 Fighter jets (unsure of exact military aircraft model) were one by one flying over the Racoon River between Des Moines and West Des Moines preparing for landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I was on my daily hike through the Raccon River Park in West Des Moines heading east, with the F14&#39;s directly overhead and in front of me approximately 500 feet over head. I stopped to watch them &#39;bank&#39; or make a tight right turn to get in position to land at the Des Moines Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I watched the first F14, then the second, each came by about 20 seconds apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -As I was wathching the 2nd F14 and looking closesely to see if their were weapons attached underneath the planes (they were very close and I could see the entire plane very clearly, something entered my site above the F14&#39;s that was extemely high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The object started out as a small bright shining metal object because it was so high, that was all I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I watched the object come directly down from the highest point in the sky to the 3rd F14 that had now entered my view right in front of me. He had started his bank or right turn and could also see under that F14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Before the object was close the the F14 I could then see the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Description of object: Once it had descended close enough for me to see, I saw that it was bright, shiny metallic exactly like the metal &#39;mercury&#39;. It was shaped like a bullet when it was coming directly at me. It was approximately 1/2 the size of the F14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It approached the 3rd F14 from the top, and turned sideways and this is when I saw it change shape. It changed from a bullet looking object to a round flat sphere. The rear was not rounded, but was straight. It was able to change like controlled mercury.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Immediately as it turned sideways it dove under the F14 and started what I call &#39;sniffing&#39; at the F14, or observing the underneath of the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was maintaing the same speed with the F14 as it went from the right wing, ducked under the F14 exhaust,engine and went to the left wing and continued the same observation on that side of the F14.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The 3rd F14 continued its extreme turn to head for the Des Moines Airport and the object then left the F14 turning left off of the left wing or heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The object flew slowly at the same altitude approximately 500 feet and hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The object then turned to face west, while hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The object hovered after turning as if it was looking at something west, or behind me. I had a perfect view at this time of the object as it was approximately 1000 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The object then turned north, while hovering, then flew at approximately a 75 degree angle upwards straight again to the highest point I could see in the sky at extremely high speeds, but still able to watch it leave our space. I would say it was like watching a F14 go almost straight up at full speed (which I have watched) and multiple that speed by 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The other or rest of the F14&#39;s made thier approach while I was watching the object leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -20 seconds later 727 passenger jet came over my left shoulder at the same height of the F14&#39;s. That is what the object seemed to be looking at, but by the time the jet had gotten parellel with me, the object was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Witnesses: The pilots of the 727 had to see the object, it was right in front of them hovering. The 3rd F14 pilot had to see the object immediately when it was descended upon. It was also right in front of his windshield. The 4th F14 pilot was right behind the 3rd and had to see the object, no question. Myself as a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was white on the top and grey color on the bottom. It was like a disk with a tall center section. I could not tell if if was moving, but it looked to be just hovering there. You could see the sun reflection off of the white portion(tall center section). I glanced at the road, then back and it was gone. A few miles down the road two miltary jets were flying very fast and low right over the road (first time I saw them flying in this location and that low). Only thing that I could think is that maybe it was an advanced aircraft the military was testing??<n>

She looked out the window toward the south and observed the truck, possibly a city or county vehicle, moving very slowly. Subsequently, she noticed a &#34;big round object&#34; suspended motionless above the house across the road, where the truck had just passed. The object emitted no light, but was visible in the ambient light of daybreak. It was brown in color. Estimate of its size was &#34;bigger than a washing machine but smaller than a car&#34;. She is unsure of the object&#39;s height, but it was certainly above streetlight height, and definitely not &#34;way up there&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to this object, she noticed a &#34;string of flashing lights&#34; at the same apparent altitude as the big round object, extending in a line eastward. She sensed that these lights were somehow associated with the object. She&#39;s unsure of their number, but that there were multiple flashing, separate lights. They were about the same size as streetlights and were yellowish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She observed these objects for approximately 5 minutes, and had no idea what they could be.There were no noticeable sounds associated with them. At no time did she see any of them move; however, after a brief trip into the kitchen, when she returned and looked outside again, they had completely vanished!<n>

The object was so close that it had lit up the whole street. &#34;If it had been a falling star that close there would have been smoke lingering in the air&#34;, I said to my friend. Eight minutes after we had seen it there was a loud, deep EXPLOSION, it didn&#39;t sound like a backfire or gunshot. We were pretty freaked out. We sat their for about an hour discussing what we had seen, trying to identify what we had seen logically, when a light that had been sitting in the sky for that whole hour, decided to just start heading south and dissapear maybe 4 seconds after it had started moving. The odd thing about it was that when it had started moving the sky was just starting to turn blue from the sun coming up. That is what my friend and I saw. Believe me, it was scary. (chills)<n>

Brian I was out on my back porch facing ENE and I was taking pictures of the clouds. I didn&#39;t see this until I downloaded it to my computer. I AM FREAKING OUT! They are watching us even when we can&#39;t see them? I can&#39;t figure out how I didn&#39;t see it when I was taking pictures! This is in Sonora, CA two days ago, April 27, 2004 around 8 or 8:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun just started to set. The picture is attached along with the ones of the scoop mark (better quality) on my brother&#39;s back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m shaking now. I went back through the pictures I was taking and here&#39;s another one. This is looking over the roof. Same time as the other picture but to the North and up. If you look above the contrail, you will see what looks like a black dot. I am sending you the original digital photo. When I magnified it on my desktop, I see a UFO waaaayy up and, magnified, I see what may be windows or something. I also didn&#39;t realize the pictures I sent of my brother&#39;s scoop mark were that very night that I took these photos. Why is this happening to my family? I can&#39;t help feeling helpless.

It&#39;s DARK here.  &#39;Somethin&#39; catches my eye that&#39;s &#39;not there&#39; normally. I&#39;m facing due West and I see 5 &#39;yellowish lights&#39; in a line over the Silverbell Mountains about 340 degrees relative @ 30 deg azimuth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *   * *   *   *              Kind&#39;a like this, but in more of an arc. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all just &#39;appeared&#39; and hovered.  They weren&#39;t aircraft markers &#39;cause they blink even viewed dead on... I&#39;m used to seein&#39; those.  They weren&#39;t flares either... My long distance eyesight is really good (after the operation) While I&#39;m lookin&#39; at this... a meteor makes a trail left to right &#39;n vaporized like a flare. &#39;Seen that before too. So... all of these lights decend in unison beyond the mountain and in the same formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep lookin&#39;.  All of a sudden... now I have 3 lights of the same intensity about 350 degrees relative... 20 deg azimuth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * * *  Not quite as high (altitude) as the 1st set,  but these disappear in about 3 seconds.  They were moving south very slowly. (Wind here is from the south... so they were against the wind.) There&#39;s a 3/4 moon w/no clouds.  Today I stood exactly where I&#39;d been last night &#39;n gauged where I saw &#39;em relative to this rather tall leaning saguero in the distance.  &#39;Can always see the shadow of that.  The Silverbells are about 30 miles away... maybe a bit more.  All of the &#39;lights&#39; disappeared beyond the Silverbells judging from the mountain contour.  They weren&#39; pop flares or parachute flares.  Luminosity was steady, altho not &#39;starlike&#39;.  There&#39;s nothing&#39; on the west side of the Silverbells for a good long distance. Gauging from the leaning cactus as a vertical marker... they were above and beyond the Silverbells.  I see the helo&#39;s from D-M AFB on nite-ops frequently... so it&#39;s not them. These lights weren&#39;t as bright as anti-collision lights &#39;n did not move other than up &#39;n down... altho I never saw them go up.  That was prob&#39;ly due to the mountain contour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was outside (same time) but putterin&#39; with the garden hose waterin&#39; the trees.  She swears she&#39;s not hard of hearing... but she is... &#39;Cause I&#39;m yellin&#39; &#34;LOOK, LOOK WEST...&#34; &#39;n she&#39;s oblivious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somethin&#39; else happened while I was starin&#39; west.  An airliner flew directly overhead.  They never do that.  Altitude about 2K&#39;.  &#39;Flew directly between &#39;me&#39; &#39;n the moon so I could determine it was a 737 type by the shape &#39;n engine locations.  &#39;Wonder if the crew didn&#39;t vector the aircraft for a look at what I was lookin&#39; at as well?  He was comin&#39; from Tucson airport flyin&#39; West by NW.  &#39;Lowest I&#39;ve seen &#39;em fly &#39;cause usually I never hear &#39;em.  &#39;Heard this one tho. Picked up his outline when he crossed the moon clearly.  They usually transit way south of here in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that when ya look at a light in the dark long enuff... it&#39;ll appear to move... which is why I took that bent cactus as a reference point. In relation to the bent cactus... they moved.  I&#39;m lookin&#39; West by Southwest.  Phoenix is 180+ miles N/NW.  All the roads here are laid out true N/S/E/W so it&#39;s easy to orient direction.  I&#39;m lookin&#39; at these lights at approx 25-30 deg azimuth to the horizon.  Dunno how tall the mountains over there are, but at least 800&#39;-1,000&#39; above this plateau.  Yuma&#39;s too far NW &#39;n in this direction.  It&#39;d be south of Ajo &#39;n even that would be NW of where I was lookin&#39;.  Only thing inna straight line would be the Organ Pipe Cactus Nat&#39;l monument north of Soronito Mex.   I&#39;m facing Mexico &#39;cause of the angle the Pima county border runs.  Whatever they were... they would be too high to be flares I think... &#39;n not bright enuff.  Those mag flares burn rather &#39;blue&#39;.  &#39;Saw no other activity in that direction... &#39;No aircraft lights or anything.  These were yellow(ish) &#39;n not as bright as the stars (which were visible) but ruffly the same diameter as a small star. &#39;Bout the size ya see in Orions belt. I considered all that when I eyeballed these things.  There ain&#39;t s&#39;posed to be NUTHIN&#39; in that direction. There&#39;s no habitation in that direction &#39;cept for a few Rez shacks scattered about. No real &#39;roads&#39; either other than Rt. 85.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rough measurements using Microsoft Streets and Trips, straight line distance, statute miles:  Roughly this location to rough location of Luke AFB: 110 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly this location to areas south of Gila Bend: 80 miles. I think there are targets there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly this location to middle of restricted area east of Yuma: 150 miles   Direction of the lights would be over the Papago Rez toward Organ Pipe Nat&#39;l Monument. That&#39;s south of Yuma.  I&#39;m on the western edge (and middle of) the Saguaro National Park West.  &#39;Bout 1/8 mile east from the AWP canal... (due west) &#39;n the Rez is on the other side of that. &#39;Canal runs N/S and angles to the S/E &#39;bout a half mile or so south of my pos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gila Bend is NW from my pos.   As I mentioned... from my LOS... these things were south of Ajo, in-line with the Organ Pipe NM.  There&#39;s nuthin&#39; else out there &#39;cept RT. 85 between the mountains.  No clouds... This wasn&#39;t a reflection... these lights were distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other witness:  My sister-in-law spotted &#39;em when she was leaving last nite before I did.  &#39;Sez she sat in her car (in the road) &#39;n watched 3 of &#39;em for several minutes..  One thing... she said she saw one of &#39;em rise and cross over the top of another , then settle in formation alongside. Then they all disappeared together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military ranges:  All that kind&#39;a ran thru my head while I&#39;m lookin&#39; at these lights. Too far south... unknown distance bu my sis-in-law said they appeared larger and were a bit further north (about due west) than when I spotted &#39;em... which indicates they moved SW.  Only other lights are the Silverbell mine road... &#39;n they&#39;re orange &#39;n sort&#39;a &#39;wink&#39; in the distance &#39;cause of the atmosphere.  These didn&#39;t and were steady.  They didn&#39;t behave like flares or helos.  Way too fast for either when they did move.  Neither did they describe an arc.  They were rather up-down or straight lines. Weird!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not given to makin&#39; stuff like this up... &#39;n bein&#39; a sailor I&#39;ve seen lots&#39;a stuff at sea &#39;n while airborne at a great distance... aircraft, birds, clouds... reflections, explosions, flares, weather balloons, sea critters &#39;n even waterspouts.  &#39;Livin&#39; where I do... I&#39;m always concious of &#39;what&#39;s out there&#39;... especially at night. Anything &#39;new&#39; will catch my attention. I know there&#39;s normally nuthin&#39; in that direction, so this got my attention &#39;n I eyeballed it for as long as the &#39;lights&#39; were visible... Taking bearings and approximate azimuth in my head... which most &#39;lubbers&#39; dunno how to do. Flares don&#39;t behave like that... &#39;n neither do helo&#39;s.  I see enuff H-60&#39;s &#39;n UH-1&#39;s out here... as well as the stuff Border Patrol flies at night to know what they look like at a distance. These &#39;lights&#39; fit none of those parameters. The lights never wavered in formation and were distinct.  None of that &#39;winking&#39; or fuzzy effect.  I mite add... nobody&#39;d been drinkin&#39; anything prior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well... that&#39;s IT.... I&#39;m convinced I&#39;ve finally seen UFO&#39;s... &#39;cause there&#39;s no other way to explain it.   There is NOTHING... in that direction but desert all the wa to the border.<n>

It was in my direct line of sight and flew toward the southeast. it only took about five to seven seconds to pass. it was large compared to other objects that had been in the area. It looked to be the size of a eraser head and dark blue, almost a grey color; much darker than the light sky. what was interesting to me was that it was so large , but so high in the sky and it flew past much faster than the planes i had been observering earlier. I was alone and called to my friend inside the house, by the time they came outdoors it had already moved from my view and out of sight. I thought it was strange and questioned my friend , since he is from the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were going back home after going to the local video store when I looked up and noticed lights in the sky. The lights were very odd. There were between 6 and 8 lights. At one time it seemed 3 lights in a row, a small break, and three more lights in a row. they were very parallel with each other. i showed them to my wife, who at first just thought it was a plane, but I pointed out that even one of the lights were to bright to be a plane. We saw them all the way down our local highway, and kept track of them when we turned right onto a side road. At that time it disappeared. We looked around into the entire  sky and found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went into our house and told our parents about the encounter and kinda pushed it aside until it was reported today that more people witnessed the event and it was being investigated. When I saw the pictures of the UFO over New Mexico today, the pictures seemed very familiar to what My wife and I saw in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I then noticed a very bright light behind the airliner off to the East-southeast traveling at a constant speed in a straight line towards the commercial airliner. The object was round in shape and was a bright white with a bluesh tint to it. I observed the object chase and catch up to the airliner and fly right above the airliner for around one or two seconds.After the one or two seconds above the airliner,the bright light on the object went out and the object disappeared. I could no longer see the object. It was a clear night with no clouds in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/26/04 22:00|St. Petersburg Beach|FL|Light|10 min|Absolutely Unreal.  What looked like a star , proved to something much more interesting!!!!!|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37091.html|47|ndxe200404| Absolutely Unreal.  What looked like a star , proved to something much more interesting!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me my girlfriend and roomate went down to the beach after sunset. We were watching the stars, when what appeared to just be a star hanging low right on the horixon, burst into a huge ball of yellow-orange light. The glow lasted approx 5 seconds and then dissolved right back to a star on the horizon. All three of us saw the same thing. Then the object shot across the horizon at an unreal speed.  It seemed to almost teleport all the way across the horizon. It sat for a second and then shot about halfway back. It then abruptly stopped and began moving slow and smooth like a plane. At this point we were all absolutely speechless!  As we began to discuss what might have just happened, I noticed the object looked like it might have been coming off the horizon.  It made its way directly towards us. In under 45 sec. the object that was a dot on the horizon had so smoothly approached us within 1000 yds. off shore and was hovering at approx. 1000 ft.  It was never possible to get a good visual of the object though, it was extremely errie that it was that close and we never were able to tell what it was.  The light on it was a wide bright white glow, the glow was the only thing we could see.  The object approached so gracefully, making just a slight hum, it was not a prop enging plane, it was not a jet engine plane, it was not a helecopter! After the object hovered over us for approx. 50 sec. it turned its light away from us and slowly headed back off to the horizon, yet still even from behind we were never able to get a visual on the object.  All three of us were in complete shock, when the object began approaching, no one said a damn word untill it left!  we all saw the same thing, and we all are convinced it was absolutely out of this world. My uncle was an F15 pilot for 25 years, growing up I was facinated will all aviation, I can tell you almost any jet that flys over the beach either en route to Mac Dill, Tampa or Clear/St.Pt.  This experience leads me to believe that there is definetely some! thing somewhere with far better technology than ours.  A brand new F22 went over a few days ago, he hit the after burners while going over and it shook the whole neighborhood, this new superjets speed was probably 1/1000th of the objects!! Anyway, This experience was unreal, I am a firm believer now that something else is out There.  And then two days later, I see in the St Pete Times the Incident in Iran. An entire village observed an object in braod daylight.  And now the March 5th video of the Mexican Air force, it was explained as balls of lightning, are you kidding they surrounded the jet!!! Nice try! Peace, and Keep your eyes on the sky!!<n>

This was a very peculiar sighting because Coalition fighters were in the area, flying sorties, and seemed to scatter away as the object approached Ramadi. It flew low (10,000-15,000ft), made no sound at all, and sped up and slowed down frequently. At first I decided it was a fighter formation. So I waited for the sound. It never came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My relief, walking up, saw me looking up and asked what I was looking at, he looked up and said &#34;oh... One of ours?&#34;, I said,&#34;I dunno? It isn&#39;t making any noise&#34;. Then I lost sight of it over a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I briefed my relief of what took place on my shift, what to expect that night, and special orders from our CO. I started walking back to my rack when I noticed the object had stopped shortly after it left our sight. I hovered in the distance. As I watched, I noticed one of the 3 lights on the right move in and out of the formation repeatedly. I stood there scratching my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got angry for not being able to figure out what it was and said, &#34;what the F%$k is that?&#34; My relief, now on guard, walked over, looked up and said, &#34;huh, thats so friggin wierd&#34;. As he said that it started moving east fast. Then it slowed almost to a stop, and shot off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that both me and my buddy were staring at a black sky with our mouths open. I shook myself out of whatever trance I was in, looked at my buddy, who was still staring, and tapped his shoulder. He jumped a little and looked back at me. We said nothing except a mutual,&#34;huh&#34;, and parted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain what it was. I have been out here on 2 occassions, and never witnessed anything remotely like it. After it disappeared, I just walked away without a word or second thought till later. My buddy vaugely remembers what happened. I find that very disturbing…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The fellow I talked with had told his father of a sighting he and his wife had tonight. His dad gave his son my phone number and the man called me and told me of an unusual sighting which he and his wife witnessed this evening. The fellows wife was the first to notice it while the couple were sitting outside of their residence having a cigarette. The sky was completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was visible for approx: 20 to 30 seconds before it left the couple line of sight and was certainly a triangular shaped craft. The witness said it was a glowing white in color, no lights were seen on the craft. The man guessed the object was flying at approx: 20,000 feet. Because of how high the craft was and being night time I wanted to make sure how the witnesses came to be able to view the object. This was due to the color of it. They explained that it was extremely bright, but went on to say you couldn&#39;t miss it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no aura or glowing light surrounding it, there was no trail or tail following behind. The witness said he saw no aircraft before or during the sighting, but said right after the object passed by a helicopter was seen flying at a low level shinning it&#39;s spotlight down towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew in a straight line towards the northeast over Okanagan Lake. At arms length the witness guessed the object would have been 1 to 2 centimeters in length looking from his location. No sound was heard. The man said the craft was solid in color and not just points of light in a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness also said he tried to contact the Kelowna, B.C. airport tower but they were closed or not answering the telephone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

Immediately when I turned onto the road, we saw something hovering in the sky. It was about 40 or 50 feet above the trees, right on the side of the road where we were driving. It was 3 extremely bright lights, all in a row close to each other. I could not see the craft itself because the lights were so bright in front of it, but I would say the lights were on 1 craft and not 3 seperate ones. The lights were not shining straight ahead, or pointing straight down at the ground, but kind of in between. They looked like huge spotlights and illuminated the sky and trees all around it. The lights were white. I pulled over on the side of the road to watch it. After about a minute, maybe a little more, it moved a few blocks west pretty rapidly, still at the same height. Then came right back just as fast to the origional location. When this happened, I got scared and put the car in gear to drive again. As I was doing this, It flew south and up higher and was out of sight within 4 or 5 seconds. There was no sound from it at all. I know other people had to have seen it. It was above houses and it would be hard to miss such bright lights out your window. Another car behind me pulled over and watched it too. A truly amazing sight to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to see in the clear detail a black V shaped craft travelling at tremendous speed suddenly halt just feet away from me. It had approx 10 white disks (not quite sure how many) that reminded me of satellite receiver dishes. They covered the whole of the underside. There were no glowing lights. It was completely silent. I saw this very clearly. It seemed to dart toward me and then suddenly darted away. I can licken its movements to a hummingbird. Then (and this is what makes me wonder if I hallucinated) I felt in a bit as a daze as i watched it transfixed (maybe due to shock) as it moved off at high speed and then it seemed to change direction and come at me but this felt more psychological than actual. I panicked and dived into the apartment completely scaring the wife. I came out again and it was gone. There was a gentleman on a balcony in an adjacent apartment who was positioned so that he &#39;could&#39; have seen somthing but he did not show any signs that he saw anything and I felt too embarrassed to ask. I have never previously seen a UFO or submitted a UFO post before. I am of sound mind, never had a mental illness and never hallucinated and it worries me that I could have hallucinated in such detail. I am staying Anonamous because I really do question what I saw and I feel confused and foolish. I hope that sombody saw somthing similar and can help me understand what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Light was approx 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Light was magnitude of an average star.  Conditions were extremely clear as the area was experiencing &#34;Santa Ana&#34; conditions, record high temps for the date.  Light displayed &#34;erratic&#34; motion, moved from side to side, right angle moves, etc.  Light displayed a slight flicker, but this certainly could be due to atmospheric conditions.  Total field covered by the moving light was approx. 5 degrees in any direction.  The light was also viewed by a witness whom I notified via cell phone, approx. 15 miles to the south of my position.  This indicates to me that the source of light was extremely far away.  I attempted to have an additional witness view the light from San Diego, (approx. 120 miles to the south), but was unsuccessful.  I first viewed the light at approx. 8:55PM, sighting lasted to approx. 10:15PM  I did not notice any change in the pattern of commercial jet activity (flight approaches coincided with the general vicinity of the light) during the entire time of the light display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion is that the light might have been a celestial body, probably Venus, which is in the northwestern sky, at the angle of elevation indicated by the witness.  We will suggest that he look again in the same area of the sky, at about the same time, on August 27, to see if the object is visible again.  PD))<n>

We watched it untill it was out of sight.  As I turned to go back in my home I heard my father yell &#34;What the hell is that!&#34;  I Quickly looked up in time to see a large cigar or rectangle shaped object zip across the sky.  It was very dark in color but you could still see dim reflections through out the whole object.It had what appeared to be four dimond shaped lights,just slightly smaller than the whole object, across the bottom; however they were also very dim. The whole object looked sort of faded as it went over head. When I looked up the object was directly above my house and considerably low flying, aproxametly 10,000 feet or so. My father, who is learning to be a pilot, said that the object was flying about even with the top of the mountains.  As I looked up at the object it continued to fly forward in a straight line although it appeared to be sitting at an angle with one side higher in elevation than the other. It was flying from south to north on the west side of the big dipper and directly in between to very bright stars that I think may have been planets.(astronomy is not my strong point.) It crossed a considerable amount of sky very fast, about 4 to 6 seconds, and then was temporarinly out of sight. What struck me as the most odd part about this first pass, other than the shear speed of the object, was the fact that there was no sound. No soud at all, dead silent. A few seconds later the object was vissible again, only a lot higher in elevation, about cruising elevation for an average jetliner.  It continued north for about 4 seconds then quikly shot back south. It covered about 2 inches of the sky in only 2 seconds then just dissapeard.  My father and I stayed out side for about another 5 minutes wathcing the sky, more so out of shock than anything else.  At one point we saw a jetliner in the sky tr! aveling from east to west. One thing we noted was that for the jet to travle about a 2 inch distance of sky took nearly 15 to 20 seconds as aposed to the 2 seconds of the earlier object. Also the satalite we had been watching was traveling south east, and the UFO started about where the satelite had gone out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another erie fact to mention would be, that after the object passed I had gone in my 93 ford ranger to grab my jacket and upon entering every light in my truck began flashing. The headlights, the taillights, the domelight, and the blinkers, were all going nuts for about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They did this in a very random pattern.  Sometimes they would all light up individually at different times and sometimes two or three or four of them would all light up together in different hovering positions in the sky.  Not predictable at all.  One of the other cooks said that they were lighting up and then flying around each other in ways that airplanes or helicopters couldn&#39;t.  He said, &#34;It looked like they were playing tag.&#34;  When I saw them they were very stationary or after some time they would slowly change their positions, but then stop and hover again doing their light show.  Their numbers went from 5 of them and about 20-30 minutes later I went out back with our dishwasher and saw one remaining, but faint.  We were looking to the North from downtown Olympia by the Farmer&#39;s Market on the water.  They also seemed to be in the flight path of airplanes flying into Sea-Tac.  Pilots must have seen something weird...  Right before they would lost all their light, I could see a very tiny object behind the light and I would say it was saucer shaped, although it looked very far away right before it disappeared.  When they would light up though, they were bright.  Not a star in the sky at the time, you could only see the moon and these things lit up brighter and with more intensity and solid white light than anything I&#39;ve seen in the sky.  A good handful of customers saw them as well.  One guy even called up our local paper here, the Olympian, to tell them what was going on.  He said he is in the military and had never seen anything like that so he called it in.  I checked after the sun went down and I didn&#39;t see anything.  I think that their light came from the sun, because the sun was directly behind us whil! e looking at them.  As the sun went down, the less and less intense the lights became.  Like they had as much light to show us as the sun had to give them.  They were brighter than any airplane light, planet or even Venus right now.  It was rad.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a orange ball in the sky, and looked and it appeared to be an airplane. It went out of my sight, and then about 5 seconds later I saw another orange flare-up. Appeared to be comming from the underneath of the object. Object proceded to disappear from my view after second flare-up. It was in broad daylight, so I ruled out the possibility of the landing lights right away. The sun was overhead, as it was 1:30 PM.. so it could not have been a refraction of the light at an angle. There was no report of any airplane problems on the evening news, or on the FAA website at the time this event occured. Object far too low to be a spaceshuttle re-entering the atmosphere - less than 2000 feet above the earth. Moved a bit faster than a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first was very insignificant but it was because of this first one that I later noticed the more prominent one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1st sighting: I was driving south on Hwy 97 in Bend, from the Holiday Inn. I hadn&#39;t quite reached Cooley Rd yet, but was coming up on it fast. It was about 9:00 pm, only a half hour or so before my second sighting. I saw this dark object &#34;fly&#34; over the road from west to east. I noticed it because it reflected light on it&#39;s underside. I saw it for perhaps a second. It then stopped reflecting light whereupon I could no longer see it. If I had to surmise how big the object was, in my best guess it was small; perhaps as big as a large duck. I also believe that it was very low to the ground, around 100 feet no higher. The shape was nearly indiscernable. It would be pointless to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd sighting: I was driving north off Glacier Ridge and came to the stop sign where you turn onto Neff rd. I was looking in the night sky for more stuff because of my first sighting. I noticed a bright light in the sky. I thought it looked funny, but not suspicious. I watched it at the stop sign until I noticed it had a blinking light. It then started to move to the west where I then realized this must be Air Life. I rolled down my window and heard the blades of a helicopter which more or less confirmed my suspicions. I then turned onto Neff Rd heading west and continued to look in the same patch of sky (looking true north), when I became aware of a strange assortment of stars. There was quite a few of them all in straight line. I knew this was more than a coincidence so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out to take a look. And I did for five minutes. This is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 12 of these lights. They appeared just like normal stars. Equal in size, and luminicity. If they weren&#39;t in a straight line I would have never known the better. The first light closest to me was directly above me. Straight up in the sky. Then the next one was a little to the north, and the next one the same distance to the north as well. It appeared from my angle as if they were all spaced equally apart from each other, except that the distance they covered shortened the length for the ones farthest to the north. I noticed that the lights were moving ever so slowly. At first they appeared to be moving north, but after a while I noticed their greatest motion was from east to west. They all moved together to maintain this straight line. On a couple occasions I couldn&#39;t count 12 but only 10 but that&#39;s probably because they were hazed over by the city light of Bend. On two occasions it also appeared as if the lights all would wobble together. Meaning all of them would seem to wobble in place, and I believe all of them did this at the same time, however it was hard to discern without any reference for a plane of stability in the sky. It might have been only the one light moved from more or less directly north of me, to the northwest of my vision, and were ever so slowly moving north as well. The one light that used to be directly overhead was now further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got back in my car and drove no less than a quarter of a mile.. keeping an eye on these lights outside my passenger window. When the oddest thing happened. I passed them! I pulled over again and got out to take a look. And I noticed the lights were roughly in the same place in relation to me, as I was in my original spot after first spotting them! I had somehow passed them in less than a 1/4 of a mile! When I was driving I saw myself passing them up! Now before seeing this, my guess was that these lights that looked a lot like stars, were pretty high up in the sky. But after realizing I had passed them up in my car in such a small distance, they had to be really low to the ground. Perhaps 500 feet, maybe a little more. And they must have been small too... It&#39;s hard to say, but maybe the size of a kite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I didn&#39;t watch them long after the second time I pulled over, but I just left after taking my fill. I tried really hard to be objective about this. No lost time. No noises were eminating from these lights. What little wind there was, was blowing from the west and sometimes the north. I find it very hard to think that this could have been some weird person&#39;s idea of attaching lights to a kite, and attempting to fly it with little to no wind, in the middle of the night! And somehow making them drift across the sky in formation! Usually a kite rotates from the anchor, and these lights did not do that!  The other interesting thing to note is that my mother said, according to the news station the military was testing jet craft or the like during the night time this last week. I heard such a craft around noon a week prior to this alleged news briefing. Now if this is military related, it must be small remote control craft. I would be very hard pressed to imagine something else. Whatever it was, these two sightings were small, which is a theme. Although one did not emit light, the other string of objects did..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t think of more than that. The lights seemed like natural star light. Remember Air Life (I assume it was Airlife because the hospital was a half mile away!) was nearby before I noticed the lights. They may have been there before, but I never noticed. Oh one last thing... It was a beautiful day in Central Oregon, so there was not a cloud in the sky, and ditto for the night as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel that it&#39;s pertinent to my UFO sightings to mention my mood. I have witnessed 5 UFO&#39;s, and I mean that in the most literal sense. I don&#39;t assume they were alien craft, military, or whatever. They are just Unidentified Objects manuevering in the sky. But on four of these sightings I remember my mood to be in the range of happy, and usually full of energy. More or less just feeling good about myself. The other UFO sighting of mine happened much earlier in my life (9 years old) and I can&#39;t recall my mood, but I was with a lot of friends, so I suspect it to be in the &#34;feeling good&#34; range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay I have just proofread this and remember one last thing although I feel it&#39;s unrelated to the incident, and makes me feel a little more than embaressed. But when I first saw the Air Life helicopter, I tried flashing it with my headlights on my car. I was flashing them with my &#34;brights&#34; pretty rapidly, comparable to morse code. They copter was in the perfect position to see me, so I thought I might get a response from it. I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approx. dusk.  From my window I could see a very odd black mass in the sky, possibly I thought a bunch of balloons but it was floating in a &#34;non-balloon like manner&#34; if that makes any sense.  I went out to my porch to look at it more closely and it was just sort of hovering there.  It seemed quite dense.  It was approximately 1/4 the size of the full moon.  It looked like it was moving higher and getting smaller.  I ran to get my video camera.  When I got back, it looked like it was very faint in the sky, but I have zoom on my camera so I tried to frame it.  I managed to frame it briefly and it looked very very odd.   Two clusters of four black blobs all floating around in a semi-symetrical manner.  Then, after 1 minute total of filming, my camera battery died.  Which is very strange, as it was on the charger when I brought it onto the balcony.  I continued to look but it was almost invisible at this point.  What I thought might be the &#34;cluster&#34; (at this point just a dark point) seemed to be approached slowly by another black point in the sky.  Then it got too dark to see anything.  No light emitted by anything to my eyes.  A very strange experience.  It could have been a cluster of balloons released, but they didn&#39;t seem to move straight up when I first saw them.  They seemed to move lateraly.   A very freaky experience.  I can try to upload the video (it was a digital camcorder) if you are interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also rang my eldest daughter and told her. I cant and have no explanation for what we saw, but I know what I saw and it was huge and was definetly the bottom of something very large, the sheer size of it is what got me, how could something that big be in the sky, it was just above the clouds, so we were lookin! g through the clouds at this object and the lights must have been extremely bright to shine through as they did.

When I saw them,appaering at about 45 degres out of the dark, they went in a N/east S/west direction, as if crossing the upper-atmoshere. I called muy friend thinking for a second it would be a shooting star visible for a second or two. But I quickly realised it was&#39;t as brigth and there was 5 of them one ahead of a four formation, the were ligth grey in color(i&#39;m colorblind)sort of triangle shaped. they did&#39;t go brigther or darker, they seemed to be very high and very fast, and were moving independantly but never breaking the general formation.We were absolutly silent both thinking we could&#39;t be seeing this, but we did&#39;t speak for the whole time.They went straigth over our heads we had to twist our necks to follow them. There were no flashing ligths, no apparent source of ligth at the back of the craft(reactor).It was eerie but the adrenaline was rushing throught me. They disapaered at the same angle in a thin cloud going just slightly more south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both knew what we saw when we went back in the flat. But we knew no-one would believe us( I think they didn&#39;t, even two friends from 10 years). I had just arrived from work and had one drink only. I&#39;ve only found the web site today, but I&#39;haven&#39;t heard any similar report coming from London. Has anyone seen these??  These were not regular planes, or meteorites or spy planes. But it was scary at the beginning when your senses can&#39;t recognise what you see.And you analyse things to rationnaly categorise the phenomenon. You can&#39;t so you accept what you see.But we did&#39;t call at our friends two rooms away, I think because it felt like a privileged moment, meant to happen. I could&#39;t care less if no-one believed me, now I know...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was amazing, awe inspiring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) (french) London<n>

Behind the outdoor stage was a lake, and behind the lake a backdrop of trees.  The craft moved from right to left on a quick diagonal; height was impossible to tell in the darkness, but the craft seemed to be about 3 inches long in my sight line.  It flashed silently and quickly across the sky, with no trail or noise of any kind.  This was witnessed by most in attendance that evening, a crowd of several hundred adults and Scouts, but it was not discussed or acknowledged publicly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Approx:. 2500 ft. I assumed it was most likely a small plane but noticed it was traveling faster than most. As I watched the white light blinked out. A few seconds later there was a single red strobe flash and then the white light reappeared going back the way it came just as fast. There is no way a small plane could have reversed directions that fast. I grabbed my new Video camera and in the few seconds it took to warm up the light blinked out again. There was still a little light in the sky but I could see nothing in the area. I checked with my binoculars but found nothing..<n> <n><n> <n><n> April. 14 - Approx:. 10:00 PM - Observed what appeared to be a fairly large meteorite heading in a northerly direction. As I watched it suddenly shrank in size and within seconds just appeared to be a satellite still heading in the same direction. Very similar to that object I saw back in the summer of 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to write this down but it occurred around the beginning of April 2004. The weather was overcast with low thick clouds. Approx:. 5 PM. I was playing on my computer when I noticed, Two dull yellow disk shaped objects, flying one behind the other in a SSE directions. Cloud level was approx:. 1000 ft. and these glowing disks appeared to be either in the clouds or just over them. I would estimate they were about over the area of 108 and King George and from that distance appeared to be about the size of the full moon. Estimated speed approx:. 3 to 4 hundred miles an hour. Time of sighting about five to ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My new camera has night vision and can see better than I can in the dark. The other night I saw that strange light which appears to flash white, blue and red. I aimed the camera at it and started zooming in and it must be in near orbit as the image filled my view finder even before it got to full digital zoom. (900X) Normal stars still look like stars slightly magnified. Anyway I did not see the blue and red lights which I&#39;ve seen through my binoculars but did see reddish looking protudences on the sides. Reminded me of Mickey Mouse. The white object appeared to be rotating quite fast but that may just have been an effect caused by the atmosphere. Just for the heck of it I left the camera running while pointed up at the sky, to my surprise I saw what appeared to be very two very faint satellites pass through the rather narrow field of view within about five minutes. I also noticed several dark shadowy objects passing in front of the stars in the view finder. I tried looking at the same area through my binoculars but could only just barely make out the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing I just remembered I got my new camera on the 13th. of April and spent all afternoon playing with it. My wife was getting annoyed and told me to put it away. About five minutes later I saw what appeared to be a small plane flying by about two blocks from here. The lights didn&#39;t look right and it was flying not much higher than my apt. I grabbed my binoculars and took a look but was unable to see the fuselage if it had one. Could only see the lights. Two small lights on what I took to be the nose, one red, one white. Where the wings should be I saw a bright blue light and a red one on the other side both larger then the nose lights, behind the wings? I saw two more lights mounted one behind the other one large white one and a large red one. As it passed the Green tower at City Centre Mall I could see a small white light on its tail. It had been heading east but swung to a southerly heading after passing the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway it looks like it might be a good summer for sightings, hopefully I will manage to get something on tape. I got a little excited this afternoon while playing back my tape from yesterday evening on my TV. I saw this thing with two big yellow lights and what looked light a dark saucer shape in the background, after watching it for a few seconds I realized it was an aircraft with its landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also noticed a number of times now those single strobe flashes which seem to be coming from space. my camera has picked them up numerous times now. I&#39;ve played them back one frame at a time and they only seem to last for one frame and I can see nothing around them even with the camera set at about 20X zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

The gentleman&#39;s wife was the first to spot the strange lights from an upstairs window. The lady called to her husband and when he got to the window she asked, &#34;what is that&#34;? The husband first thought it was an airplane a fair distance away from them but moving closer towards their direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What started the couple thinking, was that whatever it was, moved along the horizon and eventfully passed from their line of sight due to a large pine tree which got in the way. Shortly after they lost sight of it, it came back into their view and again sat stationary. Six to seven minutes later the object still remaining stationary the two witnesses noticed two more smaller lights which appeared on either side of the larger light which they had already been observing. Seeing this was turning out to be really unusual the couple jumped into their car to see if they might be able to get a better look at the objects. They eventually reached a good location as to where they could watch the lights. They had pulled off the highway beside a farmers field and this is when they started taking the photos of the objects. The fellow told me at this point he is a bit of a skeptic when it comes to these matters, but after watching the strange lights in the sky he is re-thinking the whole topic on UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still observing the three lights, one of the smaller objects shot off away from the larger object at a incredible rate of speed. While still watching, another light which was sitting stationary, started to flicker out. Then all of a sudden in about 2 seconds it was in another location of the sky hovering. Another light appeared, taking the place of the light that just had flickered out. In total there were 5 to 6 lights sitting in the sky at one time. The fellow said it certainly was a formation of lights, one large one and all the rest were smaller in size. The large light was extremely bright and the other smaller ones were a lot dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple were certainly baffled over what they were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting under investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

Broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of people laying down on tables pointed out a couple of circular objects in the sky almost directly above us.  They seemed to be very high up.  No detail visible, just white circles.  They were about the size of Venus at night quite recently except this was broad daylight and they were not shining.  They were moving east, or towards the &#34;white&#34; of the sky, all the while maintaining the same distance between them, until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more (or the same, unsure) then showed up.

All of a sudden, I noticed TWO PINK TRIANGLES way up in the clouds.  I could not judge the distance, but it was very high...high enough for airplanes to fly, as I have seen many times before...but I knew these were not airplanes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing to watch the TWO PINK TRIANGLES as they moved in close proximity to each other...I was trying to figure out what they were.  I knew that they were not balloons...as they did not move with the wind...nor were they kites...which could easily be blown about as well.  These either stayed stationary, or they moved in unison to the left, then right, and then up.  Finally, they disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately phoning my cousin in Darlington, PA to report what I had just witnessed, a short time later while still on the phone, I was astonished to see the TWO PINK TRIANGLES reappear in the sky.  I observed them again, for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen many programs on TV about UFO&#39;s, I knew that what I observed were very unusual.  Never before had I heard of a UFO described as a PINK TRIANGLE.  But I knew what I had seen was NOT an airplane, balloon, kite, or anything else I have ever seen before.  I felt in my gut that what I had seen was very definitely a UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Doctor of Chiropractic and I live and practice in Marietta, GA.  I have no history of hallucinations, nor of seeing UFO&#39;s.  My professional education has taught me to make objective observations of scientific evidence, and not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in.  However, I am quite convinced that what I observed on April 24, 2004 were, in fact, TWO PINK TRIANGLES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN UFO&#39;s.<n>

Upon crossing under the Harlem Ave. overpass, I noticed a single cherry-red colored light hanging motionless in the sky south/southwest of the expressway at about a 70 degree angle to the horizon. It was about the size and intensity of a very bright star.  At first I thought it to be the port-side red wing light on a plane but the odd thing was there were no other navigation lights visible (no belly or tail strobe, no green starboard wing light, etc.) I also thought that it might be a star or planet at first, but as I drove westward I eventally passed under it at which time it was then behind me (but still motionless in the same position on the sky). I then got off of I-80 and headed southbound on U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Rd.) and the light was still there in it&#39;s original position with my car now headed south and the light being to my left still at about 70 degrees to the now eastern horizon.  Although I couldn&#39;t tell how big or high up it really was, I got the impression that it was lower than planes would be heading into Midway Airport (I was at 19500 south and Midway is at 6300 south on the Chicago area&#39;s street grid).  Also of note was there was no noise, and if it were a helicopter, I think I would have been close enough to hear the rotors, see other navigation lights and probably even see some of the body of a helicopter.  There was no shape discernible here...just the bright, hovering pinpoint of light.  After briefly heading west on 195th St., I then turned south, but when I looked for the light in the eastern sky, it was gone.  I noticed the light had a vey crisp, clean color to it...no twinkling like a star and it&#39;s color was differant than a red radio antanea light or plane wing light...it was almost the shade of those old &#34;blue dot&#34; taillights or maybe those bright new LED lights used on new stop lights and railroad crossings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE - Although I do have an interest in UFO&#39;s, this was the first time I&#39;ve seen or reported anything unidentified first-hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for 21AU04 in same location.

The sky was fairly clear with only a few clouds. I&#39;ve been skygazing for a while and used to identifying planes, constellations, satellites, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The meteors were scarce and as I walked to an open field at the developement to get a better view and less light pollution. I looked up towards the constellation Leo.  East of the sickle (Leo the lion&#39;s mane) I saw a bright starlike object. As bright if not brighter than the near by star Regulus.  At first, I thought the object was a satellite or perhaps aglimpse of the shuttle as it followed a straight east-west path towards the sickle.  It moved at a fairly good pace then angled south about 120 deg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The common way to give rough distances while stargazing is to hold ones arm out and gauge by the number of fingers between stars.  Using others stars as a reference point for its movement, it moved anywhere from two to four fingers between turns.  It made it&#39;s next turn at about 90 deg  and a few more turns as it circled around behind the sickle and over Leo&#39;s back. It made a sharp 25 deg turn and turned again to head North.  It covered the distance at a slower rate and then went from bright to fade out, possibly going straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made my way back to the house and it was 11:15 EST.  The whole time I watched, I ruled out any dust, bugs, (too far away and did not move in erratic manner), planes (a plane could pull off those turns and the light was steady) satellites (they follow a straight East-West or North-South path) etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights moved at a high speed, crossing from horizon to horizon in an estimated 6 seconds, straight and close to the zenith, many times faster than any aircraft or satellite that I have observed. The lights maintained their position relative to each other, but I couldn&#39;t see whether they were part of the same craft.  One light was behind and to the left of the other;  if one imagines a triangle moving point-first with lights on the leading point and on the leftmost point behind, with no light on the right, then one can get an idea of what I saw. The lights had an orange color similar to that of a sodium street lamp.  The sky was slightly hazy, and the haze appeared to be at a very high altitude, since a commercial jet observed a moment later appeared very clearly.  The lights of the unidentified object, on the other hand, looked as if they were above the haze.  No sound could be heard, though I listened for a long time (since the sound of fast-moving aircraft can seem to lag behind the image).  The apparent altitude and speed of the object were such that I stood agape for a few moments.  This is the only time I have seen something in the sky that I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we follow the airplanes into the distance counting how many coming in, there was a red light standing still at the end of the traffic.  It seemed to be like the next airplane to come in but too far to be in the flight plan to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father in-law said &#34;Hey, that&#39;s not a plane.&#34; I said &#34;That looks like it&#39;s over the lake or maybe past the lake.&#34; (Lake Mead)  We watched it for about a minute and then saw it start to travel straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it started to move, it seemed to slightly shimmy side to side while moving upwards in altitude.  It was hard to judge distance of travel but it lasted about 20 to 25 second before the light turned to a 45 degree angle and continue to ascend at a slower rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the 45 degree angle, the light gradually faded as if it was ascending and traveling away from us. This lasted about 30 seconds before completely fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I did not have a camera and besides my camera would not have the resolution to pick up the light clearly.  There is no doubt, on my life, that this light was not something an ordinary aircraft could do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It moved from right to left but it kept dissappearing. I swear for almost a split second it looked like the classic ufo (disc with half a circle on top in middle) but it was really far away...Oh, also it was being chased by either a helicopter or plane (light flashing) but the disc did not emit any light<n>

The witness was backing into her carport when she spotted the object and started yelling at her daughter who was with her to look towards the mountains. Her daughter looked in the wrong direction and missed seeing it. She said the back of the object looked like it was flared out. As she observed the object move across the sky it would fade in and out. Also she noticed when stated to fade she saw a red puff come off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked what she meant by a &#34;red puff&#34;. She really found it hard to explain and said it was a red something, like a burst of red. Every time the object gave off the puff of red the object itself became more visible, or a bright white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no contrail left by the object. It was flying from the north heading to the south in a straight line. I asked if she was able to give me a rough idea as to the size of the craft. The witness said it had to be longer than the length of her arm. The lady said it was traveling at a very low altitude, between the mountains and her residence, but extremely low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She also said there is a small airport close to where she resides. I wondered if a plane was coming into to land or one might have been taking off. But from the sounds of what the lady saw it doesn&#39;t seem to resemble an aircraft I am aware of, but of course hard to say. There was no sound heard, but another interesting point she made was that her pets (dogs) and the neighbors dogs were acting up all night long. (only this one night when the sighting took place) The lady said this is certainly out of the norm for them to carry on like this and she thought this was unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was interesting to note that on the weekend the local Airforce Base there was a aircraft fair taking place she told me and this was after her sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

My first thought was it’s an airplane but it did not look right it was at a very high altitude I asked my wife to take a look and she did not know what it could be. I continued to watch it and I notice a second one heading in a direct path toured the first one. At this time I realize it could not be two planes flying that close tours each other then when they past each other which looked like to be about a ¼” something wasn’t right. I ran in the house and grabbed my camera and took two photos of the second one they both were moving what seemed to be very fast. I have never believed in UFO’s and I gave thought of sending the pictures to someone but I did not. Then this morning I was watching the news and they showed the pictures taken in Mexico and man what I saw was scary because the pictures look just like what I saw.  So I am sending you two photo’s hope they can help but the quality is not very good. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you:<n>

I ran inside to grab my video camera but when I came back it was gone. It was a crystal clear day with no clouds to obstruct my view. I live towards the coast and saw this object high over the mountains to the east.  This is the third time I have seen this kind of light in the sky.  I had previously seen it 2 months ago during evening ours. During these occurences, the light was extremely bright, it hovered for about a minute or two, then took off to the east, disappearing very fast. I live close to Vandenburg AFB, so i&#39;m thinking it might be test flights of some kind. Hopefully someone else saw this or has seen the same thing.

It was high in the sky and it seemed to be moving very slowly parallel to the Earth&#39;s ground. It almost seemed like it wasn&#39;t moving until it started to spin long ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my husband and I tried to watch it as long as possible and even kept an eye on it as we were driving away.  We noticed that when it spun long ways slowy, it would also stop at once parrallel to the Earth&#39;s ground again. That&#39;s how we knew it was a controlled object and that the wind was not just moving it wherever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not ever hearing about any UFO&#39;s that were cigar shaped, this took us completely off guard. We made our friends in the other cars stop to see it and they all said it was a weather balloon. None of us know what a weather balloon looks like, and if it was, it wouldn&#39;t be able to move and stop like it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The further we drove away, the higher it seemed to be , until we lost all sight of it. It was in the late morning, the skies were clear, and it was not that windy out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

About every 2 minutes one of the lights would go off until there were no lights on the object. This object was not moving, it was just sitting there. flicking the light off and on for about an hour. I asked the other people who have cruised this route before had they seen these lights and overwelmingly most people stated that this craft has been seen every tuesday wedsnesday and thursday in the gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Followed electrical towers<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and her husband were woke up by an extremely bright light shining into their bedroom window. There are huge (she called them microwave electrical towers) near their home. They ran outside and saw an object in the sky with extremely bright lights, but they couldn&#39;t distinguish the shape. The object had red, yellow, green, and blue lights that were moving in a circular pattern. There was no sound and it was hovering over one of the towers near their home. The object then traveled slowly North along the same path as the other large towers and then turned at a 90 degree angle and disappeared into the distance. Their daughter, who is 19, also saw the object and was upset by the sight. For a short while after they went back to bed they heard a sound that she described - like a can of pop fizzing, but couldn&#39;t find out where the sound was coming from. My friends are in their mid 40&#39;s. What I thought was really strange is that my husband and I saw an object exactly as she described about 20 years ago in East Canton, which is about 7 miles from her home. She couldn&#39;t remember us telling her about what we had seen many years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since i was young I have always watched the sky due to the wierd things I have seen as a child.....While driving in my car I was staring at the unlit building.  Right next to it was the exact same plane that was described on the front webpage.  It was a black(almost showdow looking) triangle plane(??) that was hoovering in between the buildings in downtown.  I could not believe that I was seeing this....Since Sept.11 happened I knew that there was NO way a plane was allowed to fly anywhere near or THREW downtown in any city.  I do not know of many planes that can hoover except for the new Boeing plane...but I know that they would not be testing in Downtown Dallas.  The plane(??) did not make a sound.  I looked like a BIG triangle Shadow.  I know that Lockheed made a plane very similar that is black and undetectable to radar...So I decided to pick up my phone and I called someone that I know from Lockheed and explained to them what I was veiwing.  They informed me that they knew that they were not going to test fly the plane threw downtown Dallas and that what I was explaining couldn&#39;t be connected to Lockheed.  All I know is that the government keeps certain things hush hush...but they would never let a plane...hoover threw a downtown area.  I don&#39;t know how many people viewed what I saw but you had too be looking and if you were you couldn&#39;t miss it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Just the outer edge of the rings were glowing.  The object appeared to be twice as large as the three zeros on the screen.  All three rings were heading in the same speed and direction like an arrow moving North East across the clear night sky. It was hard to judge the distance.  but I would say that either the object was extremely large and very far away (like three football fields moving across the sky at 5000 feet) or the object was about the size of a b-1 bomber at a 1000 feet.  But there was no noise, none what so ever AND it traveled half the sky in about seven seconds.  I could not be a satelite becuase nothing that far away would be THAT BIG, THAT FAST, AND THAT MANMADE.  Not even a space station. if it was in the atmosphere then nothing big and that close could have made no sound, I mean there was silence.  There was know hiding the fact that it was there but it would not have been seen if I had not been lying down and looking up at the stars while I was outside.  It just went across the sky like it didnt care who saw it but it was not flaching out in bright lights or anything. If I had to say what type of vehicle it was, I would say that it was a tactical very secret unmanned military type aircraft.  It would be nice to think that it was aliens from another planet but I dont think that they would be that stand offish  if they were this close to us already.  I think that it is just a secret branch of the government playing with our tax dollars.   Why is it secret, becuase there would be too many people asking too many questions.  We cant even solve the problems that we have right now, let alone another whole batch of legal, moral and ethical issues.

It was not yet dark, and the sun was just beginning to set. I looked toward the Northeast and saw a weird light overhead. I watched for a while as it got larger and larger, until I could see that it was shaped like a disc. I ran inside and got my camera, and when I came out, there were two. They were directly overhead, and I took pictures. One had three oval lights on the bottom, the other had no lights. At about 10:45, the lighted one moved quickly east. The other vanished shortly after. I developed my pictures the next day, and they were too blurry to make out. My town is small, and people aren&#39;t outside all the time. I think I am the only one that saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was totally confused, and thought they were messing with me. I got up to look and saw lights floating in the sky, but was still skeptical. It then continued onward towards the dorms. It then came into view. It was obvious that it was a sphere like shape. with three lights. I thought, this has to be an airplane, until it plainly came in view. It then flew over the dorm, I ran into the room across the hall and looked through their window. The UFO at this point began to roll head over heals (as visible by the lights) and then flew off quickly out of sight. I am totally a nonbeliever but I saw this, and unless the government has some sort of secret hovering sphere like craft, I am now an unwanting believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Even now I&#39;m not so sure what to believe!  I looked up to early morning sky (pre sunrise) to see a commercial airline jet traveling from southeast to northwest at approximately 6:05 AM. Along the contrail I saw a pinhead speck of bright light moving irratically up and down the port side of the contrail.  It darted towards it, then back away from it several times.  The light then traveled up and down the one side of the contrail.  It followed the contrail back up to the rear of the jet then back down the contrail, again.  It then began to dart in and out of the contrail and finally passed through it to the the starboard side.  It repeated its motions up and down and in and out of the contrail, than passed back through it to the port side.  Once again it moved very quickly up to the rear of the jet and then disappear.  I cannot tell you the elevation at which the jet was flying.  I&#39;m sure that this can be found out from one of the airports (Vancouver International) air traffic control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: We regularly have commercial jets fly over the Queen Charlotte Islands.  Port Clements is at about the center of Graham Island, part of the QUeen Chalotte/Haida Gwaii chain of islands that is about 500 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia and about eighty miles out into the Pacific Ocean from the British Columbia mainland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life!  I know that I saw a pinhead size very bright light moving irractically at a very high altitude.  I don&#39;t know of anything that would perform in such a fashion at that altitude, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that I&#39;m not bothering you with this report.  I just don&#39;t know what to think!  It was not a jet/escort jet, I&#39;m sure, at least not flying in the manner that this object flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, sincerely, for taking the time to read this submission.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Power blackout is rare in my area. I coudn&#39;t go back to sleep and I went outside to relax. At about 5:45 AM I saw this weird light that look like a star but it was zooming in the sky from north to south faster than an aircraft but produce no sound. I was watching it a few minutes then I decided to grab my binoculars so I can take a close look at it. Then I went back outside and I notice this strange star like thing was gone. I know it is not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We started out earlier in the day in the Orange County area and we saw many airplanes and stars throughout the drive up.  When we got into the bay area, it was socked in and raining.  The clouds didn&#39;t let up and I would estimate that the ceiling was down to about 500 feet when we got to Windsor, CA.  We were looking for a motel to stop for the night when I noticed a dull reddish orange light off to the northwest.  (I would estimate the size of the light to be the size of my fingernail held at arms length.)  I asked my wife, &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;  She said, &#34;it&#39;s an airplane.&#34;  Then I said, &#34;that doesn&#39;t look like an airplane because it has no anti-collision &#39;strobe&#39; type lights on it.&#34;  I also said, &#34;who would be crazy enough to be up flying in rural northern california, at 3 in the morning, when the visibility was down to about 5-10 miles and the ceiling was about 500 feet?&#34;  That is a true statement because this area is dark as a hammer and it would be almost impossible to fly using dead reckoning at night, especially in extreme IFR conditions.  After coming to an almost complete stop on the highway, I decided to exit at the next offramp.  I did and when I stopped to look at the light, I noticed another car on the freeway that had slowed way down, to about 15 mph.  I wonder if they were seeing the same thing we were seeing.  That car kept on going and we were sitting there on the offramp at a dead stop so I rolled down the window to see if I could hear any aircraft noise.  We didn&#39;t hear anything.  At this point my wife said, &#34;you&#39;re right... that isn&#39;t an airplane.  What is that?&#34;  At this point the object was moving really slowly, but in an erratic motion where it was travelling sideways, but also in an upwards motion, then it would instantly change to a downward motion.  Definitely not how I have ever seen any airplane fly.  After about 10-15 seconds of this erratic flying, it moved in a straight! sideway s motion, at a high rate of speed, covering the distance of what I would estimate was about 300 yards and disappeared into the rain clouds.  At that point, the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up.  My wife and I spent the next 10 minutes or so driving down the side road that parallels the freeway with our heads hanging out the window looking for the object.  We never saw it again.  Just thinking about this incident as I am sitting here typing this in is giving me goosebumps.  Whatever it was, it was really weird.  Never seen anything else like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me try to explain what this thing looked like.  The best way I could describe this light is this:  You know when you see a jet on approach to an airport, but it is a long ways off, like 10-15 miles; you can see the landing lights on, and it looks like a reddish orange glow because of the smog and impurities in the air?  That is exactly what this thing looked like.  And that is what I thought it was right at first, but then it dawned on me... it couldn&#39;t be because of the low clouds and limited visibility.  That was when I realized that it had to be only a mile or so away from me and I realized I was looking at something else.  And it wasn&#39;t until I stopped the car that I could tell it wasn&#39;t flying straight and level and it was actually flying erratic.  The fact that there were no strobe type anti-collision lights on it really made me think this was something other than an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else reported anything similar to this, I would like to know.  If you need further clarification, feel free to contact me.  Thanks<n>

It was around 2:45 - 3:00 AM when the event took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had recently come home from a friend&#39;s house around 2:30 AM, after playing guitar and drinking coffee. Everyone at my house was in bed sleeping and I was all by myself. I realized that there was a storm brewing up in the sky, and being an avid storm watcher, I decided to stay up even later in hopes of seeing a few good bolts of lightning. I sat on my front porch watching for about 10 minutes and there wasn&#39;t much lightning except for one miniscule bolt. The sky looked as though it was full of energy. Greenish grey clouds were to my left and pinkish grey clouds to my right; the sky was completely overcast with no stars.  I sat there longer hoping the best was yet to come for the thunderstorm. Wihtin another minute or two, out of nowhere, a tremendous bolt of lightning shot down from the sky, one of the biggest I think I&#39;ve ever seen, lighting up everything around me for a split second. Deafening thunder crashed across the sky almost immediately after the lightning struck down probably only a couple of KMs south of my porch, and south of the town. I sat on the porch very excitedly and didn&#39;t take my eyes off the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute or two of the lightning, something else caught my attention in the sky. In my periphereal vison I spotted what first appeared to be a couple of shooting stars, falling into my view from behind the roof of the porch. As I looked on, I was able to focus on the falling objects as they suddenly started to slow down to a near halt. I quickly realized that I wasn&#39;t quite looking at shooting stars anymore, I was looking at two orange, horizontal ovals, both with noticeable dark oval rings that contained more orange within. The orange was dull and dark looking, as the objects appeared to be flying through the cloud cover. After the objects slowed down from falling straight down into view, they began to change direction at impressive speeds and impossible angles. At this point though, I couldn&#39;t quite tell if I was looking at two separate objects or just one. Both ovals flew perfectly side by side and in sync and the long sides of the ovals always stayed horizontal, even when making hairpin turns. After a couple of impressive turns, the ovals both made a sudden turn at a crazy angle and started to head Eastward to where the lightning had bolted down. As the ovals raced accross the sky, they drifted apart from one another and I  knew then for sure that I was watching 2 separate craft. After splitting up, one changed direction mid way and started to travel upward, while the other continued on an angle accross the sky and upward. As the one went straight up, the other climbed to a higher altitude on an angle and quickly made a sharp inverted angle turn back towards his companion (West). Just like they had it timed to the milisecond, the two objects intecepted one another and the object flying upward made a 90 degree turn on a dime and at the exact moment it intercepted its friend. Both objects then continued back in tandem, West accross the sky at very quick speeds and made one last turn-on-a-dime, zig-zag pattern turn before they decided it was time to bolt back North over the top of my house. The objects flew away at an fast speed and in a straight line. Before they disappeared the objects made a very loud, very shrill, hawk-like squeal, immediately after which, they picked up immense speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than this squeal noise, the objects made no other noises whatsoever. The objects maintained the same colour and shape and didn&#39;t have any blinking lights. They flew like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. The objects appeared very shortly after the lightning had struck and seemed to fly around the perimiter of appriximately where it had struck. Not to mention the energy emitted from a bolt of lightning as big as I saw would surely be able to attract something&#39;s attention from miles away. The event lasted approximately 30 - 45 seconds. All details and drawings are as I documented directly after event took place, as I couldn&#39;t sleep too well after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see the illustration provided by the witness on our homepage.

They turned sharply and came parallel to the horison and went on for a couple of seconds, during which they both took another short dive and came back level again (with the same effect of the line on a heart monitor but inverted). From there, they seemed to shoot back up into the sky(still keeping the same distance between them), and vanished back above the clouds and there was no sound at all!! I have never seen anything move that fast in my life and I was surprised there was no mention of it in the papers as this occured less than two miles from Edinburgh Airport. Surely they must have seen glitches on their radar? One thing I remember is that they were illuminating the clouds they were flying under.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I often enjoy the evening skys here, and know there is lots of airforce around.  I have seen many different types of planes at night, never anything that looked like this.

Please know that this was no hoax, and do not discount it just because I may not know how to use this computer properly. I do not remember, but may have thought it did not enter and resubmitted it.  I have never sent one of these and was not enthusiastic about giving out my personal information.  My husband had suggested I write you because he said he has heard about these flying spheres/in a triangle form before and thought it was worth noting. And with that, I will also tell you that on 04/27/2004 at about 10:00pm, I went out in the yard again.  Curious from the night before and now instead of coming from the south to the north I saw crafts going from north to south.  These were not the 3 sphere shaped/triangle I saw on the 21st. I would say 1 every 10-15min flew overhead.  These had noise (the other did not).  These had 3 round lights (not independent spheres). Some of them had 2 yellow and one red light.  And you could see the triangle shape on these.  My impression was that this was some sort of airforce practice run.  Or my personal interpretation was that someone wanted anyone who saw the thing on the 21st to think it was one of these because they were so loud I kept coming out of my home every time I heard one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I had called your hotline, but it was always a recording).

Tumwater, Wa.and an orange/reddish/yellow fireball was going across the night sky at a very high rate of speed.It was traveling from the N.E. to the S.W. in a straight line as it passed overhead. It was raining lightly and partly cloudy and the cloud cover was about 2,000 feet, and the fireball was about 800 feet. I was surrounded by tall buildings (warehouses) and couldn&#39;t watch it at all as it sped away,toward the Capitol Forest.There was also a search light (white light beam) in an area about 5 miles north of my location at the South Sound Shopping Mall in Olympia, Wa, that was also working at the time. I was in a dark area with no lights and the fireball was really clear to me!<n>

They were horizontal, yellowish, and as soon as I walked out on the deck and began focusing in on them (and reminding myself where the camcorder was), they suddenly rotated like a key would to the right, going into a vertical instead of horizontal position, while at the same time simultaneously extinguishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s a similar sighting (I was so struck by the lights I was searching the internet for something similar, which is actually how I found this site in the first place):  http://www.nuforc.org/CB020618.html  That sighting has basically been attributed to flares, which is possibly what I saw as well.   There are military operations in this area (and quite active), however this would be the very first time I (or anyone I&#39;ve spoken to) would remember actually being able to see any of it, other than normal flight paths, due to distance.  Not sure what it was, except that it was very bright, much brighter than 4th of July as almost as bright as a full moon on a clear night.  It was near new moon period howerver, which may have made it seem brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an update to a previous report, I have since spoken to many more people, including someone else who saw the same exact lights, and have since become certain the lights were indeed military flares as I indicated was likely in the original report.  There were several others who very accurately described what I saw, and claimed they had seem them before, though not this time, but who had been able to determine they were flares.  You can also reference the link in the original report to the other military flare sighting that was similar, which actually led me to this website orginally.  Please paste this into the original report, or remove them both completely.  Thank you!<n>

The moon was out a little and it was clear skies through out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i arrived back home, i decided that it was too nice out to go back in.  I sat in the back of my pick up truck, listening to my cd and taking in the night air.  I live on a dead end street in Manchester NH.  It&#39;s a nice quiet neighborhood with little artificial lighting around.  After my house comes the end of the street and a small patch of woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was out for almost an hour when suddenly,j ust above the treeline, something caught my eye.  I turned to look and then sat right up and ripped my headphones off....it was a craft that glided over the treeline. This craft made no sound.  It had no lights.  It had three white bands on its underside. It looked kinda like a stealth bomber but much smaller.  More like a 2 seater airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at a good clip but not super fast. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw it again.<n>

I was driving through this stretch of farm field area.  I was distracted by a very white light coming from my right side.  It is a secluded area and at that time I did not notice any other cars on the road.  The light was so bright that I tried to speed up to go right past it, as I went past the light, I looked back to the right towards the field and I saw a fairly large sized disk shaped UFO.  Size wise I would say it was about the size of a fighter plane, but disk shaped.  I slowed down to a stop about 50 feet past UFO.  I turned around and looked back, it seemed to be floating in the air, I wasnt able to make out a color but I could definetly see the shape in the dark.  It floated for about a minute, then it sort of swung like a pendulum side to side before blasting to its left up towards the sky.  It took about 10-15 seconds for the UFO to vanish into the sky.  Confused, and shocked I drove home.  This morning on my way back to work I passed through the same fields, and decided to stop around the same area I saw the UFO.  I glanced onto the field where I thought the UFO was last night but I was not able to make anything out of it since the whole field was escavated.  And then, I went back to my car, and grabbed a bottle of glue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was plain as day...the object was a black triangle with no apparent windows and on the bottom was one large light in each of the three corners.

The spheres were hovering close to each other and periodically and very quickly shifted positions in the sky.

It was a beautiful, clear morning with the usual crisscrossing contrails in the sky. As I entered the interstate, I-75 northbound, I noticed an unusual contrail rising vertically from the horizon. I pulled over, looked up through my windshield, and saw that the contrail continued straight up for about a third of the visible sky and then made a 20 to 25 degree course change to the left. I followed the path of the contrail until I could see that a small, triangular shape continuing to travel almost vertically into the morning sky was making the contrail. It looked like a rocket on a path into the stratosphere. I watched the object moving upward until its altitude was such that I could no longer see it. The contrail dissipated until only the initial vertical contrail was still faintly visible; it remained so for about another ten minutes. As I continued my drive homeward, I could see the vertical contrail straight ahead of me in the northern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no large military bases in this area from whence a rocket might be launched. The only base is an Air National Guard base located to the south of the city. Is it possible that I witnessed a rocket launch that originated at a distant location?  This was definitely NOT an airliner or a typical military jet. I see those almost every day and I am quite familiar with their characteristic contrails. This was quite different. I would appreciate an opinion as to what I might have witnessed this morning. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail?  PD))<n>

This object was first observed as I walked from a friends house back to mine. It looked at first like a star, but seemed very bright.  We observed the object painfully slowly move across the sky in a Northerly direction.  Over the course of 30 minutes this object moved about 1 mile, if I had to make a guess.  It then began to rise at an angle of about 30 degrees and then slowly made a dual loop going back in a Southerly direction from whence it was originally spotted.  It completely a full two loops over the course of 15 minutes, and then began going up, down, and side to side in the same area, maybe 1 mile in length.  I happened to have borrowed a friends digital camera just a few days before, and started zooming to the cameras maximum onto the object.  Three photos were taken, and wh! at I found later blew me away.  A clear and classic disk with a half bubble shape in the center is seen while the object is (I think) tilted towards me.  Two consecutive photos show the object from its side, and reveal an oreo cookie type craft of two disks sandwiching a center black (From that far away and being night time,  I could not see the center) area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event repeated over two evenings.  The first lasting longer than the second. On the second night the object appeared much later.  This time around 1:00am.  It completed a series of maneuvers, very slowly, just like before, and then just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not one to second guess myself, and I&#39;m no stranger to either Unidentified Flying Objects, nor Military aircraft.

The only movement it made was the moment it seemed to move upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the &#34;star&#34; directly under it and what seemed at the time just across the way a bright light flew directly under our &#34;star&#34; It was very bright and left a trail, I had a good 45 second view of it and it seemed to be round, and it left a slight, trail as it went, the trail was very close to the object. It passed out of my field of vision behind another building on the complex. Unfortunatly my coworker did not see the sphere of light. The sphere was certainly close, just behind the trees, it seemed to only be as high as a second story building. It was not a plane, there was no sound, no flashing lights, just a sphere of bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening there was no sign of either the &#34;star&#34; or the sphere of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, the coworker mentioned to me the nxt evening on the phone that friends had called and talked about seeing a strange pulsing red star that did not move with the rest of the night sky. I am not sure if they are connected. Both happened in Maine, about 100 miles from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone from Maine is reading this, it would be nice to know if anyone else either saw this, or has noticed the strange flashing stars that change color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, or Sirius??

I noticed a bright light coming from the South / West part of the sky. It was much brighter than anything else in the sky at that time. I thought maybe it was one of the comets I have been hearing about in the news lately so I pulled over to observe it through my binoculars. The best detail I could give was an incredibly bright light, situated at about 45 degrees on the horizon. It was totally dark with no moon that I can recall. My wife snapped several pictures of the object with our digital camera and then the light disappeared after about 5 minutes. We resumed our driving and noticed again, the light in the sky but thought nothing else about it until last night when my wife down loaded the pictures onto our computer. Upon further examination of the photos, enlarged to a dpi of 2000, the images became clear that they were not made by a planet, comet or aircraft that I am aware of. There was no sound but the object seemed to hang in the sky prior to vanishing. Once we resumed our trip, the object seemed to move away from us.<n>

Looking north I noticed a single point of light it was steady and did not move at all.  I fixed the light in refrence to the edge of my portch to see if it might be moving.  As I watched a commercial jet flew under the object.  We have what I would term an approach pattern somewhat over our home for Sky Harbor Airport however SHA is 20 miles south of us so the jets are usually fairly high.  The object was much higher which made me think it may be a planet or star being illuminated by the setting sun.  To my surprise it vanished as I was watching it.  It didnt move the whole time but it seemed to have a brownish haze around it then just seemed to fade away.  The fact the it didnt move was what drew my attention to it in the first place, and watching it fade rose the hair on the back of my neck!<n>

It looked like one of those really big balloons used at car lots sometimes to hold up long streamers (i.e. did not look metallic, had no external lights, just a white ball shaped object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t swear that it _wasn&#39;t_ one of those balloons, but it was defying those major gusts of wind by going from South to North.

The distance was hard to determine but I could hear the sound of it breaking the wind, for that night happened to be windy. I called my roommate to see if he could help explain it and we stood there in amazement as to what it could have been. After a few seconds the object darted into the clouds and what seemed like into the atmosphere, then it faded away. We both decided to run to our other friends across the hallway to tell them. After explaing what we saw we all ran out to their balcony to see if it could be seen again. After a couple of minutes of staring into the sky we spotted it again but not as close as the initial sighting, now it appeared as an illuminating circular object. It seemed more energetic then before because its was speeding left to right zig-zagging in out of the clouds. Minutes later after settling down and deciding there is not much we could do but just observe it, I went back to my room and sat on the balcony viewing its maneuvering in the sky for a good hour. At one point I gestured to it so it would come closer and it stopped briefly and hovered in the sky for a good minute as if it had seen my gesture and was contemplating coming down to my level. It was quite the experience that I shall never forget. I still can&#39;t rationalize what it could have been, high tech Government project or a unexplainable natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, we suspect that the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, possibly a planet.

The night of April 17th 2004, my wife and I saw a strange object approximately 100-150 feet above the ground, over the treeline in our neighborhood. My wife saw it first at about 9pm. She pointed it out to me as it was moving slowly toward our location. It appeared to stay just above the treeline. It was an orange bulb in an oval shape. It was not overly luminous because it had a medium tone. It had no trail and made no sound. I lost sight of it...as it got to what seemed to be about 1000 feet from us. It then moved to the left, back to the right, and then I lost sight of it. At its last location, it should have become completely visible in only a few seconds if it had maintained its speed. But it disappeared. I am definitely not one to fabricate something like this. I am a law enforcement officer. Anyway, I thought this would be right place to send this sighting of ours. Thanks.<n>

As I was driving north on I-65, I saw a black and shiny aircraft off the side of the freeway. It held an altitude of about 800 to 1,000. At first, I thought it was to be a helicopter because the way it was shaped, but I noticed no propeller of any kind. It also amazed me as it turned sideways. As it turned, it looked 2-dimensional, and then into a bright star for a split second after. I don&#39;t think the bright shine on the craft came from the sun because the light seemed to be emitting very brightly than that of a reflection. After noticing the craft fade away in the sky, I continued driving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

She told me the object had to have been the size of a full moon and on the outer edge of the object the color was a much lighter pink in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the woman drove along she said it passed overhead at approx: tree top level and at approx: 100 to 200 feet away from her in distance. As the lady and the object passed one another she slowed her truck down and turned around to watch the object move slowly into the distance and as she watched it finally just blinked out. When the woman continued on her journey, after seeing the strange object, she told me that she was questioning herself, &#34;did I just see that&#34;!  Later that evening and at her work place, her and another lady went outside for a coffee break and the witness mentioned that she had seen something very strange when she was on her way to work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the lady if she thought it might have been a flare or even fireworks someone had maybe set off. The witness said she has never seen a flare or fireworks travel horizontally just over tree top level and for such a long distance. There was no sound noted. The object was reported to be visible for approx: one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This same object has been seen twice on two different occasions in the Smithers area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting is under investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

We stopped our car to see what it was , the fireballs faded, then the six objects started blinking and took off in different directions, Then coming back together making sharp turns then cicling back around, then when they stopped in mid air then began to glow orange again, this went on nearly 5 minutes. Then we heard a plane coming and all of the objects flying scattered off in to the distance. My brother and his wife told us they saw the exact same thing and were about 2 miles from us when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were out for our evening walk last Friday night.  It had just gotten fully dark.  We live in a small town with rural area beyond.  I noticed 4-5 bright orange/gold lights hovering on the horizon.  They looked like roman candles ready to go out.  I said &#34;look&#34; to my husband and he saw them too.  Then they instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were returning home from dinner when he noticed these lights again.  This time they were very close to the ground - probably within a mile from us.  By the time he said &#34;There&#39;s those lights again!&#34; and I ducked to look thru the drivers side window, I saw 3 very large yellow/orange orbs with about 3 smaller lights around the outside of the larger ones.  From what I saw, they were in a triangular pattern.  However, my husband was able to see them better out the drivers window.  He said what he saw was 4 lights with the smaller lights on the outside of them.  He also saw a much larger light above these lights which appeared to be closer than the other 4.  The smaller 4 lights seemed to come on at the same time then the larger light came on.  When the larger light came on, the other 4 lights faded.  We were only a couple of miles from home.  We drove slowly trying to see them again but didn&#39;t.  When we pulled into our driveway, I got out of the vehicle as my husband was pulling it into the garage. I looked behind me just in time to see 3 large yellow orange lights in a horizantal line about 10-20 degrees above the horizon.  They came on from left to right and faded from left to right in a period of a few seconds.  We waited to see them again, but didn&#39;t see them again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;ve stated before - this was the 3rd sighting in a years time in this same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked again and it was gone. Approximately 5 minutes later, it was in a different place in the sky. It continued to do this for about 8 minutes. After that I looked to a different are in the sky and five reddish orange lights were flashing on and off continusly. This lasted for about 1 minute. That is the last that i saw of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stepped outside for my normal check of the perimeter of the building, and I witnessed the same object as previously reported at that time and date. The sky was blue and clear, and I saw a bright silver object moving quickly at a very high altitude from East to West at about 80 degrees from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a high altitude military craft, or daytime satellite, but it abruptly stopped, and stayed in a stationary position. I retrieved a pair of 10x50mm binoculars from my car, and I was barely able to identify the object as what appeared to be a silver spinning cylinder. It was spinning very fast vertically, end over end, and was completely stationary. I asked a patient outside the clinic if she would confirm what I was seeing, and her response was, quote: “What in the world is that???”. The object was stationary for approximately 20 minutes, and at one point, a high flying (40,000ft?) commercial jetliner flew underneath, yet the altitude of this strange object was still much higher than the jetliner. I would venture to guess its altitude was on the order of 65,000+ft. To be able to distinguish it as a spinning cylinder at that altitude, leads me to think that it must have been huge. After 20min the spinning cylinder gained altitude and sped away at extreme speed to the North, until it quickly disappeared. Being an experienced amateur astronomer, I have seen quite a variety of objects both day and night. I have previously always been able to eventually identify and classify the objects as either spy satellites, the space station, space shuttle, weather balloons, or other man made aircraft, etc. The sighting and behavior of this object has bothered and bewildered me for years, and I am glad I finally found an appropriate place to tell my story, and confirm that it was witnessed by several other people. My conclusion, after all of these years, is that this was a genuine UFO, and that even the most advanced secret! militar y craft in the world could not have flown or behaved the way this one did…<n>

I had just past the Lititz Springs Creek and was rounding the bend in the road, when a disk shaped object appeared about approx. 150-200 feet above the tree line. It was descending toward the treeline at about a 30 degree angle and in a 45 degree bank at a high rate of speed. I would guess that with the bottom of the disk shape towards me and with no observable features on the bottom it was perhaps 10-15 ft across. It was black in color and entered the treeline. Trees had no buds nor leaves on them, as it is early spring. I can only assume that it did not crash as there are houses along the ridge under the trees. No noise was heard and no local reports have been reported. This spot is also about 2-3 miles from Lancaster Airport. I&#39;m also a pilot and can pretty much identify anything aloft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/16/04 12:00|Orange Beach|AL|Sphere|30 minutes plus|Object  traveling back-and-fourth  for unknown reason and unidentifible  possibly because of the distant when the object was sighted.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36396.html|163|ndxe200404| Object  traveling back-and-fourth  for unknown reason and unidentifible  possibly because of the distant when the object was sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be nothing to really report because I have this scrutinizing suspicion of what I saw was just possibly one of those parachute rides being pulled by a boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 16, 2004, I was working outdoors on the new condo construction which is located inside the bay area in Orange Beach, Alabama, and it is nearly in direction in front of the Alabama point bridge which is located near Orange Beach, Alabama.  At 12:00PM, I took a lunch break.  While I was taking my lunch break under a shade, I was admiring the beach direction view of this condo location.  I was wearing polarizing sunglasses at the time.  I noticed a helicopter flying around in the air.  It was a small helicopter like those of a small Huey or traffic watcher type.  It kept slowly flying around in the general area inside the bay/gulf channel near the bridge on the fishing side.  It would occasionally descend in each pass where people fished then ascend back to its slow, flight pattern of just wandering around near the bridge area.  My first thoughts of this odd flying behavior was a news helicopter trying to make some news because of the recent bonanza of whitings congregating at the fishing site. To the left of the bridge are two condos located on the bay side which I think are still under construction, and the height of those buildings I think is twelve floors.  On the Gulf side of those condos is undeveloped land and the beach.  From the bridge to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  From the bridge to the two condos, I think the distant is about one-eight of a mile.  From the condos to my location, I think the distant is about one mile.  The sky was partly cloudy, and the temperature was about 80 degree F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching this helicopter flying around, I noticed what appeared at first to be a large balloon drifting in the wind.  The size of the balloon object is about the same size of the condo&#39;s window from my viewing location.  Its path when first seen originated by the bridge and possibly out in the Gulf near the beach.  The balloon object altitude was above the two condos, and the balloon object altitude was at least 1 and a half condo high from my perceptiveness. The balloon object had no colors except for a minute grayish color that reflected no sunlight similar to the color of a water droplet. The balloon object was perfectly round.  As this balloon object moving from west to east drifted pass the two condos starting from the bridge in an estimated time of about 30 seconds to a minute; the balloon object completely stopped drifting and almost seem to hover in the same position for about 15 seconds.  Then the shape of the balloon object changed to something not roundish.  Its color also changed to something like a black dot but still not roundish in shape.  Then this object travel back towards the bridge location at same speed of 30 seconds to a minute.  Then it stopped and reverse coarse towards the two condos.  It appeared to get slightly smaller.  Then about half way towards the condo, I saw for a brief moment a color of paper white appear for about 3 seconds, and it was definitely not a sunlight reflection.  I realized that this was no balloon, so I was trying to figure out what it could be.  After the fourth back-and-fourth trip of this object, an advertising plane appeared trailing its advertisement.  The object on its way back towards the two condos seem to disappear from view behind the two condos.  I was waiting for it to reappear on the left side of the two condos which it did not reappear. On the right side of the bridge are some condos.  I notice a bright red/orange parachute probably being pulled by a boat.  The distant to those condos is about a mile.  The size of that parachute ! from my location was about the size of a quarter if I was to held it up in front of me.  When comparing the size of the object to the parachute, the object was like a pea to the parachute.  Then the object that disappeared behind the two condo reappeared from the right side of the two condos.  I thought to myself, &#34;I wonder if the helicopter pilot is seeing what I am seeing?  Surely if there was something out of ordinary, he would investigate it.&#34;  I was thinking, &#34;Gee!  If only I could talk to the helicopter pilot and ask him to investigate what I was seeing, then he can tell me what he saw.&#34;  I took off my sunglass to see if I could still see the object without the aid of the sunglass, and I was still able to see the object, but not as good, so I put the sunglass back on me.  I kept watching this object going back-and-fourth between the bridge and the two condos when I noticed a white dot way out near the horizon in the Gulf.  It was probably about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon, and intermittently it was hidden by the clouds.  It didn&#39;t look like it was shining a light, but it did appeared to be just a paper white dot.  It is possible that it could be a jet coming towards my direction, but that object defiantly did not pass over my location to get to the spotted location unless it was flying way up high if it did pass location. All of this viewing took place during my 30 minutes lunch break.  When I went back to work, I was still able to see the object, and I explain to one of my co-workers what I saw during my lunch break.  I pointed in the direction of the object and my co-worker was able to see it too.  He seem like it was nothing since he just glanced at for a few seconds, but I find it strange that all this object did was go back-and-fourth during my lunch break.  If it was one of those parachute rides pulled by a boat, it would had to been at least 2- 4 miles out in the Gulf.  Another possibility of what the object may had been was another helicopter, but when I first saw this object, it was perfectl! y round and drifting almost like a balloon.  When I first seen the object, it may had been up closer, but possibly it may had zig-zag a coarse out into the Gulf becoming smaller as it went which may explain how the two condos were able to make it disappear for a brief moment.  It may be nothing, but I saw it, and I can&#39;t explain it, so I&#39;m reporting it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It hovered for several seconds to maybe a minute and during this time the lights flashed on and off a couple of times.  When I realized what was happening I called the radio station with no reply than I called the Sherriffs department and they informed me they had several different calls.  As I was talking to them explaining what I had seen I saw lights again this time further away from me and I told them what I was seeing.  It looked like they were being chased or something.  When we called in regards to this matter today 4-17-2004, they have now stated it was the military practicing war games.  I do not beleive this because I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called my son to look at it and said It was an A.  It seemed to change shape and look more like a circle.  It was moving slightly and came a little closer to us into a cloud.  It seemed that it should have disappered while in the cloud but we both could it see it brightly in the thick cloud.  It went backwards from the cloud and seemed to stay in one spot for a long time.  It always flashed the lights.  We got binoculars and could easily see red and green lights.  We tried to film it but was shaking badly but we did get it on our camcorder.  It was so far away like a star or an airplane in the sky however it was not an airplane or star that we have ever observed before.  I was so certain of its oddity that I phoned the Lacey police and reported the ufo and called my mom and asked her to look for it too.  It was to the left of what I think is venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I turned around from getting my mail I saw two large orange balls of light directly above my house about 30 degrees up. They appeared to be directly over the Arkansas Nuclear 1 reactor about 2 miles from my location. As I watched the two lights split into three then four and then dissapeared completely.  I do not know how long the total duration was as i only caught the apparent end of the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/15/04 22:00|Readington|NJ|Light|2 hours|I saw 7 lights in the South sky near my home/airport and they did not move for hours until they disapeared one by one.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60729.html|174|ndxe200404| I saw 7 lights in the South sky near my home/airport and they did not move for hours until they disapeared one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting at a small airport in our town. Only single engine planes can land there. We were facing south looking out into the field when we noticed 7 very large, very bright lights up in the sky. They were all in a row, yet slightly curved downward. As if they were the mouth of a sad face. The lights were not pulsing or flashing. They were just stuck in the sky, not moving at all for about an hour we watched them. I remember watching UFO shows when I was younger. I remembered seeing the Phoenix lights in Arizona. These lights reminded me exactly of the Phoenix lights, and that is when I started to get creeped out a little bit. I was talking to my friend who was with me about the Phoenix lights and he started to get creeped out. I have lived next to that airport for 19years and not once have I seen these lights in the sky. I also know the difference between a star, satellite and an airplane. These lights were very large and very bright. They were glowing an amber/green color. We drove to my friends house who lives right next to the airport, we could see the lights from his back deck. He said he saw them appear in the same place the night before. They turned on one by one he said and stayed in the sky for 2 hours or so. As he was telling us the story the lights began to turn off. They just disappeared one by one in order. It was the most amazing site I have ever seen. Just like that they were gone. I went home to tell my father what I just saw, and he claimed that he had seen them 2 nights ago, but he just thought they were landing lights on towers for the blimp to use when it was landing at night, but during the day I could not see any towers. I don&#39;t know what they were, but the lights have not been back since that night, so it could not have been anything for the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights seemed to be getting closer and I was really freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then started moving away from us we traveled farther and sat on the side of the road and just watched the lights.  We sat there for about 5 minutes or so and the lights started to go out one at a time and when there were only two lights left they went out at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night or so it was reported on our local television station as a UFO sighting.  The local airports and airforce bases were checked and had nothing in the sky at the time of the incident.  It was also said on the news that it was unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Its location being approximately 270 degrees mag. from our position, 10-15 degrees above the horizon, distance unknown but I would say at least 20 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 30 seconds from the initial sighting the bright orange light started to move in a northerly direction and gain altitude while simultaneously separating in to two dimmer white lights. The lights stayed in this configuration for another 60 seconds. Its heading was aprox. 25 degrees mag. so the lights were getting closer to us during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving at the time, making it difficult to determine speed of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never the less, they moved faster than commercial aircraft viewed at similar distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the two dimmer white lights converged and once again became a single bright orange light while continuing on same heading.  About 15-20 seconds later the light vanished.  Its last visual location was 340 degrees mag. from our location,  45 degrees above the horizon and still 10 miles distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say, absolutely, as I&#39;ve been exposed to many commercial, military, and civilian aircraft during daylight as well as nighttime conditions, that I have never seen aircraft lights behave as these did.  I also don&#39;t believe it to be a satellite because it changed direction while in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I asked my friend to look in the direction that I was pointing to just as the light dissappeared. About 5 seconds later a second orange light appeared then dissappeared. I asked my friend if he had seen the same light. He stated that he had. There was another couple standing in the lot as well and I believe that they had heard me say something about the light, but I do not know if they saw it or not. We continued to watch the sky for any further events. The conditions of the night sky was dark and mostly clear with a very slight haze as the light emminated tonight was not as bright as the night before from the objects. I did notice other commercial aircraft in the sky, but not near enough the obect or travelling in the same direction that would suggest that it may be from those. The lights were high enough in the sky to obviously not be any city lights just as they were the night before. To guess, the craft would have had to been at an altitude of 10-15,000 ft. given their distance, brightness of the night and location in the sky. This is similar to the night prior at roughly the same time and location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This reporter, being the same who filed a report last evening, is a college graduate, ex-military and works in mental health.

We were traveling north on Flamingo Road north of Griffin Road near Fort Lauderdale, approaching Flamingo Gardens. Noticed a bright orange/red glow, stationary at about 35-40 degrees above the horizon, just above the tree line as seen from the road. Size made it appear to be an aircraft beacon but more orange/pink in color than a red beacon. The other problem is there is no beacon in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;object&#34; was apparently motionless but after about 15 seconds a long tail of &#34;flame&#34; appeared behind the object, indicating that it was entering the atmosphere from the north, thus the bright reddish glow and tail. The tail lasted about five seconds after which the object began to fade steadily and it turned to the east at a high altitude at a rapid speed, that of a fast jet. There were no aircraft style lights or beacons from the object. It faded in intensity after it turned east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This unnerved me since I have never seen anything like this, and the apparent direction was from the north, which would be a strange direction of reentry for a typical spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with meteorites, which at the rate of speed on entry, streak across the sky in about 1 second. This episode lasted the better part of a minute and was obviously not a meteorite. I wonder if you have any information on this episode that you can share. A driver behind me also pulled over to observe this object. Whatever it is, the sight was extremely unusual and compelling. My daughter was with in the car and saw the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD))<n>

Unable to note structure of object but it was moving silently at about the speed of a small aircraft unable to determine altitiude. Light of triangle was constant but dim. I am an aviation buff so I know what navigation lighting looks like and this wasn&#39;t your ordinary nav lights.  The city of Costa Mesa is near the coast so at first I thought they might just be three ballons floating on the onshore breeze and maybe that&#39;s all it was except the triangular pattern was constant and I would expect ballons in the wind to change positions.  Second of all this object was moving more rapidly than I have ever seen a party ballon move.  I observed a nearby flag ploe immediatley after the sighting and there was absolutley no wind if any.  Now maybe there was wind at a higher altitude pushing this object on shore, but for me it was the constant shape with the quick pace and no wind that interested me. The object also veered off to the east and out of sight during the 20 or 30 seconds it took to move almost directly overhead.  I was wondering if anyone else may have witnessed something similar that evening in my area. I also noted heavy air traffic with a military helicopter coming from the west,  commercial aircraft on approach (757) coming from the east into Long Beach or LAX and another small aircraft to the North along with a police helicopter working off to the East.<n>

4/15/04 16:44|in-flight/unknown||Cigar|5 -10 min|Saw a reflective "orb" above our aircraft during a return flight from Washington, D.C.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36382.html|189|ndxe200404| Saw a reflective &#34;orb&#34; above our aircraft during a return flight from Washington, D.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling back home from trip to Washington D.C., and was observing air traffic out the window.  After traveling through an area in which contrail activity seemed suddenly elevated, I used the knowledge gained from a sighting I had, which I reported to this site, last month(3/31/04), to search the sky for unknowns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted what I thought was Venus, except that it was brighter than I have seen before.  We were at 35,000ft. (our Captain reported this as our altitude) so this object was, in my amateur opinion, at about 50-60,000ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was either at a stand-still or was moving very slowly, because we passed it within a couple of minutes.  Our flight was steady, and we did not bank in any way at any time during the sighting(any banking would have been noticable because of the distant cloud cover providing a horizon-line for comparison).  This seemed important because the object moved from the front left of my view, slightly rising then lowering,then moving to the right, and then out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the naked eye, it appeared as a bright, bluish-tinted orb.  It seemed reflective and was much brighter than the surrounding sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to get off one shot with my camera, before my camera&#39;s battery died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reviewing the shot, when I returned home, one can see that it appears more like a cigar than an orb.  I thought that what I had done was take a picture of another plane, and it being so far away it&#39;s detail isn&#39;t easily noticed.  But I have issues with this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I was viewing a large number of air craft on the entire flight, and every single one of the other planes left some type of contrail.  This craft left nothing that I could see, either at the time of the sighting, nor in the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, it was much higher than we were(as I said, we were at 35,000)and was moving much slower if at all, leading me to the question of what kind of plane would fit this descrption(i.e., SR-71 or U-2 for instance).  Not that some other more &#34;ordinary&#34; jet aircraft couldn&#39;t fly at that altitude for what-ever reason, but, again, it was barely moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting the photograph, in it&#39;s original size, at 916kb, so as to keep it as close to the original as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to angle the camera up at approx. 45 degrees, and it was zoomed in to the max, 3Xs.  It is a &#34;Sony Cybershot&#34; digital camera.<n>

These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were traveling at speeds and in a way that....<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I don&#39;t really like to be looked at like a fool, I&#39;ve always kept this story for my close friends and family for a long time but now that I just found this website I decided I should let the rest of the world know what I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just for the record, I am Canadian, but now living and working in Shanghai, China, as a teacher. I&#39;ve been living in Shanghai for now two years and this happened sometime around April 2004. Anyway, I was going to the supermarket with my girlfriend in Shanghai, China, near Jing An Temple area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, I noticed something like a fireball in the sky. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something like that but as I have seen a meteor/comet previously in my life, I quickly felt it probably wasn&#39;t, mostly because of the extremely slow speed this object was moving at.  After looking more carefully, I noticed it looked more like a huge, red glowing object with 3 visible glowing parts and a long red/fire-looking trail.  It was moving very slowly towards west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed that there were other gray objects moving very fast around it!  Perhaps 2 or 4 of them, I am not sure as many were visible at the same time.  Once again, at first I thought it was something normal, just like jet fighters.  But that&#39;s when it got very interesting!  These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were actually traveling at speeds and in a way that I&#39;ve never, ever seen in my life.  I think its worthy of mention that I grew up near an airport in Canada and every other year we have this huge air show I always attended.  I&#39;ve seen a huge variety of army aircrafts in action, including F-15s, F-18s, Vertical take off planes, F-117 (stealth airplanes) and so on so I can safely affirm that in my opinion, there is no way these could have been any aircrafts that the world knows of.  These objects could stop all of a sudden, disappear, show up again, go up, down, in a way that is not possible by any know aircrafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, these objects seemed to move around and follow the bigger, fire-orange, glowing object with a big trail behind it. I could observe this for about 5 minutes before the big object disappeared behind tall residential towers with the smaller objects seeming to fade away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened almost a year ago but immediately after the event I went home and tried to somehow put into images what I&#39;ve seen while it was fresh in my mind.  As I&#39;m a web designer and being very familiar with the Flash software, I decided that the best way to make this look as close to reality as possible was to reproduce the objects in photoshop and animate them with Flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I took a picture from the same place I observed this and put that picture as the background.  I then added the big glowing object and tried to make it move at about the same speed as It was moving.  Lastly, I&#39;ve added the smaller, oval shaped crafts and tried to animate them as close to the way they moved as possible.  I think the result is very very close to the reality of what I saw that day and I hope I could share this with the rest of the world as well. The only thing that might be slightly different from the reality is the fog, which is difficult to reproduce properly. During the actual sighting these objects were very slightly less visible than that because of the fog. But this is nonetheless a very good representation of what they looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was lying in the back seat looking up at the stars. I noticed a teardrop shaped object above me, there were no bright or blinking lights, just a orange gold glint (about the same color as the streetlights). I yelled to my friends to look at what at what at I was seeing, after a bit of yelling, my friend who was in the front passenger side came back to where I was and saw the UFO as well. When my friend in the back with me announces he could see it too, my friend who was driving pulled over. The UFO hung above us for about 5 sec. more, and then &#34;zoomed&#34; away South-East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seamed to be at approx. 30,000 ft. and looked like a cigaret suspended in mid air at about 10 ft. distance. The road turned and i went under an overpass. When i creared the overpass, i looked for the object but it wasn&#39;t there. I studied the cloudy sky, when suddenly in the opposite direction, i saw a huge gray, blunt end cylinder hanging part way out of a large dark cloud. The sun was glaring against it and i couldn&#39;t see any windows or markings. I continued driving and looking back as it hung there monionless. I didn&#39;t have a camera, but i wish i would have stopped, maby someone would have stopped &#34;with a camera&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

As I was driving south I saw what looked like a large grayish-green pineapple juice can pop over the guardrail from the east and float across the road and a height of about 2 feet.  The odd thing is that as it floated westbound it was counter-rotating.  This cylinder stayed at that height even as it floated over a stone wall and into a field, I slowed my truck down to watch it, as it came to another stone wall it maneuvered over it at the 2 foot height.  Another truck driver traveling north saw it also and asked me what it was.  All during this time the cylinder stayed perfectly horizontal to the ground. In all honesty I believe it was doing a contour survey of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Everyone in the house knows I have a thing for looking out of the windows when I first wake up, maybe to make certain the World is still here...anyway, I walked across the living room and looked out of the window behind the love seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a bird...but, I realized that birds don&#39;t glow. Then I looked more closely at the shape...kind of oval, but more like when you cup your hands and put them together, and roughly twice that size...the difference being that where your fingertips would come together, there was a dark wedge shape dividing the 2 halves, but only half way down. I didn&#39;t see any head, or tail, nor feet...just this shape. And the glowing was a muted glow, not bright, and the color was somewhere between a light grey and white. And it was pulsating, but only slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know, one of the stray kittens we feed came bounding around the corner of the house and pounced at it...that is when I became absolutely certain it was not a bird. It moved so fast, from a completely stationary position, faster than anything I have ever seen move, at least in person and not on the big screen...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern of its movement was a sloppy zig-zag, and it moved at about the height of the cat&#39;s head...maybe 10 inches off the ground. After about 2 zigs and one zag, all the while staying ahead of the cat, they both disappeared around the corner of another house...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, as it moved, there was no sound...no tail...no wings...and nothing that could have been a head...it retained its &#34;cupped hands&#34; shape the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to see if I could find any trace of it, and there was nothing.<n>

The objects were in a straight line and evenly spaced (appeared about 1/2 inch apart).  The objects did not travel with me, as would the moon, but stayed in their place above the lake and very sparcely populated wooded area between mountains.  I kept looking and within one minute the three disappeared, but slowly as though fading out.  The &#34;lights&#34; faded to a ghostly appearence in three seconds, and another three seconds dissappeared completely.  I am a skeptic about these UFOs, but believe that these sightings have to do with a spiritual condition about ready to be unmasked upon the earth prior to the coming of Jesus Christ.<n>

We&#39;ve been in our home since Feb. 2003 and live in a small rural neighborhood on the outskirts of town.  On the Night in question we had just returned to our yard after a leisurely walk around the block with our dog Trina.  The sky was basically clear with only a few small clouds scattered here and there.  We decided to play fetch with Trina in the field behind our house,(5 acres of flat treeless land).  I&#39;m a stargazer and am constantly looking for shooting stars when the heavens permit.  Looking into the northeastern sky, I saw 3 points of light, in triangle form, moving at a steady pace high in the atmosphere traveling southeast. (I am not  too sure on the direction of travel) I pointed the lights out to my husband, he suggested it was a plane.  It may well have been but the lights were not blinking and there was no sound. Like I stated earlier, we live in a rural  area and it is very quiet and dark, with the exception of the occasional car passing.  We both watched the light formation for around 10 minutes. Without warning the lights vanished.  I would like to say that it went behind a unseen cloud but the exact area it vanished at was spotted with stars and there were no clouds anywhere near.  We continued to watch, thinking that if it indeed went behind a unseen cloud that surely it would reappear.  15 minutes later there was still no sign of the object.  The object moved steadily and made no stops or turns.  We were sober, as we both niether drink alcohol or use drugs. Although I have been a believer for many years my husband became one on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Branch, IN, I noticed a bright orange light against a clear, dark sky just NNW of the town and high enough that it could not have been any street lights. The light came on then after about 15 seconds, it slowly faded away. Approx. a minute or so later I saw the light again come on in roughly the same area. A few seconds later another to the west of the original came on, then one just to the east of the original, then another just to the west near the original and the last appeared between the 2nd and 4th. Here is how the series of lights appeared: (2...5...4...1...3). The shape of the lights when all were lit was slightly curve-shaped. After about 15-20 seconds the lights began to fade away. I pulled off the highway onto a road just on the south edge of town where I would be able to gain a better vantage point in a field. After stopping and getting out of my vehicle I ran to the field and looked again. It took a minute or so for me to notice any lights again, but one came back on then faded away as before. No other observances were noted this evening on the rest of my way home. There was another vehicle on the highway just behind me that should have seen it as well as we were driving north and they did appear to slow down once the 5 lights came on, but I can not say that this is why they did slow down. There was no other immediate reason for them to given our location on the road and no traffic signals to stop at. There were also other commercial aircraft in the sky during this time, but in no close proximity to the lights observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After the fourth pass three of us looked straight up and saw a triangular shaped object crossing the sky heading northwest away from the counter clockwise circling of the stealth fighters.  It was much higher, about 5-10 thousand feet.  It was not triangular like the stealth planes.  It looked like an equilateral triangle.  You could see the outline of it but when you looked to the center of it, it looked transparent as if you were seeing the dark sky above it.  In each corner there was a dim white light much like the dots on a domino.  It when across the sky for a few seconds and then seemed to stall and shimmer or vibrate and then it shot across the sky and disappeared.  The speed that it disappeared at had to have been 10 to 20 times faster that its original speed, maybe thousands of miles per second.  This speed is hard to describe but it wasn&#39;t as fast as a bolt of lightning you see in the sky.  After it disappeared, a few seconds we heard a boom in the distance but thought it might have been from Camp Pendleton.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To visualize one set of lights, imagine a cross section of a pipe with many lights making the circle.  It was these lights that alternated kind of like christmas lights that look like the electricity is moving through them.  For example, let&#39;s say each set of lights was only made of 3 lights.  Light 1 is on, light 2 and 3 are off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is on, L3 is off.  Then L1 is off, L2 is off, L3 is on.  Then L1 is on, L2 is off, L3 is off.  I wish I could describe it better.  Hopefully the text image below will come out correctly.  You should see 3 O&#39;s portraying the 3 sets of circular light schemes with each O at a corner of an equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O O O  It hovered over the highway for maybe 30 seconds and quickly sped off to the right hand site shoulder behind the overpass.  As I approached the overpass it came speeding back over the high way.  It hovered very low.  It actually passed right in front of my car twice and then hovered off to the left and shined a light (almost like a small white flashlight) right at me from the right hand side.  This light came from one of the sides, not from one of the corners of the object.  It followed me for a little bit and I was going just over 80mph.  Then it crossed over the northbound side again and then went back to the right hand side where it vanished behind the overpass.  I saw it for probably close to a minute or two total but it seems longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the color was black but i couldn&#39;t quite see it because of the lights.  I basically only saw the lights from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have been some one playing tricks on people because it was a very small object.  Not exactly large enought to hold little green men.  It probably close to 3 or 5 feet in length.  It was definitely not wider than my Civic.  However it had great agility and speed and it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was definitely not the only person to see this.  Aside from my parents in the same car, there were a bunch of trucks on the freeway at the time.  I did a search on the internet at about 5:30 PM the same day to see if anyone had more info on this and I can&#39;t seem to find anything so I am entering in this info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The aircraft had the standard blinking lights. Suddenly, I saw a faint light, mostly round as far as I could see, that was NOT blinking, go almost perpendicular, from North to South, crossing the path of the aircraft, directly over me.  The faint light was moving at a very fast speed in comparison to the aircraft. I was saying, &#34;wow!&#34; to myself, wondering what the heck it was.  And then, within a few seconds, a second light followed, on the exact same N to S path of the first light, also NOT blinking.  The first light seemed to intersect the path of the aircraft directly above me.  The second light was behind the aircraft with the blinking lights.  I tried to see if I could see the lights further south from my position, to see if they were continuing on the same N to S path, but just about the time the second light went by, my porch light went on (it&#39;s on a motion sensor), and I was blinded from seeing their trajectory after the initial sighting.  The first light had given me that &#34;wow!&#34; feeling, like the &#34;goosebumps&#34; type of thing, but when I saw the second light go by, it was a big WOW!, and I probably woke my neighbors!  I was outside with my two dogs when this happened. I can not explain those two lights, but I am wondering if the pilot(s) of the aircraft had seen it, since it appeared the first light would have been directly above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After we met and I was walking back to my house. I got to the road and I saw the saucer come out from behind the trees above the road very closeby. It passed over the road and went behind some trees. It had to have been extremely low to vanish beneath these trees. I could see it was distinctly round-shaped (not aircraft) and it was so close but completely silent. No noise from engine or anything. If it was a normal aircraft or helicopter the noise from this distance would have been loud. It had a few red and yellow lights flashing at intervals and it went directly across the road about three hundred feet away from me. It went so low under the trees, it was really ridiculous. The next day I told my friend i had met and he was astounded, he had saw it also from back at his house! He said it was as exactly as i described it and that he saw it in the same place. From his couch, he has a view of the area over my house and my neighbors, (where i saw it.) I am so glad he saw it otherwise people woulda thought i was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After riding for a short bit on Sunnyside Blvd, we went back into the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that next section there are two hills and valleys. On top of the first hill we turned off our helmet lights and were catching our breth when I looked into the sky toward the west..<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;What is that?&#34; I asked.  It was a square flying object surrounded by lights and was flying away from us.  I shrugged it off, it was pretty far away, so I forgot about it, turned my lights back on and road down into  the next valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we as we got up onto the next hill and turned our lights off, I looked to the south and saw the same flying object as before, but this time it was flying towards us.  It was square or rectangle, had lights all around the edge and was silent.  We were on a hill and the flying object appeared to be flying pretty low.  It was coming right towards us but turned 90 degrees on a dime and headed west, the same as the other ship we saw earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right then any doubt I had as to what it was vanished.  I knew it was a UFO.  Planes are not silent and don&#39;t make right angle turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed something else odd about that night.  During other night rides on this trail the wildlife would be abundant with birds, squirrels, raccoons, opossums etc.  But on this night the woods was eerily quiet, before and after the UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being filled with fear didn&#39;t stop me from continuing my ride that night, but it did interfere with future night rides.  I found many reasons to not go night riding after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend wanted to believe the object we saw was just a plane.  He acknowledged it once or twice as a UFO, but then has been steadfast in his denial ever since.  I know was I saw.  It was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The first set were of them in their living room, then shortly after that I went outside to take some photos of their house (which is only about 2 yrs old). Outside and across the road facing west with no sun visible in the sky, I started to take some shots that were more or less experimental,testing different settings. I was using a Canon EOS 10D digital camera with a Sigma 24-70mm lens. Later this evening I and my girl friend were reviewing our shots and noticed through enlarging (in the camera)something over their house. The item appeared to be exactly in the same position through several shots but then gone in some of the early ones. The UFO was a curved object separate from a circular object at the same level at an undetermined distance apart. P.S. The present form of the photos is in &#34;RAW&#34; format. How do I proceed to send you photos??? Please Advise, Thank-you.  Regards ((name deleted))<n>

It was too large and much too bright and in the wrong place to be a star or planet and it was relatively stationary. As I watched it began to move slightly down and to the right and then it remained stationary once again. It was not blinking or &#39;twinkling&#39;, though the light appeared to shine much like a diamond. There was no sound. I called to everyone else who was home at the time to come and look at it. They saw it move as well. When videotaped, the object appeared to grow larger and smaller, though we think it was just becoming brighter/dimmer and it was difficult to see what it was since the night was very dark and there was no other stationary frame of reference for the camera. When viewed through binoculars the shape was spherical, rather violet in color with rotating green rings about it with a slight red/orange trail. We called some friends, who lived in other areas nearby, but a few miles away to ask if they could see it as well - which they could. We sat watching it for some time, while it continued to &#39;hover&#39; and move slightly up, down, left and right. It (very) slowly began moving West and then disappeared at around 10:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD))<n>

It appears to be red, however upon closer inspection it appeared to be flashing alternating colors - red, white, possibly blue blips of light, possibly circular in motion.  It would move rapidly, then appear to hover without moving in any direction.  It was quite far away, so not much detail other than this.  Then it would move rapidly again, getting discernably smaller even at such great distances.  It was in the southwestern sky, then moved left . . . then moved slightly right, then took off to the left again and disappeared<n>

The object seemed to be about anywhere from 2000 to 5000 feet high. There where no clouds in the sky to guage height. There were no other aircraft in the sky to guage scale. My wife noticed it as well, and she agreed to keep an eye on it as I ran in the house and got my camera. I shot several images of the craft. In the max zoom of my telephoto lens (70 to 210) the object appeared to be a series of chrome spheres that seemed to be constantly moving and changing shape. Several times the objects formed a verticle &#34;V&#34; shape. The &#34;V&#34; shape was made twice in a very short time of say 3 seconds. I have photos of this, (as negatives as I haven&#39;t developed the images yet.) The group of orbs totaled 7 objects in all. They approached our house from the west and then began to travel south once they where over our house. Soon another sigular orb apeared from the north and started to follow the grouped orbs south. The group of orbs picked up speed slightly, and were soon covered from view by trees. Sight was lost on the sigular orb after the group moved south. The group continued to change shape the entire sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this with the understanding that I may be reporting a few Mylar baloons that got loose from somewhere. I have access to Mylar baloons at the car lot I work at but, I have never seen them behave in the manner I have described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will update this story after I have the photos developed.  I have included an illustration for reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I realized that it wasn&#39;t a flock but a grayish transparent chevron shape. In a matter of 5 seconds it flattened out into a cigar shape that was no wider than the original chevron shape. As it was flattening, 6 bright but tiny green lights appeared in a somewhat circular shape where the chevron shape had been (see drawing). They stayed this way for about 2 seconds before they began to converge into 1 green light. This single light was stationary and slowly dimmed for about 6 seconds. Then the green light flared up to a very bright green light, but did not change in size. I can only describe it like sunlight shining on greenish chrome. At this point the bright green light slowly began to move south. It picked up speed rapidly and continued south and had a thin green trail following it. I watched it speed away for about 3 seconds until I lost it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought I was seeing things, then I called my father. As soon as my father came to see, the object made a sharp right turn and then the light dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then maybe 5 minutes later I saw it again, a really bright red circle. This time it seemed it like it was climbing. This time my father did see it....and saw how quick it was gaining in altitude without actually covering any horizontal distance. As it went up in the sky the lights once again turned off....bizarre, If it was a plane flying at night wouldn&#39;t it have headlights on....I&#39;m used to planes flying over me, being close to the airport. But this was not the same......both my dad and I decided to check it out further and we went outside to look at it and we could see all the lights were off, but you could still see that greyish oblong shaped object in the sky....it seemed like it was going around in circles around our neighborhood. I don&#39;t know what this was. I was hoping that someone could shed some light on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>
4/10/04 22:25|Richland|WA|Light|20 mins|bright light, white, with hints of gold.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36230.html|242|ndxe200404| bright light, white, with hints of gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very bright light above, well above, the tree tops, possibly 1-5 miles distant.  I&#39;d say it was about half the size of a dime held at arm&#39;s length.  Far too  bright to be a star, it caught my attention immediately as I was taking the dog out in the yard.  My exact reaction was &#34;What the hell?&#34;  I moved around the yard, watching it in relation to trees, poles, etc., and could see that it was bobbing and weaving gently (rocking motion).  I planted my feet firmly and studied it in relation to stars, and it was the only thing moving.  I finally went into the house and told my wife, &#34;I know you&#39;re not going to believe this, but there&#39;s a UFO out the back.&#34;  She said, &#34;Sure, Sure.&#34;  I asked her to come look, and she said, &#34;I cannot even believe I&#39;m getting up for this.&#34;  But as we got out back, she watched it for a bit and admitted she couldn&#39;t really say what it was.  I went in and got a small digital camera and snapped a few pictures of it.  The best shows a round object with &#39;spiral arms&#39; of light coming off it.  I also took a brief &#39;movie&#39; but have not had a chance to put it on the computer.  On the camera, it appears blank.  About 15 mins later, my wife and I left to pick up our daughter from a dance.  I said, &#34;Well, if it IS a star or planet, it will be there when we get back.  If it&#39;s gone, we&#39;ll know it was something else.&#34;  We returned by 11:15 and it was no where in the sky.  I climbed the high back porch on our house and scanned the entire horizon and there was nothing.  If this had been a star or planet, it could not have &#39;gone down&#39; in such a brief span of time.  I&#39;m a meteorologist, and habitually study the sky.  I feel I&#39;m a pretty good observer.  I couldn&#39;t call this a &#39;flying saucer&#39; but it was certainly something airborne that was not identifiable as anything conventional. I will submit the pictures via email as soon as I can get them transferred to the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching a jet that had just flown over.  It appeared to be heading West to the Tulsa,OK airport.  Suddenly from the North we saw a solid reddish orange glowing disk shaped object going very fast.  At first, we discussed later, we both thought it was a missle that was going to hit the jet we were watching.  From our angle, it appeared to be heading right for it. In our excitment of what we were viewing, we both stood to our feet bracing for what we thought was about to happen.  However, it went below and behind the jet.  That is when we knew it was not a missle or any vehicle we had ever seen before.  It traveled at a speed faster than any jet could ever go, as we watched it go Southward.  There was no sound.  We could even hear the jet that had gone over still in the distance but no sound with this object. I thought to myself that it reminded me of how a bubble would act in a very fast wind. It seemed to go slightly up and down, as if floating but in a determined Southward direction.  We watched until it went out of sight.  With out saying a word we looked at each other and ran in the house.  Only then, did we both confirm between us what we had seen but could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 2 mlles north of the rest area located at mile post 13 on I-5.  Above the trees I could see a shiny, round object.  I thought it was a plane with light reflecting off the fuselage, making the shape hard to ascertain.  (I was more aware of this because when I was passing the Woodland airfield, a small plane had just taken off, but the bright sunshine reflecting off the plane was making it hard to see).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i got closer to the object, the appearance became more spherelike.  It reminded me of a shiny beach ball (note: at about 2 mles out, it looked to be the size of a large beach ball) with a band around the middle.  When I was about a half mile from the object, it made a rolling turn and disappeared.  I thought perhaps it had somehow become blocked from view by the trees, but when I drove past the trees, there was nothing to be seen.  The sky was empty as far as my eyes could see and the object was just plain gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know how many other people saw the object, but if anyone did, they did not pull off the road nor did they give any indication that they had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We own 7 acres of land. We live in rural Victoria with our whole family. As me and my young brother and father were walking through our land on the 9th of April on a Friday night we seen an object floating in the sky. At the beginning we dismissed it as being a helicopter but as it drew closer we grew with fear that it might be an unidentified flying object. The object was coming closer. It was probably first at 12,000 feet above but we started fearing when it dropped quickly to about 7,000 feet. The object which looked like a triangle with three bright balls in each corner was resonating a bright light from all three corners. We got very scared and ran to our home in shock and disbelief but we also kept watching it to see what it was doing. We will never forget what happened for the rest of our lives. The Triangle object then dropped in altitude to about 3000 feet then 2000 feet. It was getting closer the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother immeditly called the local police and told what was happening. The police skeptically agreed to come to our residence to see what was going on due to the fear that they could hear in my mothers voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In disbelief we watched the object. My mather and sister were crying as my father and brother and me watched as the object vertically dropped to about 1000 feet. It then navigated for a couple of minutes around the sky brightening the fields. The object then started moving right, then it travelled directly up into the sky - then it camoflaged into a star in the sky. It was the most shocking and emotionally disturbing experience that our family experienced. We do not suffer from a family with mental health issues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police arrived five minutes after the triangular object left vanishing vertically into the sky. We told them everything what had happened in exact detail. The police were very skeptical but told us to contact the Australia Government at http://www.defence.gov.au/ We contacted them and we are awaiting to recieve a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighiting has changed our lives forever, and we have been looking for groups to discuss what we have experienced but in this rural area where we live we cannot find anything. The local people even thing we are crazy as they did not witness it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not know what to do and we are seeking help and we feel emotionally scared from what we experienced. It seems like the internet is the only source to find information pertaining to UFO sightings. We would like to know your advise to help us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our family has been deeply shocked by this whole incident. And we would like some information to bring some sort of relief.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and noticed Oryan&#39;s(unsure of spelling) Belt, when out of nowhere a Boomerang like shape came turning towards me, it had lights going around the edges of it.  I first thought it was a plane, but then i noticed that there was no sound anywheres except for crickets and my dog growling(she has never growled at anything before) and the fact that there was no tail or flashing lights, then all the lights began 2 flicker and the weaker ones, like my flash light, went out.  It was traveling to the left, I stuck with North and South directions, but I think it was NW.  It turned away from me, North I think, and disappeared.  A sec later all the lights came on brighter then ever, like the batteries were recharged.  I ran in side and was talking with my friend, online, about it and some girls in school.  He told me that it was probably a gov&#39;t space craft or something, but then I realized that it was too thin and the angle the wings made weren&#39;t the same as gov&#39;t space crafts.(I used to be obbsesed with UFO&#39;s and gov&#39;t space craftes when I was younger)  So he reffered me to this site, and here I am.<n>

I didn&#39;t see it at first but then I saw the stars of Leo blink out as the object flew over. It was a black triangular shape that was maybe 1000&#39; off the ground, and about 20&#34; wide at arms length. It made no noise. As it passed directly overhead (heading due north) she noticed a line of dim orangish lights along the trailing edge. But they appeared to be more like exhaust ports than actual lights. We only saw the object for about 30 seconds. Both of us are avid amature astronomers and have witnessed a number of other sightings before. But nothing like this has ever been observed by either of us. I contacted Whiteman AFB 509th Bomber Div. but they told me they didn&#39;t have any Stealth bombers out that night over Phx. They told me I should contact Edwards AFB but they were of no help. Since then I have contacted Luke AFB but have not yet received a reply. This object moved at a moderate rate of speed but almost seemed like it was coasting in for a landing. Which is obviously not an option in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Name deleted) looked in the direction that I was pointing to and jumped up and walked over to the fence, where we both watched the objects disappear moving North. These egg shaped objects in an orange/yellow glow were moving too fast and were too close together to be regular aircrafts. There was no sound at all and no flashing lights to indicate it was man-made. We were hesitant to contact you, but after viewing pictures in the &#34;Newbury, Ontario Egg Shaped Objects-photos&#34; link placed on your website after sketching our own drawings we were stunned that the photos taken were similar to our own interpretations. The sighting took place around 9:37 p.m. Friday, April 9, 2004. We both came in and did our own rough sketches that are signed and dated.

I observed two objects crossing the sky from east to west at a height we normally see a commercial jet fly. When I first observed them there was a considerably gap between the two craft. As the objects passed over me the gap closed and they were side by side until they were out of sight. The objects were reddish orange in color, no blinking lights, but like a continuous light outlining the craft. The objects were triangled shape and moved at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were just relaxing and looking at the stars like we always do when he said &#34;look at this coming.&#34; I observed two disc shaped objects. They looked like two plates or saucers standing on end. They were traveling at a very high rate of speed from east to west. They looked as if they were racing each other. One was a small distance behind the other but, they crossed directly over us the gap between them closed and they were side by side. Never have I witnessed anything travel at such a high rate of speed. From what I could estimate they were about the same height as commercial jets that we have seen. The sky was very clear and full of stars. The objects were a orange color, no flashing lights. They looked illuminated , not real bright, but like a glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am 37 Yrs. old. I saw a small blinking light the size of a star almost directly overhead that I knew was a plane. About 1Min. behind it was another plane. They were traveling N/NE. This is normal because I live 15Min. from Fayetteville Regional Airport and 25Min. from Fort Braggs front gate. I am used to seeing planes of all types. As are most people that live here. Suddenly under the first plane flew a orange-red fireball from out of nowhere. It left a trail like a meteor. It was the size to me of a dime at arms length. It was traveling opposite the planes (S/SW.) From the direction of Fort Bragg. The fireball passed the first plane and vanished. I figured it was a meteor. Then it reappeared and passed under the second plane and vanished again. I waited and it reappeared again and vanished. It traveled like a stone skipping on water except the stone would be vanishing every time it hit the water. It did this a total of five times and was gone almost making the horizon. This event happened at 21:10 in the evening. The object went from directly over head to the horizon in less than 5 Seconds. It was obviously in a hurry. There was no sound. The planes did not change direction afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seemed to be rotating high in the atmosphere and was reflecting light at intervals of 3 to 4 seconds while it moved slowly downward, almost snakelike. The light seemed to be the steady magnitude of a dim star when not reflecting. I lost sight of the object at about 30 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:10pm:   At my zenith facing eastward, I saw another star like object moving SSW and followed it for about 20 seconds with 7x35 binoculars. The color of the light through the binoculars was yellowish blending into an orange/red on the outer edge and did not blink or pulse. I could see no shape to the object, only light. I looked down to see what the time was, and when I looked back up, I could no longer find the object. Weather conditions were clear and mild.<n>

It seemed bright but at times went dim.  I thought it was just a bright star at first but then it got a lot bigger, it didnt appear to be an airplane, there was only one light and it wasn&#39;t blinking like planes do. I reached down and got my flashlight and flashed the object thru the front window while driving- the object became bright and dim like a response.  I felt like it was watching me so I pulled into the Pilot TS in Winslow,AZ and parked.  I went out to the outskirts of the parking lot/near the edge of the desert {NW corner} and watched the light.  It was hard to determine the size or distance-it was about 3 thumbs up from the horizon. I got scared and went into the ts. I came out about 20 min later.  went to the same spot and the object seemed to be at a distance toward Flagstaff.  It was 1 thumb from the horizon if even that.  I went over and got another driver and told him about what i saw and where i saw it and showed him the light, just as he looked at it, the light flashed bright again.  He confirmed that it was to bright to be a star.  The reason i didn&#39;t believe it was a star was because when I was driving I noticed it move; it was south and i saw it move from the southwest part of the highway to right in front of me.  It went about 2 horizontal thumbs within about 5 to 6 seconds at a hight of about 21/2 thumbs high.  It could have been picking up my CD radio frequency (iroc) that i was playing over the radio.  Needless to say, I didnt have a warm fuzzy feeling about these guys. I thought it pretty ironic when i later turned on the xm and heard you on coast discussing ufo siteings the very night i encountered one (for the first time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.

It was dark and cloudy with cloud coverage.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but it just appeared.  In the west sky high above the tree line.  Whatever I saw had five or more round burnt orange center cirle shapes in a horizontal line.  The circle shapes reminded me of big stadium lights that were orange that would fad into a haze on the outer edges.  Like I said there were five or more.  It could of been a big circular shape that all the lights were connected to, because it was cloudy.  It was so bright that it cast a shadow on the clouds.  I never seen any metal only the round orange globes.  I seen the &#34;thing&#34;  I started fumbeling for my cell phone, never taking my eyes off of it.  I was stopped right in front of my house.  Then it was gone, before I even had my phone in hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the viewable distance, the object appeared to be quite large. I will guess maybe 20 feet in diameter. The falling point was bright white in color followed by red embers just behind the fireball that was followed by a white trail. It was very much larger than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. I expected to hear a sonic boom or an explosion as it seemed to crash near the center of Ocala from my viewing position. After reading resent reports, I think this may have been a piece of the Cosmos. I will be glad to give a more detailed report if required.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned to look and noticed six lights in a circle hovering in the sky. The lights were on for about 10 to 15 seconds then went off. In about 30 more seconds they came back on again about 200 yards to the north and stayed on for about 10 to 15 seconds before they went back off. That was the last I saw of them.  All I could see were the lights. Friday was a very hazy night in Monticello.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just finished a discussion on Big and Little Dippers and North Star.  As I continued gazing straight up (90 degrees), I noticed a faint &#34;cluster of Lights&#34;.  Two things got my immediate attention.  The amount of lights that were flashing, and the high rate of speed the object seemed to be moving.  The lights appeared to be a &#34;cluster&#34; of lights, perhaps 6-10, and they were flashing, with red being the dominant color.  I watched for approximately 10 seconds.  During that time, the cluster kept flashing and moved across the sky from straight overhead to approx. 45 degrees.  I then pointed the object out to my wife who sighted it and we watched for approx. another 20 seconds until it disappeared due to long range at about 25 degrees on the horizon.  The cluster of lights appeared to be extremely high.  No  sound could be detected. Not knowing the size of the object or the size of the lights, it is difficult to estimate its altitude.  Making an estimate based on what I know about aircraft, sizes, speeds, etc., I estimate this cluster of lights could easily have been between 25,000 and 35,000 feet, or even higher.  The object traveled the entire time in a straight line from North to South.  The cluster of lights did not change relative position on each other, and the craft did not change direction.  I am not aware of any known aircraft that has up to 10 flashing lights on the underside.  As we went to bed later that evening, we listened to &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; on KMJ 580 (Fresno, Ca) and several callers had reported seeing this cluster of lights, also moving North to South, along the East Coast.  (Were there multiple targets that evening????, or was the same target making multiple passes?)   I am a retired Naval Aviator, still keeping a commercial, Instrument rating current in the civilian sector.  In over 5,000 flight hours, this is my sighting of a &#34;really&#34; wierd sighting in the sky which defied ! concepts of speed, shape, and lighting.  I trust that this information may be useful, perhaps in pinning down what took place on this evening, or perhaps in the future,<n>

I asked the driver &#34;hey what is that light over there&#34; and by the time we passed a set of trees so she could see, it started moving toward east wenatchee and she said a plane. but then it started moving to fast to be a plane and I said &#34;I have never seen a plane move that fast before&#34;. It got about half way to horizon airport and instantly made a 90 degree turn heading back toward Wenatchee where the speed and altitude varied. We at that point knew this was no airplane. We pulled into the driveway and I stood outside for a good half hour and seen nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/9/04 14:03|Lawrenceville|GA|Cylinder|13 minutes|Spotted a cylindrical cloud behaving contrary to laws of physics at 2 PM.

Took 7 very good photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was in backyard taking photos of clouds and planes (my house in directly under the approach to the Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta). I suddenly noticed a very peculiar looking to the East. It was a almost perfect elongated rectangle, about 10 times as long as it was wide, and it appeared like an iridesent cloud, but it&#39;s shape was not like any cloud I have ever seen or heard of , except possibly, the Pillar of cloud&#34; that was credited with guiding the Hebrews out of Egypt about 3100 (?) years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get 4 good photos of it before Itemporarily lost track of it.It was travelling in roughly a North to South-West direction at a liesurely pace. It&#39;s size, after reviewing my photos, appears to be about 4-500 feet long, maybe longer.  It re-appeared about 10-11 minutes and I got to more photos of it as it was now going back to the North. although, it gave the general appearance of a cloud, it seemed to travel completely independently of any wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the aforementioned 10-11 minutes after I initially lost sight of the &#34;cylinder&#34; , which was to my East, the sound of a jet airliner, headed South towards the Hartsfield-Jackson airport, suddenly caught my attention and I turned my camera to the South and snapped a picture of the airplane(a commercial airliner) just before it disappeared over the top of the gum tree in my front yard. This was exactly 1 minute and 19 seconds after I had taken my last previous shot of the &#34;cylinder&#34;. After I downloaded my digital photos, I discovered that I had not only captured the airplane in the image , but, over near the left edge of the photo was the top half of the &#34;cylinder&#34; plainly visible and sticking up out of a bank of clouds.

I drive an 18 wheeler over the road, I was traveling north on US 29 in MD and wanted to stop at a store for some breakfast/lunch.  I took the US 40 exit east then at the light I went right instead of left (wrong turn) this headed me into a residental area which is bad for big trucks so I knew I had to turn around so I took the first right down the street and went 1 1/2 blocks and I saw a person?? walking a dog.  They had a gray hooded sweatshirt on pulled on their head and facing away from me.  I guess the truck startled her (I say her due to the body shape) and she turned around very quickly and i saw a face i have never seen before except in alien report drawings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was about 5 foot 1 in to 5 f 4 in had an oblong face with a sunken nose, creamy pale skin, very small mouth, and two very large all black eyes that just stared at me.  I was kind of shocked and didnt think to stop for a closer look till I was past her 1/2 a block, with curiousity getting the best of me.  I made a U-turn in the intersection to go back for a better look.  When i got turned around she was gone which is also weird becauce it only took less than a min to turn around.<n>

Me and my 5 yr. old niece were playing on the trampoline waiting for the sun to go down, so we can star gaze. I went to show my niece one of the stars we could already see and when we both looked up there was a yellow light flying over head. The speed was great. It was gone within seconds. It was like fire yellow.  It actually looked like fire shooting across the sky. I live close to an Dobbins Air Force Base and Lockheed. I may have just been seeing the tale of a jet hitting mach speed. But normally I can hear the jets as they go buy, but no sound was coming from this. I see alot of things in the sky around here. I just mark it up to the base and Lockheed testing some new stuff. I<n>

The object was seen from far distance as a small mettalic like light blue object that shimmered in the light. The object hovered in the sky for several minutes without movement and slowely left from right several times and in and out of the clouds all for about 30 minutes.   We observed the object through binoculars and the craft appeared to be a dull baby blue color and the materieal seamed to be plastic like.  It almost seemed fake as if  the whole thing was an object from a cartoon or something.  Up close it was not mettalic at all, only at far distances did it seem this way.  At first glimpse the object was boomerang shaped.  Then throughout the 30 or so minutes the object slowly moved around and flipped over several times.   At second glance  the object seemed to flip slowely and at one instance the object seemed to be shaped like a large &#34;L&#34; on its side.  The object moved further into the sky until it was no longer noticeable.  The whole scene was surreal as if it we couldnt believe our eyes.  There was no condesation or anything left behind, however the object floated and was solid colored with no lights or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The tails end was orange. The fireball was low ( about 1/4 mile up, I think), and travelled almost parallel to the ground and slowley decending toward Sisters Point to the EastSouthEast. It decended for about 5 seconds, then just disappeared. It looked like if it had continued its trajectory for a couple of more seconds, It would have hit Sisters Point. About 4 minutes later, the waves got larger like a boat had passed, but I could not see nor hear any boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no reply from the newspaper so she went and paid them a visit enquiring about the email she had sent to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She eventually talked with the editor and the paper is going to run a short piece on what was witnessed that night in the April 8, 2004 in the Wednesday - April 28, 2004 newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the lady observed from her home was a bright pink spherical shaped object and surrounding the object was a dark blue aura. The object sat low, hovering over the Smithers Ski Hill Road until it just disappeared at a extreme rate of speed. Before the lady lost sight of it, it was moving very slowly from it&#39;s hovering position. She said there was not a sound coming from the object. The woman said she usually heads to bed earlier but she wasn&#39;t able to sleep and had been watching a program on TV when she decided to go outside to take her dog a pet cookie. She turned around to go back into her home and saw the strange object. She told me that it was not a plane as they are use to seeing them flying over top of the area all the time due to the Smithers airport being close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very important note is that the object was below the rim of the mountains. Also the object was &#34;not&#34; observed near any of the ski runs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

I was walking out of the Marathon Oil tower at 11:17 pm CDT.  As I was saying goodbye to a security guard, a cylindrical object came down from the South East above a park across the street.  The security guard and I didn&#39;t see it until it was about 30 ft about the park because of a cover over the passenger dropoff point.  The object hovered above the park changing color from blue to white and blue again.  The object seemed to be made up of a single glowing light source.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object.  The hair stood up on my neck, and I looked at the security guard.  He was staring right at the object.  After I looked back at the object, it made its final color change and almost instantly lift back up into the sky.  We could not see where it went because of the cover on the passenger dropoff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few words were exchanged between us as we left.  I took a cab home that night rather than walking.  Now the security guard refuses to acknowledge this happened.  When I try talking about it, he says he doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to have the other individual submit a report, as well.

It was a pretty clear night, and often if I am outside and the sky is clear, I will look up at the stars for long periods of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I looked up while I was taking my bookbag out of my car, and I saw that SOMETHING up there was moving because I could see that motion of stars disappearing and reappearing.  It was larger than a normal plane probably because it flew closer to the ground, I would say about helicopter level.  As it flew northeast from southwest, it flew above my head.  I noticed it was going at a medium pace, and that it was triangle shaped, but also had an indentation at it&#39;s base, like a boomerang.  I was stunned because I noticed that craft had no lights whatsoever!!! I had thought that all aircraft were required to have lights!!  I tilted my ear up to the air to listen for sound but there was none.  The bottom of the craft (on the bottom corners) seemed to have a faded dark grey circle.  I could tell it was lighter than the black craft, but I can&#39;t say it was light because it was so dark! If I hadn&#39;t looked up to see the stars move and realize there was an object I would of never known it was there...completely silent and dark.  It never hesistated, it just flew over me in the course I indicated earlier.  As it flew more Northeast, I tried to spot it, but I could not longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my very first unidentified aircraft sighting, even though I have been looking for a very long time!!  I was pretty excited, but not scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But...when I woke up the next day I realized I felt sick.  I developed a cold.  I don&#39;t know if the craft had anything to do with it, but I am getting better now.  I went on the internet to see what I could find about crafts.  Believe me, I was SHOCKED to find out many people have had experiences with black triangles and no sounds!! In all my years of UFO interest, I had never really stumbled upon the black triangle phenomena! Thanks for reading my sighting!<n>

Wingspan was at least 100 feet.  1/2 mile to a 3/4 mile high.  Seemed like a glider with just the wings without the fuselage or tail.  It was not the stealth fighter as the wings were very thin width wise and the stealth makes quite a lot of noise which this did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Before going, we had a little chat. I looked up at him and suddenly noticed a black object which was hovering close by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately saw it because I&#39;m a bird-watcher, I thought it was an eagle at first. Unfortunately I was shocked when I realized it was not a bird. It is an aircraft and a weird one which I never have witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that it is a black disc-shaped object, so the first thing that came to my mind is that this is a UFO. I hoped that it was actually a flattened balloon slowly dropping down, but it wasn&#39;t. It floated at the same attitude going forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that it is nothing I ever seen. I quickly told my friend to look at it to see if he saw it or not, and whether he knew what the heck it was. He looked back at me after he watched for a while. I could see the same curious look on his face. He thought it was the so-called UFO too. We looked carefully at it as it slowly hovered, just like what helicopters does. I estimated it to be about 100 meters from ground and about the size of a car. As we are living on the 5th and 6th floor we should have heard a sound coming from it, if it had of been a helicopter at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc flew in a very unique way, it flew like something injured, because it sloped 45 degree to the left then right then left again as it traveled along. If it was flown by humans, they would easily be affected by nausea in such aircraft. I noticed a red light flashing at the back of the craft. Since it is still bright outside, I could barely tell whether it was glowing or not, but I saw the atmosphere near it was a little lighter than normal, maybe it is due to the contrast or maybe it is shimmering. It disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that no one each from our hostel actually saw the object. I&#39;m still in shock and still try my best to understand what it was I saw!

4/8/04 10:30|San Francisco Bay Area|CA|Rectangle|About 20-30 minutes|Two bright amber lights hovering, separating, rejoining, then leaving in different directions silently.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42624.html|297|ndxe200404| Two bright amber lights hovering, separating, rejoining, then leaving in different directions silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearly a year ago, on the evening of April 8, 2004, I was standing in my backyard patio looking at the clear night sky when I observed 2 big, bright, yellowish-amber lights hanging in the southwestern sky approximately 35 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I couldn&#39;t figure out which &#39;planets&#39; these were being so bright and below the orbital plane of the planetary solar system. These objects were much brighter than the apparent magnitude of Venus and of course a different color. I then located ice-blue Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and maybe either Uranus or Mercury - they were all where they should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought they must be 2 hovering helicopters but being that bright they would have to be very close and I should be able to hear them.  These lights never made a sound the whole time. My son, unbeknownst to me at the time, had been standing in the street in front of my house to get better reception from the cell phone as he was calling his aunt and uncle in Richland, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He saw these same 2 lights climb out of the southwestern horizon (which I had not) and then stop and hover. He too was puzzled and described the phenomenon to his aunt while still on the phone.  He then walked through the house and into the back patio to tell me but as I have said, I was already watching them at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked, the left light only receded back down toward the southwest to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, stopped, and hovered there for about 2-3 minutes. Then, on its way back up to join the other light, it emitted what looked like 3-4 streams of sparkling lights or projectiles that reminded me of tracer bullets or Roman candles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For an instant, it scared me so my heart stopped as I truly thought we were under some sort of attack. (Too many war and space movies I guess!)   Now the left light had rejoined the other one and they both just hung there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside the house and got my binoculars which revealed the big, bright, amber lights, both left and right, to be actually 4 steady, separate lights on the corners of a perfect square.   These two bright amber lights, continued to hang there for about 4 more minutes then the left light began climbing up the sky until it was directly overhead (12 o’clock position).  It moved at about the apparent speed of a satellite but it was obviously no satellite as it was a hell of a lot closer, bigger, and brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got to the 1 o’clock position on its northeasterly course, the lights instantly disappeared as if being turned of by a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back to look for the right light, it was gone.  My son said he had watched it depart on a course 90 degrees to the other light, in a northwesterly direction.  He said it appeared to drop a couple of tiny red dots vertically downward and then it too suddenly disappeared.  Neither my son, who is a college graduate, nor I was able to explain this phenomenon to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the ensuing days, I scoured the newspapers and watched the TV news but not a peep mentioning anything about this.   I asked several fellow pilots in my flying club, and after some joking at my expense of course, none had observed anything as they were inside their houses that night.  I also called the Traffic Control Tower at Buchanan Field in Concord, CA several days later and no one had observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really boggles my mind is the fact that in a large metropolitan area of several million people,  you’d think at least a few people would be outside their houses looking up at the night sky to see this phenomenon, and knowing this could not be explained as ‘conventional aircraft, satellites, or planetary behavior’, would therefore report it to someone.  Of course, neither did I, officially, until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been on my mind for almost a year now, and it wasn’t until I saw the Peter Jennings Special on UFOs a few days ago that I learned of your site for reporting this sort of phenomenon.  So here I am and now you have it.<n>

I was dreaming normally, and then the normal pleasant dream when to black, like a void  I was conscious being in.  Then there was 6 round bright lights, and they illuminated the darkness without being there, and all i could see was white, just blinding white, but not blinding my eyes, blinding my mind.  And they I heard a voice.  Time has come child, I am going to take you home soon.&#34; thats all it said, and when it finished the blackness and bright white were gone, and I could see the creature that said it.  Feel it.  But not make it out.  I can&#39;t remember what it looked like, but I saw it.  I remember it wasn&#39;t short, and it had bigger eyes, but it didn&#39;t look like a little green man or anything.  It looked almost human enough.  But thats all I can remember from that.  After he looked at me as well, the darkness, and then I realized what the darkness was, and it sucked me backwards at amazing speeds.  I could see stars whizzing by, and huge planets, and then there was Earth, and though this was only in a dream, It was the most Amazing feeling seeing earth like that from space, and then I went head first through the sky, falling, falling, headed towards my state at first, then towards my town, then towards my house, then towards the room over my bedroom, and I heard a boom.  Not from outside my dream but inside my head, and I woke up, all in that instant. The whole encouter scared the crap out of me.  Still does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have absolutely no way of knowing whether the experience described by the witness has any relationship to UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>

I decided to file this report after seeing other reports about an object that was sighted on April 8, 2004 near Rochester IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a truck driver and was traveling northbound on US 31 between Peru and Rochester IN when I noticed a series of amber lights approximately 100 ft above the ground traveling east at a slow rate of speed. At first I thought it may be a commercial or military aircraft because of my proximity to Grissom Air Base, however, as the object grew closer it looked as if the front was rounded or oval shaped. I slowed my truck and the object passed just behind me making no discernable noise. I began to speed up and I noticed the object had changed its direction, now moving towards the north northeast gaining altitude until it dissappeared in the clouds. When I got home a few hours later I told my wife what I saw and never thought anything more about it until this morning when I saw the other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from apparently same event.

As one would go out the other would light up.  They were so bright that they lit up the entire valley like a full moon.  The light was similar to a HPS light, however the amount of lum output was more than I have ever seen.  At first we thought that they were flares, but then we soon realized that it was not possible for a flare to burn this bright for this duration.  The UFO&#39;s headed towards the Arrow Lakes only one was lit at this time.  As the UFO&#39;s got further away we started our snowmobiles.  As we reved our sleds the headlights of our sleds pulsed with higher amperage.  All of a sudden the other UFO lit up and both of the UFO&#39;s started to pulse like our snowmiobile lights.  The UFO&#39;s started to come closer, my partner did not like that and he turned his sled around and we went back to the Pass Creek Cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As they flew by, over my home, our lights turned off and our cars would not start and our radio&#39;s were buzzing for about 5 minutes after they were out of the vacinity. Being frightened by what we saw we called the police, they thougth we were pranksters, so we then decided to flee our homes in nimmitabel, and travel to sydney, to stay in a populated area with our families where we knew it would be safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He went in and got his digital movie camera with a 72 zoom we could see so much more. It was not a star or a plane, we captured it on video for over 20 minutes. I find it hard to describe and is best for anyone to see the tape. Then the next night we thought we would look in the same area, it wasn&#39;t quite dark but stars could be seen and there is was again right between the big dipper and the little dipper this time it let us see so much more, it changes shape from a dot to a huge ball, multicolored with greens, reds, blues and greys. This night it also change to a hour glass shaping with red (flame looking) all around it.My brothers camera allowed us to do a 360 zoom and what we saw was quite a show. You must see this video we have over 36 minutes on the second evening. Last night it stormed here so we saw nothing. In all my years I have never seen anything like this, years ago in Racheal Nevada I met a man by the name of Bob Lazar and thought he had some unusuall stories but this is caught on tape.

Three lights rapidly approached from the West in a triangle formation, at &#39;12 o&#39;clock low&#39;.  I watched them closely to make sure that I wasn&#39;t looking at birds or something else. I am inferring that the object between the lights was solid and triangular, because when the object banked North, the angular relationship between the lights was consistent with the banking of an aircraft - however this was no ordinary aircraft. It moved completely silently and covered half the horizon, that is from Surrey to the North Shore Mountains in about four seconds. I am guessing the altitude (based on watching approaching aircraft in the same airspace at 2000 - 3000 f, and the brightness of the lights of the object relative to the brightness of passing aircraft lights) at within 7000 feet. My gut feeling while watching this thing was that it could not be man-made; I was also admiring the technology that could create something with this kind of performance envelope. Amazing! I continued to watch the sky for about a half an hour afterwards; I noted that the flight path of the object was directly over the approach path to YVR, and that at 21:55 an aircraft approached through the same airspace. I tried to sketch this out on paper, but the sketch doesn&#39;t do justice to the way this thing banked and moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Text deleted--Source of report has considerable technical experience, and possesses some interest and experience in the field of UFO research.

It was a little after 9:30 pm when we came within 15 miles of the savannah exit on U.S. 80. I looked of to the left because I thought I saw a deer by the median. I began to slow down when I caught a glimpse of an object going behind the tree lines. I told my wife to put the video camera on nightshot and record the object.We had been to savannah the year before and saw alot of military aircraft. I thought this was one of them so I wanted to get it on camera. It looked like it was preparing to land from what I could tell. I noticed a clearing of the tree tops just ahead in it&#39;s path. When the craft got to the clearing, I realized this was no military craft. I was triangular in shape, black, very smooth texture,very areo dynamic. It&#39;s lights were not flashing as an airplane&#39;s landing lights would. I knew this thing wasn&#39;t a plane, it wasn&#39;t a steath bomber, I have seen those before.I rolled down the window and slowed down to see If I could hear the engine. I work at a major airport and I have heard many different engines. I heard nothing. Not a sound. We had a fully charged battery when we began our trip and there is pretty much nothing on the way there for us to record. I know we didn&#39;t waste the battery before this and my wife told me she got the object on camera.As soon as the craft dropped behind the tree line my wife told me the battery was going dead.When we got to our hotel room, I charged the camera. When I went to watch the event on tape, I couldn&#39;t find It anywhere on the tape. It went from just before I told my wife to put the camera on nightshot to well after the inncident,close to our exit. I don&#39;t know what I saw that night or what happened during the time we lost on camera. One thing I do know, Is that I want to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as someone who works around aircraft on a regular basis.  PD))<n>

I wonder what I saw??<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I can’t believe it’s me writing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night (April 7, 2004 from approximately 9:30 to 11:00 pm EST) I saw what I guess was a UFO. But it was not what I always thought of as a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the northwest sky there was an extremely bright, extremely white light so much so that it looked as you might expect a diamond would sparkle under a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times it also seemed to shift, for a second or so, to a slight reddish color and then back to white.  In size it was at least ten times that of the biggest star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now from here on in I’m not sure if what I saw was real or imagined. There seamed to be small dot shaped, orangish – reddish in color, “balls, disks” in the surrounding area of the light. They numbered perhaps eight or ten. I referred to them as dots because they were perfectly round as a dot and with no extending light beyond the actual shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw what appeared to be two of the dots move away at a fairly fast speed. The one followed the other in exact formation space and distance from the other. As they moved away a white light was added to the orangish/red color.  They continued moving away and finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point approximately 30 minutes after I first saw the light it dropped lower in the sky, just a little, the reason I noticed this was because it was now just slightly below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before going to bed, 11:00 pm, I went to take a last look and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

Our neighborhood is rather rural. The event we witnessed appeared in the lower southern sky (about 30 degrees from the horizon) at about sunset, traveling very quickly east to west, silent and very bright.

Almost nearly home, we noticed a fairly bright light on an object directly in front of us (North of our position.) At first, I dismissed it as a helicopter or a fixed wing airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 30 seconds of watching the object, what appeared to be the wing of the craft was illuminated by the bright singular light of the object. The &#34;wing&#34; appeared from our position that of an air plane in a hard bank. So the &#34;wing&#34; was straight up and down and was not hiding the large singular light, nor was it effecting the intensity of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, my wife called her mother and had her look from her location which was only a few blocks away north of our position. Useless for triangulation. She attempted to get her video camera set up, but was unable to do so during the short time span.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gauging distance would be difficult, but I would guess it would be no more than 5 miles away. There was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no wind whatsoever, yet the object looked as if it were drifting in a large circle, hung from a cable from high above. The object displayed no vertical movement. It appeared to keep the same altitude as it drifted to the West. At times it would stop making its pivoting circles, and hold in one location. From my position, it would appear as if the craft while drifting West would slow down, and head back East, then go back west. It would slow as it reached the edge of it&#39;s circular pivot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve used and seen many types of flares, and this was no flare. For one, if it was a flare, it didn&#39;t do a very good job at illuminating the ground. No smoke was seen near the object either. Plus, the lack of vertical movement makes me skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept wanting to think it was a hot air balloon dangling a light below it. That&#39;s the speed and impression the object gave me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no strobe lights that I could see. The single light was much brighter than the evening star which was present just to the West. The light was a dim redish color that tended to flicker slightly. The size of the light from my position was aprox. 10 times larger than the Evening star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object disapeared, the light simply went out as if you flipped a switch. This alone eliminates any type of commercial traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only theory is it could be ball lightning, some type of flare, unknown military or alien craft. We did have non-producing thunder storms in the area earlier in the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t explain the cable or the &#34;wing&#34; structure above the light either. That kind of eliminates ball lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me, I&#39;m a trained observer, and work security for the Federal Government at a local facility. I have an interest in aviation and military equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a &#34;UFO&#34; before, since I was always able to find a credible answer for whatever I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, during the event, it sounded as if a large number of people were outside looking at it. Also, I heard some tires screaching off in the distance. This object definately had peoples attention. We&#39;re used to low flying air craft up some fairly large commercial jets overhead since the International Laughlin Airport is aprox. 5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other aircraft were present in the area during the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may contact me through e-mail if you need any more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thats when I looked up at the sky and noticed what seemed to be a star moving.I have seen a shooting star before and I know that what I saw was not. I live in Miami and airplanes can be seen alot at night but this object was way to high to be an airplane. Like i said it appeared to be a moving star. I then stopped my cousin in the middle of the conversation and said &#34;a look in the sky and tell me what you see&#34;. At first he said i cant see anything then  I pointed him in the direction and his response was &#34;what the @#$%&#34;. We watched it move in the same direction and then it just stopped and vanished. We talked about it for a while after the sighting and we could not come to a conclusion to what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had the standard looking orange flame surrounding a red/black core. I called my mom out to watch with me. Within five minutes the object had dulled to a soft glow (our sunset is about 20:15 here now but the object was still highly visible). The light then completley extinguished and the object seemed to turn more nothernly, toward the Olympic Mountains. As it fell, dark black smoke trailed behind it. It wasn&#39;t falling quickly, like a shooting star, but as a &#34;regular&#34; plane would fly. We are just across the water from SEA-TAC international, and there is no way this was a &#34;regular&#34; plane. Besides the initial &#34;fireball&#39;s&#34; brightness and length, the turn it made was less of a &#34;plane circle&#34; and more of a direct shift in angle. The news didn&#39;treport anything about the flame or smoke, and no one has gotten back to me yet about the reason behind this sighting. I do know that besides SEA-TAC, Vashon is about 60 miles north of Fort Lewis Army Base and McChord Airforce Base. I do not mean to insinuate anything with either of these establishments, just more to give the reader a location idea. This is our first sighting on Vashon. Both my mom and I had an unrelated sighting about eight years ago in the Bitterroot Valley. I do not consider myself to be near an expert in any of this, this sighting however left both of us a little chilled so we thought others may have seen it too..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, enjoy your day!<n>

The light was stationary for several minutes and then got very bright and then slowly dimmed until it was not visible.  It never moved from the location where we first saw it.  I thought we had just witnessed a supernova.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I notice a bright yellow/white ball of light...at first I thought it was just a planet.  But it appeared too bright.  I carry a small pair of 10x25 binoculars with me at all times when I take walks...just for this kind of thing....I focus into it closer...it had no blinking lights...just a yellow/white ball with edges that made it look like Saturn on a tilt.  It was moving slowly Northwesterly over Phoenix.  The trees were getting in my way and I run further north to see it getting dimmer.  At some points it would almost fade out then get brighter...and as it would dim it would change from a reddish glow to a blue/green glow then back up to full yellow/white.  I watched for approx 20 mins til it slowly moved out of view.  It was not a helicopter, blimp or plane!!  I walked home as fast as I could to make this report<n>

As we looked through our binoculars, we observed that the flying object has differnt colors like red, blue, green, yellow and silver.  Three days before my uncle saw this flying object but he didn&#39;t bother to report it. They thought that it was only a star but it was different. It was not twinkling like a star. It only changes it&#39;s color every quarter of a second. We based it&#39;s movement from every other stars and it was faster and it moves to the east.  At 11:30 p.m., it was seen again at the south were it was seen at 10:00 p.m. I once red a book about this and the article said that most people that saw this U.F.O.&#39;s always says that they have never seen anything like this before and now I am one of them who is amazed to see this object and will always be watching the sky at night to report this object again if ever I see this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was when I was walking along Ocean Parkway in the direction of Avenue X from Avenue Z ,heading to the library on Avenue X, that I had my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to my left, I noticed a ,seemingly, toy-like object just above the row of houses. Yes, it was that low to the ground. I quickly realized that this was something very unusual. It was a pyramid-shaped metallic object that was rotating as it was ascending into the sky. When I tell people about it, I describe it as being a pyramid-shaped capsule and as being toy-like. I know it was metallic because the sunlight reflected off of it like sunlight would reflect off a shiny piece of metal. It didn&#39;t ascend straight up but actually ,maybe, at a 45 degree angle. The rotation or spin seemed to be somewhat slow but at a steady or consistent rate. Maybe less than a minute after first spotting it, it disappeared through the clouds and I could no longer see it. My current thought on it is that it was taking off ,maybe, from someones roof when I was seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to point out that this was in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon and in a main area. It was very busy was alot of traffic and people and there were planes in sky too. There were 2 people that were standing just a couple of feet in front of me ,while I had the sighting. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t say anything to them and I did wish ,afterward, that I had said something. But, there had to be other people who saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always tell people about it even though the reaction is not good. I made sure that I remembered the date which was on April 06, 2004. I tell people about how  this sighting was traumatizing to me because it ,momentarily, took me out of the reality I was in ,so to speak, and made me aware of another kind of existence. This existence being other-worldly. Being a man of scientific thought, I always try to analyze and understand what I saw. I believe that the object was in some kind of anti-gravity space and it was rotating to provide gravity ,inside of it, for its occupants. But, no matter how much I think about it I can&#39;t know how it&#39;s doing it. I could only watch in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just this past year, I came to a startling realization. It is quite possible that these pyramid-shaped objects were commonly seen back thousands of years ago and this could be what inspired the Egyptians and others to build the pyramids. This may be what ancient civilizations did to pay worship to these objects.<n>

The object seemed to be climbing at first than seemed to stall / perhaps even sliding backwards for a few seconds - then the object seemed to simply disolve in the air... The reason for looking up was the excess amount of air-traffic... This location is at Luke Air Force Base and it is usual to see a few fighter jets in the air... but on the 6th of April the traffic was excessive and the noise cause us to look up.  The object at first glance appeared to be at about 10,000 ft a extrememly bright shinny finish.  The fighter jets in the area all had a dark grey-black appearance. My first thought was that the object was a fighter climbing at a very steep angle but after ten seconds or so I remarked that -&#34; whatever he doing doesn&#39;t look right&#34; I thought it might be one of the fighters about to do a hammerhead stall - then the shape told me this is not a fighter.  It disappeared - as if it had vaporized...The fighter jets were at about 5,000 ft - not as high as the object. I didn&#39;t think to report this until today because I have just read about a Mexico City sighting on the Mar. 5th...<n>

I pointed it out to my fiance but it was gone before he could catch a glimpse of it.  I was expecting a big crash due to how low it was flying but it was there, and then gone.  We looked in the sky all over for it.  I thought I was going crazy and then did a research online about sightings of the same thing.  I know I&#39;m not insane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took out a magnifying glass to get a better image and it appeared to have a slight dome on the perfect dome with a protrusions below it. The photo is very clear, but we never saw the object before and during the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is the first time I have seen what I have heard.  I probally saw these objects in my back window of my house at least a dozen times. I watched for at least 10 minutes and they periodically came back into view.  They were very high up and I would say as high as planes usually fly, the one&#39;s with the smoke following them.  I think these were ufo&#39;s but I don&#39;t know.  At the most I saw three but I know their had to be more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object streaked down slowly in similar fashion to flares I&#39;ve seen in the northern Arizona desert, although it did not appear to be burning up like a fireball which eminates and emits an aural haze, it looked more uniform like a meteorite with a tail. The object was observed from 0-1 seconds for about 10 degrees when it disappeared for 2 seconds and reappeared at 3-6 seconds to the treetop horizon. I had a very good view of the object because I was obseving that exact part of the beautiful, clear evening sky at the time it appeared directly in my line of vision. The best way that I can describe the way in which it traveled was that it appeared to me as though it had been dropped. It&#39;s brightness was that of Jupiter, and it did not seem as though it burned up before it impacted or landed roughly 10 miles away. It&#39;s behavior seemed so unusual to us that we all immediately acknowledged it and joked that the aliens were landing in Leeds, Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are MJ- age 30, April- 24, Brandi- 20, Crystal- 18, co-workers who had stopped at April&#39;s house after work to visit, and we observed the object as we were leaving to take everyone home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If needed, as a digital imaging specialist and multimedia developer I can provide detailed longitudal bearing and locale via email using graphics or animation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

A triangle shaped craft was spotted by the three of us flying directly over our heads, approximately 100 feet above the palm trees by my driveway.  It appeared to be black, but very visible to the naked eye.  We saw what looked like 7 small circles on the bottom of this craft, one at the point, and three on each side.  This craft was so low, that we could make out the outer rings around these disks, which were concave in shape.  It flew directly over the top of us, not very fast, but not slow either.  It continued on for about 500 feet, ascended, and disappeared right in front of our eyes.  The thing that really struck us was three things....first of all, there were no lights of ANY kind on this craft, but we  could see it clearly, as if the city lights reflected off the bottom, kind of luminescent.  The second is that for it flying so low, there was not a single air current in its wake in the tops of the palm trees, like a copter or plane would generate.  Lastly, but most importantly, it made ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND!  No engine noise, no wind, nothing.  What is really strange is that we live literally in the Marine Corp Air Staion&#39;s back yard...something flying as low as this craft was would never be seen on their radar. We see military and civilian crafts all day and night, because we also live right next to the airport.  This was like nothing we have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved around in a circular pattern. Then it disapeard in less than a minute.  I live in downtown Miami in an 18th floor apartment and have seen lots of airplanes and helicopters flying around. This was not one of those.  Being someone who has not really thought much about UFO&#39;s I thought maybe it might a Turkey Vulture flying around.  But I don&#39;t think they fly at night being that they Scavenge for food during the daytime and by this time of year they are heading back up north as the weather warms.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up, saw some lights, it was a craft of some kind, so I quickly thought to myself, then grabbed my camcorder that happened to be on my front seat,inside the truck. From this point on I have on video, its not the best, I tried to zoom in and out, and the camera didnt like that in darkness. But it will be worth the wait, if I am still alive. :-)  Its 8pm, and total darkness, a couple of street lights in yellow, the moon has not come up yet, when it does its a full moon. I look and see this craft has 3 lights, one in the center flashing, its a triangle shape and coming towards me over the homes, I follow it with the camera until it gets to the end of the street. Once it got to the end, I noticed at the end of the street another of its kind was coming the opposite way traveling towards us, the two met at the end of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This other craft was flashing a white light and had stationary lights surrounding it just like the one I saw up close. I got into my truck to go look for them, but they had gone, so I thought. I took a left onto the other road, and shortly turned back. As I turned right back onto my street, I looked over to the left, and above the old town pool and park area, I saw both both of them, hovering, semi, almost fully cloked. I dont know how to spell cloked term from Star Trek so I am typing &#34;cloked&#34;. Hopefully someone can let me know the correct spelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they were hovering the other caught my eye, the other wasnt all the way cloked, its hard to explain, but to the right of the craft, it was lit up, just a little, its lights were lower, then stronger, it was doing something while the other stayed stationary to its left. finally the light went out, and both of them were straight ahead looking at me, cloked, each of the craft had one little light at each end, as if it was  a distant star far off, the lights were on each side, with a certain distance apart, the other craft had the same lights barely visable, only this second craft hovered just a little distance from the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It getting real cold, so I talked out loud to these things, because at this point I am wondering if I made this whole thing up in my head!, as I am leaving, the one on the left crossed over to the right, then towards me, as I turn around and go towards my truck, it starts to follow on my right and contunes to move as I am walking, I get inside my truck as it leaves, still cloked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to record this for myself, but I should describe what I saw, because you cant see the video yet. This craft that I filmed was a smaller craft, a little smaller than a small airplane, it had three lights, one in the center, the 4th, was flashing also a white light, and it seemed, well once you see the video, it seemed that the flashing light was also being beamed out towards the other side. The craft went at a good pace, it traveled with one light as a leading part of the craft while the other two lights were on the sides. There was no sound, I was ruffly 35 yards away. Just across the street. In the video, it goes behind telephone poles, wires from cable and phone lines. This craft then met up with another that was coming from the opposite side towards it. I hope this was clear, any other info I can add if you need.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I copyright the video, you will see exactly what I saw. Hopefully someone wont come and kill me for the tape in the meantime. LOL  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It was a orange/red fiery looking object glowing really bright blue and it was hanging in the sky for a moment and then it fell straight down for about 15 seconds and dissapeared.  I saw it for long enough to realize it was nothing I had ever seen before.  There was an airplane in the same part of the sky at the time, it couldn&#39;t have gone unnoticed to those aboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am giving you this information so those of you who live or know New Jersey know exactly where I viewed this event from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was eyeballing the sky, off towards my left, in the direction of South Plainfield, and this object may have been further off than that in fact. Now, I am 32 years old, have been a skywatcher (day and night skies) for all of my life and have been driving an automobile for over 14 years as well. I have 20/20 vision and can identify and spot the difference between a small plane, a jet liner, a helicopter and a satelite. In fact, I have performed formal research in the field in UFOlogy as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I first thought was a jet plane, taking a North by North East flight path and which I was waiting for to hook towards the vicinity of Newark International Airport never did. I first thought this was a plane and although it was slowly becoming a clear blue sky at 11:45AM, with some very high level clouds, scattered and disapating as the day wore on. I also gussed that this plane still had its headlights on and what I was seeing was one of two things, lens flare or reflection of the sun off the planes exterior. Neither was to be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was more of a sphere type ball of light and was more orange in color than it was yellow or light. This is what caught my attention most. Second, instead of the object banking left (it&#39;s left, my right as I assumed it was heading in my direction), it proceed to accelerate upwards into some high level clouds and then out of site rather quickly  I am submitting this hopes that others in the area who may have also seen this thing can have some validation that others saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you in advance, John<n>

It didn&#39;t look mechanical, more like some kind of animal. It did not have extended wings like a bird of any kind, but seemed to have some sort of stubby wings which were part of the body, like a flying squirl or some type of bat. They protruded out near the head, &amp; tapered back to a point at the rear. The creature appeared to be around 3 ft. from head to tail, &amp; a little over 2 ft. wide at the shoulders. It was moving very fast in a straight line at an altitude of approx. 150 ft. I saw no method of propulsion such as wing movement. It just seemed to be gliding, but at a high rate of speed. It maintained level flight moving west where I eventually lost sight of it. Other details were a light brown color along the sides of the wings, like skin, with a dark body color, possibly dark brown or black.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing outside when I saw what I think was a fuzzy circle, maybe a spherical object. I couldn&#39;t tell, the sun hadn&#39;t come all the way up but I can say this, the sound I will never forget.  It was the sound of a tornado siren in the distance.  I was scared, I rushed inside to tell my family and when they came out it, it was bigger then ever.  The sound was like a train coming straight for us.  At least 5 minutes passed and then it just vanished.  Out of my eyes it was gone.  I am going to keep everyone updated on this if I see it again.  I&#39;m going to try to get it on the news and hopefully more people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m a 38 year old Army veteran,I have seen the vast majority of the US aircraft out today and know their flight capabilities. Anyway, I was on my way to work on that day In April, when I topped the hill and slowed for the stop light.  I saw brilliant bluish green ball of light off to my right ,my heart jumped a second or two And I came to a complete stop rolled the window down to make sure It wasn&#39;t a reflection off the pole lights In the parking lot next to the Intersection. so I just sat there for a good 44 seconds looking at this object It made no noise it was about 80 feet off the ground and about 400 ft away maybe the size of a small compact car. hard to tell In the dark, all I had was the dark starlit sky as background, and then It just went up in a swooping ark and was gone In the blink of an eye. Thats all the proof I need Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

The objects were not seen through the LX200 but with eye only. They were orange in colour at a height of a high flying aircraft, between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. They were traveling side by side at an in determinate distance away from each other, (possably 200 to 500 feet. estimated guess only) They did not display any lights but the entire craft exterior glowed in a vibrant, almost luminessant sorange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> they moved in a westery direction accross the night sky, originating in the area of Ursa Major, at a relativly slow speed for about 3 minits. then they both stopped and appeared to honer in the same spot for at least 1 more minit + and then appeared to shoot directly up to leave the atmosphere in a approximately 70 degree angle in an in determinate speed... they were amazingly fast...leaving 2 streaks of light accross the sky(1 from each craft). these were the only trails of light left behind and only stayed there for a very short second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an astromomer i know the difference between a satellite, aircraft, shooting star, meteor, star, planet etc. These objects what ever they were, were obviously under an inteligent influance as there movements were un natural. They could in no way be a craft, probe or other devic of this world as the speed in which they travelled accross the sky no human could stand in a piloted craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A passenger plane was in a relative possition to have possably seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the object left the atmosphere or dissapeared from sight, 2 high powered jets flew over at a high altitude and headed towards the rough area of my last visual sighting of the objecs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it could have been picked up by radar, then east midlands airport, only 10 miles from my location would have picked it up at some point.<n>

Another couple that went with us, were driving behind us, and we pulled over told them we had to go back, go on ahead to Cleveland, we will see them the next day. On the way back I was in the passenger seat, and happened to look at this bright low star, or so I thought. It caught my eye, because it was so bright, yet so low. Never thought anymore about it. We made it to the resturant, then headed back home. Now my husband, was driving, and he said wow what is that, here he noticed the light, because it was now on his side of the road. I told him I noticed it on the way back to the resturant. We pulled off the road, in a spot where we saw radio towers, just to compare it. It was as high as the towers, brighter then the towers, and the sky was clear, with a full moon. The towers had to be about five miles from us, and we could see the frame of the towers, but no frame on the bright light. The light slowly moved to the other side of the towers, and it grew lighter then darker, in brightness. So we assumed it was a plane. We got back on the road, and continued on, but pulled off the road again,because it had moved now behind us. At that point we called our son in Columbia Station, Ohio. He went outside, and could see it also, and this was 80 + miles away. We told him to get his camera, and get a picture. Then we called my sister-in-law, in Elyria, Ohio, she went outside with my niece, with binoculars, the saw it, and said it had lights like a blooming flower, with rays off of it, and it twisted and turned. My son called us back saying he could not get the camera to keep it in focus for the shot, now at that time we pulled off the road agin to get our pictures with my cell phone. After I took two shots. We all saw it dissappear. No light at all. We were all amazed. Then it reappeared. At that point I took a total of four pi! ctures with my cell phone, all have an accual star in the sky and this light. We called the New Philidelphia police, they said they would investigate it. The cell phone my husband used to call 911, went out of emergency mode, finnaly, and he called my son back, and he was taling about it being a possible ufo, his phone went to a loud static, and and he kept loosing signal, but my cell phone was fine, that just added more to our thoughts. We called Channel 5 news in Cleveland, Ohio, to see if there were any reports. No one belived us. We then called the other couple that was first driving behind us, and they also saw it, but they noticed it only because they saw a bright light shooting off it, thinking it was lightening, they watched it for awhile, because of the lowness of it, and knew it was not a plane, but didnt think much of it till we told them how we watched it for 45 min. I have a total of 4 pictures. In one it shows two lights, but all the rest show one light. I believe in my heart out of 7 people in different areas, we all saw a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I can be sure of the time because the news had just started on the television and it was time to let my Irish setter outside to do his job. One thing I want to point out here, is that my wife and I live just south of South Bend, Indiana city limits and We have a completely unabstructed veiw of the horrizon to the south. I had no sooner hooked the dog chain up, when my Irish Setter lunged out the door and started barking up in the air at an object flying over our backyard and off into the distance. I stood tranfixed on the sight.  The object was a bright orange-red color like somthing on fire but with no actual flames or tail coming from it. It appeared to be a sphirical shape. It made no sound at all. The object was not falling to the ground, but rather on a level flight path. The night ski was pretty much clear that night. Judging the size would be to much of a guess but if I were being pressed, I would say that it had to be nearly 150 feet or more in diamiter and seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. The object took a direct path due south. I stood outside on my back porch and watched the object until I could no longer see it beyond the horizon. The whole episode took maybe 15 seconds. I see airplanes and gliders and such all the time out my backyard view and I can tell you that this was non of these. I am a well known Business owner in the community and well respected. I am a Buddhist LAma, I have several Degrees and am not prone to flights of fancy. If the truth be known, I would have just forgot about this, but after seeing other reports a few weeks later in the same area, I thought that this should be reported to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I would like to add, that 25 years ago while driving south toward Odessa texas, I and at least 5 other drivers saw this EXACT SAME OBJECT FLY OVER US. aT LEAST FIVE OTHER CARS AND TRUCTS ALL PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT TO ASK IF WE HAD ALL JUST SEEN THAT OBJECT. AGAIN, THIS SEEMS TO BE THE EXACT SAME OBJECT THAT I SAW ON APRIL 4TH 2004.)<n>

At first I thought it was a plane but the dot&#39;s red color didn&#39;t seem to flash, it retained it&#39;s colour perfectly as it flew. It was when it started going back and forth as it flew west that i knew it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter. It was fairly low on the horizon so it was far yet it sped back and forth FAST. The speed and manuverability of it stunned me. Then when I knew this thing wasn&#39;t explainable, another two red dots flying in formation quickly joined up with the first and they all sank below my line of sight because trees were in the way. I hopped out of the tub and ran to where I could see, but they were too far. All of this happened in around 6 seconds...these little dots were moving way too fast for any vehicle I know of.

The nearly full moon was in the sky at the time.  The light was bright white much like venus, no yellow tint like an aircraft.  The light was not flashing.  The light also extinguished quickly, usually satellites fade out as they near the horizon.  Maybe it was the space station?<n>

At around 1:00, a group of lights came from the southwest and passed directly over us going into the northeast.  There were about eight lights arranged into a sort of triangular shape, although it may have been more of an X.  It was hard to tell exactly because the lights were spinning around.  Whatever it was was moving pretty fast because it only took about 6 seconds to cross the sky.  In this time, it made at least 3 rotations tumbling across the sky in a straight line.  I guess it&#39;s possible that it was more than one object and that all the lights were separate, but they were moving as if they were part of the same object. From our point of view, it was hard to tell how high it was, and so also we couldn&#39;t tell how big it was, but it was about 10 degrees across (the length of your fist at arms length)  After seeing this thing, we were both pretty jumpy and left.  After telling a friend what we had seen, they told us that another friend of ours saw something odd also.  Talking with them, it seems we saw the same thing.  they saw it from the side, from the 11th floor of their building, they had a better judgement of its height, and said it was really low in the sky.  If it was low, it was probably about 75-100 feet in length.  I&#39;m not the type of person to believe that this was some sort of extraterrestrial ship or anything, I just want to post this to see if anybody else saw it also and if anyone has an explination.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It happened about an hour ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos of the marks on the man&#39;s body can be found at:  Also, last night my brother had new marks on his back. Pictures attached, as well as a mark or scar behind his left ear. He has NO memory of getting them. No nausea, no pain, he was looking in the mirror when he noticed them. They&#39;re are more on his back now. If you compare the pictures I sent you before, you will see the difference. I don&#39;t know why they would focus on my brother&#39;s spine, but he was in a motor bike accident when he was sixteen. He is now 22 this month. He swerved to avoid a dog and hit a tree. He wasn&#39;t wearing his helmet and ended up in a coma for two months. He has mobility in his left leg, but not much control over it. His left hand still spasms. He had nerve damage. He walks with a pronounced limp. I wonder what they are doing to him. It is frustrating! He says that he doesn&#39;t mind if you use his pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

The full moon was up and to my right.  From my left (south) a large bluish white light flew over me, no more than a football field or two above.  It flew across the moon and kept going rather sedately.  It seemed to sway to its left and then to its right as it moved to the north.  Object was in sight for over three minutes.  Other aircraft (definitely planes with FAA mandated blinking lights) could be seen to the east of the object.  They were flying much higher than the object.  It gave me goose pimples and a feeling of excitement while I watched it.  It was beautiful!  There was no sound from the object, but it seemed to be hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/3/04 18:45|Pinellas Park|FL|Changing|5 minutes|Glowing object at sunset|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36060.html|365|ndxe200404| Glowing object at sunset<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left work in Brandon, Florida at about 18:00 hours on 4/3/04 to head home. The weather was cool, and the sky was blue and cloudless. As I got into my truck, I noticed the moon had just risen in the east and was just above the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I headed west on Interstate 4, then to Interstate 275 which crosses Tampa Bay on the Howard Franklin Bridge. There was an airshow at MacDill AFB that day so I kept glancing to my left (south of the bridge) to see if I could see any interesting aircraft. (To give you some background, I&#39;m 39 years old and have grown up on or around military bases my whole life. My father and ex-husband were both in the USAF and my daughter is now in the USAF. I know many USAF planes by sight and sound.) I was disappointed to see that the only thing in the sky was what looked like a commercial jet from the Tampa Airport, along with it&#39;s contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued west, enjoying the beautiful sunset. After the bridge, the interstate takes a southern curve so I was out of the sight of the sunset for a few minutes until I headed due west again on the 118th Avenue exit. The sun was not yet touching the horizon when I saw what I first thought was Venus, since it was in the same location that I usually see Venus around 9pm or so. However, this was NOT Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very pure white, oval shaped object about 1/2 the size of 1/2 of a full moon. It looked to be over the Gulf of Mexico. It seemed very high in the sky and did not move, it just glowed. At this point I pulled over on the side of the road so I could watch it uninterrupted. As the sun lowered, the object went from an oval to more of a triangle with softened corners. As the last of the sun went below the horizon, the object faded away right before my eyes. Could it be the reflection of something?<n>
4/3/04 11:45|Alcalde|NM|Disk|55 minutes +|Daylight disk near Alcalde, NM|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37405.html|366|ndxe200404| Daylight disk near Alcalde, NM<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following report was originally reported to MUFON on the day of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ------------------------------------  I was traveling back to Taos at around 11:40am MT, going north on NM 68 after having been in Santa Fe to get my cell phone serviced.   It was raining on and off and there were large patches of storm clouds intermixed with clearings and breaks in the clouds.  Sometimes everything was soft and greyish and sometimes parts of the landscape and sky were in full light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere between Espanola and Velarde, NM and just north of Alcalde, NM, I noticed a very steady solid white shape moving swiftly and smoothly in a southerly direction (parallel to the highway in the opposite direction of my travel).  Its altitude and speed at this time did not fluctuate.  It made its way from my northwest at roughly 20 degrees to slighty south of my due west (perpendicular to the highway) in a fairly short period of time.  If I had to guess I&#39;d say it covered between 1/2 and 1 mile in no more than 10 seconds.  I traded between watching the object and watching the road, trying to determine a shape and wether it would be worth stopping the car.   I was looking for the tell-tale signs of a small engine plane or large bird and could distinguish no features, other than an ellipse seen at a subtle angle.    Then it slowed dramatically, almost to a stop, and started dropping in altitude,  It was at this time that my curiosity was high enough to stop the car.  This is only the second time I have ever done something like this.  The first time I was able to quickly determine that what I was seeing was a large shaped balloon on a tether.  This sighting lasted almost an hour with no satisfying explaination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I crossed the 4-lane highway (2 lanes in each direction separated by a land divider somewhat excitedly because its shape was still elusive, and now its movement quickly ruled out a lot of possibilities. It was about 11:45am when I started watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed in the same general area for a very very long time, changing altitude in a range as high as 20 degrees (no higher than the high mountain line in this area) and as low as possibly landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, I never saw it leave.   I left only when I became convinced that it was not going to come close enough to me to get a good photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 55 minutes I observed it, it exhibited the following behaviors: First it behaved like a bee hovering over flowers, except with less erratic motion and a bit slower.  It would dip down low enough to make the mountains and hills behind it a backdrop, making the white ellipsoidal shape pop out pretty clear in spite of the light raininess.  It moved smoothly, but not perfectly smooth.  Accellerations to the left, right, higher or lower, and to and fro, were not always at the same rate, but within a range that suggested it was not at the mercy of the wind.   It was also clear that its angle would change.  There would be &#34;flashes&#34; of white as its &#34;top&#34; surface area either reflected light or simply showed more of its white coloration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, it came VERY low.  In fact, it dipped between an earthy slope and some trees in the relative foreground that couldn&#39;t have been more than 1/4 mile from the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was behind the trees, it seemed to make its closest approach to me.  I could see its white peeking out from spaces within the trees and it appeared relatively much larger.  Then I didn&#39;t see it for a while.  But my eyes were locked on to the spot I last saw it, hoping for it to show again.  Then after some time I saw it move horizontally south as if it were a white van driving on a road behind the trees, only it lifted and appeared to move back away toward the mountains again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made this low approach twice, and when it did, it reappeared from the very same location some time later.  I suspect it could have actually landed, or just hovered lower than I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it rose it often stayed along the very edge where the mountain met the sky, and was just a few shades lighter than the clouds there, and about as bright as the brightest point in the sky where the sun threatened to break through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very excited.  I have never stopped to look at something like this for such an extended period of time with such focus.  I didn&#39;t try waving down any cars nor did I care to fetch my camera right away for fear this would be short-lived.   Once I got a sense it was restricting its range and was going to stick around, I went to fetch my Canon digital Elph.  I wasn&#39;t expecting to get anything more compelling than the movement I just described, but thought it was sort of obligitory to try.  At the very least the photo gives place and possible distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still perplexed.  I am considering going back down tomorrow to see if anyone from any of the local farms saw it (or was somehow responsible for it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of my theories failed under at least one of the observed behaviors.  I considered that it could be:  A prop plane - prop planes can&#39;t hover A model plane - can&#39;t hover A helicopter - no sound or discernable movement of vegetation as it neared the trees.  rises in altitide too abrupt at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A model helicopter - if so, it was very fast, very large, very quiet, and had a range approaching 1 mile at first A large bird - It would have had to be very very large for a bird, and then again it&#39;s general shape never changed, and it&#39;s movement was not very birdlike A piece of detritus - it was windy out, and things stay up a long time in the wind, but it&#39;s initial movement was steady as a rock in altitude and shape.  Highly unlikey that the wind was controlling this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before I gave up, it went to a dark tone, as if it had gone from reflecting light to silhouette.  It&#39;s behavior and general flight range remained the same though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first &#34;daylight disk&#34; I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 37 year old graphic designer and web developer by trade.  I telecommute from Taos for a NYC-based company.  I consider myself an excellent observer, which was developed in the practice of art-making for the better part of 26 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As my daughter and I were driving home, my daughter looked off to the North and said &#34;What is that&#34;? There it was again, even lower in the sky, and moving. So I started to follow it NorthWest, but we lost it. We wondered if it could have been a small aircraft that had to make an emergency landing. Nothing was ever reported about a aircraft landing in the area. It was very low, and very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thats what I thought until....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approaching a gate to secure where I work, I drove towards it on the road where trees cover both side of road. As I put the vehicle in park to exit it. I seen a fireball type falling star, which started above me out of view but I happened to catch it once in it came over the vehicle and in view through the windshield. It followed the line of the road directly overhead. I thought I was watching a shooting start. It was blue in color and left a nice long blue tail as it streak down the sky. I would almost describe as a typical falling start, fireball blue with blue tail. I wasn&#39;t surprised at all since I have seen many fireballs over the years. I even began making a wish when out of my amazement the falling star had stopped falling and actually shot horizontily across the sky. When first observed, it was approx 90degrees overhead (directly overhead, very high like a typical shooting star)traveling from north to south. I was facing south with my vehicle. Apporx right in front of me (south) at about 30 degrees ahead of me the object shot due east and out of sight over the tree line. It never stopped but moved continusely. Like I said I was making a wish like you typically due when you see a shooting star and as I was near the end of my wish is when this star? just shot east. I am very confused as what I saw and never have seen anything like this before. I know what time it was exactly because the gate was supposed to be closed at a certain time. The duration of this lasted about 4-7seconds. I never heard anyhting but the crickets in the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/2/04 20:00|Lamar|CO|Disk|5-10 sec|First let me say I am a police officer in the Metro-Denver area and have been for 26 yrs. My wife and I were at John Martin State Park.|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36048.html|374|ndxe200404| First let me say I am a police officer in the Metro-Denver area and have been for 26 yrs. My wife and I were at John Martin State Park. There had been a drowning the previous week and portions of the lake were closed off since the Park Rangers had not recovered the body of a 17yr that had drowned. There was alot of government activity at this time from state,federal, and county personnel. The navy had flown in a special sonar to try help locate the body of the victim. The incident that was witnessed by my wife and I took place on a camp ground called Point Overlook. We were in our RV and were the only ones at the campgound excluding a Park Ranger in a vehicle approximately 2miles away. We were approximately 300 hundred feet from the lake and approximately 30 feet above the water on a bluff overlooking the lake, hence the name of the campground. My wife had just retired to the bed and I was in the process of securing the RV as we planned to get up early and go fishing. This a lake with approximately 3500 acres of surface water and a fairly large concrete dam. This lake is approximately 8 miles long and 1 mile wide. We were camped approximatley 4miles from the dam. I first saw a bright light comming from the dam heading west. I initially thought it might be a helo looking for the drowning victim as early in the day the authorities had used an airplane and dive teams. This light came closer it became apparent that it was not a single light but six lights strung together. The first was white with the succeeding lights red blue red blue and amaber at the end. It appeared that the lights were connected by some sort of stucture. I estimate the length of these lights to be 600 feet in length. I yelled at my wife to get up. She did in time to see the lights stop directly perpendicular to our RV. The lights were directly over the lake, altitude approximatley 500ft distance to object was 500ft. The lights stopped and rotated. I was in the process of getting the camera and bicnoculars and wife was w! atching the lights. I did not seet the lights stop and rotate she did. She states that when the craft rotated she could clearly see that it was a craft disk in shape with a dome stucture on top. She also stated that what we thought were lights were windows with lumanting lights from inside the craft. By the time I turned around the craft &#34;winked&#34; out. That is the best description I can give for its rapid disappearance. The whole thing lasted no more than 5-10 seconds for me.  I had an opportunity to talk to the Park Ranger that was 2 miles away the next morning and she asked me if I saw anything unusal. I told her and asked her if she saw anything. She said that in the past week they all have seen stange lights in and aroung the lake. She also said that they talk amoung themselves but that supervision frowned on making any offical report.

I arrive at Barrington Shores off blue star highway in south haven Michigan. I have lived here for 3 years during the summer and this night was unique. This housing development was slow underway so sometimes I take drives there and park at the end of the drive to relax, call friends exedra. I am a 20 year old. I am a firm believer in what is unexplained and what shall soon be explained. The night began talking on the phone to a significant other from flint who as also taken part in this via phone. No more then 3 – 4 minutes into an in depth conversation I take a minute to appreciate everything around me. I have experienced things like this before where I have seen objects move in unworldly directions at undisclosed speeds. Through out the phone conversation I look strait ahead, taking note of an abnormally bright light. At this time I think absolutely nothing of this and continue my phone call. As I continue to look around I see that this light can be associated with celestial objects in the sky around me. I.E. the moon, &amp; stars. Not only is the object I am looking at extremely close to the water, it seams extremely distant. Ignoring my self and thoughts based on things I have seen before I continue on. Its now 12:06, the clock is extremely bright in my car and clearly readable. The object proceeds to dart left, and down back around in a circular motion, continues back up to the general area it had started at and then moves right a significant distance. My jaw hits the floor, everything goes pretty cold. I dropped my phone, and I can hear Jenny in the distance babbling on continuously through the Nextel. I reached down picked up my phone and attempted to explain what I had just saw. By 12:08 the conversation has become pretty dramatic as the object moves at extreme speeds in a continual circular motion I decide its time for me to leave…Considering everything that just happened I call my mother who lives not far, I remember being at the end of the drive at Barrington Shore! s and it being 12:12 I told her what happened, what I had seen. She wants me to come get her and take her there, I agree to, when we returned 10-12 minutes later the object is no where in sight. If anyone else saw this that night please email me, ((e-address deleted)) Thankyou!<n>

They looked just like stars. Then I watched 1 of them move very fast East in the sky from Orion&#39;s belt. I then stopped in another spot and stayed there. The other 2 just stayed where they were and moved everyonce in a while not to far, but enough to watch them move. They moved like nothing I have ever seen. The one that moved to the East moved very fast like a fighter jet, but then made very sudden moves in circles, and up and down. Then it stopped and has remained there since I was last outside. This is the 3rd time this week I have seen this. They also seem to emit something. I can see streaks of light, that are dim, around them. There is always 3 and they are never together, or in the same place. When they aren&#39;t flying around they stay pretty motionless, moving from time to time, but they have strobe lights on them. Atleast it looks like strobes. Everytime I see them I come inside and get my wife. So she has seen them also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/1/04 23:55|Haysboro (Canada)|AB|Light|5 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A yellow white light with pulsing red light.|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35954.html|378|ndxe200404| Calgary, I saw something towards the west at 11:55 p.m. Thursday. I watched it thinking its only a star, then it moved one way then back again. It looked kind of like a yellow white light with pulsing red light. Two planes flew past, this was weird because the light didn&#39;t move at first, then after the second plane flew by, it moved away slowly. I live in Haysboro Southwest part of Calgary, looking west is where I saw this. It&#39;s a very cool evening. I hope someone else saw this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information Below:  The witness observed the light for approximately 5 minutes before losing sight of it. I also was playing a cat and mouse game, hide behind a tree branch, and see if it moves, and yes it did. Now as for the lights probing, moving back and forth, its kind of hard to see between the branches and my binoculars aren&#39;t that great for distance. I would estimate the object&#39;s altitude was as high as the two planes as they were flying into the city. I did not hear any sound coming from the object but did hear the sound of the planes that flew over. It was about the size of a pea/dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other witnesses to the sighting, only myself. I went out side to see why there was so many lights in our alley. Some kids decided to spray paint their initials on the side of our garage last night and I thought they were back. So I went on to the porch to have a look. I saw the moon and I decided to take a picture of it. Then I looked at all the stars in the sky when I noticed that one was was sitting there as the first plane flew by, then it moved. I grabbed my binoculars to have a closer look and then it moved again. I played this game you close one eye, see what happens, it moved further west and then north. The red light kept pulsing and I noticed it turning and then it stopped. I wanted to go chase it, but thought it would disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second plane flew by, it left heading west by north. The first plane looked like a normal commercial airline, the second plane I paid no attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry that&#39;s about all I can tell you, I hope someone else saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

These lights were arranged in a row and were clearly seen high enough over the horizon to know it was not a boat or anything like that.  They would flash in intermitent patterns, sometimes one would flash at a time or all three at once, they would even flash in sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After noting this for about ten minutes we noticed something else.  At about a 50 degree angle to the south, about five miles form were at we noticed a distinct blue light floating motionless in the sky.  After about one minute this light split into two lights.  These started floating apart in a spiral trajectory moving clockwise.  Once they were somewhat far from each other one flew off at high speed towards the east while the other one started to look as if it was coming closer to our location.  After the second light was out of sight we heard the roaring of two jet aircraft come from the southeast and the second light quickly flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a dark and somewhat cloudy night. At a red light at the intersection of US Highway 90 and Market Street we saw a massive object outline above us. Stopped at the red light I got out of the vehicle to look up at what seemed to be a hovering object in almost the exact shape of a Stealth Bomber. All that was clearly visible was an outline (by moon light)of the back in and most of the sides, but not so much the nose. It was not moving and seemed to be very large but very high in the air. I’ve never seen reports of such UFOs and lack the knowledge of the capabilities of Stealth Bombers but I believe this was different. I’ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Also a link to the March 31, 2004 sighting is included in this new report below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I saw the exact same thing over downtown St Paul last night heading south around 8:30 PM.  We believe it was a flock of geese flying at a high elevation that were catching the last rays of sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information Below:  We live in a high rise in downtown St Paul, Minnesota, so I believe we have a different vantage point from which to view the phenomena than someone on the ground would have.  At approximately 8:30 PM on Thursday we went out on our balcony to have a cigarette.  The sun had set and it was fairly dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife noticed the flying &#34;V&#34; formation heading due south.  The sight was identical to the picture you posted on Rense.com. or here at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1150  She pointed it out to me and we stared at it.  Our initial thought was that it was a UFO.  But as we observed for about three minutes we noticed that the formation metamorphised into a sloppy looking &#34;W&#34;.  Then we saw a piece of it break off and go to the other side forming a lopsided &#34;V&#34; formation again. There was a cloud formation to the southeast that was slightly illuminated on the top as well.  Both the formation and the cloud to the southeast faded out simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a large Canadian goose population around here.  Typically we can see flocks flying south near the end of the evening.  Based on our observation we thought that the &#34;V&#34; was a flock of geese flying at a higher than normal elevation and they were catching the last rays of light on their underbellies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, we could be wrong.  I have seen unexplained sights in the sky before but this was the first time I had ever seen an illuminated flying &#34;V&#34;.  In this particular instance though, I think that the sight we saw probably had a natural explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may very well be that what you observed portrayed different characteristics and was not the same phenomenon we observed.  I wish you luck in solving the mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n>

It was nice today, so we had the sliding glass door open. It was a cool, clear night. My youngest son who is 17 was in the kitchen and I was in the office on the computer (I am 48, and a housewife)and I suddenly heard my husband hollar at me.  He told me to look outside. My youngest son and I ran out onto the back porch, and my other son who just had gotten out of the shower (21, two years of college, works at Costco)also came out to see what was the matter. My husband told us to look at that bright light in the sky that was moving north at a high rate of speed.  We watched it and then it turned back south. My youngest son went and got our binoculars and we all took turns looking at it. Suddenly it stopped and then went straight up into the sky towards the moon. I was looking into the binoculars at that time, and as it was almost to the moon, my husband and both sons yelled out,&#34;There is another one!&#34; As I was looking at the first object which was going straight toward the moon, out of the left came the second one straight toward the first one.  I watched them as their paths crossed. They were both just bright objects like a star, but my husband said for us to be able to see them so clearly at such a far distance, they had to be huge. The second one continued to the South and we lost sight of it quit quickly, but the first one came back from behind the moon and turned back toward us and then went in a NW direction.  We watched it for a couple more minutes and then lost sight of it. My oldest son, when he was looking at it through the binoculars, described it&#39;s movement like a worm, and so did my youngest, although he wasn&#39;t sure if it was because he was shaking! Needless to say, we are now believers in UFOS.  My husband has always been, I thought I saw one once, but never really believed to much that they existed, but after seeing what we saw tonight, we all do. If I hadn&#39;t seen the second one, I might! have thought it was a satallite, but like my husband said, it was going way to fast to be one, and it wasn&#39;t going in one direction.  When that second one showed up, it was just too much. The sad thing is is that it happened on April 1, and no one will believe us. We called our daughter in Seattle, and she kept saying April Fools, I don&#39;t know if she yet believes us! But we know what we saw, and it was for real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend came to pick me up from work because she was coming out to orange county to stay with me for a while so we left her car at my work parking lot, we got into my car and preceded to head south bound on azusa ave in the covina/azusa area. We were driving in the left lane on azusa heading toward the 10 freeway maybe about 1-2 miles from the freeway. I looked up and saw a silver, perfect orb in the sky. I could tell it was metallic and not plastic such as a balloon because of the reflection of the sun on its right side. The orb or sphere did not move and i cannot tell if it was spinning because it was pretty much a perfect looking circle in my vision. I look down at the road and my spedometer, I looked up at the spehre again, i would say it must have been between 200-300 feet above the surface and maybe 10-15 feet in diameter. I asked my friend if she saw the spehere i was looking at and she kind of non caringly said yeah i see it. She acknowledged it being there so I knew my eyes were not playing tricks on me. I continued down azusa ave and moved into the left lane as i approached the freeway, I pass by a couple of trees on the sidewalk and as i past 1 tree I saw the object inbetween the gap before the second tree. After I passed the second tree it disapeared. I have not thought much about it since, and have had no other UFO experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was a black object above the residential area across the parking lot and across the street.  It was very large, it seemed as big as a house.  &#34;What is that?&#34; I said.  ((name deleted)) looked, but couldn&#39;t identify it either.  It made no sound, had no lights, and was turning in it&#39;s orientation very slowly and changing shape as it hovered about 500 feet above the residential area at a distance of about a half a mile.  It was impossible to make out any features, it just looked like a black lump with a flat underside.  Sacramento is littered with aircraft and I&#39;ve flown myself.  There were no lift planes, no engines, nothing that could be identified with any type of aircraft, and it was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told ((name deleted)) to go inside and get the sheriff, but he had already left and another coworker came out to see what she was talking about.  Two men who had also been watching the object from our parking lot came drove up to us adsking, &#34;what is that thing?&#34;  At the same time on of our clients and her children came out and saw us looking up and also saw it.  It seemed to be getting closer, moving silently and slowly.  Everyone else began to leave but ((name deleted)) and I stood and watched as it slowly started to drift hight and higher.  As it did the bottom showed a distinct triangular shape.  ((name deleted)) went back inside but I continued to watch as it just rose ingto the stratosphere and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt very strange afterward.  Very confused, but very tranquil.  I think it&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t some flashy sci fi UFO thing.  I had seen it, and others with me.  On my way home I called a local news station on my cell to see if anyone had reported seeing anything at that location.  They said no but wanted to know what I saw.  I told them briefly but neither they or I pursued it further.  The tranquil, huanting feeling followed me for days, despite being teased by our coworkers.  I think it just confirmed what I believed was true, in broad daylight with one of my best friends with me as well as a bunch of strangers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

But then they started to make these weird formations.  And then i saw some reflection, so I knew they were metal.  at fist I saw 4 they made a triangle with one on top,  and then there were five and then six.  they dissapeared and then come back.  As they moved I saw more and more 20, then about 50 then about 100.  They looked like white fireworks in the sky.  They would appear and then dissaper in 2 different sets.  A passenger plane flew into the direction of the lights and then they were gone. It is a clear day today not a cloud in the sky.  I know this is april fools day but this is no joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Faster than anything ive seen from earth.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36388.html|393|ndxe200404| Lights travelling very fast in the sky with. Faster than anything ive seen from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gonna try to write this as good as i can because im from Sweden my english might not be right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out with 2 friends driving. We stopped just next to a big grass field ((deleted)). As I was standing looking up in the sky i saw 2 lights. Very small lights ( they were very far away)  but they were still strong. orange lights. Theyre speed was faster than anything that i human could build. But not as fast as a star falling. But not far from. They were flying in a straight line when suddenly one of the lights accelerated and then the other one catched up and then they crossed each other. And because they were so high up i guess i must have been a very long way from eachother.  Like if you stand and watch the sky. if you hold your hands straight up in the air. Between your hands it is like 50cm?  Thats how far they crossed eachother very quickly! And something crossing so long way so fast cant be anything out of this earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after they crossed eachother they just disapperad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do you think about this. I cant explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But i can say that it wasnt a comet, or a star falling. Theese objects seemed to have course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
