P-51&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subject: german rfz (ufo) 4th may 1945.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A special event took place on 4th may 1945 at 16.03 when 3 Mustang flying over a very importend german radarstation area Camp &#34;Lindwurm&#34; near Fraer, Jutland Denmark as this event took place:<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three pilots mentioned above ((below)) were on their way back to their base in England from a raid in Danish water &#34;Kattegat&#34; - but they were on their course crossing a big and very importend ((important)) german military Radar- and listening Camp- codename &#34;Lindwurm&#34; - with 6 spec. Radar/listening devices/system were placed among other equiments etc. - I think they all three pilots got very suprised on this spot which looks peacefully - here is the event as I remember it:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that this very last day 4th may 1945, just 14 hours before the second World War (the german surrender) ended both in Denmark and Germany was on a Friday 4th May 1945 and precisly at 16,03 hours did 3 Mustang Jagerfly IV pass by on crossing Jutland and they were passing by on course 280o. - A schoolboy (((witness name deleted)) - 13 year)  has stopped on the road, when he heard this special  airplane noise which only could come from the allied flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boy stopped on the road, on his way home from school, just outside one of the german Würzbug Reise radar-station - close to the road (30 m) and when he discovered three Mustangs - he signaled to all  3 pilots by waving his arms.  The pilot in front tipped with his wings from side to side back to the boy. On the precisly the same time a german flak open fire on these 3 Mustang IV from ((Squadron # deleted)) Sqdn. (Madras Precidency).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 Mustang-flight´s now turned 360o around and back again to fire on this creasy german flak, hidding in on a very small forrest area - Pilot P/O   ((pilot name deleted)) here was hit in his arm, and the aircraft was holed. The  P/O  ((name deleted)) crash landed few  minutes later on an open field,  approx 1 Km east of the city Hornum village,  where he was taken care of and brought to Løgstør Hospital by civilians (local doctor), just before the German army entert the crassing plane. - The German army now went to Løgstør Hospital to capture ((name deleted)) as prisoner, but the hospital cheif/doctor refuse to do it, as he said: &#34;this patient was in treatment.&#34; - P/O ((pilot name deleted)) soon recovered and was back in Great Britain within 2 weeks time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The schoolboy shortly after that got in serious truble from two germans soldiers, who was stationed at this Würzburg radar, nearby him - they shout, threaten and running after the boy, they want to give him a beating. The boy jump on his bicyckle as fast as he could away home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very special event toke place as those 3 Mustang turning 360o around to fire back on the flak. Than they aprox. after 90o all meet a collered &#34;grey hat formed object&#34; hanging in the air - max. 100 m of the ground, without no sound!  When this &#34;grey hat-formed object&#34; realize that it now could get in truble, it started at ones away from those Mustangs in direction SSW. When &#34;the grey hat object&#34; (a german &#34;Haunebu&#34; Vril-7) was on its side marked with a german cross. This object did started with a short heavy noise, a sound as you may imaging comming from many metal dustbins, like rumbling and away was this &#34;grey hat-object&#34; as fast as a now a day Jet-fighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report on this document I hereby sign, testifying as the witness, to that the above report, confirming that this insident did take place as described here.  in June 1999.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact: ((name deleted)) e-mail: ((e-address deleted)).tele.dk November 1997 - Signed by my own hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The special event on 4th may 1945 at 16.13: I would like to get in contact to one or all 3 RAF-pilot who was stationed on Banff Air Base in northern England in may 1945:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mustang  Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #2 name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mustang Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #3 name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mustang Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #1 name and birthdate deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three Mustang on crossing out over Jutland, some flak positions by Mariager (correct pos. was Fraer near Skoerping) opened up fire.  Mustang Jagerfly  ((pilot #1)) was hit in his arm and the aircraft was holed. Bell crash landed near Løgstør (Aars) and he was taken to Løgstør Hospital. He soon recovered. - Some sources also state that the Banff Strike Wing was &#34;escorted&#34; by their Air Sea Rescue Warwicks as well on 4 may 1945.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has later been confirmed that P/O ((pilot #1)) has been killed in Kenya by the &#34;Mau-Mau movement&#34; in Kenya sometime between 1952-56.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I´m willing to answer any quistions and to your first question I can replay: I did not see this rfz object before the insident tool place becuse my interest was the well knowing noise from this P-51 a noise which we during the 2. WW have heard many time but only at nights and never have seen, now was possible to see in full daylight and this was a exciding moment for me. after following the P-51 around in the air I here for the first time got the wiev of this rfz object there was hanging quit was just after the germans try to shoot the P-51 down and they now turning around very fast- here I got the first look at  the rfz -object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second question: the rfz did take ofF from its hanging position after the P-51 was in very close contact to this rfz object and the rfz  fly of in the direction SSW south/south/west in high speed possible and my only guess is that it did try to avoid any futher contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i do hope that my response to your quistions be content sincerely ((witness name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.--My english is not the best but I hope we understand each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the most interesting letter!!
