We were 15 and bored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After swinging for a few minutes we stopped to rest at the base of the pole, back to back, when we saw over the top of the schoolhouse, just above the shadow of the wooded area immediately behind the playground in back of the school, a blue ball/light which curved down to the treetops and disappeared. When we investigated we were witness to a craft hovering above the woods where the light disappeared. It silently made it&#39;s way over our left shoulders, which were backed against the brick backed school building. With a low cloud cover toward the downtown area, which reflected the city lights, we could see 3-4 more ships slowly circling toward and then stopping above the same area. They seemed to be patrolling the area around and above the woods. After a time we could make our a figure walking along the edge of the woods on the other side of the large yard making up the playground. We could barely make it out but it stopped every time we called out. As we continued to watch the circling ships one suddenly made it&#39;s way toward us. Frozen against the wall and unable to move from fear, it was right in front of us about 50 feet in the air above and immediately in front of us. We could see the windows surrounding it and lights moved in a circular motion as the illuminated each window. There was absolutely no sound made. We were sure they were going to do something but it just slowly lifted and again made it&#39;s way over our left and over the school building out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile we decided to move up closer to the yard from the building. As we moved forward we cleared a part of the school to our left that jutted out and my friend alerted me to someone running to our left. I forgot to mention that during the initial sightings of the ships we ran back to my friend&#39;s house to get a camera. His family actually didn&#39;t have one but we were able to find a pair of binoculars. That and a borrowed leather jacket for me that belonged to his father were all we could return with. As we walked toward the figure that was running, which had stopped at my friend&#39;s alert/shout, it became clearer that it was one of the aliens from the ships. He was tall and thin and was a light orange/white and appeared to have a suit with a black square on the chest. And a collar that appeared to be for a helmet or something. He was poised to jump as we approached. We were within 25 feet of him when we remembered we had the binoculars. When I lifted them to my eyes it was as if someone punched me in the eyes. I looked directly into his face. My friend&#39;s reaction was much the same. After I called out to him his face turned into us and he looked directly at me as I looked through the glasses. When I called out with &#34;we mean you no harm&#34; I felt silly saying that and was embarrassed. After about 20 minutes of holding him there, he started to make coughing sounds and a whistle of some kind. We decided to let him go as we didn&#39;t know what else to do. We backed away and (no kidding) as we cleared around the blocking part of the school, a police car came toward us from where we&#39;d first started. As they approached we just knew the alien would no longer be there. The police (two of them) stopped us and asked us what we were doing behind the school and we told them about the alien. They first searched us, our pockets and such and of course my friend&#39;s father&#39;s jacket had a bunch of matches deep in one pocket I didn&#39;t even know were there. We did convince one of them we were telling the truth and they agreed to accompany us to the site. As we rounded the blocking part of the school we could see he was gone. The police, to their credit, did go up into the yard and shine their spotlight into the woods that edged that side of the playground. The alien had been standing just inside that thin line of woods that went up the left side of the school to the main woods that ran left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings that the whole town had seen, including my mother and sisters, claimed there were three craft with one appearing in trouble and two on either side of it following. We surmised through the years that they were maybe repairing that craft in the woods and we happened there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If we had a camera, especially a video camera (not common then) we could have made a feature movie! This is all 100% true. By the way, to make matters worse (for our credibility) the National Enquirer was on a UFO kick and had along one whole length of the front page an exact picture of our guy! Unbelievable. But absolutely true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I hear of regular sightings I just think, &#34;wow, if they&#39;d seen what I saw!&#34; Thanks for letting me tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were off at a greater distance and dancing around one another in the nite sky. I ran in the house and called &#34;0&#34; (before 911) and was put right through to Port Columbus tower. I dont know if they still do that but apparently thats how it was done in the day. The guy in the tower claimed he couldnt see anything but I could tell he was pulling my leg. So I said &#34;Come on man! Are you telling me you cant see those things?&#34; he said &#34;Yes we can see them but we dont know what they are.&#34; My older brother was with me at the time. I tried to get my dad to come out but he would not. We had a run in with some UFO&#39;s a few years before and he didnt even like to talk about it. I sent you the details on that one and asked you not to publish it if I remember right. Do you remember I sent you info about a year or better ago about seeing a ship up close with little ones coming out of it and taking off in several directions? The cops were there as well as many witnesses. Men came to the house and told my dad to shutup about it. I mead we were less that 125ft from this deal and it didnt care who were watching!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness may be addressing the event that occurred over Ohio in October 1973, although that is only a guess on our part.  PD))<n>
11/7/70 21:00|Franklin|TN|Sphere|5 minutes|White globe above river at prehistoric indian site|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37363.html|3|ndxe197011| White globe above river at prehistoric indian site<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 20 yrs. old at the time and driving west on hwy 96w 5 miles west of Franklin,TN. I saw a light through the trees to my right(north) and stopped on the Harpeth River Bridge. This is a rural area and back then there was almost no other traffic. It was night time. I&#39;m really unclear as to the month or day of the month, but there were no leaves on the trees and it was warm because I was in a convertible Corvette with the top down. I turned off my headlights and walked to the guard rail and focused on the light which I had seen through the trees. I was looking northeast and saw that the light was a crisply defined, pure white globe about 30 feet above the river and moving at south west toward me and following the course of the river. It was moving at a speed of less than 5 mph and less than 100 feet from me. I could have thrown a rock and hit it. It was only about 4 feet in diameter. I knew right away that this was not a naturally occurring phenomena, but was an object made by some being. I assumed immediatetly I was in the presence of an alien craft. I stood there and decided to raise my right hand and WAVED! at it with a goofy smile on my face. It came a few feet closer to me and then changed direction and headed to the northwest away from me, lifted over the line of trees 300 feet from me, and  went back down behind them and I was no longer able to see it. I will always believe it changed direction because whatever very small entity inside it saw me standing there on the bridge with my hand in the air. I guess I am one of a small number who suprised a UFO. I drove around the area the rest of the night, but saw no more of the object and never reported it, but I think about it often as it changed my life. No one will ever convince me that I did not see something from another world or another time. Whatever it was, it was very interested in the river itself as it was following the course of the river exactly until it saw me. This is an area that was inhabited by prehistoric indians and ! there are 3 indian mounds south of the bridge within sight of the location so I have wondered over the years if the pilot of the craft was doing a little historical research, but of course I have no way of knowing. It made no sound whatsoever and there was no wavering in its movement. It moved as steadily as if it was on a track and never changed its speed at all. What struck me the most was that it was moving toward me and then instantly away from me with no change in speed. I forgot to mention that it was as bright as a street light and the light was coming from within the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Size of circular disk aprox 7&#39; diameter. Sharp cylendrical holes 45 degrees about 22inches deep with one cone shape hole in cente about 12 inches deep. This soil when dry is cement hard and no irrigational or farm tool could be capable of making such a hole which appears glazed glasslike smooth inside. The photos of these holes were made 7 days after siting after heavy rain had caused crumbling of the soil around edges of the disk area. Other sitings were seen up in Tully, Queensland Australia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We have requested confirmation of the date, and the witness forwarded photos and a newspaper article about the event.  PD))<n>
11/1/70 20:30|Rochester|NY||30 MIN.|A number of cases described a reddish clay residue that had been found at abduction sites.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26460.html|6|ndxe197011| A number of cases described a reddish clay residue that had been found at abduction sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a child I lived in a corner apartment on the first floor in New York state. One night when I was about eight years old, my mother had just left my room after tucking me in. About five minutes had passed when I saw a shadow of what looked like a thin man with no hair walk up to my window. The curtains were drawn shut, so I could not see detail. I was startled, and then I heard a scratching noise against the screen. I was so afraid that I couldn&#39;t move. I tried to scream but nothing came out. Finally, I was able to get out a yell and my mother came rushing in. I told her what I saw and she reasured me that there was nothing there and that she would take a look. She kissed me goodknight and left the room, with the door open this time. Later I could hear her talking with her boyfriend outside my window. The next morning I went outside and took a look at the window. There was a reddish, pinkish clay that had been smeared about 5 or six inches on the screen where I had seen the shadow. When I asked my mother about it, she didn&#39;t say anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years went by. It was always in the back of my mind, but I didn&#39;t dwell on it. Then in the mid to late &#39;70&#39;s I saw an episode of &#34;IN SEARCH OF&#34; with Leonard Nimoy and the episode dealt with alien abductions. A number of cases described a reddish clay residue that had been found at abduction sites. After I saw this it was like a light bulb had gone on. It made my hairs stand on end. To this day I often wonder if I had a close call with being abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>
