To be honest I thought it was a firework in its descent but it never dropped altitude, and seemed to hover. I watched it to the horizon in awe and looked back at my family and another light same type hovered and appeared to pause.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/10 23:50|Montgomery|PA|Fireball|1 minute|Multiple witness Fireball sighting with animal reaction|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79622.html|2|ndxe201012| Multiple witness Fireball sighting with animal reaction<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leaving the house with my girlfriend to have a cigarette before the New Years Eve ball dropped, my girlfriend noticed one very large, very luminescent fireball/ glowing object in the northern sky several degrees from the route 15 mountain skyline.  The object in question had a yellow glow to it.  At first we believed we were viewing a weapon, possibly a nuclear warhead, or some form of dangerous device, however it did not show trajectory like a rocket.. instead it simply hovered in the air, not moving, nor emitting any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring at the object less than a minute, it rapidly accelerated to the west in a very unnatural manner, and faded from view in three very distinct phases.  The fading was not natural or progressive, instead sudden with 3 steps of brilliance, each lower than the last, leading us to believe that it was not a rocket burning up the remaining fuel in a gradual manner, a firework, or any natural or man made object fading from the night&#39;s sky.  It truly looked as though it left earth, completely gone from sight after the third distinct and rapid phase of dimming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend&#39;s dog had been on edge all day, aggressively barking, with hair raised on her body; at an area in the forest each time she was let out that day.  She never exhibited such a reaction, especially to an unseen presence from the woods, and given what we experienced that night, the pet&#39;s reactions seemed eerily appropriate to what others with pets reported during sightings.<n>

This time only I could see three of them,instead of  more than that the first time I saw them. They traveled from south east to north west.  Bright orange color, like it was later reported in this same web site the last time.I wonder if they could be Chinese Lamps?  It happened the first time December 31st,2010 around 11.45 PM.We live in South Folrida.West of Miami,sightings were closer to my house.  Witnessed by my wife,my daughter and I.And it happened again December 31st,2011.around 11.45PM.  This time lights were further  away from my house.  Witdessed by me and my wife.I read in this site that same lights were seen from Orlando to Washington state in 2010.Wonder about this year were else would be seen!<n>

I live southeast of Jacksonville by 10 miles, and their path was west of me by approximately 1-2 miles.  They travelled approximately 10 miles from south to north during my observation.  They were not at exactly the same altitude but were fairly close.  They had no blinking lights and made no sound.  They looked almost like you would expect after-burners to look on a jet fighter, but there was no sound at all.  The size of the light was too big to come from an airplane, and the speed at which they traveled was too fast for a helicopter.  I’m not sure what these were, but they looked very similar to those I found on youtube videos when I searched for “Orange UFO”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I see hundreds of airplanes and helicopters in the sky on a weekly basis. I have never been intoxicated or on drugs, and consider myself to be a reliable witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On New Year’s Eve 12/31/10 at approximately 11:40pm, I was leaving a friend’s party in Fairfax, VA, and as I entered my car which was facing south, I witnessed 6 round red lights flying in a line low above the trees  in a Northbound direction due east of my position.  I’m not sure how far away they were, but the 6 lights flew in no apparent formation in a general northbound direction.  I quickly got out of the car to get a better view, and alerted my friend and his cousin who were sitting on the front porch. Both witnessed the event alongside me.  As the red lights flew, it was apparent that they were changing speeds, and changing positions with each other as they flew.  The event lasted for a full minute, and just as the 6 lights began to become distant, they all suddenly vanished in unison. I understand that on New Year’s eve there is the possibility of fireworks in the sky.  I assure you that these were not fireworks.  I’ve never known fireworks to change speeds and to fly for a solid minute in one direction before burning out, not to mention the simultaneous nature of the disappearance.<n>

12/31/10 23:00|Leavenworth|WA|Light|10 minutes|At approximately 11:00 PM PST on New Year's Eve, 2010, my wife and I both observed two orangish objects in the night sky, approximately|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79685.html|8|ndxe201012| At approximately 11:00 PM PST on New Year&#39;s Eve, 2010, my wife and I both observed two orangish objects in the night sky, approximately 25-30 degrees above the southeastern horizon, from our house near Leavenworth, WA.   Based on the surrounding hills, it appeared they might have been somewhere between the towns of Peshastin, WA and Cashmere, WA although if they were higher up or large, they might have been closer to Wenatchee, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was through a large, southeast facing bathroom window.  Being an extremely clear night, it was easy to distinguish the two objects, not only because of their orangish color, but also because they were considerably larger than the surrounding stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it was night, we couldn&#39;t estimate the altitude or size of the orbs.  However, the objects appeared to be about 10 miles to our southeast and maybe several thousand feet above the ground but these observations are purely guesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, each object appeared to be stationary.  Perhaps a minute later, one of the objects began to travel slowly towards the north or northwest, which would put it on a course to possibly travel over our house.  As it progressed, it also became visibly larger than it was initially, which would probably be the case if it was, in fact, headed our way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object started moving our way, the second orb seemed to do an about face and headed in a southeast direction  for a few seconds, then appeared as if it headed toward the ground as if it were falling out of the sky.  We lost sight of it once it went below the hills surrounding our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object heading in our direction moved from the southeast to a point more directly overhead, approximately 60-75 degrees above the eastern horizon.  After about a minute or so, it appeared to stop and seemed as if it was perhaps only a mile or two away and several thousand feet above the ground. Again, the distances are strictly speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the remaining object was now much higher in the sky and closer to our home, I went outside for a better view.  The object was still glowing orange and remained stationary.  Suddenly, the object began to pulsate with a brilliant, white light.  It reminded me of a strobe light and was difficult to look at directly.  After maybe 5 seconds, the white light then faded back to the orange glow and then repeated itself perhaps two more times, each time emitting the same strobe-like white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the last strobe light episode, the orange glow of the orb grew larger, and then returned to its original size after about 4-5 seconds.   It then paused for around 5-10 seconds before glowing larger, and then returning to its original size.  The orb repeated this around 4 or 5 times and then slowly, over the course of maybe 15 seconds, faded away until there was nothing left to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the sighting which lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n>

The object was round in shape with the top 2/3 rd. being bright red in color.  The bottom 1/3 rd was bright orange. I would guestimate the object to be at around 18,000 feet in altitude.  It traveled from east to west where I observed it for about two minutes. It traveled at a medium and steady speed.  The object then came to a complete stop for about 20 seconds and then changed direction and headed north.  I watched it for about another minute until it went behind some clouds and that ended my sighting.  The object was silent and made no sound at all.  If you would hold a basketball at arms length,  this would be the size of the object from my vantage point.  The object was about 500 yards away and at a 50 degree angle to the ground.  First time in 62 years I saw an object that I couldn&#39;t explain in the sky!<n>

As we were looking into the sky, I saw three extremely bright objects moving at a rapid pace across the sky.  I mentioned it to my other friends and we weren’t sure what it was.  The three objects were at least 3 times brighter than any other star in the sky.  The objects moved in sync for the first few minutes but then started moving at random, seeming to weave in and out of flight pattern.  Two of the objects headed in an easterly direction while one stopped and hovered for 3 minutes.  The single object that hovered then took off in a southerly direction and faded out.<n>

A few seconds after lighting it, I looked over to the North and saw three glowing orange orbs in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately yelled for my husband to come outside. He came out and saw all three in the sky.  He went back in the house to find the video camera but couldn&#39;t locate it.  When he returned outside two of them had dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as the third and finale one slowly seemed to burn out and turn into a small silver speck in the night sky.  The three objects where heading from the Nort to a East by Southeast direction.  There where two other airplanes in the area shortly after the UFO&#39;s where gone.<n>

Initially, we both assumed that it was possible firework debris but (1) they were not falling (2) continued to burn and (3) started to move after &#34;hovering&#34; for &gt;30 seconds.  We ignored the fireworks as we continued to follow these two objects begin to move and then they quickly began to move into the distance.  I wondered if perhaps someone was in a helicopter watching the firework display from above, but the light was &#34;fire-like&#34; and flickering -- plus the way they moved was inconsistent with any obvious explanation.  I wonder if anyone was taping the firework display, we did not have our cameras and we are stumped on how to explain what we saw.  I know the Navy maintains the Pacific missile testing range here -- but I cannot think that what was seen is congruent with a missile or any other military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light in front slowly moved to the right and the one that was in that position moved to the middle and the one on the left slid outward making it seem effortless in all.  The one in the middle then moved up and they all moved together going back to triangle formation.  The one on the left then vanished like a light loosing battery then the one up front followed and vanished and next it was over when the last one to the right slowly vanished like so.<n>

It was too close to be an airplane, so we all thought it was a helicopter, and it was just going around alpine for New Years Eve. The light started to dim and then quickly got bright and flashed throughout the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after this happened we saw a few more lights quickly moving in multiple directions and then shooting off into the distance, there were a few flashes during all this.  There seemed to be a tint of green in the light.<n>

They were spherical in shape.  The objects were flying north-west, and one appeared to be ahead of the other.  The object that seemed closer was quite large, about two times the size of the private planes we normally see in the area.  The other object was about the size of a small plane though.  We took deep notice of the objects because we had never seen planes with a light this size or glowing this color, nor have we seen a plane appear so fast before.  The object was moving slow; it looked like it was hovering in place, then slowly move in our direction, and then hover again.  It was traveling very slowly and flying low; not at the height of jets; more like small planes and helicopter height.  We heard no sound.  I ran inside for the camera as our phone video would not capture them, but when I got back the lights were gone.  Husband said the lights just dimmed and then were gone.  The night was clear so we didn’t lose them in the clouds. The duration was about 2 minutes.<n>

Thinking it was a helicopter with an unusual orange light we just watched as it flew over our home. As it came closer we expected to hear the usual noise of a helicopter, but it was silent. As it seemed to be directly overhead, it seemed to dim and then shoot upwards to a pinpoint light and disappear. While overhead, it seemed to have the appearance of such a bright light it had a starburst look about it.  About 15-30 seconds later, another one came from the same direction and did the same thing. After about four of these bright orange light &#34;fireballs&#34; we called our son to come and witness. He saw three more of the same.  We were not under the influence at the time. I do not drink. My husband is an airline pilot and former Marine fighter pilot. He is a very logical man and was completely dumbfounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/31/10 20:10|Anchorage|AK|Light|5 minutes|Two small orange lights flying over Anchorage|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79474.html|18|ndxe201012| Two small orange lights flying over Anchorage<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was New Year&#39;s Eve 2010, and I stepped outside to let my grandmother&#39;s dog out at about 8:10 PM. There were fireworks going off all around, so I instantly looked toward the sky when I got outside. The very first thing I noticed was a small orange light traveling fairly slowly moving from east to west. It was going slower than an airplane and was fairly low to the ground. Lower than an airplane would probably be flying. There is plently of air traffic over Anchorage all the time, so I know what I&#39;m talking about and this was definitely not an airplane. I watched the thing very closely, and it was a steady light -- no blinking.  I tried to make out if it was a large craft, but it was too dark and all I could see was the light.  And it was not fireworks either, believe me.  I saw it moving and all of a sudden it made a strange move -- about a 23 degree shift to the right effortlessly.  At that point it looked like it was going to fly almost directly over my head! , so I got excited, but all of a sudden the thing started going straight up in the air. It went straight up to the point where the light was so small, it was about the size of a star. And there were two stars up in the sky and I swear they were moving around, but maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I wear glasses and my vision is not great, especially things from far away. I was squinting as best as I could, and I could still see this light traveling now toward the southwest. It was obviously very high in the sky at that point, and I watched it about another three minutes until it just stopped. At this point it was no longer orange.  It was what I&#39;d call a black or gray light. So you&#39;d think it was something impossible to see, but I could still see it because I had been watching it the whole time. This was the point where I figured it must be a very large object because it was very far away at this point. And it just started falling straight down. It was falling faster ! than it had been moving the whole time. I heard no sound, but ! keep in mind I was near a busy road and there were fireworks going off all over the place. But I made a conscious effort to listen for sound from it, and there was none. I watched it fall for about 30 seconds, and I looked back toward the east for a second and I saw another light. It was the exact same thing flying at the same rate and roughly the same path as the original. I watched this one for about 10 seconds and then I looked back to the southwest for the other one, and I could no longer see it. So I looked back for the new light, and it was gone. I scanned the sky for about another minute, and I could not see either of the two lights, so I went back inside.<n>

It has been scaring me as to not knowing what it could be, and I am again clueless as to what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have included photos and videos of it.  Careful inspection of the photos revealed a large object with a black center illuminating white light. I have been seeing this &#34;ufo&#34; in the sky countless times over a month long.  You look at the evidence and tell me what you think it could be.  Be warned, it is scary.  Also, it is only visible late at night and the early mornings.<n>

We tried to call some friends but all of our cell phones had shut down.  The crafts also made a slight buzzing sound.  We viewed these objects for about 15 minutes, as they hovered above the river.  As quickly as they arrived, they immediately sped off into the horizon.<n>

Thinking maybe it was a helicopter at first when another unblinking, slightly pulsating orange/amber light came behind the first following its flight pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the first pair changed direction the second pair showed up behind the first, then the third pair appeared. All three pairs drifted through the same positions in the sky, from flying horizontal to vertically,( one above the other ). Then one pair after the other just kinda faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later we see an actual airplane flying from south to north, heading to Arlington airport. We then see one more of these orange lights fly parallel the the plane for a bit before hovering, and then drifting straight up and disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a couple minutes later another two were moving to the north, further north then before. These were not airplanes or helicopters, no noise, no blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

His window is right by is bed to we were looking out of it.  I noticed something that looked like a really bright star.  It started slowly moving towards us. We ran outside to watch it.  The closer that it got we noticed it had lights coming from all sides. Very bright lights.  It started going straight up in the air very slowly. we stared at it until it just became a star.  It never went farther away or came any closer after that.  It was just the brightest star in the sky. we went back in side and were talking about what we just saw.  Moments later i spotted another one. A bigger one with more lights than the first one.  It was moving so slow but came so low we knew it was not an air plane or anything else.  It had a soft humming noise as well.  We ran out side again and for something that was moving so slow by the time we ran out thereIt was gone.  We have been trying to talk our selves out of what we saw for the past week.  It w! as the weirdest thing we have had happen to us.<n>

It was the clearest night I&#39;ve seen in some time. This large, round, glowing light much larger than the space station or satelites I&#39;ve see.  It moved faster across the sky than airforce jet I&#39;ve seen. It would had flown close to Vandenburg airforce Base, Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, &amp; then over Fort Hunter Ligget.  The large,SILENT, glowing orb stopped, swerved back &amp; forth, the shot from its Northern direction, to a 90 degree change to go Northeast @ light speed. I mean, so fast it just blipped out in a second. So, To recap.  It came from the South moving fast to the North, then stopped, made a pengelemn back &amp; forth action, then went into light, warp-speed to the Northeast.  The light seemed like it had a hugh or haze around it.  Plasma, maybe because of the speed.  I know of one other person, a woman bartender, who saw it from Cambria, 15 miles North of wh! ere I saw it.<n>

My first thought was that it looked like a new radio or phone tower with red, blue, and yellow lights, but I knew that wasn&#39;t possible because we travel down taht road often. We first saw the lights about half a mile away and as we got closer we realized that the lights were hovering just over the tree line attached to a dark boomerang or triangle shape.  All of the lights seemed to be flashing at first, but as we got closer all the lights were shining down towards the road.  The object was not moving at all it was just hovering over the road. when we passed under it we still could not figure out what it was, I wasn&#39;t driving so I turned around to look back and see it from the other side and I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  We turned around about 100 yards past the object to try and get a picture of it but it was gone, no lights in the trees, in! the sky, or anywhere else that I could find.  The object was not a helicopter because it made no sound, and not a plane because it was too low and did not move. Whatever the thing was it was about as wide as the highway and I could not tell how long it was because it was dark behind the lights.  This is the first time i&#39;ve ever seen anything that I couldn&#39;t explain around here although I did see unexplained lights in the sky in Iraq in 2003. This area is only about 45 miles from Ft. Bragg/Pope air force base, so I guess it could possibly be some kind of military project that i&#39;ve never heard of. I&#39;m not one to jump to conclusions, but this thing has me confused.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw the object or made any kind of report.  I really just want to know if this fits with UFO sightings or if anyone can tell me what this may have been because it was only about 3 miles from my house.<n>

I looked and there directly above me was a diamond shape object flying at an extremely fast speed.  It was fairly large. About the size of a 1/3 of how a waning crescent looks from earth.  I was mesmerized as the object turned from blue to green to red to purple and then simply disappeared.  I have never seen anything like that and it immediately gave me chills.<n>

It was very overcast that night and I could see the outline of the large round object through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a second glance, I clearly saw the object&#39;s outline (perfectly round and bright white glow). There was light traffic traveling in both directions. I was surprised that the object was flying relatively close to the ground (approx. 300 feet off of the ground; not much higher than the street lights or the tree tops).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emmited a solid, bright white light and moved silently in a northwest direction at what speed I cannot say, but was able to keep pace with it and for 30 secs. and keep it in my sight out of the driver&#39;s side window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the object to the attention of my passenger, so that I could get a second opinion ! of exactly what the object in question was.  The passenger could not identify with any certainty what the object was either.  I was not playing the radio, given our close proximity we couldn&#39;t hear its sound.  That fact surprised us both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I live close to O&#39;hara airport, I am used to hearing and seeing aircraft flying over head.

Light visible in daylight. What was unusual about this was the light was high in the sky with a tail and not a planet.  This was not stationary.  My questions are three fold: 1) space station but why would it have a tail ?  2) Satellite in decaying orbit ? 3) Did we have a comet pass close by ?  And to add a forth given the recent reports - was this a high flier leaving a con-trail ?  (high flier being UFO as in unidentified object) not implying anything but &#39;unidentified&#39;.  Flight path was straight and a SSE direction over the North West region and to the left of the crescent moon which at the time appeared overhead but in a Southerly 10 O&#39;clock position, so not directly overhead. I am thinking space junk or Earth born stuff rather than other worldly craft. It was a bright light so you couldn&#39;t identify it as a craft with the naked eye and I didn&#39;t have binocs or telescope. I am a tech. and applicati! on Admin. Attention to detail is required.  Bare in mind I viewed this from a moving vehicle and could not stop to get a better look. So better details could not be gathered. Over the period of 1hr 1/2 commute the object was visible for 15 minutes as it wafted it&#39;s way South. I might note that the size never diminished as is the case with meteorites and this was not a flash of a meteorite. The size stayed the same relative to the distance of course as an object gets smaller over distance and time. It would be interesting to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That was when we saw a very intense bright white flashing in the sky off to the distance about a mile from my house. We decided to go investigate, because we thought it could have been something going on at the regional airport, because it was in that general direction. However, we later learned that it was no where near the airport, which was still a good six or seven miles away from the scene. We got closer to the lights, and we were parked on top of a hill. Looking down from the hill we saw one very large craft that hovered very low. It was hovering right above a series of houses, and appeared to be almost touching them.  We couldn&#39;t tell where the flashing was coming from, because it didn&#39;t appear to be coming from the craft.  The craft was long and oval.  From our vantage point, we saw four rather large bright yellow lights, each being the size of a house.  We couldn&#39;t mak! e out the craft at first, because it appeared to blend in with the night sky.  However, after looking at it for a few seconds we could make out the outlines of the craft, which I compare to trying to make out the outlines of the darker part of the moon against the night sky when the moon is either a &#34;new moon&#34; or a &#34;crescent moon.&#34;   I can estimate the size being close to that of a house, because of the craft&#39;s close proximity to several houses.  We wanted to get closer to the craft, so we continued driving. We drove past a wooded area, where the flashing seemed to be coming from.  It appeared as if the flashing was coming from forty to fifty feet within the woods.  We tried to get closer, but took some wrong turns and ended up driving away from the scene.  When we turned around to go back the lights had stopped flashing and the craft was no where to be seen.  We then somehow got out of place and ended up about three or four miles east of where we were.  The details following our si! ghting are still a bit foggy for me. I have driven past the lo! cation i n the day light and the night time since the event took place, and I can see no logical reason for the flashing nor the craft.<n>
12/28/10 23:40|Auburn and Westboro|MA|Other|10-15 minutes|3 Objects, All were bright glittery, 2 eventually turned off bright lights and were observed, third travlled quickly.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79410.html|48|ndxe201012| 3 Objects, All were bright glittery, 2 eventually turned off bright lights and were observed, third travlled quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. I was driving home west to east on the Massachusetts Turnpike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The first object was very bright, slightly off to the left of me at about 10o&#39;clock high.( Auburn, MA). The second and third objects were also very bright but had a twinkling appearance at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. First object - I thought it was a plane with it&#39;s approach lights on. The second and third objects were not seen for another 10 minutes or so after the first. I was still getting my thoughts together about the first object when the second two appeared to my left, about 9 o&#39;clock horizontally and 10 o&#39;clock vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. First object - was right in my line of sight so I get an eye on it ( I was travelling at 70 MPH in traffic so I couldn&#39;t stop or listen for sounds. Second and third objects - really got my attention, as they initially looked the same as the first one. These seemed to appear suddenly, but they may have moved rapidly from behind me to the left. After watching the first object for 2-3 minutes and trying to recall exactly what I saw, when these other two appeared, I observed them much more closely, as closely as you can when your are driving at highway speeds.Interestingly, when the second two objects appeared, i saw a lot of brake lights go on around me so I think there was a multiple group of people, including truck drivers, who saw these last two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. Object 1 - First appeared in front of me, about 10 O&#39;Clock high. Initially, I thought it was a plane with approach lights, however the object was not moving, or if it was, it was very slowly moving. I was approaching the Auburn 140 exit, and within 5 miles I had driven right under the object. I could make out two white lights, side by side, no wing lights ( starboard / port red and white  ) and nothing blinking. Where the object should have had some type of shape, there was a misty, cloudy mass. You could see a trail emanating from the lights ( this could have been mist or fog). The best way to describe what this looked like was as if you looked at the afterburner of a twin engine fighter jet, however these were definitely white lights, not exhaust flames). I drove right under the object and lost it once it was behind me. I did not see much if any movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. Object 2 and 3 - This was the most detailed. I was trying to put my thoughts together on the first object and was approaching I 495 eastbound when I caught a very similar light to my left. I then noticed there were two objects, both glittering brightly and moving north to south, about 9-10 o&#39;clock high on the horizon in front of me. The cars in front of me started to tap their brakes, so I had to watch the road as I watched the objects. These objects did move, Object 1 fairly fast for what seemd to be 1-15 seconds unti, it was right over I90. When the object was about 11 o&#39;clok in front of me, the bright glittering stopped and I could make out red and white lights, and I saw strobing. My first thought was airplane, but as i got closer ( again, the object slowed way down to where I drove right under it), I could make out a triangular or circular pattern. The center of the object had that blurry/misty appearance, so you couldn&#39;t see an actual shape in the darkness. What mad! e this object so strange was that the strobing was coming from the white lights; the red lights were not blinking. The white lights had a pattern of 1-2, half second, 1-2, half second. I could see a bluish haze in the middle of this light array as I drove under it. I lost it as I passed under. The third object  was the most active, but also the least viewed. As I was watching object 2, Object 3 remained &#34;glittery&#34; and was at 9-10 o&#39;clock vertically. It moved rapidly from my left to about 2 clock to my right off in the distance and then just hovered there for what I estimate to be 2-3 minutes, then moved off to the south. I did not overtake this object, but it did look the same from a distance with object 2 until object 2&#39;s &#34;glitter&#34; stopped and the shape and red/white lights were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an ex-Navy airdale, so I&#39;m somewhat familiar with aircraft and helicopters. I wish I could have pulled over to observe these objects from a stationary position and listened for engine noise. What was most striking was the slowness / lack of movement / lack of standard running lights / north south direction ( Logan was east of the sightings)and the clarity of the lights and the misty looking area where you would normally see the outline of an aircraft. If they were aircraft, they would have to have been helicopters based on the changing speeds and my ability to overtake them in a car, however, the lighting patterns and lack of a hard shape just doesn&#39;t add up. Hopefully someone else will be reporting this to you so you can compare notes. I have drawn the objects so I don&#39;t forget them with time.<n>

I apologize for the inconvenience  Location: Colusa, California Time of Sighting: Noticed an oddly colored star in the very center of the sky from my view, slightly to the west of the constellation Orion; 8:38pm PST.  At 10pm, object was still in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside looking at the stars, and as Orion came into my view I thought what I witnessed was the International Space Station flying by.  As I watched the object, it moved north, south, and then to my amazement did a full circle in the sky.  It returned to its position to the west of Orion.  The object was a slightly off color, amber-orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside my house and got out a pair of binoculars to see if I could get a better understanding of what I just saw.  Once I looked at the object through the binoculars it appeared to be in our atmosphere, too close to be a star.  And once more, startled me as it moved in the same pattern while I was looking at it through the binoculars.  I was under the impression it was trying to disguise itself as a star.  I felt the urgent need to report this to some one.  I used Google and found your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student at AIU.  I am getting my master’s degree in IT/Internet Security in 3 years.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I have only seen one other irregular star while living out here.  And that one blew my mind so much I was scared to go outside at night for weeks.  That time, an object similar in color, appeared to be flying in front and around the moon.  It looked like it was heading straight for me, and then when it got a short distance away from the moon, the object split into two objects and continued on their separate ways.  That was several years ago now.  I did not know that I could report such incidences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was to the right, i.e. west, of Orion, it could not have been the star, Sirius, which is located to the left of Orion, as one faces that constellation.

There wasn&#39;t a sound in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I was sitting on my couch on the laptop and watching TV. I was sitting next to a window and noticed lights that made a triangle form. I then proceeded to go to my front porch and got a better look. The “craft” that I saw was triangle with a light on each point and one in the exact center blinking.  It was moving from north-north west to south-south east.  The air was rather still and a small breeze blew. The breeze wasn’t strong enough to make enough sound, but the air was very quiet.  The air was so quiet that this craft would’ve been heard.  It also was flying rather low. Way below commercial airliner height.  I would say 2,500-8,500 feet.  The color of the aircraft would probably be a darker color like a grey, naval blue, black or dark color but I couldn’t completely tell because of the minimal light.  The time of day it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft flying past the front part my house I had to run to the back porch. Once again I saw the same craft coming out of the trees next to my house.  I watched it until it started to shrink from the distance. Then it disappeared.  One of my family members also saw it but denied it was anything, not even an airplane. This was incredible different to an airplane for many reasons and we live near three major airports so I know what an airplane flies and that they make noise. After the craft diappeared the wind picked up right away and got cold. There was no noise what so ever. This craft had no traits of an airplane.<n>

I thought they were attached until I saw the boat move away without them. you could see only see one most of the time but the second one popped up every now and then.  no weird erratic movements though just floated there and if they moved they moved slow.  Also to the left there was a big ship maybe navy or something but it was huge and dark. and above that there was a floating white orb, I noticed another orb later on.  The orbs also stayed stationary while the ships moved on. but they would change their height in the sky slowly and over the hour or so I watched it had moved pretty far to the left but nowhere near the boat it started with. the other witnesses were my mom, brother and sister, and some random people I brought my binoculars over too on the beach to get th! eir opinions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hey I checked the box that said I wanted to be contacted by an investigator, but if you guys want a clearer description or something I&#39;d be glad too. but otherwise I just wanted to be contacted if someone else posts this sighting. thanks!!<n>

12/27/10 20:00|Fremont|CA|Triangle|20 minutes|UFO was observed as a triangle shaped object with a glowing green light below,  Craft lowered to 1000 feet, hovered  w/ no sound .|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79400.html|60|ndxe201012| UFO was observed as a triangle shaped object with a glowing green light below,  Craft lowered to 1000 feet, hovered  w/ no sound .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object observed was at first thought to be the North Star. The star began moving slowly towards the south east.  As the object moved closer its color was more defined and observed as a large flouresant green light with a light colored haze shadow above the green light.  Object at this time was estimated at least 100,000 feet above the earth.  The object lowered more than X5 in size and hovered slightly north east of our location. At this time my wife and I could see there was some type of &#34;object&#34; light gray in color like a shadow that was shaped like a triangle above the green light.  This triangle object was directly over the top of the green light ( same color green as that of a green light used in green for traffic signals) and moved as if it was part of the structure attached to the Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object hovered for approximately four minutes at this position.  The Object then began to lower elevation and proceed directly towards our residence.  At first as the Object was lowering it was hard to tell if the Object was a Craft or some type of balloon because the green light was well below the gray fuzzy Object.  I say fuzzy because the Objects perimiter lines were not clearly defined until the object lowered to approximately 30,000 ft.  The Object which I will now call a Craft continued to lower at an angle in which we could only see the bottom of the Craft and the lower green light which was well beneath the craft.  The Craft slowly came down directly at us taking about three minutes then made some sort of a maneuver at approximately 10,000-15,000 feet tipping forward the &#34;body structure of the Craft&#34; and turning towards the westerly direction (San Francisco and Oakland) and stopped. At this time the craft approximately one third mile away and was seen to have a series! of window like structures with clearly defined pilliars.  These solid same as Craft composition pilliars made this front of Craft area look like it had windows only in front and not all around the Craft.  Also, it was hard to tell if this green area was not some type of power source and not windows at all BUT they sure looked like windows to us...  These structures were clearly defined as they were flourescent green in color same as the single green light below the Craft. This Object/Craft only had the solid permanent &#34;on&#34; round green light as described above and no type of the required red, green or white flashing navigation type airplane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Craft straighten up again and stopped. The Craft positioned itself so we could only see the bottom again for about 30 seconds.  I tried to take three photos of the Craft and the green light with my camera but the Pic&#39;s even though they were in the view area when Pic was taken did not show up on photo.  The Object/Craft was now close enough to see that it appeared to be emitting enough light from the large lower green light to illuminate the bottom of the craft and make it visible to the eye.  The Craft appeared as a semi-flat gray colored triangle shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At ALL times during the observation of the Object/Craft.  There was NO SOUND at all from the Craft and there was some type of energy either emitting from or surrounding the Craft.  This energy would slightly distort the Crafts perimiter lines.  I can only describe this energy or what I am calling energy as someting that would look like heat waves in the desert on a very hot summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Craft after hovering another 30 seconds began to slowly move forward and descend in altitude moving to the west on the approximate approach path in between Oakland International and SFO Airports.  The Craft at this time was approximately 5,000 feet lowering to 2,000 feet and about one quarter mile from our location.  The Craft appeared to be about twice the size of a 747 aircraft. As the Craft slowly moved off in the distance.  One could see as the Craft moved through some thin low clouds (that added more additional light reflecting from the city lights)that the Craft clearly had less distortion from the energy waves.  The extra light gave us a glimps that the Craft&#39;s surface was non reflective flat gray to egg shell gray in color and had slighly rounded corners in the triangluar shape. Now at a lower altitude and closer proximity it was much clearer to see the craft. We could see that the green light that emitted light was well below the craft and at least approximately 300! feet lower than the Craft.  At this point, I could not tell if the green light illuminated the bottom of the Craft or the Craft actually had a faint green glow emitting from the Craft. This was because no attaching structure could be visibally seen inbetween the Craft and the lower green light at any time..Especially when the Craft passed through the lighted clouds and became more visible and we could not see any ataching structure to the green light.   The lower green light appeared solid in color, round and seemed have been shaped like a sphere.  The overall size of this green light was approximately 5 percent the size of the Craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Craft was stealthy quiet. If we would not have been in our spa watching for satillites we never would have seen this Craft and Event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this Craft slowly move towards San Francisco/Oakland at an estimated 100 mph same as a small private plane&#39;s speed almost stop then proceed and continue at an altitude of approximatel 1000 feet until it was out of view.  The Craft proceededThis heading over San Francisco Bay like it was going to pass right in between the two major airports SFO and OAK.<n>

It was a very clear evening and I was looking up at the night sky.  In the southwest sky there was a light from what appeared to be a planet and to the right and above the planet I noticed another odd, bright light.  It was oblong in shape and had a glowing white oblong light on its underside.  It was moving at a slow pace in a northerly direction.  It seemed to be moving too slow to be an airplane and it seemed to high and too big to be a helicopter.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also saw it and couldn’t explain it.  We watched it for about 2 minutes and then it suddenly disappeared.  We didn’t see it fly off.  It was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time there was  eight twenty pm tonight, Dec. 26. I pressed her for information.   She said both of the flying objects were about two km above the and both were flying slow but the one in the rear was traveling slightly faster and it caught up with the one in front and together they continued slowly in the same direction.  I asked her if they had green red and white lights and she said no.  She said the color was pinkish.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was an arrangement of lights on a power pylon in a nearby field as they were red/orange in colour and unlike the bright white of nearby background stars.  There were 4 lights making a triangle configuration with the fourth light below the lower corner of the triangle.  My partner who was also in the car confirmed the sighting.  As we moved further down the road the lights seemed to separate and it became clear they were not local but much higher in the sky and further away.  We stopped the car so we could assess their movement. At this time we saw what looked like a conventional aircraft (pass between us and the lights).  Soon the lights began separating further, two moving off to the right, one remaining more static to the left and the fourth disappearing from sight.  All of the lights were of a reddish-orange hue and appeared to pulsate slightly in intensity.  Soon all the lights had disappeared from sight.<n>

Just after passing the Waterdown Road exit, we saw what appeared to be numerous planes in the North East sky.  We thought it was odd that there were so many and continued to watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer near Kerns Road we could see a total of 5 lights.  One was huge and did not appear to be moving. It had a flashing blue light and a flashing red light but was way to big to be a airplane or a helicopter. It just stayed in the same spot.  The other 4 lights were further off in the distance behind this one and they were not moving either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept thinking they were planes but they all stayed in the exact same spots and were too low to the ground to be airplanes or even stars.  They all had flashing lights on them. When we got closer we realized just how big the one with the red/blue lights was.  It almost looked like a blimp.  You could see an outline even though it was so dark out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept watching! and we could see it all the way until we exited the highway at Guelph Line.  On our way home we looked for it again and did not see anything.  This morning we were in the same area and looked around to see if it could have been towers, or something else that we were seeing, but there is just nothing there!<n>

The night was partly cloudy, and the night sky was twilight.  There was only one star visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house street runs west to east, I am standing across the street setting up my HDD recorder, I would be looking south to film my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started filming at 17:00 hour. The second song to play is Wizards in winter and that’s when the object appeared at about 17:08.  I first saw the object way before it entered in to the view finder. It was bright and very bold looking in the sky, as nothing could compare to its size or speed.  Best way for me to explain its size is if a star is pin size the object would be pea size.  I can’t imagine it saw it for more than 5 seconds.  It disappeared behind the clouds and I saw it again through the opening of clouds for maybe another second then it went be clouds again.  The object itself seemed to go bright to dim, there was no after burn or anything behind its movement.  Meteors, space junk, don’t know, hopefully there is a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards<n>

I have no paranoia towards UFO or extraterrestrial life forms.  Although I believe their existence highly possible, I believe that this fact has no effect on what I saw.  All three individuals including myself acknowledged the scene that occurred.  All four of us pointed and followed the bright blue object that can only be described as an orb, as it streaked across the sky at a much lower altitude of any airplane.  The orb went south to northeast and was only visible for more than 15 seconds before it vanished very abruptly.  As I alerted the other individuals that it could be a possible UFO, they all dismissed the orb and didn’t mention it all day.  We viewed this in the northern sky in our car near the San Joaquin River.  The orb seemed to be above the water and going in the direction of the river to the north.  I believe I saw something that was not an airplane, and much faster than any remote light or flare. This is not a fake account.<n>

It remained motionless above the mountains which we estimated were 3-5 miles north of Mohawk.  We drove along I-8 for another 15-20 minutes passing through the security checkpoint on I-8.  The object remained visible as we continued along I-8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, we decided to try and get a closer view so we left I-8 at exit 102 and went north as far as the road goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it was about 17:10 and the object was still clearly visible.  As the sun went down the brilliance of the object progressively declined until it was no longer visible at ~17:30.  We tried to take pictures with our low resolution phones but we were still too far away and by then the brilliance of the object had declined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based upon the first sightings form the car we estimate the length of the object to be large...at least the length of a cruise ship and its high r! eflectance (brilliance in sunlight) could only be consistent only with a very highly mirror-like surface.<n>

I decided to finally report this after hearing of so many other incidents that sounded almost exactly like mine which occurred more and more in the months and years after my experience and came to believe it may be related to the UFO phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Christmas night I was sweeping my sons floor and I hear a huge explosion which scared me at first but I immediately assumed it was a large firework from someone messing around and continued sweeping but then immediately realized it was still making an after sound like when you hear the rumble of thunder after a big lightning strike.  It was loud enough to set off a bunch of car alarms and rattle my windows.  When I thought it was thunder I promptly ran outside thinking it might start pouring rain and I had to cover my motorcycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I ran out there looked up and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.  It was one of the clearest nights you could ever find in south Florida.  It couldn&#39;t have been a lightning strike with a clear sky.  I know it wasn&#39;t fireworks because I know exactly what those sound like up close.   My only other thought was a sonic boom which I have heard before but there were no jets or jet sounds, I didn&#39;t even see any regular planes in the sky just stars and I looked very carefully.  My neighbors heard it to but no one had any idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought my story should be out there and wondering how many other people may have heard this boom.<n>

The red light was high in the north western sky.  The light was about as large as Venus appears to the naked eye,  when it is brightest shortly before sunset and shortly before sunrise.  At first, I thought I was looking at Mars, because of the red color, but Mars is not that big and bright, nor does it project such a vibrant red color to the naked eye.  Then 2 more red lights appeared and I noticed all were moving eratically.  I then called out my wife and in-laws to witness this.  It was Xmas night, so my inlaws where over.  By the time they all came out, 2 lights had disappeared, but on remained.  All saw the remaiming red light, moving eratically, until it faded away.<n>

I shouted out to my partner to come check it out thinking perhaps these were fireworks breaching about to begin their descent but then no..... as we watched i then noticed the bottom light flicker a touch and seem to have a little more energy and as they both started to rise, I thought aircraft possibly but then the lights move quickly up and as one of the lights just dissappeared, the bottom one. The other light continued on and seems completely perpendicular in its flight path as it made us kink our necks as it passed above us and then seemingly qite sharply reach the opposite horizon with the other light returning on at least two occasions as the one constant light finally dissappeared from view leaving us totally in awe and questioning what just happened?!! so first ever sighting of this nature but cant explain it through our technology. Anyone Else?<n>
12/25/10 21:15|Hudson (Canada)|QC|Light|4minutes|2 Red orbs; 16 witnesses, Christmas night 2010, Hudson, Quebec|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79494.html|77|ndxe201012| 2 Red orbs; 16 witnesses, Christmas night 2010, Hudson, Quebec<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in Hudson Quebec, Canada, Dec 25, 2010, Christmas evening, at  9:15EST pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I, and my two children aged 26 and 22, were visiting my nephew who lives there.  We were at a gathering of family to celebrate Christmas, a dinner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter had a few pieces of fireworks left over from the summertime.  After supper we all decided to walk over to a schoolyard clearing, a block away, to launch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was about a foot of hard snow on the ground and the temperature late that afternoon was between -10 and -15 degrees below zero (Celsius). There was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 16 of us in all, including three young children. All the others were adults, ages 22 through 60.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nephew, who&#39;s home we were visiting, and a friend of his were present. Both are experienced commercial pilots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a retired mechanical engineer, aged 60. There were several other professionals among us as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set up a few firework sticks in the ground and proceeded to fire them off. There were a total of about 8 pieces, five of which shot simple &#39;light balls&#39;, high up.   I was in charge of the fireworks; the others were situated about 50 feet away for safety. There was one fairly bright streetlight just off to the north-west side of the group.  I was at the bottom of a very slight hill; the others were at the top of the hill. The sky was generally clear, though very slightly hazy in areas,. Stars could easily be seen through this haziness.  The moon was well off in the horizon and had not yet come into our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the final launch, the whole of which took about 10 minutes, one of our girls called out something to the likes of, &#34; Oh, what are those?&#34;.  We all looked up to the West sky, for me partly obscured  by the streetlight. It helped to block out the streetlight with my hand extended, in order to see the objects better.  I then quickly proceeded up the short hill to a better viewing point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ALL witnessed what I can only describe as two glowing ORBS, transitioning from a copper-red, to a golden-white hue (somewhat pulsing)  Their size appeared (comparatively) roughly 10 times the diameter of the planet Jupiter, though not 10x as bright. They were not spectacularly bright, not dull, but clearly visible. If there had been any clear shape patterns/or distortions they would have been noticed. The shapes remained basically oval/spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One pilot estimated  the distances to be roughly  2 kilometers away at elevations of about 2000-3000 feet or so, angled at about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.  The other pilot ventured a height of about 1000ft and perhaps only a kilometer away. A couple of us had seen what was most likely a plane passing far overhead and far above the ORBS, and estimated it to be at perhaps 4000 to 10,000 feet (PET airport is about 50km away)  The ORBS were very clearly visible and well below any cloud mist, the whole of the observed time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly asked if anyone had brought with them a camera. No one answered to the affirmative, even though we  had many cameras back at the house, just a block away. Nevertheless, my niece had indeed brought her old cell-phone camera and had tried to snap a picture. She and her companion reported that the picture did not come out, believing either that there was not enough light or that she was not able to get the objects into focus within that short time they presented themselves to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ORBS were present to our viewing only for about 3-4 minutes, from the time we first discovered them... they may have been there longer, but not observed by us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ORBS were moving slowly in a roughly easterly direction (parallel to the Ottawa river, nearby). They made NO sound that anyone could hear, and we all had stopped to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking at them and they were traveling in our direction, at least at first notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shortly after the fireworks show that we first noticed them. Within the subsequent minute, the ORB at the left appeared to come to a full stop, and did not change in brightness, except for the color changes (about one full cycle per 3 seconds). The second varied at what appeared to be the same rate. This variation transitioned smoothly/continuously, and not in any abrupt off-on manner.   The ORB on the right appeared at first to be about the width of 3-4 fingers apart (held at arms length) from the ORB on the left. It stopped momentarily, dimmed, and then commenced to brighten slowly (until it roughly matched that of the ORD on the left), all while moving forward (or downward) as the other ORB remained put. This movement entailed a short (clockwise) bending pattern movement, then coming around  into  a straighter path, to eventually arrive at a position much closer to the ORB on the left (one finger width). I thought at one instant that it was going to connect up with the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it stayed put and the ORB on the left waited, then slowly moved into a new path towards the south-south-west. Shortly afterword, the second ORB slowly began to move in that same direction, following the other precisely. Both went on their way into the distance and faded out of sight within the 3rd-4th minutes (like fading embers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It really appeared to me that these objects had been observing us and had only changed direction after having noticed that our show was over, or that they had been discovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In discussing with the pilots, they decided to &#39;call in&#39; to their professional contacts to see if any planes were in the area, at this level, perhaps explaining the observations. Two calls were made. There were no confirmations, at that point, of any such low flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We conjectured:    None of the lights were typical of any known plane &#39;standards&#39;, that the pilots could think of. There were NO sounds at all, if one were trying to consider helicopters in the area, as a possible cause.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The amazing coincidence of two objects seemingly communicating with each other, on Christmas evening, at this hour, was very unusual. In particular, the coincidence of our lighting off fireworks (or anyone doing so on this day), and the timing of the ORBS appearance, seems inexplicable. Their substantial change in direction within a minute of our observing them is equally uncanny... they seemed to be watching us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The transitioning lights were not beams of light shining down onto the earth nor into the sky; there were No traces in the slightly misty air. The &#39;entire&#39; objects were clearly glowing, as opposed to lights on the objects; this is unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I showed up to light off the fireworks, (the others had arrived at the clearing about 5 minutes before me), my daughter was explaining to one of the pilots about how her dad was very interested in the subject of UFOs. They were joking of course about it all and then, this new experience occurred. Also, one of the fireworks pieces was called &#39;alien invasion&#39; and my wife was calling out to bring on the aliens, in gesture only. Very weird coincidences indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this was a very real experience that can be confirmed by all present. The three children were unfortunately quite upset and frightened by the sighting. It took us a few hours to calm them afterwards and convince them of some alternate acceptable explanation for all this.<n>

I walked to the shop while still watching.  When i got home i could view them from my window my mother also witnessed it after i called her over to see the strange objects.  They where emitting an orange glow that got brighter then faded very slowly until you could barely see them then it would glow brighter very rapidly.  These objects continued to return to the same part of the sky at night for the next two to three weeks if i recall there was a small section in the news paper briefly mentioning the objects.<n>

The objects where about the size of a quarter and appeared to gain altitude as they rose from the southwest.  They move at a steady rate toward the northwest until they disappeared one by one, (perhaps because of cloud cover.  They did not have the typical green and red airplane running lights. Definitely UFO&#39;s as they were unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/25/10 18:50|Coventry (UK/England)||Light|4-5 seconds originally|Incredibly bright Golden Light interrupts Xmas dinner|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79369.html|83|ndxe201012| Incredibly bright Golden Light interrupts Xmas dinner<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whilst eating Christmas dinner and watching the Christmas episode of Doctor Who a bright light caught my attention through the window of the, south facing, living room.  It was an intense golden colour  surrounded by an orange halo effect, i would estimate it appeared to be roughly 4 times the apparent size of Jupiter, which was visible in the South.  I called my friend&#39;s attention to the light which was travelling far too  quickly to be a Chinese lantern.  The object was on a West by North to East by South trajectory appropriately 30 degrees above the horizon.  We could hear no engine noise and I had time to reach the back door and open it to hear no noise before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions at the time were clear skies, temperature of about -4 degrees Celsius with calm conditions, what little breeze there was was from a SW direction and was measured at 2 K mph by local weather stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ISS was on the other side of the world and this object, I would estimate had an apparent magnitude of about -6, ergo brighter than the ISS ever appears to be and considerably brighter than  Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9it is hard to estimate the objects height. First assumption was Chinese Lantern  but it moved wholly to quickly to be unpowered and simply blown by any wind. Given the brightness of the object, had it been a helicopter or aircraft light, the noise of the engines should have been plainly audible even through double glazed windows. Having managed to make it to the back door to open it as the object was passing from view, again had it been an aircraft or helicopter there should have been audible engine noise, however there was none. I estimate the object covered 3/5 ths of the visible sky , from my back garden, in 10-12 seconds. The object would have been spotted earlier but for a curtain being drawn across 1/3 of the room&#39;s window. I would further pint out that the object caught my eye, the other witness was facing away from the window, whilst watching TV from a lit room, 1x 100 watt bulb, 2 x 60 watt lamps, which again gives some idea of how intensely bright the light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two airports in the vicinity of Coventry,  Baginton, to the South East of Coventry itself and Birmingham international, some 15 miles North West of Coventry. I am use to seeing traffic around the area , including police and rescue helicopters. I have not, as yet, seen any such craft  carrying only a single  visible light commensurate with that we saw tonight and neither has my co witness, who lives in an apartment block close by and has a great view of the sky most nights.  I scanned the sky as the object vanished, from my viewpoint at the back door and their appeared to be no other visible traffic in the air at that time.<n>

I approached the sliding door suspiciously and witnessed 3 lights. These lights reminded me of candlelight. Together these objects moved synchronized in a triangle formation maybe 60 feet from each other and slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were traveling south toward my parents’ home when I had seen them, maybe 1000 yards away. There was a lot of cloud cover. These objects were traveling silently below the clouds and perhaps only 150 yards in the air. My mother curiously went outside to closer examine what we were witnessing.  As these lights approached my location they abruptly stopped 50 yards from my home. As I was standing inside the home, pressing my face to the sliding door, looking straight up into the sky I could not see these objects and where they had stopped from that perspective.  I opened the door and stretched my body out and looked up to watch these objects rise into the clouds and leave.  They left one by one and I watched them rise into the clouds and could still see them until the light dimmed out completely... VERY WEIRD, I haven’t seen anything travel the way this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student with 20/20 vision and I make every attempt to be objective. My mother is a house wife. This was a very chilling experience.<n>

I told my wife to turn up prospect road, cause i see some strange lights. We pulled along the road and i got out of the car, staring at the three lights at the time. I listened and there was no sound. There were cars driving by slowly and i tried to stop them but they drove off fast. The lights were about 50 feet off the ground.  Then all of a sudden two more appeared out of no where. Then two lights streaked across the sky, then the others did the same.<n>

They looked to be round in shape with slightly visible vertical panels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other people I know who saw them from a differnt part of the valley was my brother and his wife with a few other people around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I placed calls to the local police and to the airport and nobody else had made a report and the airport said they didnt see anything.<n>

He ran outside, yelled at me to come out on the deck, and I ran to join him, along with our seven year old daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up in the eastern sky were small, orange spheres of light, silently  and slowly flying to the west.  Each one (we counted 16 in all) was perfectly and evenly spaced from the others, glowing a bright orange, and each one banked to the north at the exact same point in the sky.  The night was completely still, cold, no wind, and as far as we know, there were no other witnesses, even though we live in a highly populated suburb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, an aerospace engineer/physicist, ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars to get a better look at them.  At first he thought they were Chinese lanterns, but upon closer examination with the field glasses, he could ascertain no form, no type of material whatsoever, in their makeup.  They appeared to be made of light.  Also, they did not vary in altitude or waiver in any direction, as might be the case if there had been a current of wind that could affect them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were completely silent, and really beautiful to watch.  I am not a good judge of altitude, unfortunately, but I would estimate that they were about a thousand feet up, and at that height, appeared to about the size of a basketball in the sky.  They came in groups of two, then four, but all precisely spaced apart.  We saw 16 in all, but I suspect that we had missed the first groupings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our seven year old was entranced by them, and yelled her opinion of the event with great awe:  &#34;Santa Claus!!&#34;<n>

My mom, sister, and dad went outside and saw it as it continued to slowly move over the hills east bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes from when I first spotted it, i lost sight of it behind a tree.  I then got back in my car to follow the object and as soon as I got to a spot where I should have been able to see it again, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove around the area for over 20 minutes looking for it and there was no sight of it.  At the speed it was traveling and its location, it is virtually impossible for it to have just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was VERY big, I would compare it to the size of 3 blimps put together.  What was most interesting about it was its very obvious saucer-like shape and very bright flickering lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

I happened to look to the sky and noticed one blue light in the south/southwest area of the sky. I immediately told my friend to look. We watched it as we quickly found somewhere to park and observe this object.  The object was blue when we had first seen it, but by the time we had parked it was red.  The object then changed colours again, this time it was white. Neither of us could make out the shape of the object.  It flew very quickly, from one end of the sky to the other, neither of us had seen anything fly that quickly before. It changed directions erratically. One minute it would be flying east, and the next it would be flying west. A few times it would seem to change altitudes as well. The whole time we observed the object it continued changing colours, blue, red, and white. The white seemed exceptionally bright. They were not flashing! lights, and they would remain one colour a few seconds before changing again. The anomalous  flight pattern continued for approximately three minutes, at which time it just seemed to simply disappear.<n>

All or most was viewed by my neighbors and my mom who was in another location.  No sound was heard.  I estimate altitude of between 10000 and 15000 feet.  Possible less.  Sky was clear.  The were a few prop driven aircraft in the vicinity and some higher altitude jet traffic<n>

It was a red circle with three flashing silver/white dots going around it. It slowly started to circle down. We watched for a while then were forced to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the second one at approximately  22:35 it was a oddly shaped outline,like nothing I have ever seen before,the out line looked like it was made up of small stars.  Flashing silver/white lights a red light was in the top region and it looked kind of like a plane flying backwards made of small stars and lights.<n>

The red light seemed too big to be an airplane, and it seemed to waiver a bit at times as it was heading toward the East side of the river.  It then traveled upwards and then seem to dissipate into thin air.  Within a few minutes another was &#34;launched?&#34; from the same spot and the same thing happened.   Following a few minutes later by another, and then three in a row.  Being the night of the Solstice, was it someone with some kind of light that could be launched and then burn at such a high altitude that someone launched?<n>

I pulled over to look at it.  The object shot across (over me), Sarah got out of the car, the object shot straight upward in the air (leaving no cloud, or making no noise)  It took fast for object to move over to me.  I noticed a couple other objects (these looked like planes on me, but they were very fast (faster than a jet)).  These objects were close to each other.  They appeared to cross paths.  I saw another that looked like a plane (this made a plane noise)  I saw another object that also shot straight up in the air.  Sarah saw another object, that was far away and disappearing.  I immideatley said and thought that I have never seen this before, and I have never seen this many planes in the same airspace (especially where I live (I live about 20 miles, so I see some planes, but not 5 or 6 in the same airspace).  The two objects tha! t were flying UPWARD had red and white lights BUT A LOT.  These objects were a kind of oval/rectangle look.  THESE WERE SO FAST.  The other objects had red and white lights but on one I don&#39;t remember seeing what kind of lights.  It was hard to really process everything happening because it seemed as if these objects were coming from different areas, except for the two objects that came after the first object shot upward.  ALL the objects though traveled in a different direction (to my right, which I am logically guesing is West)  It all happened so fast and they disappeared rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The UFO was guessed to be a 30 minute drive from their home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are familiar with planets such a Jupiter (which is currently shining in the southwestern sky at this time.)  The craft hovered for over three hours.  The viewers were frightened and did not attempt to get in a vehicle to drive closer for a better view.  They did, however, use binoculars in their attempt to describe the craft.  It was, as stated to me, definitely a sphere, definitely rotating, possessing colored lights around its perimeter, and it maintained a consistent altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 40 year old daughter saw the craft, after nearly three hours of viewing....simply VANISH into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is the credibility of these witnesses?

After a long while everyone had gone inside and I was left alone for a moment and noticed a glowing orange ball of light low in the sky around 100 yards or so away slowly drifting diagonaly across my neighborhood.  My first thought was that it was a blimp or helicopter, but it made no noise, had no blinking lights and was only about 200 feet up. My mom came out and I could only point. She ran and knocked on the neighbors door and I could still only point and say &#34;look&#34;. For the next 5 to 8 minutes we watched it drift over the neighborhood then straight up, hover for awhile, flash a couple times, then away into the clouds. we all took turns looking at it with my binoculars and we&#39;re all stumped as to what it was<n>

It was first seen coming from the SSE direction. It was travelling about the speed of a fighter jet, but made no sound.  The object had no blinking lights, therefore omitting the possibility of it being a plane or helicopter.  It moved very fast, but slowed down and sped up again...twice. Also, when it changed speeds, it changed it&#39;s direction.  While still travelling forwards, it banked down and then back up many times.  The object seemed to go dim and bright again many times. The light seemed brighter as it came towards us, but was dim as it left in the NNW direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and four of my friends were watching the lunar eclipse that night, and when the clouds blocked the moon, we began walking back to the house.  This object was below the clouds, maybe 1000ft above the ground.  We were only able to observe it for roughly 30 - 40 seconds.  It disappeared out of our view beyond some trees in the NNW direction.<n>

We spotted two very bright (but off white) round lights very close together in the sky.  It alarmed us because it looked nothing like any airplane lights we&#39;d ever seen.  It seemed to be barely moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden, the lights went out and bright strobe type lights started rolling in a pattern from left to right (about 10 lights).  The speed accelerated and we couldn&#39;t keep it in our site for long as it zipped across the sky.  It was dark and we were driving so we could not make out a shape....only lights.<n>

Then it changed colors, it would go from white to green. Then two little white objects flew around it and disappeared into the bigger object. My husband and I also witnessed it and we saw the colors change. We saw that it was moving up and down and from side to side and the lights were pulsating. Unfortunately it is dark outside so we cant tell for sure the actual shape and size and our camera wouldn&#39;t pick it up. By the way it changed colors and how it moved it could not have been a satellite or an air plane. We just don&#39;t know what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still dark and you could see the stars real well.  As we were standing in the blind looking to the north, two bright objects suddenly appeared just to the left and below the Star Polaris.  One object was slightly below the other and both were very bright.

I watched as it started gaining, then dropping altitude, and what appeared to be broad spotlight(s) coming from the center, and sweeping.  It then dropped altitude, and out of curiosity, I grabbed my ultra bright white LED light, and used the strobe function, pointed directly at the object.  The object itself started flashing, first slowly, then rapidly, then slowly again.  I then switched it to fixed beam, and started slow sweeping motions, left, then right, then up and down.  It followed the track of my light almost perfectly.  I then turned my light off, and watched the object start making circles, then figure eights, and then stopping.  It repeated these movements four or five times before I turned my light on again, and pointed it directly at the object.  I repeated the sweeping motions left to right, up and down, ! and again it followed the light.  I then QUICKLY moved the beam to the left, and it followed.  Moved the beam to the right, it followed again.  I then replicated it&#39;s movements (circles and figure eights) and it followed the beam.  It was at that time I had observed a yellowish-white light coming from the bottom of the object, in a vertical axis towards the ground.  It quickly gained altitude, and stopped.  I also observed what appeared to be five smaller, independent objects shoot out from the center of the object, and make circles (almost as if sweeping a 3-Dimensional Perimeter) and return to the center of the object.  I also noticed what appeared to be a military aircraft in the vicinity that was completely blacked out except for the one rear flashing red light as it was coming from the north.  It appeared to be making a large circle around the object (I am not sure on the radius, I saw it make a shift to the south east, and then didn&#39;t see it again).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the same, exactly the same object again. This time it was in the city itself. I had come down from my 12th floor apartment to a grocery store downstairs. I was just leaving the grocery store when I noticed a strikingly similar object that I saw yesterday. It was same light, same intesity, no sound. This time, it was hovering above a 15 storey residential building across the street. I was thinking to myself, what the heck, am I imagining it myself, then I called the gorcery store man and showed him the light. Another person walking by also saw. He was also amazed. The light stood above the building for well over a minute. Then it started to move away from us in a horizontal plane at a much faster pace. I could notice it until it disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved very slowly and smoothly in the sky and made no sound. It was a deep orange color, and looked like it was glowing.  It was the same color as an orange street lamp, or similar to a fireball, but it was pretty stable looking.  It moved from east to west, then somewhat towards me and then it just stopped. It hovered for about a minute.  It was cloudy and drizzling so I assumed it was pretty low in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was a helicopter by the speed and way it was moving, but the fact that it didn&#39;t make any sound and there were no blinking lights, had me intrigued.  I watched it for about 2-3 minutes. It hovered in one spot, then appeared to dim, or ascend up into the clouds until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I joked before I actually looked.  When I did look, I could not identify what these were.  There were three black/metallic objects hovering mid air and rotating at a very high rate of speed on their horizontal axis.  The objects were large in size and unlike anything I ever seen before.  The objects were also in a very tight formation.  Other cars noticed the objects, as there were brake lights illuminated in great number ahead of us.  My vision of the objects became obscured by trees for a matter of three seconds.  The objects were gone. It took us about another 5 seconds to relocate the objects which were now directly over downtown Norfolk, but now were 4 in number.   I watched for another 5 seconds and the objects... for lack of a better description zoomed away at a VER! Y high rate of speed.<n>

When I got out I looked to the sky because it was such a beautiful night.  The sky was very clear and the temperature was about 26-30 degrees F.  There were stars shining all over the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly, some type of craft located just to my left jetted off in a westerly direction leaving what appeared to be was a rocket blast from a space shuttle, or some type of rocket.  Then, while I was standing there in total shock another one jetted off from the exact same spot headed in a northerly direction.  The trail of rocket exhaust or smoke or whatever it was, lasted for approximately 100-750 yards and just stopped.  That exhaust or smoke was absolutely bright white against the dark background of the sky.  I did not see any vehicle emitting that exhaust or smoke.  I could hear the rush of the exhaust/smoke. Other than that, the night was perfectly quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all happened so close to the ground. I was really in shock and awed.  Frankly, I was so afraid that I could not take a step. I felt dazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion is that at least two UFO vehicles were hovering in the field at approximately 1,500-3,000 feet, and when I drove up near that dark field with my headlights on they decided to move on.  They were probably even closer to the ground than 1,500-3,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought nothing of it, but then it started moving weird.. kinda in a squiggle shape..  BUT it wasnt slow, it was fast, like how a bug moves, only it was REALLY BIG... and it wasnt far enough away to be a plane.. it looked like it was right across the field over by that one kids house that rode my bus...  It was freaky. I slowed down and stopped and watched it.. it was flashing very weirdly.. Like it wasnt flashing more like.. pulsating..  anyway it slowed down and started going slow towards hillsdale.. and it got dimmer.. and dimmer.. and dimmer.. then it disappeared.. then it did 1 more bright flash then vanished completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home and told my brother... then about 5 mins later my dad came home and HE says he saw something too. BIZARRE!  He said he saw something near Coldwater though, that looked like a comet, that had a sparkly tail, but it kept blinking on for awhile then off.. then back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out looking for about an hour, but didnt see anything additional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is significant because neither of us really ever talk about UFOs, much less see one, and since we both saw something weird at the same time, it was really bizarre.<n>

If came from one side of the road towards the center cutting in front of our car.  (Driver thought she hit it but no evidence.) The object was the size of a dinner plate and looked like a crab but moved like it hoovered not walked.  It was black with two bubble like eyes on the top.  There may have been, not sure due to the split second appearance, another stick like object that moved away the other direction.  The object had &#34;legs&#34; that I can only say were not functioning to move it.  First thought was it was a creature or something being blown across the road however there was not a breath of air, just very cold (10 degrees at most).  It did not move in a this world order.  It may have had a gray or silver ring around the outer edge.  This all happened in a matter of two to three seconds.  Driver and myself, a back seat passenger leaning over the front seat, saw the object and both saw the sam! e thing as we discussed it.

While driving, I saw two steady white lights in the sky south of my location.  They were up about as high as a traffic helicopter might be.  As I approached between Magic Mountain Parkway and Valencia Boulevard, I realized that whatever was up there wasn&#39;t moving.  It was just hanging there in the sky.  There were no strobes, there were no other colors. Just two, maybe three white lights.  Once I got to Valencia Boulevard, and the object was within view, the lights turned off.  The object was still there, I could see an outline/shadow of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the shape because I was traveling at highway speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I passed under it and passed ahead of it I lost sight of it.

It too, left a trail that vanished instantly. I then saw yet another light zooming through some trees to my right and then stop on a dime and seemingly stare at me. I at that point ran inside and heard my tv get louder and make stactic sounds. Please help me, am I insane?<n>

While night hunting in rural Runnells County on the 15th I saw them only once and then on the 16th my son and I saw them as many as 8 different times between 630 pm and 730 pm.  The lights were at a low angle, approximately 30 degrees.  The lights were circular and would come on and go off and then another would come on in a different location.  It happened fast enough and over a distance large enough that it could not have been a plane.   We never saw the lights move, they only came on went off and then reappeared in another location. The lights were very bright, much brighter and larger than a star and even much brighter than Venus. It was hard to tell the distance, however they were below 30,000 ft as they were underneath the Cirrus  Toward the end of the sightings we noticed what seemed t! o be an increased number of aircraft flying into the area we had been seeing the lights. I’m a Meteorologist and have watched the skies for many years with a discerning eye and I’ve never seen anything like those lights before!<n>

It was descending from the sky and was about to land on the traffic ahead of us - slightly further east.  I pulled off to the side of the road as it looked like it was going to collide with the traffic on the busy road just ahead of us.  We were amazed that there was no collision and it just disappeared.

All the time the object hovered in almost the same spot, ( south of us and about 4 hundred yards up and 2 to 3 hundred yards south of us.)  I too came on to the front patio and watched theobject through the binoculers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight the sky is totally clear of cloud, stars can be clearly seen, and no lights from other houses, street lights or city lights obscure the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through binoculers, the image is clear enough to make out that it is circular in shape, tilting edge on and then slowly tilting to show a round shape, it has a circlemade up of white lights and about five to six coloured lights spread evenly around its edge, ( these range from blue, red, green and yellow).  It is still there now as I type, another similar object appeared and then moved of lower then the one we can still see.  We are on the flight approach to Valencia airport, ( 22 miles away), so we are used to seeing lights from planes and helicopters day and night, this is definately not either of them or a weather balloon, it&#39;s too clear and bright to mistake it for anything other then what it is, a strobe like flashing circle! It has just gone now, so we have watched it for over an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in our fifties, have not been drinking or taken any drugs for medication or recreation, I am a interior designer and my partner is a garden designer. He has a lot of knowledge of space, science and things real. I also have a real world knowledge, and we are both level headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden I heard what sounded like a low, deep hum of what I thought was a cessna sitting on a runway just running the engine. I kept watching to the north where it was coming from. After about 10-15 seconds, two bright white lights appeared over the top of the next building, and heading towards over my building heading south. It appeared to be at about 500 feet above. I watched it was my jaw dropped. I was not scared of it, and in fact felt really comfortable, and even peace.  As it slowly, but continuously floated overhead, I noticed that it was a triangle!  The front was like two &#34;headlights&#34;. They were in the front of it, not below it. And as it was right above me, I noticed the back of the craft (triangle) had a light at that end also.  There were no lights underneath it.  The lights were reflecting the undercarriage where I noticed that it appeared to be a whitish-grey color.  I noticed some detail on it&#39;s belly like what looked like a long pipe running up one of the sides of the belly.  It didn&#39;t stop, or use any kind of spot lights. It just kept moving south until it moved completly over my building, and out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total amount of time that passed from start to finish was about two minutes.  I looked at the clock as soon as I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, and it said 11:00pm California time.  After that, I couldn&#39;t get to sleep so I just laid in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 12:15am, I heard that same exact sound again, and just laid there. I didn&#39;t know whether to get up and go look, or stay in bed where it was warm... I stayed in bed and now regret it.  I heard it for 15 minutes before it slowly got quieter, then complete silence.  I wish I had not made the decision to stay in bed.  What if this really was a UFO? That was a one-in-a-million chance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearby, there is Mountain View, CA where there used to be a NASA base. However, they do not test anything there. Up in the nearby Santa Cruz mountains, there is a secret military base where only God knows what goes on. There was nothing in the sky before the sighting, and nothing after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am wondering if anybody else saw this? It was realatively early as there was still alot of cars driving on the streets, etc.<n>

It would travel one way then the other maybe 90&#39; or so.  Did not think much but I began to notice it didn&#39;t have any nav lights, beacons or strobes and I found that odd.  It traveled at aprox. 120-200 knots, about what I would expect of a aircraft.  We are close to Felts Field but the tower was closed at this time and it was not in the pattern or even close and it was not on approach to Spokane Int or Fairchild AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my cell phone camera and decided to take about 20 pictures. I forgot about them then the other day I looked at them and noticed a object above the bright light.  It seems to take several different forms and changes form.  I realized my phone was a video also and took a video and in the video, on frame by frame play only you can see the object! go behind the bright light then back which you could not see at normal speed.  Also you can hear the sound of what sounds like a jet aircraft but during this all I heard nothing.  I did have my truck running during most of the time which would have covered any sounds but when I turned it off I don&#39;t recall any sounds.  I have a extensive aviation background, could fly before I could drive, lived on a airport, father is a retired 747 pilot, I know aircraft and this was not any type known to myself.  I don&#39;t have any idea what it is and I find it very interesting, whatever it is?<n>

On December 15, 2010 at approximately 9:20pm I was outside enjoying the cool evening and waiting for my oldest son to drive in from school. About ¼ mile from my house is a local high school.  The stadium lights were on since there was a soccer match being played.  I was looking south in the direction of the school when I noticed a fairly large light to my right about 1 mile away heading from west to east. It was on a track that would take it between my house and the school. At first I thought it was a plane but then I realized it was far too low. Then I thought it may have been a helicopter but as I continued to watch this light I noticed that there was no sound at all coming from the direction of the light. The light continued to move in an easterly direction at an amazingly slow speed. As it neared my location I could tell that it wasn’t just a single light. It was an enormous v shaped ! object with 3 almost blindingly bright lights on the under side of each “wing”. This object passed slowly between my location and the school at an altitude of less than 1000 feet. It continued moving east until it got just passed my location. As I was watching this object it simply vanished. Literally in the blink of an eye it was gone. The next morning as I was dropping my youngest son off at school I was stopped by the religion instructor who is a friend of mine. He excitedly began to tell me about the object he had seen the night before. His sighting lasted considerably longer than mine. He was driving back from a function when he saw this object. When he first saw the object it was moving very slowly in a southerly direction at less than 1000 feet. He watched the object for several minutes until it simply vanished. Within just a couple of seconds it reappeared at a distance my friend estimated to be at least 1 ½ miles away. My friend drove toward the object’s new locati! on and actually got to a point where he was nearly directly un! der this object. He confirmed that it had 3 lights under each wing and that it was an enormous v shaped craft. He also confirmed that it was completely silent. He continued to watch the object moving now in a westerly direction for another 30 seconds until the thing vanished again. That was the last time he saw it. My friend later learned that at least 10 kids who are students at the school also saw this thing.<n>

It was 6:30am about dawn, but sky was still dark, and no other stars were visible. Then I noticed that object did not look exactly like star a planet – it had dimensions. It was not a plane – it was not moving, and it was too bright for helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the object through 24x binocular and found out that I was not able to recognize – a circle with a smaller circle in the middle (like a hole in the middle of parachute) covered with small bright lights (from 20 to 40 lights) that were slowly moving, so the shape of object was instantly and slowly changing. It looked slow fluctuations or as jelly fish moves – I don’t insist that these moves were real – they may be explained by thermal airflows or small moves of binocular in hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to identify this object to any known flying object, so I think it was UFO. The only person who witnessed the event was my brother.  Around 6:50 the object stayed at the same spot , but became smaller, it looked like a regular star, though closer to 7am the sky was light, and no stars could be visible. Through binocular I still could see object structure with less details. At 7:05am the object was covered by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not have camera or camcorder with high resolution that would allow to show object structure, so I did not make any pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Quickly realizing it was too large it began to grow in front of my eyes.  It started turning and grew to at least 20 ft across as it grew I could see a structure through the material.  The internal structure resembled a birds wing bones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It became solid and then as it was gliding up the mountainside two concentric rings were visible the inside bubble looked like it held some kind of vapor the outside was a ring of blue as bright as neon.  It pulsed and went straight up into the sky pulsed again and  again and was only a black dot that disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, I noticed flashes of lights to my left and then to my right, it was as if flashbulbs were going off all over the sky.  I drew several pictures of the craft as soon as I came back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I has called my mother to view the structure but she did not get there in time.<n>

As I have never really seen any strange lights in the sky before, I had to make sure my brother witnessed this with me as I am on pain medication and I did not want to be made a joke of with my dad, I am very glad I did this, as now my brother and I have really seen the lights and can believe.<n>

I went back inside house to go upstairs and get a better view from upstairs window. I also got my wife to come and look. We watched the object for about 15 minutes. The object stayed in same position for about 10 minutes,then moved west for a few minutes slowly, then just vanished. There were some clouds in sky last night but not near object at the time. It definitely was not an airplane or helicopter. Ive lived near airport my whole life and have seen thousands of planes before and this was way to bright and big to even come close to compare it to. The object pulsated a few times even brighter, it changed colors like a star twinkling in sky, I looked through my binoculars also and can distinctively see it changing all different colors, red, blue, green, yellow, but at the same time it always had a bright white light coming from it continually. I also took a s! hort video of it from my camera, it doesn&#39;t have a good zoom on it, but you can definitely see how bright it was in comparison to the street lights in video. I will transfer video when I  get home. I also checked the reports of ufo sightings and someone else posted about same object, but at different time. I was really excited to see that other people seen this also!! I hope more reports come in and.ill be ready with a better camera if it comes back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects were flying low, just above the tree line and flew in the same direction I was traveling.  I pulled my car over and observed the two orange lights begin to fly in separate, opposite directions.  After a moment one of the lights stopped and the other orange sphere began to move towards the other light. Both of the orange spheres appeared to release on object that resembled a shooting star.  They then joined together, with no apparent change in the size of the lights, and then they accelerated straight up into the night sky until they completely disappeared out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a lifetime resident of this county and had never before witnessed a UFO, but I firmly believe that this object was not of an Earthly origin.  Its actions and movements did not appear to resemble any plane or other flying object that I have witnessed.  I was stunned at what I had seen because it was an amazing incident that does not happen everyday.  I phoned a friend to tell him what I had observed and he directed me to report this sighting to you’re website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The trail was a great deal of length based on size of front object.<n>

On the way up 101, we stopped at a place that has a Burl Forest, I’m not sure exactly where this is because we aren’t from Washington, so I looked on the map and I’m guessing it’s in the Kalaloch area?  So we went down to the beach, it was around 3 in the afternoon.  There is a little island off the shore with a lighthouse on it. It was mostly cloudy, I think this was on December 14th.  So we are looking out over the ocean, and what appears to be a jet, dips down out of the clouds over the island.  So we look at it, but suddenly it tips up, and it isn’t a jet because it is disc shaped.  It leveled back down again, and started bobbling, for lack of a better term, it was flying like how a school of fish would swim.  Then it headed back away from the beach and disappeared.  Judging by the vicinity of the island it was above, I would estimate that the vehicle was about ¼ the size of the island?  So it was kind ! of big.<n>

The movement was erratic and it first I thought it was an airboat spinning around and moving over the shallow flats, but there was no sound and as it moved it became obvious that it was above the water...several hundred feet.  The object was approximately 1 mile offshore.  The lights were red, green and blue with a spotlight pointed straight down. There was a haze around the object...making it blurry to the naked eye. The object was visible for almost thirty minutes then simply vanished...almost like someone turned off the lights.  I tried to video the object but my camera did not register the light...it was a black screen.  I walk my dog almost every night around 3am and we just moved into this new house.  Trust me when I tell you that I will be looking every night for this object again!<n>

It blinked every 10 seconds with an intensity near that of or slightly brighter than the adjacent stars.  The light remained stationary for 10 minutes before it ceased entirely. It appearred to be at high altitude. It was cold and late so there was little ambient noise.  No sound was detected but not surprising given the distance it appeared to us to be at.<n>
12/13/10 22:00|Salaya (Thailand)||Light|10 minutes|Dancing multi-colored UFO videotaped for 5 minutes by married couple in Salaya, Thailand.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79273.html|181|ndxe201012| Dancing multi-colored UFO videotaped for 5 minutes by married couple in Salaya, Thailand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This UFO was videoed by my colleague at work, and witnessed by his wife and him. The witnesses are both in their 30s and college educated professionals. The sighting occurred on Monday night, December 13, 2010 at around 10 p.m. Bangkok time. Location: Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand near the Mahidol University campus from their Crystal Place complex 6th floor apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was smoking a cigarette on their 6th floor balcony when he first noticed a bright light in the sky, which turned into a bright line. He first thought it was a star, then a satellite, and then an airplane, because it was multicolored and was more than just a point source. However, it hung in one place in the sky, so he called to his wife to come out and bring his video camera, because he wanted to use the telephoto zoom on the camera to enhance the image and try to explain the mystery of what they were witnessing. He mounted the camera on a tripod and used the camera&#39;s telephoto lens to zoom in on it to get a higher magnification. That was when they both noticed it was dancing very rapidly in snake-like or worm-like movements, but in the same place in the sky. They were looking toward the southern sky.  They actually saw 3 of these dancing lights but filmed only one of them. The light you first see in the video is a light on the side of their apartment building, which provi! des some reference to the angle of elevation.  He estimated it was perhaps 10,000 feet above the aircraft passing underneath on approach to Bangkok (BKK) Suvarnabhumi Airport, so the altitude might have been around 15,000 feet. The choppiness you see in the video is definitely part of the phenomenon, because the speed of the video is normal, not sped up or slowed down.  This can be verified by the audio comments they both made, which are quite interesting to listen to.  To the naked eye the UFO appeared like a bright light or line in the sky; only under telephoto magnification, with the camera mounted firmly on a tripod, were the strange worm-like maneuverings observable on the camcorder&#39;s digital display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we watched it for the first time in the office, Wednesday December 15th, one of our colleagues commented that it looked like the UFO was spelling out writing in the sky. It is strange and inexplicable that there appears to be a quarter-second pause between each &#34;dance&#34;, which does make it look like a form of signaling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camera information: HDD JVC model GZ-MG750 800k pixel with 1.8x magnification high definition 43mm telephoto lens. Camera was on a tripod, so the motion is NOT due to hand movement of the camera (except at one short point when he moves the camera). It was videoed at normal cameraspeed. I can vouch that this is an authentic, untouched video with absolutely NO added special effects. What you are seeing in the video is not a star, planet, satellite, airplane, balloon, or any other prosaic explanation. It&#39;s a definite unknown! Report submitted by Donald A.

Beyond this street is  vacant land and a clear view of the open sky where we can see plenty of stars on a clear sky. Tonight my wife and I witnessed something we have never seen before in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky was a very bright round shaped object which continued to change colors from red to green to orange. From its left side and then bottom it shot out about half a dozen orange yellow colored objects which were small at first and then grew larger and suddenly vanished. The second set was about a dozen of the same objects which again glowing, first small and then grew larger and suddenly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident appeared to have resembled blowing bubbles where at first they appear to be stuck together and then find their own shape as circles and then take off like the speed of sound. The object continues to remain in the sky as I write this letter. The object gets brighter and then returns to a stable strobe of green orange and red lights.  From Queen Creek the object appears to be over the ASU Polytechnic Campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers background is US Marine Veteran and Retail Manager<n>

This route at that point goes straight east.  In the sky east-north-east about 15 degrees from true east was a type of UFO seen before in the desert of Eastern Oregon.  The craft was impersonating a jet aircraft, but the contrail was short, stubby, too wide, and too dense to be a real jet contrail.  The rising Sun was reflecting off the object, and creating an opalescent/rainbow sheen that real contrails don&#39;t have. The craft was barely moving at all against the morning sky.  Later the whole thing seemed solid, like the edge of a huge disk.<n>

It is a popular place for people to park at night and just watch the boats go by  and chat with a coffee or something - so we weren&#39;t alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually noticed a blue-white changing light scoping up and down the Manasquan inlet parking side.  Briefly it went down the road leading to the parking, closest to the beach and returned scoping up and down the parking.  We didn&#39;t think anything of it at first - thought it was a flash light or a laser pointer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed it going into the water near what we call the Dog Island area - near the bridge of Route 35-and saw it emerge with a second sphere.  They were perfectly in alignment with each other while moving - zig zagging even - and then they would go off in different directions scoping the area again and then re-connect (erratic movements and then sometimes in formation).  We were curious about this, as it came OUT of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got out of the car--and saw several other people who were parked there get out of their car too -- a dozen of us just talking about what was happening over the inlet.  They went again in the direction of Dog Island after scouting both sides of the inlet and then both went underwater -- only to re-emerge with a third sphere, one after the other.  They moved in triangular formations - equally spaced apart - and then would go off in their own directions before reforming again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, a lot of us were just speechless - all watching in silence.   After say 15 minutes - 20 minutes, they shot off to Dog Island itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was eager to see more of it.  By the time we crossed the bridge to the other side of the inlet, we didn&#39;t see anything.  It was the most peculiar thing and seemed to be changing colors between blue and white - although that is all I can remember after so much time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They didn&#39;t seem very big.  Just spheres that were initially thought to be a flashlight projection, or something similar to what could be projected by a laser pointer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silent too.  Didn&#39;t hear sounds as the lights came out of the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The position of these dots would form the corners of a triangle with the two corners on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  proceeded to start yelling for anyone that could help verify, but no one responded at this time.  While yelling the  bottom right dot started to move toward the upper right dot while the left dot remainded stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two dots  them came close together then the whole formation seemed to head east, and that is when I finally ran inside and  summonded my friend Brent who came to see the end of the first event pluse the second event also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brent and I together witnessed the lights disappear in the east in the formation specified...this ends the first  event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following the first event, Brent and I discussed the options and possibilites of what we has just witnessed for a  little while before he decided to retire inside while I still watched the early morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 minutes  lights once again graced the eastern sky....i summoned Brent and he summoned Kathey who would be the third witness  to tonights events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second event consisted of about seven objects in the eastern sky positioned side by  side  each other, slightly above the horizen with 2 of the objects on the right being very close to each other. I believe  this was object number 3and4 from the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again the objects seemed to slowly disappear in the eastern sky  after several minutes.

My boyfriend and I were doing laundry at the local laundry mat. We parked in the back of the building which is on a main road that runs west and east from the Everglades to the Atlantic Ocean. This location is about 10 blocks from the Everglades which is right on the other side of the Sawgrass Expressway (literally). My boyfriend went inside to check on the clothes in the dryers and I stayed in the passenger seat of our car. I was watching videos on my phone when I got a weird urge to look out at the sky so looked out the passenger window. I was shocked to see what appeared to be the big dipper constellation because stars are hard to see in our city due to all the light pollution. What caught my attention was that more of these &#34;stars&#34; began to appear. I then realized I was looking at a cluster of orange orbs moving rapidly from west to east and immediately got out of the car. I ! yelled for my boyfriend to come outside NOW! And I&#39;ll be darned if as soon as I did they began to disappear. By the time my boyfriend was able to get outside only 3-5 were left. They made no sound. This entire event took place in the span of about 20 seconds. I am very disappointed that I did not have a chance to grab any videos or pictures. I have lived in Broward County my whole life and never saw anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a resident here I am very familiar with how airplanes appear at a low altitude since I work right next to an executive airport and Fort Lauderdale International is right off of I95. Anyone who has driven on I95 enough times could tell you about seeing the Que planes form before landing and experiencing having a Boeing fly 50 ft above your car as they drop the gears for a touchdown. An airplane has red white and green or blue lights. These were NOT planes. I was a logical optimist; a &#34;the universe is too vast for us to flat out say we are alone&#34; type of person. I am undoubtedly a believer now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approximately 8:50 PM. I noticed a spherical shaped object flying over the center of my vehicle. Other people noticed it as well. They hit their brakes to slow down and stare. It was similar to a meteor, yet there was no tail and it was larger than any meteor I had witnessed. The sphere was blue, strangely like the blue in the movie Tron.  It lingered over the 2nd car in front of me; and followed at the same speed for a couple of minutes. It bounced forward in the air, much like a stone being skipped. Then, it behaved like a balloon that had been blown up and set free; as it darted to the right quickly, and then to the left and up. Next, it shot down to the left of the freeway as if it was going crash hard. I watched as I passed where I believed  there would be an ultimate explosion, smoke, or signs of a helicopter or plane crash.There ! was nothing. It was gone  Even though it had erratic movements, I still wanted to believe that it was a known craft. It looked and behaved like nothing I have seen in reality.  Only on t.v. and in movies have I seen something move that far, that fast. I thought of the possibilities such as a search light, but there was no beam extending to the ground, and it was smaller. I thought about it being a helicopter when it was over the 2nd car, so I cracked my window and heard no engine sound.  I have looked on you tube to see of anyone posted a video of it. I saw this one which does look like the sphere and the shade of blue.I doesn&#39;t have the same movements. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjBapdW5jS0&amp;NR=1)  I do not know the person who posted the video, so I can&#39;t say that it is true or not.

As we drove down I-91 South I noticed a trio of lights far in the distance. I told them to look at what was ahead, and we all found it strange.  At a first glance it looked like stadium lights, but then I realized there were no stadiums anywhere near the highway and this object was floating. As we continued to drive and watch this object, it came closer and closer very quickly. This was strange as it seemed so far away.  It was very dark outside so the color of the object was not seen. The lights were white and flickered very slightly.  Before I could get a picture of it the object flew over the trees to the right of us and out of our sight.<n>

I had to move a car from the back and park out front. After I parked the car I started to walk back to my shop. The walk is approximately 60 feet. It was a cool clear night, the stars were out with almost no clouds. As I walked back I saw how calm and clear it was. So I decided to stop and just admire how nice it was. There I stood for a good minute looking upward at the southern sky. Nothing obstructed my view, and I was looking in the same general direction the whole time. My eyes were about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said I was looking at the sky for a good minute and I am sure nothing but stars were there. Then suddenly in the calm and clear sky it appeared. Yes it just appeared, as if someone had flicked a light switch.  It was a very, very bright round sphere. It had a distinct edge to it.  It was a lime green color with a green lighted haze or fog pulsating and radiating all around it.  In relation to where I was standing I would have to say it was 400 feet forward.  The height was at least 250 to 350 feet up now judging from its position above the house below it.  To where I was the size was like a basket ball. Next to the stars it was much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed there for at least 7 to 10 seconds, not moving an inch from where it appeared. Not getting any dimmer, or changing in any way.  When without any warning or change it quickly darted directly downward, leaving a straight bright lighted green haze trail behind it.  Within 10 seconds the lighted trail diminished completely, and nothing was there.  The whole incident happened quickly and only lasted at the most 20 seconds from start to finish.<n>

We could barely make out the shapes of the vehicles before they were out of sight, all we saw were 3 very fast, cigar shaped crafts flying very close to the ground.  The light that was coming off the vehicle woke up a lot of neighbors and blurred our vision.

We were told we had to head out that same night because the shoot was o the 11th at 7 AM.  Therefore, we decided to head out around 9 pm.  After heading out from Miami, and being on the road for about an hour and half or two, we had a UFO sighting.  I was driving on I75 North (alligator alley), it was very dark and we were the only car on the road during that time.  There was nothing around us, and the sky was absolutely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden the other model, which is sitting on the passenger seat, asks, “What is that?”, pointing to something that was heading towards us.  I immediately answered without even paying much attention to it, “Oh it must be an airplane”, and she said “No, that is NOT an airplane”..<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we starred at it as if it was flying towards us.  We were going 70 MPH, and this all happened in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object flew right above our car and it was about 200 to 300 feet high.  It was absolutely shocking, and unexplainable. It flew so close to our car that we were able to see the object very clearly. We can describe it as a capital letter I , and it had four bright LED white/blue lights. These lights were circular, and really bright, and they were in each corner of the I .<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we are starting as it, it passes us, and I (driver) decided to pull over and figure out exactly what it was. As I pull over and look back it had vanished.  No where to be seen.  No lights, no object, nothing! It literally took me less than a second to pull over.  We both looked around us and there was nothing in the sky. It was so dark that we would have been able to see anything, even from really far away.  We had mixed emotions, we had no idea what we had just seen, we were laughing for the next hour non stop, but it was mainly beca! use of h ow nervous we were. As we saw that the object disappeared, we decided to start driving again. We’ve done some reading online, and saw stories of people who have had the same experience just like us on the same road. Some moments i just think to myself, “did that really happen?”. It just seemed so unreal. But it DID happen. I wasn’t by myself, nor was the only one who saw it. We both saw the exact same thing. I do believe in UFO’s but the other girl had never believed in that. But after this experience, I can definitely say, we saw something out of this world. Specially because this “ship”/UFO made NO noise at all. If it would have been anything human, like an airplane or helicopter it would have made lots of noise, specially because of how close it was.<n>

Two other neighboring men were hanging out on their boat.  We all looked up and saw something falling vertically fast, but no flames or fire like a meteor.  Object had a com trail.  Object fell right behind one of the major hotel buildings on Ala Moana Blvd when it flashed twice about 100 ft above ground.  This flash seemed to be a double flash and very bright blue/white lit up the sky.  No sound of impact or crowd craziness occurred. We all looked at one another and asked if we all saw the same thing.  There were no sounds when the object flashed. The object was grey metallic like naval ships.  Must of been 20&#39;w x 40&#39;h x 40&#39;l approx. in size.  I saw com trail was more vapor-like than smoke; almost like moisture or steam. It disappeared quick in 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash was amazing.  Haven&#39;t seen colors of blue like that in lightning. The object had structure but not like an airplane falling downward.  It was more squared with a noticeable corner extending off to one side.  The travel distance downward was five times that of the height of the Hotel next to the Harbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know people may have sen it who were near the street but who looks directly upward that fast.  Three seconds from trail to flash and 5-10 seconds of vapor trail evaporating.  Cars below would have missed it since it was directly above.  Cars in traffic must have seen it flash. I think our position at the harbor was the best vantage point to see the object falling vertically.  It was hard not to notice something that big on a vertical fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial response was a falling star burning up, but the grey shape of the object didn&#39;t fit in my mind as a non-burning falling star.  So I googled this site to write it all down and let it go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We have noticed lots of different kind of military aircraft and unmarked choppers flying around and a few months back I saw another UFO so I have had my camera attached to me ever since.  I drive with my camera on my lap now, always ready to go. I looked up to the sky and noticed a thick cloud of smoke in the sky, looked just like contrail but there was nothing in front of it.  You could not make out anything... my daughter and I kept watching it and I started to take photos with my 300mm lens attached to my Nikon D3000, great lens!  I kept taking photos on multi shot as these two orbs started forming in front of the smoke trail.  They would fly away from one another and closer, they would become one, then split into two. It wasn&#39;t until i got home and uploaded the photos that I could see what they were really doing. Some of the photos (out of the 70 I took) show this rainbow like ! object where the two orbs were. It changed colors, shape and size and then it just disappeared. There were other aircraft in the sky but all you could see was contrail. Towards the end of the photo set you can see it just fade away and it was back to that original smoke trail I saw. This is not the first time I have seen this in the past few months, lots of strange happenings lately but this was the first time I could capture it on camera. Finally I have proof and not just my word to go off of.<n>

They were clearly very far away, smaller than an airplane, black, and spherical. Occasionally the sun would hit it and there would be a bright, silver reflection. They moved slowly like airplanes do, but because of the apparent altitude, it was probably moving pretty swiftly.The speed was very regular, I never saw it speed up or slow down, just move in a straight, slow line accross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what this could have been, but I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a bird or a plane.

On my way to work I was driving and noticing the particularly beautiful day and it was about 8:20 in the morning as  I crossed the bridge like I’ve done everyday for two years. Now in the area is what is called Ellington Field, which is a sort of airport for NASA and Military use.  I am used to seeing planes and hearing jets fly over. I tend to think of myself one who has my head in the clouds but as I was driving I noticed a particulary shiny flying object. I took a double look (thinking it was a cool looking plane) but it in fact was an all metal low and fast flying object. It was hard to see and I think the only reason I did was because the sun was to the right of me.The object was reflecting the sun light  but like a mirror as well camoflaging  itself with the sky at the same time.  It was flat but round like a disc but it had a small dome on! top and a slightly larger dome on the bottom. It was moving at a very fast speed, but not so fast that the speed Iwas going in my car could not keep up.  Now once I finally reached a red light on the busy morning road, wondering if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing, I fixed my eye on it. So after the light turned green, the speed of the object started to increase until instantly, as if it had known I had discovered it, it vanished like looking like a bright star in the day sky and then gone completely.  I didn’t suffer from any electric disturbances nor did really anyone else driving seem to notice, but I was for sure I had seen something out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was comprised of 5 lights in total, 4 white/yellow on the 4 corners and a red on in the center. I am about 50% sure this was possibly a helicopters however there was no significant noise of a rotary blade and not a single flasher or navigation related light. The craft craft was moving at about 1.5x my velocity(30 to 40mph) in terms of angle it was only gaining a couple of degrees on my sight as I moved north north west. What struck me as odd was when it banked over to the east it moves rather gracefully and again I got a good solid look at it to confirmed the lack of general aviation lights. It was also a good indication that if it was a private aircraft it would have been flying rather low, 2k feat at best. other wise it would have had to have a large wing span if was indeed at higher altitudes. given its observ! ed attributes and movement I was shocked at the lack of noise. and the paradox between observed movement and luminary characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it could have just been an air plane but I have seen so many over the years this one just didn&#39;t make sense. I play a lot of video games and some of them are 3d flying games and also 3d space type games so judging angular velocity is a skill I have, this object defied many of the general definitions I have for normal air craft. It didn&#39;t move in a way that caused alarm but the combination of the lights and lack of flashers and indicators along with its graceful back was cause for concern.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I rushed in to get my mother and she seen it went back inside, then I went back out to see if it was falling. I noticed it started to go back and forth side to side but it looked like only inch&#39;s where I was seeing it from. After that I seen it kinda light up and the red tail turned a green and there was what looked like a &gt; math sign, greater than.  It turned from green to red, I only have one contact in but I watched with one eye. so I ran to get my sister and she saw it, went back in and I goggled it.  Said something about over breavard county Florida the space station could be seen but there was no date.  So I am wondering is it the space station a UFO, God?  I believe its still out there, its south south east, dropping below the tree lines, but it is still bright, soooo did I see one?<n>

We looked to the south and noticed a large round very bright light in the sky.  The light was approximately 1/2 the size of a full moon.  The light was hovering over Rocky Mountain Airport in Jefferson County.  The light hovered for approximately 45 seconds, then a flash of lightning occured in the section where the light was seen, then the light and lightning were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/9/10 20:00|Broomfield|CO|Light|45 Seconds|Bright light in the sky approximately 1/2 the size of a full moon; then a lightning streak and it was gone.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79199.html|225|ndxe201012| December 9, 2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 8:00pm Ventura, California  I was driving home from a business meeting on the northbound 101 freeway when I noticed a small hazy red-orange glow of light hovering over the ocean in the north-western sky.  Given the color I assumed I was looking at the moon obscured by a cloud of smoke; as a resident of California it is a phenomenon I have seen often enough.  The depth of color was indicative of a very dense, very close fire so for safety sake I scanned the inland sky hoping to locate the source but I saw no plume of trailing smoke and there weren’t even clouds in the sky.  Several things crossed my mind then, it was too early in the evening for the moon to be in a setting position over the ocean, the new moon had just passed so the sliver of moon visible wouldn’t be as large as what I had just seen and lastly the moon wouldn’t be setting in that location of the sky anyway.  So when I looked back at the light it was a little disconcerting to notice it had grown larger and brighter and was definitely taki! ng on an orb like shape.  I was driving so I had to alternate between watching the road and watching the orb and each time I looked back at the orb it appeared larger and brighter as if it were coming toward me which meant that it was moving inland in an easterly direction.  At one point when I looked the orb had changed shape, like a tear drop on its side with the pointed tip in the tail position and it was moving parallel to me only in the opposite direction (southbound) there were also three small lights visible at the top. Because of those small lights I thought “Oh it’s a passenger plane.” I wanted some kind of confirmation so I looked for the fuselage knowing that if I could see the lights of the passenger windows I should be able to see the plane itself but there was no plane and the whole thing was still glowing orange.  It continued southward and I watched it move across the sky until I was almost looking over my shoulder out the driver side window and the glow sta! rted to dissipate then it vanished at a point where my eye cau! ght sigh t of a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident took no more than two or three minutes and I wasn’t the only one who saw this; there were 15 other vehicles in front of me and several behind.  I watched the orb disappear then turned my full attention back to my driving and realized everyone had slowed down to watch the strange lights in the sky.<n>

Just passed Temescal Canyon Rd exit, spotted what first appeared to be three lights in a delta formation heading directly towards me. Altitude &#34;estimated&#34; 3,000 above ground based on mountain range reference parallel to the interstate. This configuration appeared unconventional, so I immediately pulled over onto the shoulder about 1/2 mile south of Temescal Canyon Rd. I exited my vehicle and observed three pairs of lights, each pair blue and red, in a delta configuration move relatively fast and amazingly smooth almost directly overhead in a northwest/north direction. As it flew overhead the sets of lights appeared to be embedded in a flat surface shaped in a &#34;boomerang&#34; or &#34;v&#34; shape body. very pitch black colored. Each light was ring shaped, not solid oval. Each pair of lights were on each &#34;wing tip&#34; as well as the leading nose. The lights were not blinki! ng or strobing. There was no apparent navigation light system as expected in conventional aircraft. Lights remained on constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 30 seconds for the lights to reach overhead from the moment I pulled over, and I observed the object for an additional 3-4 minutes as it eventually faded out of site. What was impressive was that it banked slightly to the left at times as a single solid object and it its massive size was made apparent because even as its lights waned in the distance, its size became smaller very slowly as it got farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not verify any sound emitting from the craft as it was too noisy from cars on the interstate passing by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A good way to describe how big it was when over my head is to raise your hands above your head and spread them apart about 3 feet. That was the span from wingtip to nose tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone in my car, however the interstate was very busy with many cars heading southbound, and there was another car who had pulled over about 200 meters ahead of me at the same time I did. It appeared they were observing this object as well. They remained there as long as I did, and I attempted to approach them to ask them if they had observed the same object, but they left the scene as I approached them in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:55pm PDT I texted a friend with my cell phone about my sighting and then I continued on for home. I live approx 5 miles south of where my sighting was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I had a video capable cell phone, I was not able to have enough time to get my composure and get a video of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had to be many more people who were driving to witness this craft. If it was that obvious to me what I saw, other drivers had to see it too. There were many cars driving alongside of me at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I got off the bus, I looked for the object but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else seemed to notice anything but me. Sometimes I see lights or images in the bus window due to reflection but this was not the case. I&#39;m not sure both objects were of the same source, but this happened within minutes of each other.

They were traveling together and within very close proximity of each other just as two side by side blue angel jets do when they fly in tandem formation during air shows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they had caught my eyes attention, I focused directly on them for approximately 7 seconds as they went from the far right hand side of the Western sky all the way to the left of the Eastern sky.  I tried to get my friend’s attention who was standing to my left and facing me to turn around and look at the two fast flying ufo’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he had turned to face them, they were already two thirds the way across the sky which caused me to get up out of my chair and walk forward passing by my friend to catch the last glimpse of them as they went over the far Eastern hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two ufo’s were traveling at approximately 4,000 feet above the ground and were about 3 miles or so out away from my home and seemed to be traveling at a speed of at least 1,000 plus miles per hour as it appeared from the distance that they had covered in such a quick time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way I figured their speed at about 1,000 plus miles an hour is because I lived near the San Jose airport which is about 2 miles North West of the home that I was living in at the time and I use to watch the incoming and out going planes flying overhead all of the time in the sky at about the same distance that I had watched the two oval shaped ufo’s flying and they don’t cover anywhere near the distance of skyline in such a short period of time that the two ufo’s did in that day of December!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everything that I have mentioned in this statement is 100% true and as accurate as I can remember.

First they were moving in a sort of V formation but as they moved over me the formation was moving and changing shapes. It almost seemed as though they were moving around eachother but they were moving around eachother way to fast to be any kind of aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. I saw them 3 times within a few minutes. The first time I saw them they were moving from the north to the south. The second time was east to west and the third time was very far off from the south west to the south. The weather conditions were very dark and cold, 25 degrees. The sky was very clear. There were other aricraft in the air as there normaly is. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Blue light gradually sped up and then disappeared.  Compared to surrounding aircraft (approx.400pmh) I can guess that it was around 200 times as fast as the aircrafts.  The craziest part is I have been searching for other posts regarding this sighting and I found a post on this site in Florida today/tonight that is the exact same description of what we saw. I think its very crazy that the same sighting was also seen in Florida. This also proves that it was either fast enough to travel across the country or seen 2 separate times to help prove my claim.

When I looked in that direction 4 lights slowly increased in brightness and took off south in a straight line very fast.  I’m not exactly sure how far away they were but seemed like a couple miles. Maybe over Masonboro Island which is I think 3 or 4 miles away.  I don’t think it was one craft because three of them were in a triangle but not a perfect one and the other was off to the right.  They were close to each other though, but it’s hard to say how close because they were far away.<n>

I thought it was a transformer blowing up because the flash of light was so bright but as I continued driving east the flash of bright light continued.  It would flash and then go dark for about 30 seconds and then flash again, this was continuous.  It was not moving just flashing on and off.  I continued to drive east and was almost parallel to it but it was up above the hills.  I pulled over as did two other cars to see if we could tell what it was but it wasn&#39;t recognizable.  It was too high to be any sort of tower and it didn&#39;t seem to be any type of aircraft that was recognizable since it wasn&#39;t moving - just staying in the same spot up in the sky.  I left because I had to go to work but I witnessed this thing for about 15 minutes. I have driven this route every morning for 12 years and have never seen this ! before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on speaker phone having my nightly conversation with my mom. I noticed coming from east to west something interesting...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not raining, the sky was over-cast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what looked like a normal (I assume) helicopter/airplane lights red,green and white and about 50ft from the helicopter/airplane a red ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mind me -my mother was on the phone with me the whole time. What caught my attention was how insinc they were flying together, it seemed that the helicopter was about 50ft behind this red ball of light the whole time. I kept my eyes on the second &#34;craft&#34; hoping that it would show some sort of running lights you would normally see when aircraft are in the sky, the red ball of light kept flickering and pulsating as it lead the helicopter/airplane from east to north-west. I pulled over into an old sub-division (I was scared that I would run into a car)where I had a view to watch this. The objects were about 200ft give or take? in the sky, they moved from Benson Hill-Talbot Road area across the Valley towards Southcenter Mall and what looked like the Burien area. It struck me as odd. I think we (humans) need to pay attention to the sky more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On this Monday the sky was very clear after a weekend of rain and stars could be seen with clarity.  After being taken back by the size and brightness of the star I noticed it started to flicker as if it were a helicopter or as if a Christmas tree light were hanging in the sky.  After about five minutes of the flicker the light began to dull out as if it was a short, then I noticed a change from white to red and then it was gone in a blink of the eye.  After about 2 or three minutes I noticed the bright bright star once again in the same spot, as if it had never went away it just appeared out of no where.  It was once again still and bright white, I noticed it for another 5 min and then once again is started to dull out and vanish.  After doing this twice now when it returned as it did before this time there were three bright lights making a triangular shape. I called my mom to confirm what I was seeing and she saw the same from her back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed for about half an hour with all of them changing from bright white to red to vanishing. After seeing this I have done some research and found a group of people who saw the same event about two months ago in the same location as I did and took a video, this is exactly what I experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There video is listed on the following site:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcIRkkm2IoI<n>

There wasn&#39;t any clouds in the sky, so it was very easy to see. I would&#39;ve said it was a star other than it was during the day time. I ran back into my house and got my camera and took several photos of it. It seemed to move a litte bit while I was snapping pictures of it. After a few minutes of starring at it, the glowing sphere got closer to us. So then I took some more pictures of it. This was defenetley a foo fighter looking UFO. There was no sound and it stayed almost perfectley still. It remained in almost the same spot for hours even after the sun went down. Once it became night time, It was still there. Then I went in doors for a few minutes and came back out and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I originally thought it was a snowmobiler riding down this logging trail back in the tree line.  However, I was curious due to the fact that the terrain along that logging trail dropped slightly in elevation approx. 20-30 ft. over a distance of about  100 yds. or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traversed the 100 yd. distance in about 1-2 sec. max..  The bright object I saw flew straight and did not drop with elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I jumped on a snowmobile and rode out there only to find not a single trace of anything. I walked around the area which was about 2 feet deep in snow.  No tracks of anything.  I could only think that what ever I saw fly down that logging trail, never touched the ground. I can only say in closing that if it was a snowmobiler I would have not been able to see its headlight due to the fact the logging trail actually runs away from my bosses property, not parallel or towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve been a professional pilot for 31 yrs., I know what I saw. I’m in disbelief that I’m even writing this.<n>

I let it go for about 10 minutes and then realize there are planes in the background landing and taking off from LAX Airport. I quickly rush to the end edge of the roof and am able to make out the craft well. Its a long cigar shaped object thats black or dark gray, there are no visible lights and the object doesn&#39;t reflect light. Every 3 to 5 minutes the craft would stop. I could see at least 5 airplanes flying right by the craft. I tried to tell myself it was a blimp or helicopter but this thing would completely stop for minutes at a time and just hover. One more thing that was strange was in the background theres a mountain like a  huge mesa almost like where the Hollywood sign is. As the craft pass! ed I saw a bright flashing coming from the mesa mountain, almost like taking pictures from a professional camera but big, it was bright and I could see it for miles away.As the craft passed the flashing stop and it continued to hover and move slowly. I was Able to take one clear picture of the craft. I tried taking video but I was unsuccessful because I have no video zoom so you couldn&#39;t see anything. The sun was also pointing in my direction.The craft then kept moving east till I lost sight because there was a building office in front of me. I couldn&#39;t see where I was pointing my Iphone but when I returned home I could clearly make it out. I used Windows picture system and I was able to zoom in. I was Shocked, it a long cigar shaped object with no visible attachments or helicopter propellers. The same day On December 6th, 2010 over LAX Multiple UFO were spotted forming a V-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First I would like to apologize for my English, cos I am not from USA or other English speaking country but I will try my best to explain everything as detail as possible.  Ok I will start from there that I am a young guy who likes sports, dont drink, dont smoke nothing, only healthy life, I am saying this, cos I was not hallucinating or something!!!  I am very interested in UFOs since I was little, now I am 27 and I am obsessed with the subject. When I am at home after work I am watching all kind of documentaries about it, everything there is on Discovery, History channels and so on. So one night when I finished watching a docu about ufos, I said to myself - ok thats it, I am tired of only watching about it and about all those fake ufo clips on youtube so I decided to look for myself. It was June very warm weather I looked outside from my window I am living in a 9 story! building and I am on the highest floor, when i looked up I saw that the sky was absolutely clear, so many stars and I said to myself omg I got to go on the roof and start watching the sky every single night, Inside myself I knew I would see something, cos up there high I can see the whole sky more clearly and without the distraction of the street lights. So when everybody was sleeping I got there I took even a blanket to lie down and look at the sky till the morning that was my plan.  It was Friday  I stayed for like an hour and I saw a meteor fly by it was so beautiful and at that moment I thought to myself wow when this meteor can enter the planet Earth so easy everything can and I stayed like half an hour more and got back to my apartment. That was my first try, I was very happy thou that I saw something moving not only the stars but that was only the beginning. On the next evening was the actual sighting, so the same story I get there around 1:00 am and laid down on the ! blanket and actually I was prepared to see another meteor I wa! s convin ced that there are ufos but didnt expect to see what I saw, its crazy! So around 2:00 am I saw this time a bigger meteor to fly by and it was destroyed by the atmosphere into peaces very high in the sky, it was beautiful, so I got on my feet and start watching it and after 30 sec I saw the meteor the sighting began! So I was staying on my feet and still watching up high cos wanted to see more meteors maybe but what I saw I couldnt believe my eyes! So the meteor was burned out and 30 sec after I saw him I was still looking up and saw a light cant tell the exact color red or violet was falling from very high in the sky down to the roof in a spiral fashion it was unbelievable like a dance and I thought to myself wow a peace of the meteor is falling down yay I am a lucky one, I saw a meteor very high in the sky and its gonna fall a 6 meters in front of me wow what are the chances but thats what I thought cos I didnd expect something else! So this light was falling down in a spir! al fashion from very high very slowly and when it was around 6 meters in front of me so close and the same height as me so in front my eyes I just step back one step cos I was like wow its gonna fall on the roof but when it was on my height falling in a spiral fashion it just start to fly straight in front of me but not straight I mean left right up down it was like dancing and then I was like ooo my God that is not a meteor, it flies! I was very scared, what the hell is that I didnt have time cos I look to my left guess what another light falling down this time like a &#34;falling leaf&#34; fashion left right, left right and when was in front of my eyes height it flew in the direction of the other ufo and it was absolutely silent no noise at all only flying and it look like it defies gravity up down left right so smooth it was like magical I was like watching those fantasy movies watching magical lights flying by me no sound no nothing I immediately call them fairies cos they were! so beautiful no sound at all, so after the second one I turne! d to my right a 3rd light falling and flying in the direction of the first one. And when I look at them how they are flying it looked to me that they were intelligent, cos they were flying so like they were looking for something left right up down and like scanning the surface. So I was there all alone on the block of flat at 2:30 am and those lights were like dancing and wanting to show me their presence I dont know but I was scared and started to fall back and when I was going back a 4th light flew over my shoulder and I was like omg I am out of here on the way back I was looking in every direction, cos I didnt know from where they will appear I was scared I coudnt hear a thing only with my eyes I was like turning my head in every possible direction and when I got to the door to exit the roof a 5th one flew over my head omg I am out and I ran the stairs down to my flat, I was all shaken! This is absolutely unbelievable! I stayed at my apartment like 15 min and was looking up from ! the window and saying to myself omg some lights (or fairies like I call them immediately) are flying up there and I am staying here I have to go back not everybody is seeing this I have to be crazy not to go there this is unbelievable! So my curiosity was bigger than I was scared and i got back there. When I arrived I was looking at every possible direction cos I knew I coldnt hear them only seeing them. It was 3:00 am and I waited till 3:30 and I was trying to convince myself that I was hallucinating and to go back to my apartment, cos actually i was scared :D and I said to myself ok last look up to the sky till my neck hurts and I am out and when I looked up immediately it just flew over my head about a 2 meters above it, it flew so smooth I can describe it like when you make an airplane from paper and throw it, it flies so smooth and make a smooth turn to my left and just disappeared I even saw it very clearly, cos was above my head and I could see it in more detail it l! ooked something like a rc mini airplane I can even describe it! , it loo ked like 2 dots connected with a minus sign something like that  *-*  and had a haze around it, but there was no mist or something it was absolutely clear night, but when it flew it had some green glow around it, it was like going through the space and I can even make another comparison, when there is a mist and the lights of the car is on, around the lights there is some kind of glow cos of the mist this is what it looked like but was a clear night, it was unbelievable, and I was like &#34;There it is ooo my God!&#34; (I was talking with voice to myself all the time, cos this was something that cant be explained) and I got out of there and that was my story. It went 7-8 months from that sighting and I cant go back there cos its cold its winter now. I cant wait to get warm to go there again, but this time I am very scared cos I know what to expect, don’t saying that this was something scary but those lights were something out of this world and when the human brain sees something tha! t cant be explained, it is scary. That day I didnt expect anything to happen but now I know and i am 100% convinced that they will return, cos they know I am looking for them and I am even convinced that they are even flying every single day and night but we cant see them, cos they are invisible and only if they want to show their presence they will light their light and glow, cos when I saw the last light and when made a turn to the left it just disappeared, so they can be flying without we even know it. I hope someone has a similar experience and tell me what that is. Thank you in advance!

The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle and was illuminated bright white with one circular white light at each corner. It was aprox a half mile above ground and was flying from east to west and was TOTALLY SILENT.  We watched the object fly for about 10 seconds before it disappeared out of our line of sight.<n>

It was dusk, but there was still an inkling of light left in the sky.  I pointed out that they were very bright, and were traveling oddly slow, and I noticed a familiar formation I had seen in some UFO conspiracy videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> rying not to be immediately critical, we both concentrated on them for another moment when all of a sudden, another appeared as if a light had just been turned on in the sky. We were both so shocked by the way it appeared, we were screaming in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, it was nearing the end of rush hour, but there was still a good amount of traffic. We looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, when the traffic light turned green. We drove home quickly and brought our friend out to see the lights in the sky. He agreed that, &#34;there was a lot of air traffic in such a small area of the sky.&#34; We had never seen airplanes fly this closely together, unless they were in a USO show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As most of them very slowly faded south/southwest, one or two of them came almost directly overhead of us, just about one or two miles north. From there we could make out five bright lights on the bottom side of one of them, one in the front, and two sets of two behind that, in an &#34;A&#34; or &#34;V&#34; shape. We also all noticed it made little or no noise, although it was somewhat blustery that day, so we didn&#39;t think it was TOO strange, but just a little. Either way, we were all very shocked by what we saw, and we still can&#39;t explain anything we saw that day, besides saying they were definitely NOT airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, curious to see if there were any reports, we found a news report from that same day, just hours before in Nixa, Missouri, saying they also saw something strange in the background of a report that had been given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXlJM9dOE4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their explanation at the very end is not convincing though.

As I was gazing at the sky, I noticed a string of about 3-4 bright amber lights in what looked like a line formation moving toward us from the west in a northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the lights looked strange, so I focused on them and noticed several more of these lights coming up behind the others from over a mountain to the west.  I then pointed them out to the others and we all became very excited and inquisitive wondering what they could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 10-15 minutes or so, it seemed like an endless stream of lights coming one behind the other.  As they came closer to the east, we listened to hear if maybe they were Air Force jets, but we could hear absolutely nothing.  I’m estimating that there were upwards to 19 or so lights that we counted over a period of about 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone agreed that these lights looked odd and didn’t appear to be aircraft we had ever seen before, especially since they were amber colored and had no white or red lights on them that we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch, the lights seemed to change direction and began to head southwest until we could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on the TV hoping to hear something about these strange lights, but I never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were these aircraft from Luke Air Force base or were they something else entirely.

They were more discreet and two of them came very close to each other in a controlled and slowed motion, then parted ways because the other 12 begin to come into the picture.

I know it sounds weird. I presumed it was a spot light at the Hawthorne Airport. As we passed the airport we realized it was further south. Now my wife had mentioned to me on 12/02/10  at approx. 14:15 that she had seen a strange prism like rainbow on each side of the sun (have pictures) in the same vicinity. She reminds me, now I am eager to find the source. I drove to El Camino College, Alondra Park and back to Crenshaw Blvd. South, but no light source but the lights are still moving. At this point we are chasing the source and realized the lights are above the clouds. To me it seemed as if it knew we were trying to pin-point its location. As we approached Artesia Blvd. the lights changed from four to three lights and still spinning and rotating. We end up on 182nd street just west of Crenshaw blvd a! nd now the lights changed from three into one light and stopped moving. To all of us it seemed as if it knew we were trying to find its exact location. Finally, we travel North on Prarie and now the one light begins to move erratically(fast) and then disappears. Now i truly believe it was avoiding our vehicle.

The sky was faint orange colored and the sky had a few bits of clouds.  The taxi was driving me to the north, I was on the left chair looking through the left window.  I spotted an orange mixed with yellow so homogenuos that it appeared like fire colored trianglar object.  At first, I thought it was a plane or something but it was flying higher than any plane I ever saw that it so high to spot details.  It was the shape and size of a broken pencil pin when you hold it as far as you can with your hand.  It was so bright to be seen yet too small.

I had a clear, wide angle view of the entire horizon, north, west and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes and then I thought it must be the rumored Project Blue Beam or a new and improved night time HAARP/Chemtrail program. Maybe a phenomenon like the recent one in Lu Shan, China, supposedly created by the city lights, and the atmosphere? So, when I returned to my ground level home, 30 miles north I looked into the clear sky,  I saw the same grids of energy beams and faint pinpoints of light that appeared to move rapidly at certain intersections where the suspended particles met.   The next day, at high noon, I went to an open field nearby, stood in the shade and voila! The sky was perfectly clear and blue, except for the thin veil of grey particles, suspended by waves of energy in a perfect grid pattern,rolling across the sky. Planes preparing to land at Fort Lauderdale airport appeared to be flying above the particle grid, so it could not have been more than a few thousand feet from the ground. These beams were visible to me for 3 nights and! 1 day and a freind who lives 5 miles west.  Last night, they became barely visible and today I see no particles or beams in the daytime sky.  Unfortunately, the beams are so faint during the day and night, I can&#39;t imagine you will see any photo evidence soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying toward us (west ward) it then zig-zaged then flew straight again, then zig- zagged again. It almost appeared to be a flame fired toy balloon but it was too bright (without much change in brightness) and with the speed and the sudden turns any flame probably would have been extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise at all and in about 2 minutes it suddenly gained altitude faded to a red dot then vanished. I live under the flight path to LAX and this light flew across the flight path around or just below the altitude the jumbo jets fly. The clouds were moving slowly, there was very little wind and there were no aircraft seen in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using google earth and measuring from the mountain it appeared to fly over it seemed to travel about 5.5 miles in about the 2 minutes we observed it.  I think it could have been what is known as an earthquake light. There were power lines under the center of it&#39;s path but it was very high in comparison to the lines. If it was a flame fired toy balloon the person who set it aloft could have started a brush fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flashed red, green, blue, yellow, orange. Seemed to be rotating. Hovering for several minutes. It moved away from us very rapidly, faster then anything I have ever seen flying and I have seen many military aircraft in the years I have lived in this area. It dimmed very fast and disappeared suddenly and was gone. This is nothing like my fiancee nor I have ever seen. No sound at all it is a very quite night. It seemed to be about 2 miles away and the size of a dime from that distance so it must have been fairly large. At times it there also appeared to be a second much smaller shape off to the right very close but may have been an affect of the flashing. The flashing was not timed or steady but more pulsing and was brighter sometimes then dimmed. The shape seemed to be disk or round as much as we could tell. That is about it.

I am wondering if anybody else saw what we saw??   The object was first spotted when a member of the group went outside to smoke a cigarette around 9:00 PM.   He called the rest of the group outside to look at this &#34;thing&#34; in the sky.  We stood looking at it for almost an hour and this is what we observed:  The object was round with blue, green, yellow, and red lights that rotated in a circle horizontally while the base stayed put. The object was very still but would eventually move every once in a while.  The colors were very distinct; christmas red, bright blue, ect. If a person would have blurred the image, it would have resembled a fire ball in a way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved, it APPEARED to be subtle movements from here on earth...although in reality, that craft was extremely high and had to be moving at an incredible rate. It would move waaay back and get very small and far for about ten minutes, then eventually come closer.  Eventually we watched the object slowly disappear into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison to a plane, the object was substantially higher than a plane would travel.  Not to mention it hovered for about an hour, only moving occasionally.  The object was about the size of a plane flying at max height, although given the fact that the the object was so much higher than a plane would travel, it was clear that it was greatly larger than a plane.<n>

At first it seemed to be stationary but then it became clear that it was moving very slowly in a downward arc. We noticed an airplane (obvious because of the vapor trail) moving in that direction, intersecting it and passing by. Finally the object was below the treeline and we could not track it any longer. About two minutes later (and this may have nothing to do with the other) was saw two planes going in opposite directions (again, we could clearly see their vapor trails) and one had a black object following behind it and the black object had no vapor trail. We continued to watch until they were out of sight. Certainly I do not know what I saw and my son is only 11 so he is fully prepar! ed to be invaded by aliens.

I had attempted to stay up till the next night to find out if I could see anything that would disprove me. I was unable to do so because of the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pretense to the sighting was that my girlfriend and I wanted to have a cigarette after watching a show about the previous presidents. It was a cold night with hardly any cloud cover whatsoever so we decided to smoke in my truck to avoid the cold wind outside. There were no other aircraft of any kind in the sky. The sighting began as being any other plane or helicopter in the sky so it went unnoticed for at least 3-4 minutes until the light began to almost vibrate and move side to side(very slightly and not seen in video footage for it being the reason I have the footage to begin with). As we sat there watching this light we noticed that it began to get higher and higher in the sky all while dimming out and showing up higher. I ended up going in for the night just after the last video because I had work in a few hours after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin, please excuse the language that was being used. It was a long day and I was excited at the situation. The video footage that I have begins with the light off in the distance. The white circle that looks like a kind of disk is from my front windshield. The light however looks as though it blinks different colors but I did not witness that with my eyes. I did notice that when the light had dimmed  it gave off a bit if a red light. The third video shows the light flare up at around 1:51. The footage however is not really that great of quality although I am willing to risk my name to prove the footage has not been tampered with whatsoever. The resolution is 160x200 and I believe 15-20fps(shot on an Iphone 3g with downloaded application). The footage is very similar to the NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 11, 2010, AT 06:45 HRS sighting. The differences are that there was only one light and it dimmed out completely at some points and then reappeared higher in th! e sky which is very apparent in the video. I also have a photo of the exact viewpoint of where I was at but during the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.:  Under the check all that apply section I left the first one about being contacted by an investigator unchecked because I would like to be contacted only if the evidence supplied deems worthy of an investigation.

I immediately looked to the sky where she was looking, and saw the same thing she had.  Four “star like lights” Traveling East to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SIGHTING I only knew to look to the sky by the look on my wife’s face. When I did, I saw four “star like lights” in a formation that resembled ascending stairs.  The lights kept a generally same formation the entire time I saw them, but each light, for lack of a better term, wobbled independently of each other. I base my certainty of these lights being UFO’s because of; - The speed at which they traveled. Taking less than 3 seconds to leave my line of sight behind my house, when I ran through the yard to continue to watch them travel, they were no longer visible to me. Note* It is an overcast night tonight. I do not know if they became too far to see, or if they changed direction, or other explanation is necessary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their travel pattern. While their pattern remained “stairs-like,” stacked one atop the other with even spacing from each other, at approximately a 75 degrees pitch, each light seemed to carelessly wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Position of Traveling		Top: flight path Objects		Bottom: Horizon  My wife described their movement through the sky as Passeando, which in my understanding of Portuguese could mean walking, meandering, strolling, et cetera. I couldn’t have said it better, they moved at speeds that I could not imagine man-kind of capable of just yet. They made no noise, moved swiftly, yet as my eyes were upon them, it felt as if time slowed. Much like moments I felt as a high school athlete, when I was making a “big play” it almost felt as if I was perfectly focused and everything moved just as fast, but seemed slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t imagine what else to write so please contact me if there are any questions you’d like answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. If you do retrieve any footage of the passing of “Lights” please forward it to me!<n>

It’s been getting pretty cold, so our dogs have been sleeping in our porch or in the house.  I looked out our living room window, which is located at the front of our house facing southeast.  I immediately noticed a very bright and colorful light in the sky.  This colorful light changed colors from red, green and yellow.  It was a clear night and was very visible.  I grabbed a sweater and went outside to get a better look.  This was pretty exciting for me and I wanted to share this with my two daughters(20 &amp; 18 yrs. old).  Both were fast asleep and didn’t wake up.  Still wanting to share this with someone, I began text messaging with my 22 yr. old son.  He works nights and of course was awake and suggested that I video record this sighting.  I recorded it on my blackberry and took a few shots of it.  As I began to process my experience, I actually started googling recent UFO sightings and even ! went on a star magazine website.  On this magazine’s website I found that a star named “Mira” was visible to the unaided eye as a red star.  So I figured this bright and colorful light was this star “Mira”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the days passed, I curiously began paying more attention to the stars at night.  I’ve since seen this bright colorful light in the sky at least 6 times and so has my husband and 18 yr. old.  Last night(12/1/2010) we brought our dogs inside because of the cold temps.  We were all sleeping, when one of the dogs began barking and running down the hallway towards the front door.  I am a light sleeper and got up quickly to see what was going on.  This was at about 1:40 a.m.  By this time our other dog got up and followed me outside.  My small dog that woke me up, kept barking up towards the sky.  Sure enough the bright colorful light was there again.  I woke up my husband and we both went back outside to see the lights.  We watched for a few minutes, until we couldn’t stand the cold temp.  I am convinced this is not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just this evening my husband and I both saw it in the northwestern sky at about 9:30 p.m. and then again in the southeastern sky at about 10:00 p.m.  I’m not an expert, but if I’m not mistaken stars don’t switch locations like that.  Our town has a small airport and an air force base.  But this looks nothing like airplane lights to me.  The couple of times that I’ve seen it, the colors are clearly red/green/yellow and it‘s stationary.  It doesn’t twinkle like a star, but blinks as it changes colors.<n>

As I slowed down to see where the light was coming from the light then seemed to turn onto my car like a spotlight and slowed down but then the object turned the lights forward towards the opposite direction I was traveling.  At this point I was able to see the shape of the object it was triangular with different colored lights on the bottom of it in the middle there was three white lights that were being used as spotlights.  I turned around to follow the object, as I did this the object turned on its side and sped away.  I tried to capture the object on film, on my phone, but my phone became out of focus and would not let me record.<n>

I was at BMX training. I was looking north east towards mt Dandenong TV towers then I noticed 2 circular disc shaped objects flying past rather fast. I tried to get a better look on the second burm, but then they vanished. I asked a mate if he saw the discs and he said I saw something “fly past rather past”. I then ignored it and thought of it as 2 fighter jets that had their engines off. So about half an hour later I was up on the 7 metre start hill and then noticed the 2 objects again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this time they were flying slowly, and then they started to hover then shot off in a south west direction. It was so fast I could only just process it. I felt a little dizzy afterwards because I thought “if that was a UFO, then what the f**k”<n>

It was particularly cloudy out, so there were no stars visible in the sky.  As I was approaching New Hampshire Avenue on Bonifant, I saw what I first thought was a star constellation, formed out of bright orange/red circles.  There were five circles in a formation that at first resembled the big dipper, except without the scooper portion of the dipper itself.  The circles seemed lower than the clouds, and a color I have not seen on any aircraft at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, I called my girlfriend to get her to go outside to see if she could see what I was seeing.  While communicating with her on the phone, I pulled off on a side street just after Notley Road.  I was able to see at this points that the circles were not stationary as they first seemed, but were actually moving.  I&#39;m not sure if they were moving the whole time or not, but I traveled a relatively short distance before noticing them moving, so I feel that I would have noticed them prior to pulling off on the side street.  Once on the side street, I drove up a little ways, and seemed to be directly under the 5 orange circles, still spaced a pretty good distance apart, best compared to the spacing of looking at the stars that form the big dipper.  I turned onto a second neighborhood street to follow the direction they were moving, all the while talking to my girlfriend, aside from one call to my brother, to see if he could see them as well, but to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second neighborhood street was a culdesac, so I turned around the circle, at which point I noticed two to three new circles of the same size and color, and at what appeared to be an equal spacing as the previous five from the previous five.  They appeared to be moving in the same direction as the first five that I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These crafts appeared to be lower to the ground than the storm clouds, as stars were not visible due to the clouds.  After this point, I made a point to try to observe airplanes in the area to compare to what I saw.  These circles were different in that you couldn&#39;t gather a distinctive shape, whereas sometimes with a jet you can pick up multiple lights in different parts of the craft, or perhaps even an outline of the jet.  Usually if it&#39;s a jet, you can at least make out the shape of the craft until a point where it gets so high in the sky, that it appears to be like a moving star sized object.  These circles appeared to be two to three times the size of a jet that is high up in the sky and resembling a moving star, but notably lower to the earth.  They appeared to be moving quickly, and I was unable to discern any shape to the craft, even right I turned onto the side street and was directly beneath them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what to make of this.  I&#39;m an open-minded person, but this was quite alarming to me for a number of reasons.  I have never seen jets or planes with lights of this color, brightness and size.  It was a bright, single solid orange color for each of the dots.  Additionally, because of the storm clouds, these stood out on the sky well apart from stars since stars were hardly visible.  Thirdly, they appeared to be stationary prior to moving.<n>

It looked to be a very large craft. It seemed to be at an altitude that most helicopters maintain.  There was no distinct sound where as if it were any other aircraft of human-kind, we would have heard it.  There were approximately ten red blinking lights along the crafts outermost circumference.  The object came from the southeast heading northwest.  It made a sort of swerving motion as it traveled across the sky. It would look as if it would wobble when it would make a slight change in direction.  Once it got further toward the northwest sky, it sort of disappeared in the overcast clouds that were rolling in from the west.<n>

Weather was clear, no wind to speak of. The objects flashed, with orange light (did not blink on and off) like a strobe effect. Both were larger and brighter than stars appear. Point of observation is atop a hill about 1 mile south of MO river, situated below regular MCI and downtown airport flight paths (aircraft such as commercial jets, small planes, helicopters frequently overhead). These objects were not moving: neither to either side, nor becoming larger or smaller for several moments. I called my husband to see them. The uppermost object then moved away rapidly into the northwest sky. The lower object remained stationary for another several minutes (I had time to get my telescop! e from another part of the room and aim it at the object). The object remained where it was; a regular plane flew over the space with normal movement toward airport, but the hovering object did not move at all. Finally it very slowly moved upward (judged by power line in foreground) and then away toward the northwest(in the same direction as the one before had gone) and was quickly no longer visible. Could not tell how far away or at what altitude, but compared to the commercial jet it was (estimated) about half the size of the fuselage of the jet and at about the same altitude, but seemed more distant  – no wings were apparent. When these objects moved away they quickly became &#34;smaller&#34; to the naked eye, and then disappeared.

We were just talking before it was time for me to go inside for the night. We were facing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an orange light in my peripheral. At first, I thought it was the streetlight but I realized that it was shaking and moving across the sky. I turned my head and saw that it was two orange spheres, seeming to shake rapidly as they moved smoothly and silently across the sky. They looked like they were made of light. One was in front and higher in the sky than the second light, but they moved perfectly synchronized. They were moving east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they were almost in front of us, they stopped moving in the sky, stopped shaking too. They just froze and hovered for a few seconds. They were orange balls about the size of the full moon. They seemed to be flat, like 2D, and multifaceted like bicycle reflectors. But it was hard to understand what they really were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is hard to explain: They were hanging in the air, one higher and more to the left of the other. Then, simultaneously, they shifted in the air so that the higher one was now in the lower position and the lower one was now in the higher position. They froze again. Then they shifted back and froze. Then, they just LEFT. They ascended into the stars just fast enough for your eyes to follow – FAST. Up, gone, away. They didn&#39;t seem to accelerate, just suddenly gone. It was amazing and I will never forget. Years later, I thought they must have known we were watching but who knows?

At first thought it was a bright star. However, having grown up my entire life (over 30 years) in the area, I knew it couldn&#39;t be a plane, and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter because I didn&#39;t see or hear any rotor-blades. I stopped my car, turned off the engine, and rolled down the window and looked out. I heard no noise as the craft slowly passed overhead going roughly southeast - it was low enough at this point to know for sure that there was no engine/rotor noise. It was roughly 300-400 feet above, and its speed was a slow 15 mph or so. It was a black triangle, with bright white lights on each of the three tips. I could definitely see the shape of the black craft against the dark, night sky. There were two thin white light lines parallel to one another and close together, in the center of the craft pointing in the direction it was moving. It was around 25 feet wide or so. Again, no noise at all. There was also a red light behind it that was bl! inking very fast at times as well. I didn&#39;t know what to think about it at first, so I rolled up the window, started the car and went on driving. After about 15 seconds or so, I got a very nervous feeling that maybe this was something that could not easily be explained. Since it wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, or anything with an engine, the only other explanation would be a glider or a remote controlled vehicle, however this area of Orinda is one of the highest points, so a glider wouldn&#39;t be a practical explanation. Also, anything remote controlled would presumably make some sort of noise, and at 20 - 30 feet from tip to tip, that would be a big remote flying machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will explain the event as if you could hear my thoughts that were going through my mind from the start of the sighting to the end, which was no longer than ten seconds:  What?  Wow!   Those are bright stars!  Those aren’t stars; they’re a little bigger and moving.  There’s another one!  It just appeared and not too far from the others, oh it’s moving to join the others, Oh!  They’re gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now to go over what I just saw and put it into words.  When I looked up, I saw three objects very shinny moving very slowly in a northerly direction and side by side east to west.  Then another one not too far away to the west of the others just appeared as if turning on a light and moved to join them four abreast.  As soon as it did all four just disappeared as if you turned off a light. This scenario made me realize that these objects where defiantly under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The backdrop to the objects was the sky and stars and my line of sight to the objects in relation to the horizon was about 50 degrees.  It’s hard to say how close they were and how big but the feeling I felt was they were about a mile way and about the size of a car and oval in shape.  The only way to describe their appearance is how liquid mercury appears.  Smooth and shiny and reflects light. I was left with the impression that four ships where traveling together in cloak mode and for some reason un-cloaked and then went back to cloak (traveling while invisible).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason why I didn’t report this until now is that not then but now I’m curious if anybody else has reported a similar event.

It was a calm sunny morning.  There was no mistake that we both witnessed this, no possible way it was an illusion bc it was only about 100-200 feet off the ground and not far away at all.  I could not see what happened after we drove by bc there was a tree line along the road we were driving on.<n>

About 3:AM I was up performing my normal middle of the night routine when I decided to let the animals out in the cold as they would come right back in very quickly. As I looked out over the back pasture I could see what I then thought was the outline of a house with those white lights on it just below the tree tops..   I thought to myself then that I never realized that a house when lighted up could be seen at all through the trees. There were no clouds and the sky was very clear.  Due east and to the left was appeared to be a very bright star (maybe satellite) and several others could be seen.  That was a UFO, normal white lights, no blinking, no moving just stationery. After coming back about 30 minutes later to let the animals in, there were no lights.  I thought to myself, now why would anyone get up at 3:30 to turn off lights, maybe a timer.  When I got up this morning to see just what! house that could possibly be, I realized that there is no possibility of a house at that level.  That is straight into the sky as those trees are on top of a hill and nothing is visible for miles and miles if ever at that angle. This morning , there is no house, never could be, and never will be.  Nothing like any UFO I had read about but that was no illusion, not a mirage or some atmospheric phenomena. I did not take a picture, as it just did not impress me at all until this morning looking out to see where it was and to take note to go look at the house with Christmas lights in that area.<n>
