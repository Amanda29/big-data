12/31/06 23:15|Marikina (Philippines)||Circle|2 hrs & 45 min.|Sighting over Quezon City Philippines during midnight of December 31, 2006|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54251.html|1|ndxe200612| Sighting over Quezon City Philippines during midnight of December 31, 2006<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were preparing for NOCHE BUENA in preparation for New Year 2007.  I noticed this red shaped object (size of a small planet like Mars) about south-east of the full moon.  It was clear although there was some clouds which at times cover the moon.  The sky was well lit with fireworks display since it was countdown to New Year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought it was Mars but noticed that the object was contant and there was no flickering.  I noticed the object moving into a slow speed going North.  It took quite some time but the speed was constant and it was straight until it disappeared into the horizon.  By that time, my wife&#39;s cousing was with me watching the whole thing.  I thought it was a plane of sort but later ((name deleted)) (wife&#39;s cousin) came inside and claimed that the red object had reappeared and heading into the same position at the same slow constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it until it took the same position as last time and stayed there for quite awhile until it again sped off into the distance at the same slow constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reappeared the second time.  This time my aunt and wife were with us.  It performed the same exercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third time, by then it was already 1:00 AM, January 1, 2007, it reappeared and followed the same path and position.  But this time, it was joined by a second smaller red object which flew parrallel its original route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bigger object then started speeding into the distance at the same constant speed while the smaller red object reached a point parrallel to the original location of the bigger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, the bigger object had already disappeared the smaller object started to follow it, at the same slow constant speed.  I went up to the balcony to follow its route until it finally disappeared.  Time was around 2:00AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that at one point the entire street lamps along our house concked out for a full three seconds before it reappeared.  But no brownout occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the UFO was watching the fireworks display and perhaps it was thinking that it could not be seen because it was a red dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take pictures of it with my sony W50 digital camera but I am not sure if anything came out of it.  I have the file and can send it to you.  Have not touched it really as I am not adept with any software relating to photography.<n>

It was behind the cloulds, the moon was very bright that night so you could see very good. I looked up to the sky and you could see this round oject hovering above the clouds or below it looked like a black ring moving around.  Then it took off straight up leaving a perfict circle in the clouds! That was unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/31/06 22:30|Paramount|CA|Light|2 minutes|Five Lights Sighted Over LA Area on New Year's Eve.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54282.html|4|ndxe200612| Five Lights Sighted Over LA Area on New Year&#39;s Eve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On New Year&#39;s Eve I was at a party outside in Paramount, CA, very close to Long Beach, CA. There were approximately 20 people standing outside and eating and drinking.  Suddenly someone pointed to the sky and we all looked up as we saw five very bright lights. There was a cloud cover that night, but the lights were below the clouds. There were five lights and they seemed to be very high up. Immediately we started speculating and ruled out the chance of them being helicopters, as they were very high and unlike any helicopters I have seen in my military service. We then ruled them out as airplanes, as the cluster of five lights seemed to be hazardous for any airplanes to fly in. Also, there were no flashing wingtip lights as seen on normal aircraft. The third incident, which ruled them out as aircraft to us, was when two of the lights started to converge together. Briefly, they became one light as they met up for approximately 10 second, then they broke off and became two separate lights once again. We thought that perhaps they could be comets, as we could definitely tell that there were fiery sparks breaking off from the lights, which happens when an object enters the atmosphere. But the strange activities of the two lights made it seem nearly impossible for them to be comets. The five lights were not moving in any specific formation, just a round cluster of about three lights on top and two on the bottom, with one following behind the other. We watched the lights for a couple of minutes, speculating, when it looked like one of the lights went out. Perhaps it disappeared into the cloud cover? I do not know, but it looked very much as if someone had put a candle out as the light died out. Right after the first one went out, then slowly and in succession the other 4 lights started to go out, until there was only one. It waited for about 20 seconds, and then that one went out. I would say about 30 minutes later one light reappeared in the sky, lower to the horizon and over the city.  This one! light l ooked very much like one of the five lights previously seen. It zoomed around briefly and then disappeared into the clouds. We tried taking pictures and video on our cameras, but we didn&#39;t have good enough zoom to capture the lights, as they were very high altitude.<n>
12/31/06 22:00|Brawley|CA|Circle|2 minutes|Strange object left hole in the cloud|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54397.html|5|ndxe200612| Strange object left hole in the cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were camping in the desert just outside of Brawley CA. The sky had thick but scattered clouds and the moon was very bright. A dark slow moving circular object without lights was quietly moving just below the cloud line. It came towards our camp, stopped below a cloud and then took off straight up right through the cloud leaving a hole in the cloud it went through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several families in our campsite and atleast 10 people saw it.<n>
12/31/06 22:00|Merritt Island|FL|Circle|1-2  minutes|Orange ball hovering over a river south of the Space Center in Florida|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55015.html|6|ndxe200612| Orange ball hovering over a river south of the Space Center in Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling East on State Road #528 and got off at the Banana River Drive exit in central Florida when as we reached the bottom of the ramp we saw what looked like a round ball of orange fire. It was around 10 pm under clear skies in late December of 2006. We were almost home from an evening of visiting our son and his family when, as we reached the bottom of the off ramp, straight ahead of us in the air we spotted a ball of orange flame hovering in place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife to &#39;look at that helicopter up there.&#39; I said that it had to be on fire and she agreed. It was dark outside but a clear night and unless the ‘helicopter’ was completely painted in florescent orange paint with spotlights shining all around it, the craft we saw had to be engulfed in flames. We fully expected it to suddenly fall to the ground, but to our amazement, it instead just quietly hovered in place until finally it made a lateral move, exactly as a helicopter might do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But where are the blinking lights I said? Any flying craft would have to have some sort of blinking lights on it so as to alert others that it&#39;s there, no doubt it&#39;s an FAA law. But there were no lights, only that glowing orange ball. It was no more than a 1/4 mile away from us, hovering over the Banana River, roughly about 150 feet in the air. Cars began to back up behind us so we left the scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it a UFO? I believe so. I thought so then and I think so now.  A sighting by a retired Air Force Colonel in Arkansas not long after our sighting was similar in appearance, as he was fortunate enough to get a picture of the orange ball like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For background, my wife and I are both about 50 years old and live near the Atlantic Ocean about fifteen miles South of the Kennedy Space Center where I work.  Neither of us drink or do drugs, nor do we, as a general rule, look for or care about the subject of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They were flying in circles, not sure if it was 1 object changing lights or three different ones but probably 3. After about 10 minutes I only saw 2 spot lights in the clouds. Freaky!I&#39;m never gonna forget this, BTW it didn&#39;t make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

To the south, a bright oblong shape, white light Flying West to East.  I wasn&#39;t wearing my glasses at the moment, but as soon as I noticed this object the light had toned down to an Amber color,  then moments later the Amber light toned downed again. To a (Pinpoint) of one or Two red Lights; Which faded out quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then the entire Craft was lost in the darkness, still on a east to west course no lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m  a retired Air Force Radar Operator. My Last 11 Years in the Service was with AWACS as a Crewmember.  This sighting although very Brief was clearly not an aircraft of any sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One: The complete absence of Standard Navigational  lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two: The sighting had no associated engine Sounds, no sound at all.  the Object while heading to the west, was I estimate doing  around 130 Knots Airspeed, and it was  low, maybe 2000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have Oak Trees 45 to 50 feet high and it just above the top brances.  The size of the object can&#39;t be determined.  Nor the shape. It was just a light.  Although my gut feeling tells me it was small and close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (the Pinpoint red light just before it faded was a lot like the afterglow of a Halogen light when switched off).<n>

In this past week of December 26th, 2006, at 6:52 PM and December 31, 2006 at 6:52 PM same time again, these  Golden ball lights with no sound with no other lights came over My area at about 5 miles out at about 5,000 feet from a west to east direction over the North part of the City of  Red Bluff, California. These lights came over while aircraft traffic was in the area at the same time. I know these aircraft seen these lights and the light on December 31, 2006, because one aircraft on the December 31, 2006 at 6:52 PM made a turn towards the light,I am sure it was  to see the Golden ball of light better. The aircraft was a signal prop engine aircraft, civilian because I could hear that it was a ,possible Cesna Type aircraft.  The aircraft was at the  same altituded and a half a mile if not close from the object. The golden ball light was biger then the aircraft&#39;s lights brcause if the aircraft had gone into the light or passed behind it You would not see the aircrafts lights at all. I and two witnesses watched it as it went  over the City of Red Bluff, California the light just went out in front of our eyes.<n>

No wings no exaust and no propeller.  It stayed still for about 10 sec and then drifted behind the mountain so we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.   It looked like a mirror was in the air reflecting light straght at us.  Very Bright.  Total view time abot 30 sec then it was gone.  I would have thought that people @ the ski area would have seen it too because that is what time the mountain closed.  Lots of people getting in their cars.  but so far I guess it was just us that saw it.  I have spent a lot of time up on my hill and have seen all kinds of planes choppers and gliders,  This was none of the above.<n>

It was so far that I could not make out the shape, but it looked as if it was reflecting sunlight off of it, and it was the size of a dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I took my eyes off of it, I had to carefully scan the region of space again to find it. It was stationary. I did not ever see it move the entire time I watched it.  However, when I looked away for a more extended period, perhaps 15 seconds, I could not find it again. There was no streak of vapor associated with it.<n>

I looked up and saw 3 small glowing or metallic spheres. Other people on the street overheard, and looked up as well. One sphere was stationary, one was moving in a steady circle, and the third was moving diagonally across the sky. The woman stated that she had been watching them as she walked up the street for a couple of blocks. She said she had seen 20 or more at once and they were disappearing up into the sky. The three I saw seemed to fade up into the sky as well. A few minutes later 2 more appeared and moved across the sky at a steady rate in tandem, before stopping and remaining stationary. These two were then witnessed by a friend of mine who had been in a store. After the two spheres became stationary, I became uncomfortable and entered the subway station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They were both very high in the sky and one was slowly moving over a 40 minute time to the south.  The larger light was so bright.  It reflected bright red, blue and white.  The smaller light also reflected the same lights.  I alerted my friends to look outside as well, they also were puzzled by the two strange lights.  It was a completely clear night, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  Evenly the brighter light kept moving slow to the south and just disappeared.  The smaller light also disappeared at the same time (40 mins).  Who knows...maybe it was a satilite, but it appeared very odd.  It was brighter than any star I had ever seen.  I am not sure what to think...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star, Sirius??  PD))<n>

They  seemed to be on a dimmer as they were hard to see -yet they had an essence of being reflectors instead of bulbs emitting light  --- no engine sound but a very slight whishing. Each light seemed to be about the size of a dime at arms length. Altitude was around 3500 ft. The entire sighting could have been no more than 6 seconds to cross the sky as much as I could see from my yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Venice 5 blocks from the beach --- as there are lots of city lights about my viewing is somewhat limited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In November around the same time of evening I saw the same formation only a full V --- 11 lights total ---- as they crossed the sky and before losing sight of them the light at the apex seemed to move to the right leg of the V --- I thought it was a flock of geese and dismissed it as &#34;wishful UFO sighting&#34; --- however, each light  was about the size of a dime at arms length. I would estimate the altitude to be around 3500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most curious thing was that I knew earlier today that I should go out tonight and that I would see the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 6:15pm I bundled up and joined the cats on the trampoline for observation.

I&#39;ve had 3 experiences that I found strange worth reporting, particularly after reading some of the reports from Harrisburg, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) About 2 weeks back from (12/29/2006), driving back from work around 7&#39;ish in the evening, I had just entered Harvey Taylor bridge and I was looking at the sky in front towards the state capitol and I see a set of lights in the sky, bright white lights in the distance off to the right side of capitol. My first thought was that it must be lights up in the mountain and then realized the mountains are to my left and I was still wondering what the light was, continuing to drive looking at the road and the sky, by the time I was getting towards the Front St. intersection I could see the lights were turning right to left and just disappeared. By the time I got to the intersection and had a red I was thinking it must have been a plane since there&#39;s an airport close by, but I&#39;ve never seen that many lights and they were very bright and gave the appearance it was in far off and it disappeared, since I have to use 2nd st to get to my apartment on Front St and there are buildings on 2nd I couldn&#39;t see anything more. When I parked my car at the apartment I scanned the sky in the direction in which I had seen the lights hoping to see something but there was nothing, and I thought nothing of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) Today (12/30/2006)I was coming back from my weekly gorcery at Giants (Camp Hill), I was driving back on Harvey Taylor bridge, I had just entered the bridge and again a set of lights this time towards the left side of capitol and a lot closer than what I saw last time. I could count about 6 distinct bright white lights, I couldn&#39;t make out any shape as I continued driving I&#39;m looking at the sky and the road ahead, it&#39;s impossible to stop on Harvey Taylor without getting yourselves killed because a lot of people speed, I had covered about 3/4th of the bridge and the ligths as far as I could make out were stationary and then the lights just disappeared. I kept scanning the sky for anything a plane, anything that could explain the lights as I was driving on 2nd and again when I got to my apartment and parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually see planes in the evening sky from probably the airport close by but they are identifiable becuase you see them, there are the lights which are not unusually bright and you can see them move steadily and then you hear them and if you keep looking you can see them go away from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in this area for close to 4 years now, I think I have a fairly good idea of the Harrisburg skyline, I usually bike or walk and many I&#39;ve taken my bike across the brige to look at the skyline from the other side of the river. I think I can say those lights were not from any building, even though the lights I saw was low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not an expert and I have nothing to gain from this, just found it a little strange and I thought I should report. Coming to the third experience, I have not too much to report. I live in a high rise apartment on the front st, overlooking the river with my apartment windows giving a beautiful view of the mountains in the distance. Some time in the past 2 weeks (it was a weekend because I was home) probably around 2-3 PM, I was going in to the kitchen to make some coffee. There&#39;s a small window in the kitchen facing the mountain, I just instinctively looked outside, and saw a small patch of wispy clouds in the sky over the mountains, probably what made me stop and continue looking at the clouds was a shining disc like object just at the edge of the clouds. I kept staring, thinking that I should go to my living room window because it gives a better view but I couldn&#39;t move and kept staring and I saw the object disappear behind the clouds. I went in to my bed room pulled out my binoculars (I&#39;ve got a 15*70 Porro Prism Celestron) from the shelf and to look the clouds hoping the object would reappear. The clouds was not too much and the sky was really clear and blue, just a little and wispy, but I could see nothing but the clouds. So I put my binocular down, pulled my chair to the window and just sat there staring at the clouds, the strange thing was the clouds disappeared totally, usually you see the clouds moving with an air current but this just disappeared and the sky was totally clear. I sat there in my chair looking out the window and after a while I just went back to my routine life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and I look at the sky with my naked eye and at times with my binoculars (harrisburg city is not the best place to look at night sky). I have no idea about what I saw, just that it was not normal that I&#39;m used to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineer and I work in a field where my main skills are problem solving, I would rate myself as a person with a scientific outlook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not bother to look at the exact time and I did not even bother to note down the date, becuase I still hope that there is a simple explanation and maybe what I was just something very ordinary and easily explained, probably it was just that I found it strange. What brought me to this site was to try and see if there was anyone reporting anything like this in Harrisburg and google search brought me here, I thought for a long time before I decided to post what I saw.<n>

I ALWAYS CHECK THE WINDOWS. I GLANCED OUT MY KITCHEN WINDOW ( THAT FACES  WEST ) AND NOTICED TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST  A BIG BRIGHT ORANGE CIRCLE IN THE DARK SKY. I TOLD MY HUSBAND TO COME AND SEE IT FOR PROOF OF WHAT I WAS, BUT HE SAID IT WAS THE MOON. I WENT BACK TO THE WINDOW , IT WAS STILL THERE.I WENT OUT ON MY DECK TO SEE IT I COULD SEE ANYTHING ELSE. THER WAS NOTHING BUT THE ORANGE CIRCLE. I WENT BACK TO SEE IF I COULD GET MY HUSBAND TO COME AND SEE IT BUT HE WOULDN&#39;T. WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE WINDOW IT WAS GONE.ON TUESDAY 01/02/06, WHILE AT WORK I DECIDED TO CALL TALK RADIO, WSAR - 1400 IN SOMERSET, MA. I SPOKE WITH MIKE MIRAN,THE DJ. AFTER I CALLED IN , A GENTLEMAN CALLED AND SAID HE SAW THE SAME ORANGE CIRCLE, BUT IT DID NOT STAY, AS SOON AS HE SAW IT, IT WAS GONE. HE MENTIONED TO SOMEONE, THE PERSON TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN THE SAME CIRCLE IN 1976 OVER MIDDLEBORO OR ATTLEBORO I&#39;M NOT SURE. THEY HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT WATER, WELL COME TO THINK OF IT, THERE IS THE NORTH WATUPPA POND ABOUT A MILE FROM MY HOUSE THAT SUPPLIES FALL RIVER WITH WATER AND TAUNTON RIVER ABOUT DOUR MILES,THAT IS ALSO IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE CIRCLE. I THOUGHT OF TAKING A PICTURE BUT I DID NOT HAVE FILM IN MY CAMERA, THAT&#39;S WHY I WANTED MY HUSBAND TO SEE IT, SO I WOULD HAVE PROOF.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was late at night. I was towing a heavy trailer. I was not familiar with the area. I do know I was going around a mountain, clockwise. I was near the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my right, thru the passenger side window, I noticed something very large and round.  It had many lights all around it.  It seemed to be descending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I circled the mountain I saw it again.  It still seemed to be moving.  Even though it seemed to be moving, I told myself it was because I was moving.  I couldn’t stop to look.  I told myself it must be a large house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later I asked someone who lives in that area what it could have been.  She told me there was nothing there that sounds like what I described.  To me it looked like a large round house with picture windows all around it.  The windows were lit up. There were lights above and below the windows.<n>

I noticed how the stars were out and I was looking at the Little Dipper, I was facing south looking up.  Below the Little Dipper were two stars shining, to the left of those stars was a very bright object. The bright object was placed like:  X (Little dipper here)      . Star        . Star  		     *  object<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Design did not survive the transfer from the report form to our database.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there admiring the sky, the bright star like object started moving down and to the right a bit in a very precise motion ( in the shape of the letter L).   To make sure it wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me I called my husband to the door of the studio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said look, at that bright object.  Is it moving to you?  He stated, wow, yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after he sat down in the studio.  I continued to watch this object for the next two and a half hours. (9:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. central time).  It was a clear cool night, no winds.   During this time the object made small circles in the vicinity it was placed, it also moved up and down, left and right.  There is a very tall tree in the neighbors yard that I stood behind to watch the object.  I placed myself against my studio and watched the object move left and right up and down and at one point did a small circular move through the tree limbs.  I also stood in the back yard away from all trees and watched this object do the same movements.  My husband came out a couple times to view this object and he did say it was something moving up there.   Once we both saw what looked like a red flashing light from one side of the object. (Unlike any human aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed several commercial airplanes doing their normal flights.  Non of them seemed to be aware or concerned that this object was there.  I could hear the commercial planes go by, I could hear the low faint rummble of the jet engines.  The planes were quite high.  I heard nothing from this object that seemed to hover the small city of Auburn.  I also kept an eye on the surrounding stars to see if there was a change in brightness or positions.  No change noticeable to the human eye. (Of course I did not have a telescope, I will be getting one now.)  I went into the studio for a bit to warm up, always looking out the window or door  to see if there was any change in what this object.  Within one hour the object had moved up to a  parallel position to the star on its  right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Closer to 11:00 p.m. it looked like the object was fading, moving straight back, not up or down. The object began to dim, very slowly.  By 11:30 p.m. it looked as if it were a small spot in the sky, unlike it’s first bright lit form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movements I am describing from the object were not large movements.  Small and precise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing this object I will state again that no other stars had any of the features or characteristics  this object had and the stars never repositioned themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report it but because I did not have knowledge of what to do I did a little research on-line to find this website.  This morning just read a sighting reported by CNN.com in Chicago that happened there within the last 2 days.  Chicago is approximately 230 miles north of Auburn, IL straight up I - 55 North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) Auburn, IL 62615<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a rural area. It was a dark clear night with sveral stars. I was watching the stars when I saw an uncommonly bright &#34;cluster&#34; of lights in a triangle shape hover and dip quickly. At first I thought it might have been a falling star but they were in a formation and they dropped slower than a shooting star and it dropped straight down.  I waited to see if there was a crash on the ground but there was nothing<n>

The day was severe clear and crisp.  There were a few contrails crossing  and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one of the linemen, looking up at the sky.  I asked what he was looking at and he directed my eyes to an object so high up it seemed to be against the blue of the sky.  The object looked like the ball at the end of a pushpin held at arm&#39;s length.  It was the color of quicksilver and looked perfectly spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from south to north and we saw it pass behind a number of contrails; some of which had to be in the FL400 range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more lineman came out to see the object and we observed it move north for about 15 minutes all told.  In the end, it simply vanished and we could not locate it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think whatever it was had to be huge to appear that size to me.  The object didn&#39;t shimmer, shine or give off any sort of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve no idea what it could have been.<n>

Along the way I noticed a yellow/orange ball in the sky. It was about the size of a pea I guess, maybe about a fifth the size of the moon from our vantage point. The sky had a slight overall cloud cover and this thing was I think just at above the level of the clouds. Although you could not see any actual clouds just a faint blanket cover, enough to mask out the stars.  It kind of floated a bit like it was in water and moved along the sky. It then did very slight zig zag movements as it traveled but didn’t stop to turn. The change of movement was straight away. There was no noise at all and I watched it travel across the sky. I tried to see a shape around but this was really difficult. All we could see was the actual coloured light. It then started to fade, I imagined as it ascended up and the cloud got thicker    Was really strange. I don’t have a clue what it was but I know for sure it was not a plane. If it was a helicopter it was silent and I have not seen one with a large static coloured light&#34;<n>

The other lights appeared like &#34;cat eyes&#34;, a color blue that I cannot describe, but were much like a dusty sky blue and not bright in any way.

What I saw was the most profound experience of my life – it happened over the duration of my stay – I arrived on the 26th of December and every night from the 28th-29th I was visited by something in my room.  I had someone staying with me and he saw it as well.  The first night I was sleeping and was woken by a kind of grinding noise, like a car revving – I was laying on my right side of my body facing the wall which had curtains across it – when I woke I didn’t immediately open my eyes, but I listened I thought it was something outside my window of my room – later I learned the curtains only covered a small window but they spanned the whole wall of my room.  I listened and when the sound got louder I opened my eyes.  Directly in front of my face, in my room, there was a ball of light – about the size of a basketball – it began to move way from me as soon as I opened my eyes.  It moved in and thru the curtains while moving away from me, but still in my room.  It got to the end of my bed – sound of the revving still present – then floated out my balcony window.  I stared at the wall directly in front of my face, and I could see the light thru it as it backed thru the forest – I could see the shadow of the plants and trees blowing the wind on the wall of the interior of my room.  Then slowly the light faded away and the wall became solid.  As I lay there I thought of every possible explanation: someone shining a flashlight in my room, I was dreaming – but I wasn’t and they weren’t – it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night I went to bed with the anticipation that something might happen again.  I had told my friend who was staying with me what had happened the previous night and he didn’t believe, he thought I was dreaming.  We went in to our beds and turned out the lights, and I lay there for a bout 2 mins with nothing happening.  Then from the corner of the room – the opposite side from the window – I saw a light.  A small round light formed in the corner of the room, and it began to float over to me and floated across the room and over the foot of the bed until it was directly over my body.  The ball of light was slightly different from the other – it was bluish in color and had tentacle like streams of light coming from it.  If I had to draw a parallel to something – I would say a jellyfish, but it wasn’t a jellyfish.  I woke my friend up by calling his name – I didn’t turn on the light and I told him to look and tell me what he saw and he said he saw it and he described it as I saw it there floating in my room.  We were both quite shaken over it and turned on the light - after several minutes of talking about it, rationalizing it we turned the light out – and we could see it floating there still.  I asked him to turn the light on again and when he did – the light wouldn’t come on immediately – instead it flickered, like an old movie reel – we could still see it – the flickering of the light allowed us to see it still as if the light was on – the light flickered for what seemed like forever, but was only a couple of seconds.  When the light came on – I have to admit I was terrified.  Then I heard a sound – like a plane coming from a distance, but the sound became louder and louder – then I realized it was the same sound from the night before – like an engine revving, but clearer, more defined and definitely louder.  My friend said it was it was in the room – I know it was there and it was loud and frightening, there was no light show or anything – the room was lit and I couldn’t see anything, but the so! und was there and then all of a sudden it wasn’t.  We slept with the lights on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called the Coast Gaurd to see if there was any known lights he stated no and said he would call me back if he had any info. The formation looked like it was spinning and changing shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I firsted noticed it I went inside and got binnoculars this is when I got witnesses.  It moved south west.<n>

Commercial airliner approx. 10K ft. departing from DFW airport. Lights appeared faint due to the height and seemed to be moving approx. twice the speed of the commercial airliner. It was moving west to east. Did not seem to be involved with the aircraft as the air craft was making a slow south easterly turn. The &#34;V&#34; kept on a straight path. Due to the height of the object(s) and poor visibility due to surrounding city lights, that is all I can report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Sitting on from porch facing north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. I watch for shooting stars when I want to relax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Something different. I thought of the flying triangle over Arizona. That is the only thing close. What I saw was much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Just flew what seemed to be a straight, level and high path. Due to the airliner that was below, for a short period...that is my only reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. I felt perplexed and I went in to get my sister, who also saw the same thing. Total time of the sighting was approx. 1.5 min. and 30 seconds for my sister.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. It simply slowly kept on going until the lights of the City of Addison/Carrollton made it too difficult to see. I was originally very faint and hard to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time is not indicate by the witness.  We have assigned an arbitrary time for the sighting.  PD))<n>

There was a single round shaped object that seemed to be hovering over the city. The object had two rows of bright white lights, that were around the edge of the circular shape, and between the two rows of lights was a single bright white light. The object appeared to have been between 500 and 1000 feet in elevation, and was pretty large. The night it happened, there was a low cloud cover, which the object was under. I noticed the cloud cover level, because there was absoulutely no sound coming from the object, and with low cloud cover,and lower elevation of the object, most aircraft would have made some sort of noise. The object moved slowly south, the seemed to sway from side to side loosing and gaining elevation with the sway. The object then slowly turned towards the east and moved away at a very slow pace until it went out of sight behind some buildings. As I changed locations to see the object again, it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance ( who is a marriage and family therapist) and myself (who is an environmental professional) both saw this object for approximately 2 min, and could not identify  what type of know aircraft this could have been.<n>

The jet was traveling from North to South. I noticed at the jet&#39;s 2 o&#39;clock position a small cirrus cloud. As I glanced at the cloud a small egg shape was travelling in front of the cloud. The shape was dark and the cloud sillouetted it well. The object was traveling North to South at about 10,000 ft. parallel to I-75. The object moved at a fast rate of speed. I was able to watch the object for about minute. It adjusted it trajectory slightly to the Southwest and I lost sight. One good comparison event happened as I watched the object: a bird flew in line of sight of the object for a second and I was able to compare and the object and bird was definately different. A minute or so after the object disappeared a small plane(single prop cessna-type) flew from the Southeast to North/Northwest at about 2500 ft. Very different shape also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 6:40, at near the same point in the sky.(At this time I was trying to compare what I saw to other planes) a flash of light caught my eye. The flash was the setting sun reflecting off a mettalic object. I caught sight of an object very similiar to the first. Approximately 10,000 ft, traveling to the North; parallel to I-75. Moving at a high rate of speed. The object slowed for a moment then sped up and I lost sight of it. I did not see anything else. Just to the Northeast is Robins Airforce Base and we see alot of jet traffic. I have seen f-15&#39;s and 16&#39;s and this was totally different from those aircraft. There was no contrails or noise with either event. I did not have a camera and the object was to small for my camera phone. Unfortunately, all I have is anecdotal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the diamond shape but do not know whether these were separate craft or what.  I saw the whole diamond configuration for only a few seconds the top light disappeared and then the bottom light did as well about 15 seconds after the top one.  It appeared to drift southwest but never went above the horizon.  Instead it appeared to lower and fly through trees.  I rolled my window down but heard no unusual noise.  (No helicopter or airplane noise).  It was as plain as day to me but no one else seemed to notice except my son who saw the lower light and the two middle ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to appear and then disapear in less than a second and in that time it had to have traveled half was to a third of the way through the entire sky. All it was was one large light with a smaller light close behind it, probably connected to the same craft. It absolutely did not come in through the clouds then back up giving the illusion of appearing and dissapearing, it seemed like it was traveling in a straight line very quickly and for some reason became visible or lost its cloak somehow.  Very weird. The shape may have been tear shaped but I could be certain because of the immense speed.<n>

This time it was different.  For about ten minutes, I looked up at the sky and there was this shining light in the sky,  at an east south east location.  It was wierd because the sun had not set yet and usually I can only see the moon real bright.  From were I was standing, the moon was to the right of the light.  At first I thought that maybe it was a star that was visible at that time but, I have checked and the brightest star visible from my location is Sirius, at that time it would be impossible to see.  Anyway, stars shine, and shift light when visible.  This was a stationary light, real bright.  After, about ten minutes or so the light exploded, or imploded.  It left a visible cloud of smoke and after this happened, you can see a small bright little orb falling slowly away from the cloud of smoke.  After a few seconds, that small light became stationary, then it disappeared.  A few minutes later, you can see two airplanes one behind the other fly by where this light was.  They were leaving those white trails of smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a light in the sky I didn&#39;t think much of it at first until I saw the light was throbbing kind of fading in and out but still maintaining a high light level.  I saw the objective and when I closed one eye I could see the object zig zagging from side to side.  I went into the living room to awake my roomate but he refused to get up and look.  From my living room I saw the ufo on more of a side-rear view and saw the craft moving up, down, and side to side.  The object was white and when concentrated hard on the light u could see multiple colours.  At first it seemed to have been red and blue but over time it went to  other colours as well.  I returned to my room and it was still there i lied in bed and watched it zig zag out of curosity. My lazy eye kicked in and my sight went out of focus.  During this I saw the ufo itself.  It was a disc shape object, I could only see its shape when i wasnt focused on the lights of the craft.  I saw it spinning clockwise with a light shining down on the sky below.  It was I am predicting a few hundred to thousand feet away.  The object was fairly small but still rather large.  I live in the downtown area of Victoria, bc and I believe it was above the Inner Harbor/James Bay area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This was the second ufo i&#39;ve seen in the general area within the last 3 weeks.  I saw a craft very simular and a lot closer approxmity 3 weeks prior.  The ufo was hovering about 400-800 feet away with the same bright lights.  It zig zagged back and forth.  Within 12 seconds of me seeing the craft it traveled to 1/3 of the size it was.  Roughly a grape fruit size.  It zig zagged abit then took off from a grape fruit to nothing and I saw it to the last second.  It took roughly 6 seconds to get totally out of sight from a grape fruit to spec.)<n>

I was looking N/NW and the object appeared to be traveling east toward Winston-Salem, NC.  It appeared to be about 20-30 miles away but it was hard to tell and was flying at a height that I usually associate with local planes and jets that are landing at the airport in Winston.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my attention that the object (which I assumed to be a plane) didn’t seem to have any of the usual lights required for aircraft.  I lost sight as the object passed on the side of my house so I got up and went to a large window in the front of my house (which faces east) to see the object as it came back into view.  It seemed to turn slightly south and I could finally see a flashing red light on it but the flash was not steady but rather erratic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 15 more seconds or so and then (to my amazement) a white light that I can only describe as looking like a missile (or a laser) shot out from the bottom straight toward the ground.  Needless to say, a burst of adrenaline went through me!  At first I thought a plane had dropped a bomb on the outskirts of Winston and that we might be under attack on our on soil---I stood looking at the sky for awhile and observed nothing else unusual.  The object traveled on and I lost sight of it in the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I had to travel to Tennessee and when I arrived at my parents’ home, I asked them if anything had been said on the news about a bomb (or whatever) being dropped near Winston-Salem------that’s how unnerved I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it between a tree and at first I thought it was the moon untill it went away. When I looked where it had been there was a black shape moving in the sky. It was oval shaped with bottom portion hanging down like a fin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s a very clear night, with no clouds, and at first glance above the streetlight I thought it must be one of the planets as it was a different colour from all the stars (more orange), larger,  and much, much brighter.  Then I realised it was moving, and the light was pulsing. It moved very slowly at first and not in a straight line, so I didn&#39;t think it could be a comet or meteor (as all of those I have ever seen have been very fast and moved in one straight direction only). There was no noise at all from it, which made me think it couldnt have been an aircraft and besides no aircraft lights look like that. It moved to a point directly above where I was, and stayed there pulsing but not moving for about 30 seconds. Then it seemed to go straight up as the light got smaller before disappearing altogether.  A couple of planes passed by at the edge of the sky a few minutes later and they made the normal noise and looked completely different so I am utterly convinced it could not have been a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One group northerly from our position at the Kirkuk Regional Air Base located in Iraq had 3 small fire lines, the other approx south by south west had 1 larger fire line. The two groups of fire lines were oriented in different directions. The fire lines appeared to come from the sky and were bright enough to penetrate the light clouds that passed by.  The lines grew steadily brighter and then receded, but never appeared to change distance, heading, or other appearence.  In the vicinity of Kirkuk their are oil refineries and other plants that have large external flames, however this phenomena has never been experienced here.  It did not appear to be miisles, rockets, aircraft, or other such military weaponry or hardware known.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a hawk floating over my house. After a second or two I realized it had too many wings to be a hawk. It was more of a star shape with about six points, dark against the bright blue December sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next guesses of a very large leaf or (hah!) a flying squirrel were ruled out by the altitude of the object. I guessed it was flying at over 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cruised silently from almost directly west to east, at roughly 120 to 150 knots at my estimated altitude. As it approached the trees on the eastern horizon, I could no longer make out the points of the star. It now appeared more like a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps unrelated to this, a helicopter (which I took to be military from the sound) followed the same course (and apparent altitude) exactly ten minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier today I was taking pictures of hawks and so had my telephoto camera within 20 feet of me but had no time to take a picture of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object may have been a very large balloon, though I haven&#39;t seen many star-shaped balloons of this sort. It flew in the direction of the wind. It made no sudden turns or other unusual movements, nor did it make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was one unit high and 6-7 wide. It was dark grey in color against a light grey of thick overcast, though the clouds had visible forms.  It was well defined with sharp corners, so I actually thought it might be a billboard hung from something, but there was nothing above it. There were no letters or other forms on it. No one else seemed to be noticing, but we were driving.  My wife and I are professional educators 67 and 68 years old. It was in the sky north of Orlando at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The best way to describe it would be to say it pulsed at a 2 second interval OFF, ON, OFF, ON. I slowed down to try and see what direction it was traveling but I could not determine, it seemed to be moving slowly. I wish I had stopped but instead I drove about 35 mph. After turning 2 curves in the road I looked back over my shoulder and through my mirrors but could no longer see the light, it could have just been out of my line of sight.

I was watching the planes going in and out of McCarran.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The east bound jets mostly went directly overhead.  I saw one of these jets, headed east, that was accompanied by another object, which was directly under the jet, travelling at exactly the same speed and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might have been about 100 feet under the jet.  It was very shiny, and did not have any wings.  It was simply a sphere.  It looked like it kept a constant distance from the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a very clear view of the object and the plane, and comparing its size to that of the jet, I would guess it was maybe 20 ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and 2 other people came outside, and they all 3 saw the same thing.<n>

It was a very clear night and I was looking up at the clear starry sky when a triangular formation of white, orb like lights flew over my house from behind me.  There were three orbs extending down the left side of the formation, and two down the right, with one at the point.  They made NO noise and flew in perfect formation while turning to my right as they appeared to be doing a large U-turn.  At what seemed to be the apex of their turn, the last orb in the uneven left side separated from the formation and maneuvered itself precisely into the same position on the right side of the formation.  I realized then that these orbs of light were totally independent objects flying in one perfect formation.  I was now trying to focus even more intensely on whatever these orbs were and began to notice that their was slight variations in the intensity of light being generated by the orbs.  The formation continued on its flight path and disappeared from sight when the house blocked my view, completing almost a perfect U-turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any noise coming from these objects, and had no real way of judging the distance between them and myself.  A major highway is within sight of the house from the deck.  The path these objects appeared to take almost makes me wonder if they saw the highway and decided to turn around in the other direction.  I stood there for sometime waiting for them to come back, hoping they were flying in a circle so I could see them again and be more prepared for what I saw the first time.  But nothing came within sight for the next 30 minutes I stood there waiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the days to come, I contacted a customer of mine who is an Air Traffic Controller at the Lancaster Airport.  I asked him if they had any reports of strange lights in the sky Christmas Eve and was told they did not.  He did ask why, and I briefly explained.  His analytical disbelief in what I saw prevented me from sharing this experience with anyone but my wife and kids.  A few close friends were told whenever the topic of ghosts and UFO’s came up, which is how I received the link to this website.  A friend of mine sent it to me and suggested I read up and submit my story.  I’ve been a believer since that night and would love to know more, see more, do more.  It’s exciting whenever I think about it.  Thanks for this website, as a place to examine what I do not totally understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it appeared there was an airliner that was closer to us and we could clearly see the flashing lights and strobes as it made it&#39;s approach to Sac Int. This object had no lights that flashed or strobes that identified it as a plane or helicopter. As it moved it seemed to be slowing down. My wife thought it was stopping and then moving slowly again. I pulled the car over and we got out and watched the object. It was stopped and motionless. The light began to pulse slowly. It also appeared to be swaying from side to side like a kite in a breeze. Then it began to move slowly north. We got back in the car and continued driving north, watching the light from the car. I pulled up to a stop light and the light was moving slower and then stoped again, then began moving back to the south for about 5 seconds then started moving north again. I turned right (east) to get to my house so I lost sight of the object for about 30 seconds. I pulled up in front of my house and got out in a hurry and the light was still visible to the west and it was moving north. Then it moved a little faster and disapeared in about the same way it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One of our party was very frightened, so we were forced to leave before it went out of sight.  We couldn&#39;t find it when we got back to the house.  None of us have ever seen anything like this before and can&#39;t emagine what it could have been -- we told the two children with us that it was Santa&#39;s sleigh.

I was thinking to myself, &#34;Thats going way to slow to be a jet.&#34; I went out onto my patio and watched it approach. As it was coming, no sound was heard. It was not to high as it approached, it was rather low. 5000-6000 feet maybe. As it was directly over me it was triangular shaped with what looked to be two jets off of the back. There were white beacon lights on each edge of the triangular shape. As it went over, it was completely silent. I knew it wasnt a jet because of its speed. It was going slow, almost hovering. Then, it was right in the path of an oncoming jet plane, luckily it did move out of the way. Then, it picked up speed and made a southeasterly turn and picked up speed, then it went out of sight. I never did hear any sound from that triangular craft. It was chilling. I know what i saw was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light appeared to be moving southward away from us and the made a slow turn westward. As we watched, trying to figure out what it was, it began to get brighter and then split into two seperate but equally bright objects. We then got in the truck to try to get to higher ground for a better view. Approx. five minutes later we arrived at St. Vincent&#39;s hospital parking lot where , approx.2 to 3 minutes later while scaning the sky, the light appeared again. This light was moving in a south easterly direction and stayed visible for about 30 sec. before getting brighter and and spliting into three parts, one from the top and one from the bottom. We waited approx. 7 to 8 min. before we saw another light moving in the same direction as the second. This light came from farther away than the second and was moving at a greater speed, slightly bobbing up and down as it went before the light faded out and was gone. We did snap two shots of the objects on a camara phone, but as we continued to snap a few more shots the camera gave a message of &#34;picture failed.&#34; The screen on the phone then went hay wire and the screen pixilated in in multiple colors, which has never happened before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

12/24/06 19:30|Arcadia|NY|Unknown|4 seconds|On Christmas Eve we saw a large dark craft glide from one cornfield across a road and into another field.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55907.html|80|ndxe200612| On Christmas Eve we saw a large dark craft glide from one cornfield across a road and into another field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was on Christmas Eve. We were traveling by car through a rural area - we were surrounded by fields with no streetlights. We were just approaching a hill when a car came down the hill, facing us. As they came down the hill, that car braked and its taillights illuminated the hill behind them in a reddish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In that glow both my father and I saw a craft gliding across the top of the hill from one cornfield into another. It was dark gray with no lights and massive - it took up the entire road, we could not see the beginning or end of it. It moved more smoothly than anything I have ever seen; cars, planes and ships can move smoothly but this glided almost as if automated. It was like it was on a conveyor belt. Then the car approaching us stopped braking and its taillights went off and the hill fell into darkness again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my father and I were shocked. We are from that area and are well acquainted with tractors, cars, trucks and anything other vehicle in local use and we could not think of anything it could be. It was just too huge. Furthermore there were cornfields on each side of that hill - there was no reason for any kind of craft to pass at that location. As we drove up and over the hill, I looked into the fields but could see nothing... everything was pitch black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This probably isn&#39;t related but something odd happened the following morning on Christmas. My parents&#39; house is very remote and too set back from the road for anyone to approach on foot. Yet we discovered HUGE footprints leading from the driveway through the snow around the house... and they just stopped in the middle of the yard. They didn&#39;t turn around and they didn&#39;t go anywhere else. The tracks just ended as if whoever made them vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Christmas and we were obviously busy with other things, but the sight of that craft gliding from one field into another has haunted me ever since. I know it&#39;s not a &#34;flying&#34; object as it was on the ground but it was not of this world either. I&#39;m sure of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is when I began to think they weren&#39;t ordinary aircraft. At this point they&#39;er moves became even more eratic, but only very briefly. The two then lined up side by side again and started off in a north, northeast,direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened as my mom and I were picking up my father for a christmas eve gathering.

I ran out on deck and could see a single object  North of us, moving from West to East, either over Dundas Island or Dickson Entrance. It was hard to tell how large or how far away it was. I’ll guess, between 2 and 10 miles. We watched it for about 30 seconds until it went out of sight, below the tree line in front of us. It glowed a white light, with a dome of light in front of it. It seamed to travel a steady course. It was a dead quiet, still morning and we heard no noise from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

12/24/06 02:55|Indianapolis|IN|Unknown|15 seconds|Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo's with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63647.html|87|ndxe200612| Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo&#39;s with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear this account is entirely accurate and 100% honest based on my unforgettable recollection and account made immediately after the event. I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I’m taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I’ve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse’s rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor’s floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I’m uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I’ve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon. Let me know what you think. THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRD.<n>

I was with my boyfriend, but he was asleep in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a brilliant lime-green light that streaked in an absolute vertical path (I am an artist, and very good at drawing, so I am very clear about vertical and horizontal alignment - this was a straight vertical) which was visible from the upper part of the windshield down more than halfway to the horizon.  My line of sight was clear in front of me, mountainous to my left side, and ocean on my right. The road runs right on the coast in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first assumed that it was a comet or shooting star, but I have never seen one like that before, and another quality was that the actual object was glowing that brilliant lime-green color, which I have never heard of in a comet.  It left a long green glowing tail the full length that I could see it and contiued to glow for another second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unusual aspect was that it seemed as though it was a spherical object that was itself dark in color, but was &#39;glowing&#39; all the way around it, because the object seemed to look like the color &#39;thinned&#39; toward the center, and was extremely vivid at the edges, like it was producing the light as an aura or emission, it appeared like a green corona. I definitely saw darkening in the center and made mental note of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t estimate the size but it seemed much larger than any shooting star I have seen. I have observed meteor showers, and never seen anything that is similar.<n>

It was dark out, so the object was easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend seated in the passenger seat was taking a sip of water from a bottle just at the very moment the object appeared, and therefore didn&#39;t see it (very frustrating, because people don’t believe you).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a fuzzy faint glow around it. It stayed for about 5-6 seconds, then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had heard of others seeing &#34;something&#34; while on that particular road before, but had never experienced it myself until then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think careful monitoring of.this area should be seriously considered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I took three photos each slightly to the right of the first. When I printed the photos (digital camera) I was amazed to find what looked like a full moon. On closer inspection, I discovered two other less bright  circular objects. I still don&#39;t know what I captured on film. When I took the photo, I was so concentrating on the composition, and trying to capture the new moon behind the branches that I did not see anything else. It was not until I printed the photo that I discovered that there was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t a craft in the usual association of the word, but it was a literal UFO.  It was large, between 80 and 110 feet long, and was approximately 700 feet up in the air.  It was smoke colored.  the sky was otherwise clear.  It was the darker &#34;smudge&#34; of a cloud in the sky that caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving in normal traffic.  This is a secluded area, in the mountains/hills.  When I saw it, i just looked at it because it was odd, it looked like a puff of smoke in the sky, but it was moving laterally, instead of vertically, as smoke usually does.  I watched it for a second ro two, and it ballooned out and took on an almost serpentine shape.  It expanded and collapsed in upon itself.  It seemed to be more of an entity than a craft, but I don&#39;t know.  I might have imagined it to be just a figment of my imagination, except, its persistancy was odd.  I hit my brakes and tried to keep a watch on it.  I drove under trees and could watch it ebtween the branches as I drove udner them.  I had no hallucinations either before or after this episode, and I was rested and stress free, having gotten off work 4 hours early due to an absence of clients.  It seemed to play in the sky.  And then, after about 40 seconds of watching it, it just collapsed in upon itself, and disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no means by which to even try to explain this.  I have no knowledge of anything on record even close to it.  It seemed to be made of something semi reflective, or shimmery, and cloud/smoke colored.  It seemed to move as if it was an organic being.<n>

It hovered in one spot for the entire time I was looking at it.  It had a blue, red, and white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue and the red lights were twice as prominent as the white light.  The white light seemed as it was the light of a white house.  My vantage point did not give me adequate means to give me solid knowledge that it emanated a beam of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to find out any additional information from the local police departments and was not contacted by the police departments after I filed the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a joke and why I have been led to even write you is because of the idea of a missing person and a UFO does not sit well with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I prefer to keep this discreet but welcome a phone call.<n>

I watched it, and it seemed to be the shape of a small circle, silver colored.  It was moving slowly in the direction which I believe is to be south of where I was.  I was still driving, approaching a red light, and kept an eye on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I had a feeling that it was not an airplane, I decided I would turn left into a buisness area to get a better look.  Stopped at the red light, I was able to watch the object for a good 30-45 seconds.  I noticed it was still moving slowly (I was completely stopped), and the color appeared to be a white/silver color.  But every few seconds it would turn a darker color, almost as if it was rotating, and the other side had a different color.  Maybe it was the reflection of light on it, but that did not seem the case to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the light turned green, I quickly turned and pulled into a parking lot.  When I got out to search for the object, I could not find it.  I had no idea where it had gone, maybe it was still around, but I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Officer asked if I was watching or noticed the &#34;lights&#34; beyond the Prison water towers facing North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glimpse I noticed two flourescent orange orbs of light equally distanced from each other which appeared to be hovering.  I grabbed a pair of Binoculars and hoisted my hands on window bars to steady the shaking of my hands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now a clear shot I watched as both orbs seemed to be in conjunction with the other, perfect match of each others size... As one orb would appear to get brighter the other would dim then two smaller lights shot from the left orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes or so watching these objects I witnessed a smaller row of orange orb-like lights seem to have turned on, above the two bigger orbs, this was all one object I&#39;m sure. These smaller lights seemed to &#34;twinkle&#34; as they spun in a sort of carousel motion. The closest thing to the looks of the object is a gigantic freight-liner with running lights coming at you head-on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for an approximate 2 hours. There is nothing but BLM land and forest there.  Later that morning at 0600 Hours I was relieved of shift and drove up a single dirt road to where I thought this object was, my car lights began to putter dim and I turned around and took off!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in the Air Force and have seen many strange lights but this is the closest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Both sets of lights changed cadence several times and reversed colors (the red lights became white and the white lights became red).  This same pattern continued for approximately 40 minutes with periods of hovering.  A third white, bright light streaked somewhat slowly in a southwest direction.  This third object started in the middle of the other two objects and then appeared to burn out or disappear as it approached the treetops.  It looked like a shooting star but burned much brighter, travelling far slower and over a shorter distance than a typical shooting star.  No sounds were audible at all unlike helicopters and airplanes which emit a distinct sound as they pass by.  My wife witnessed the same experiences at the same time.  We tried to videotape the event but the camera lost power right after I turned it on and attempted to zoom the lens.  The battery was half-full when I turned it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two lights that split came back to one, and the fourth light disappeared.  The three remaining lights all remained stationary and ever initially seeing the lights at 8:18pm, they disappeared at 8:28pm.  The lights were very similar to what I observed on 12/6, except instead of being southwest of Maricopa, AZ, the lights were over the Gila River Indian Reservation, inbetween the Estrella mountains and Tablerock Mesa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military flares??

We both commented &#34;look at the moon&#34; and then we felt an eerie feeling and it disappeared within 2 seconds. We both then said &#34;what was that!&#34; My mother described it as large and egg shaped if the egg was vertical with the bottom being straighter than the top. My mother also said that the right had side of it was obscured by something. This object was motionless in the sky and was the relative size of the moon, if the moon had been out that night but it wasn&#39;t, and the sky was clear with billions of visible stars. We both felt that the moon couldn&#39;t go behind a cloud that fast and even if it did, there would be some sort of a glow around the clouds as they covered it. It was as if someone turned off the light once they knew we could see them. This incident was reported to local Newspaper office.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched for it to return but it didn&#39;t. Many craft of this kind are sen in my area. It&#39;s a phenomenon referred to as the &#34;Corydon Lights&#34;.

The light was also heading north bound. My husband made a u-turn to park in an empty parking lot across the street to get a good look. When we parked, we were surprised to see the the light had also changed direction and was in the sky in front of us. The light became very bright and blurry. No matter how much we stared at it, neither of us could focus on it. It danced in the sky from side to side in an unsual pattern. I noticed three men across the street outside a coffee shop. They were also looking up at this strange object. It was a big ball of fire. The way it moved in the sky was unlike anything I have ever seen. Afer five minutes tiny balls of fire dropped from the huge ball of fire. When this happened, I got scared. I didn&#39;t know what was falling. I even told my husband to get back in the car. Several of these smaller balls of fire fell from the large one. As the objects fell, the original fire ball shrank in size until it was gone. Once it was gone, I looked back over to the men that were across the street looking up at it. I told my husband that we should drive up to them and ask them if they could make sense of what we had just seen. Unfortunately, they got in there car and left before we could get to them. Once again, this ball of fire dancing around in the sky was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We left my house at 6-7 and started heading to his place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live out in the boondocks so nothing really ever happens, barely any aircraft fly over and its just away from the city (Clarksville, TN). I know Fort Campbell is close but like I said theres never really and light or planes or anything and these weren&#39;t going towards Fort Campbell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we were driving to his house and saw a bunch of lights that looked like they were under a big awkward looking diamond. At first I thought it was a B-2 but the shape just wasen&#39;t right, it was a lot bigger, and it was wider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just hovering there in the sky and then all the lights but 3 turned off and it started picking up speed really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept driving and saw 2 more about half a mile away from the first.

(I was on the upper floor and didn&#39;t look up but sideways through the angled skylight.) At first I thought it was an odd reflection of a car on the street below, and for about 10-15 seconds I tried to get my bearings, figure out how in the world it was reflecting into this upward facing window. I then realized it was a flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the next skylight which I could stand directly below (inches from the glass) and continued observing the object. As the craft approached my vicinity, I noticed there were more than just the two &#34;headlights&#34; on the front. There was a series of six lights on the bottom of the craft about midship, in a 2x3 rectangle configuration extending from fore to aft. From either side was a light on each of what may have been the tips of a very short wingspan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, there were 10 lights on the object, each off-white. (Groups were similarly colored, and each group varied in color temperature only slightly.) There were no blinking lights on the craft, and no red or green beacons, as per federal aviation regulations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be about 50-100 feet above the treeline, due East, almost perfectly so. I could hear the object clearly through the window. It made a loud, low whooshing/rumbling sound unlike any aircraft I had heard before - almost otherworldly, like something you&#39;d hear in the movies. It traveled fairly slowly, perhaps between 20-50 MPH, although this may be a poor estimate. Regardless, it was traveling FAR slower than a plane, and slower than I have seen most helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over me, almost perpendicular. When it had passed over me, I could see what appeared to be two thin poles jutting out of the front of the craft in the vicinity of the &#34;headlights.&#34; As it eclipsed my view, I quickly darted downstairs and out the door to continue my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I had been observing the craft for about a minute and the trip downstairs took approximately 5 seconds. When I got outside and looked at the sky, I could no longer see the craft. I have a clear line of sight in the direction it was heading and estimate it should have taken approximately 1-2 more minutes for it to evade my sight. I also could no longer hear the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All said and done, I have never seen this lighting configuration before, and the sound it emitted was very odd - neither the sputter of a propeller nor the hum and hiss of a jet. I&#39;ve lived near airports - large and small - all my life, and I&#39;ve seen and heard a lot of aircraft, and this one was unlike any other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding this location, it is a heavily wooded and sparsely populated area and the nearest airports are 10 miles North and 15 miles South/South West respectively. There is, to my knowledge, no place within at least 5 miles to land an aircraft, even a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The word (light or lights) is one of the very few words in his limited vocabulary and could mean a wide variety of things. Not expecting much I looked up and saw what appeared to be an unusualy large star or planet. The &#34;stars&#34; larger than average size, unusual brightness and semi-sqared shape really got my attention. It also appeared to have several smaller lights ringing or dotting it&#39;s parimeter. As for movement, it looked mostly stationary, like an airliner does when flying twards you on decent from medium altitude. Not a very dramatic sighting for sure, but I&#39;m sure curious as to whether anyone else noticed this, or was it just some normal celestial occurance. Note that it was bright enough and unusual enough for my toddler to take notice.<n>

They were on for about thirty seconds to a minute and then they went out altogether, like someone turned off a light switch, snap, they were gone. After a couple of minutes the whole thing started again ending the same way after about thirty seconds to a minute. They were over the horizen to the north, higher than a helicopter but lower than a jet.   When I told my mother about seeing them she said they sounded very simliar to the Phoniex lights of 1997. Looking at those on the internet I can state that is exactly what I saw except these were much brighter.  Afterward the lights went out the second time  nothing else happened for about ten minutes and then I noticed helicopters from the Marine base(29 Palms) flying around the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft had thrusters it looked like on each side front and back of the craft it was grey and silver and left no trail what so ever then all of a sudden it was gone in a blink of an eye The one happened over my house very high in the air. Unfortunatly I have no pictures or video but I know what I seen those days and I hope one day there will be some light shedded on these events and the goverment to acknowledge this to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The circles and line appear clearly in Google Earth at latitude 34.152137, longitude -115.573694.  The line appears to eminate from the exact center of the circles and point due north.  The outer circle is 400&#39; in diameter, and the inner circle is 200&#39; in diameter.  The line is 500&#39; long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An entry in Google Earth Community shows a location marker very near there titled: &#34;SHEEP HOLE MOUNTAINS SONIC BOMB TARGET #2&#34;.

We had left the turnpike to avoid the crowds and to get a glimpse of the sunset over Lake Okeechobee on our way home to SW Broward county. This is a very remote area west of Ft. Pierce lined with thousands of acres of cattle ranches and sugar cane fields. As it was late Sunday afternoon there were very little, if any, other vehicles on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly we came upon a flock of birds behaving very erractically. They were sort of disorientated-swarming like insects. Two birds actually crashed into a billboard and hit the ground. We found this to be very strange and disturbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds later my husband remarked that he hadn&#39;t seen a car behind us for at least twenty miles.I pulled down my visor with a mirror on it and saw some headlights and said &#34;Well, there&#39;s one now.&#34; A vehicle was on the road behind us about 1 mile back. I looked up in the mirror again and saw that this &#34;vehicle&#34; was quickly approaching in a &#34;hyper-jump&#34; kind of way. I looked again and the thing was practically on our bumper. I yelped and my husband shouted &#34;This guy&#39;s not gonna pass us- he&#39;s gonna ram us!&#34; I pulled my visor down to a different angle to get a better view and that&#39;s when I saw that this &#34;vehicle&#34; had no tires/wheels!! (It was shiny like chrome with a arrangement of lights like I&#39;d never seen.) Of course we were very excited at this point and my husband swerved to the shoulder of the road thinking that this thing would hit us. We turned our heads to the left in unison and it literally disappeared in front of our very eyes. We jumped out of the car and looked up down and all around and there was nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were very warm, daylight, clear skies, flat land, and very quiet. This craft emitted no sound!  I haven&#39;t slept in three nights...................<n>

It was a clear night/morning. He saw it for about 1-2 seconds, but another witness travelling in a different vehicle saw it for a bit longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother saw it for a couple of seconds, he presumed it to be about the size of a basketball and 75 feet away, &#34;could&#39;ve been bigger&#34;. It changed colours, from yellow to purple and there was a light trail from it (do not know how long) . He thought he saw something dangle from beneath it &#34;like a wire&#34;. It travelled diagonally from the top of the treeline to a few feet off the ground then &#34;just disappeared&#34;. They didn&#39;t stop to take a closer look (Why they didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t know)He said it &#34;sorta travelled slowly&#34;. It was tough for him to understand what he saw as it was for a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say this about what the other witness said, but bear in mind this is my brothers word about it, and I haven&#39;t spoken to that witness yet. He saw it for a few seconds, but it came from the sky (how high or direction, I do not know)but it did change colours as it descended. From red/blue/white/purple etc. It changed frequently. It left a light trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled slowly then disappeared, just as my brother had said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what this could be, but I have another family member who has seen &#34;an orb&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/16/06 23:00|Austin|TX|Light|10 min|Unknown Light over Austin, TX|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54045.html|144|ndxe200612| Unknown Light over Austin, TX<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in my driveway talking to my girlfriend on the cell phone when I happened to see a star move from the East heading toward the West. At first I thought it might have been an airplane since aircraft do fly along that route on final approach to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. This however just appeared like a star. I never blinked or changed color. After about 1 minute of viewing it stopped and remained stationary for about 2 minutes before proceeding on a N-NW heading. After about 20 seconds of that heading it changed and started heading SW coming to a stop again after about 15 seconds. It remained in position for about 2 minutes before heading W again. I then saw it stop and hold position for about 3-5 minutes. During this time, the clouds began to move into the area and altough they covered the stars, they only obscured the object. I believe it was either bright enough to be visible through the clouds or may have been in the clouds. I saw it proceed to head W again through the faint bit of light in the clouds and finally lost it after another couple minutes. I did not hear any sounds, witness any other lights or aircraft in the area. The next aircraft to fly in the vicinity did not arrive until about 20 minutes after I last saw the object. I also was unable to get the object on my camera phone because it blended into the stars too well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was headed to feed my horse (which is approximately a 20 minute drive).  It was a nice drive, the skies were clear with possibly a few higher clouds in the sky, but you could still see the stars.  I can’t recall if it was a full moon or not, but I know the moon was bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The barn is in the back of a subdivision, at the end of a dirt road about a mile off the main road of the subdivision, backing up against a pipeline. The road is barely wide enough for 2 cars to pass one another in certain places. We had received a lot of rain in the past 2 weeks, so the road was well worn with large holes from the rain, as well as from the 18 wheelers that traveled the road headed for the M.U.D. maintenance facility near the barn.  Traveling the road in its condition, along with the deer that cross the road at all hours, at a pace of 10 miles per hour was the fastest, safest speed you could travel on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About halfway down the road (headed toward the barn), I started getting a strange feeling I was being watched. (I have had these feelings before, but just played it off in the past as though it was the horses or deer watching me.) Being how is was dark, I was alone (with my 6 year old son), and the barn is in an isolated area, I hurried to get the horse fed. It couldn’t have taken more than 10 minutes to fill his water bucket and give him his grain and hay. I locked the gate and headed back down the road towards the main street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I came around a curve, I noticed 2 red dots about 5 ½ or 6 feet from the ground in the trees. My first though was it was an opossom sitting on a limb of a tree. I kept my eye on them because I couldn’t fiqure out why its eyes were so red. They were bright, bright red and had a glow to them. As I got closer I realized they were teardrop shaped and way too big to be an oppossom. The closer I got, I could see a silhouette of a being. Thinking it was a person standing there, I tried to see if I could recognize the person wondering why he was in the area so late. The body was very skinny, very dark grey or black in color with a very small pot-belly. It wore no clothing. Its hands didn’t seem to have any fingers, although it had a thumb-like appendage. The harder I stared at its face trying to make out any facial features, the less I could see. The face, although I could see the body perfectly, was very cloudy and continued to blur the harder I tried to see anything. The only movement I observed was the movement of the face/head as I passed it. It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded the next corner I stopped my car and put it in reverse, intending on backing up to take another look at what I had seen. I looked at the display clock on my dash and it read 12:30 am. It should have been reading no later than 10:35 or 10:40 pm. I put my car back in drive and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was joking with my 14 year old son about what I had seen, never really thinking twice about it. Later that evening when I went to feed my horse he wouldn’t have anything to do with me. He went to the very back of his stall and would not come near me even when I put out his feed. For the next 2 months he acted in the same manner towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t until the end of April 07 when my insomnia started coming back that I realized I had not had any problems going to bed and staying asleep. I had in fact been getting 9 hours of undisturbed sleep every night for the past 4-4 ½ months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no photos, although, I could draw a picture of what I seen that night.<n>

The dispatcher said they had just received a call of two loud booms and gave the officer the address. The caller stated that it was toward the south of his residence but nothing looked out of the ordinary. Shortly after, another call came in describing two loud booms around the pierceville/deleware area. This time two bright flashes of light were seen in the southern sky and followed by the loud booms. Police checked the railroad tracks for a possible train accident. Everything checked ok. Yet another call came in to the dispatcher. Reports of two loud booms in the area of (address given)but the caller did not witness anything. I called my mom and sister who had heard the booms as well but they are about four miles apart. This incident took place within about a ten mile radius.  The sky was clear and no rain or storms were in the area. I contacted the police but they said they do not know what it was. Could it have been a meteroite that had broken up and into two sections (two flashes) and each piece broke the sound barrier (loud booms)? I don&#39;t know but I would like some theroies on this (no assanine theroies please).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in between four major airports and always see planes it was not a formation of planes becaused there seemed to be atleast onehundred objects or more it was dark outside and they seemed to have a faint glow but not too luminious.The light was a dimmed white ,grey and black and seemed to pulsate. The way it was moving i could not tell if it was one object or fleets of objects but it was syncronious in movement .It was going from northwst to southest.  It flew not to far from a plane in the sky and the plane was high up. Another guy came up the street and observed it too i asked him what he thought it was he said the object appeared to be one object but large and kinda cloaking in and out like rippling water effect . I still think it might have been several objects  because they shifted place simontaneiously. my uncle agreed it was so hard to say what it was but i know what it wasnt and it did not look like anything i have seen before.There was no sound it could have been a mile in legnth because it took up atleast a quater of the sky i could see from my view.It also had a dark shaded cloud that seemed to ride with this event the cloud was much larger in size . it moved fast but not faster than the planes up there where it was at . It dissappeared out of my sight others had to see this there is no way on earth that alot of people did not see this. Im not soo surprised of what i saw but how could no one else see this it was huge event ether way u look at it.It was very similar to the ones i saw on a mexican news report. These where traveling in somewhat of a v shape could have been almost seen as a large flock of geese but these where no geese. im sure others on my block saw it but not every one feels comfortable talking about stuff like this i understand. i am a little ! worried about something of that size and nature was not on the evening news for real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Manuevered in fast tight curves very close to each other. Very low to the ground (100ft?). Had appearance of landing lights when you are facing a conventional aircraft and intially I convinced myself that&#39;s what they were, I watched for running lights blinking and didn&#39;t see any that&#39;s when I became more suspicious. They moved so fast and close to each other that I could no longer believe that they were  conventional aircraft of any form. Near the end the two objects stopped swooping around and stopped in the same location one above the other by maybe 50ft. for maybe a second then they both curved away from each other in oppsosite directions. One heading North the other south. I watch the one heading north for about 10 seconds until I lost  tracks behind trees.  We were just south of Burbank airport and I was able to compare them to conventional aircraft including a helicopter that flew into the area.  I was able to see the running lights of these aircraft and none of the them were running landing lights. It was the comparison to these vehicles that led me to believe after careful thought and analysis that these objects needed to be reported. I know what aircraft can do and these were NOT conventional aircraft and moved consistent with an object that was not subject to gravity or inertia<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

He had intended to photograph the sunrise and captured a series of photos that show an object that he said was rising in a swirling motion (corkscrew) from the ground up.The time on the photos indicate that the sighting started at 7:11 AM and ended at 7:13 AM. He was using a digital camera and the photos were made as fast as the camera would cycle.There is an aircraft con-trail visible in the background that seems to go approximately North to South. The object seems to change shape, but since he stated that it was swirling, it could be just just different views of the same shape.

I was listening to the radio...just watching the road in front of me.  It was 7:20 am.  It was dawn but not quite light yet.  The sky was still a deep blue color.  Clear weather, no clouds.  Off in the horizon at about a 60 degree angle from myself, a bright blue light appeared to come around the curvature of the earth on the left of me and continue on a direct course until it disappeared around the curvature of the earth on the other side of the horizon approximately 2-3 seconds later.  The color of the light was about that of a blue LED light that people use to decorate the hoods of their cars with.  It was deep, bright....almost neon.  It truely looked almost exactly like a LED light.  It could tell it was very far in the distance and high in the sky based on it&#39;s position relative to the horizon.  This thing was booking it.  The speed it must have been travelling to transverse the entire curvature of the horizon from one side to the other in 2-3 seconds is mind boggling.  Even at the distance I was, the light appeared to be about 3-4 times larger than a bright star in the night sky...ofcourse that&#39;s my own comparison, it was already dawn so there were no stars visible behind it to directly compare it&#39;s size to.  I was very far away and listening to the radio so no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I saw a white smokey trail come out of the southern horizon quite a distance away from us. I would have to guess on the order of several miles or more. At first I thought it was some type of rocket lifting off, the zig zagging of the trail indicated that. The trail abruptly cut off after a few minutes of rising. Then a minute or so later a second trail appeared going up in the same way about a thumb width away from the first trail. The second one rose much higher. I measured it with my hand on its side, it went up a little more than the width of my hand then vanished. A few seconds passed, and another trail appeared above the trail that had just cut off. I assumed it was the same object, but I could see a glowing bright light at the tip unlike in the previous trails. The sun was up above the horizon and to my left. The bright light flew to the west for a few seconds and then stopped and stood still. A large haze started to come from the object, spreading out to make a sphere of haze that was by my guess a mile wide. This haze stood in the air for at least five minutes after the light had vanished. The trails had not dispersed when I had gotten on the bus and stopped looking. I looked at a clock, it had been twenty minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about six of us there who all saw it. Two adults and four teenagers including myself. Later when we got to a speech tournament, my coach had talked to a coach from Akron (a full 30 miles away from Canton) whose students had also described to her an identical event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Wallops Island, VA.

The light then went out and re -ignited, then went out again leaving a zig zag contrail similiar to the challenger contrail. The contrail glowed in the morning dawn for 15 min. I thought, space junk, meteor, or a jet plane had exploded. It looked like a failed rocket launch on the horizon. I have seen no info yet but others driving east must have seen it. It was huge.

It was still mainly dark but dawn was just beginning and you could still see the stars and moon. The sky was almost completely clear with only the odd low wispy cloud. After maybe 30-45 seconds the object caught my attention as I was looking in an E.S.E. direction. It appeared to be quite large although it&#39;s hard to say how high and how far away it was- I will guesstimate it at 4 to 10 miles away and at an altitude from 6 to 12 thousand feet. The object was a general triangle shape however the &#34;front&#34; seemed to stick out slightly in a semi-circle protuberance. The closest thing I can compare it to is a badminton birdie that has been flattened and then had its back flared end cut straight across to form 3 straight sides but with the rounded rubber end sticking out at the front somewhat. The object was travelling downward at about a 55 degree angle very smoothly at a fairly slow speed- it almost seemed to float or slide through the sky. The object made no noise and seemed to be made of white light or was luminescent. It&#39;s colour was very close to the bright moon&#39;s although it seemed to be less substantial- as if there was no actual physical{steel,aluminum...} structure to it. - The light reflects off of the moon so you can see it but this thing seemed to consist of light itself. It retained its clear shape for about seven seconds with no contrail and then over about the last 3 seconds it sort of slowly, uniformly shimmered and faded out of the absolutely clear sky- it just disapearred out of thin air and I was left there literally with my jaw hanging open. I was in awe of it and was excited,stunned,bewildered,delighted and in disbelief all at the same time. After about 30 seconds had gone by and I was pretty sure it wasn&#39;t going to reappear I ran inside to check the exact time and try to process what I had just witnessed. I can say that I am 100% convinced that it was some kind of craft utilizing technology far beyon! d what t he world&#39;s public is aware of.

It was very well formed and concise and looked like it was fresh.  It started about 30 degrees above the horizon and continued down to the horizon squiggling the whole way down.  I couldn&#39;t tell if the line was dropping in altitude or just going to the distant horizon.  This eratic contrail line disipatted after 20 minutes from my first viewing.  It looked like it may have been from some kind of rocket that had no (or little) guidance system - just so erating and many times finely looping on itself.  It also was 90 degrees to the norm of contrails that normally form this time of day as we have much commercial traffic heading west at this time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after first noticing the out of the ordinary contrail I saw what I thought appeared to be a comet moving not really fast to the east at about 90 degrees to the from the contrail.

The pattern was so wide and irregular it caught my eye.  I never saw the shape of the object, but I did see the shape of the light coming from it.  It had a brightly lit front nose that was followed by a conical white light body.  It disappeared and reappeared x 3, but the jet stream remained behind it. At one point it burst into bright fireball light and disappeared, but reappeared again.  I woke my husband and son to see it.  By the time my son woke up there was only the wide spiraling jet stream. Mu husband saw the light object.  It reminded me of a comet, but appeared to be traveling parallel to the earth&#39;s surface and not toward it. It did not appear to be getting closer to the ground when it disappeared.  It also reminded me of the space shuttle and one was launched Dec. 9. .  I also read that the military launched a new stealth jet yesterday.  Any of these may be possibilities, but it was certainly special to watch.  I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD))<n>

Trajectory almost precisely (apparently) east-west.  Similar in behavior and speed to commercial airliner, but with only one contrail while flying, but odd for its time of day, apparent altitude (seemingly lower than trans-atlantic jet airliner), and flight corridor - no airplanes have ever been seen flying at that altitude, and certainly no trans-atlantic commercial jets.  After returned (20 seconds away) from getting my camera, the contrails (which had been straight) were wavy due to wind (no doubt), but the odd thing is that the UFO was still shining bright - probably reflection of the sun - sun was rising, but hadn&#39;t yet risen, but was apparently stationary.  It faded over the next minute.  I have a couple of photos of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD))<n>

We were westbound going to meet freinds to go golfing. As we approached Reading,Pa. we noticed a vapor trail that appeared to be vertical to approx. 15,ooo ft than appeared to take a 90 degree turn to the west. The vapor trail was straight up and down but the horizontal vapor trail changed direction several times in an erractic succession. Upon meeting our freinds they were baffled as to what they saw. They asked us if we saw the vapor trail. They were much closer to it than we were, in fact they were transferring golf clubs into another car in a parking lot when they saw what they described as a small round object launch extremely fast , as a rocket would launch, vertically.It than seemed to drop back towards them at which time it again rose very rapidly and than turned on a dime toward the west and quickly disappeared to the west. They described it as a round metallic object that was very hard to see due to its extreme speed. What was apparent was its vapor trail off of both sides of it. They also said it was extremely silent. The desciption of their sighting was exactly what we saw from approx. 10 miles away. We were hoping that someone else also had this sighting, as it was very strange indeed.What bothers me is when something this apparent is not publicized ,it seems others must have seen it also. I have never seen anything like it nor would I ever imagine ever witnessing anything so surreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD))<n>

The large round lighted mist is gone and now, A starburst!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I had split up and were settling in for the moring deer hunt. He was probably a half mile from me and saw the entire happenings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had walked to my position where I was going to sit and wait for Whitetail deer (about 50 yards from a large wood line in a picked soybean field) I looked over at a beautiful red horizon where the sun was going to be rising soon, As I looked I saw what appeared to be jet contrails coming from almost directly from where the sun was about to rise. For a split second I didn&#39;t think a thing about it but just as quick I thought it was strangely low in the horizon to be contrails. Now the contrail seems to moving very fast and right at my frined and myself. Suddeny the contrails stopped and now I could see one very bright light. This light, now no longer producing contrails seemed to be at a very high rate of speed and was still heading right at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next thing that happend really shocked me. I continued to watch and suddenly the light stops. Not right over top of me but still out in front  of me and was now lower than at any other point. My guess would be 500 to 700 feet. Just as it stopped the single light seemed to begin growing. The light grew and it wasn&#39;t just light but a mist or fog seemd to growing within this ever expanding light. It still was not moving. In much less than 1 second, the misty light or large circle of light disappeared and once again it was just this single light hovering. Then in another split second the single light turned into a larger starburst light! Now the object is moving slowly to my left (North) But it may not have been moving directly left as it didn&#39;t get smaller in size or seem farther away as you would expect an oject to do as it moved along to my left. I thought it may have actually been moving to my left and slightly forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I conituned to watch it and just then my phone, which is set on vibrate, begins to do so. I answered it and it was my buddy asking me if I was watching this too. I said of course. As we were talking about the events we just saw the light seemed to be fading away. But not really fading as if it was moving away and becoming faint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the case at all. It was simply disappearing. It looked as if was slipping behind a curtain. It started to disappera on the Sunburst right side and continue to move towards that side until the whole thing was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone may think it was cloud it slipped behing. Nope....There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky on this beautiful Saturday morning. It was crystal clear with thousands of stars out. This thing just slipped away into thin air! My friend and I contued to discuss this for quite sometime before we started to think about actually hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always loved airplanes. I model them and go to airshows all over a three state area around Ohio. I am somewhat fimiliar with any aircraft, it&#39;s lighting and and it movement. This couldn&#39;t have been the movement of any aircraft I have ever seen. I think We certainly would&#39;ve heard some prop or jet sounds. Not close of course, as even airliners that are very high in the sky can be heard at 7:00 am in the middle of a large area where there is nothing but crops and woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.

We were all aware that they would have the video game system we all wanted for xmas so we had to be in line before the store opened or we would not get it.  I showed up at 2:00 am and others arrived after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:30 I happened to be looking south toward the city of Guelph.  I saw what I thought at first was someone setting off a firework or flare.  A reddish orange ball shot up from the ground leaving a smoke trail underneath it.  When it reached it&#39;s apex in the air, it moved slowly east and then west and back to the east in a circle.  There was also a smoke trail of a circle where this manoever had occured.  Then the object just blinked out and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if anyone else in line had seen this and they all said yes.  There was many comments on how it was really weird.  There was no clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind or anything and like I said it did not shoot off in any direction it just dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone mentioned that they wondered if it was some sort of a plane that was having a problem.  Someone else mentioned that they had heard there was solar flares occuring that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all this commotion was going on the object suddenly appeared again exactly at the point where it had dissapeared.  This time though it was no longer red and orange it was a silvery colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had 2 red lights and a white light visible on it. Then a bright white light shot out of it.  Not towards the ground but out horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was brighter than any lights I have ever seen it was like a huge floodlight of some sort.  The light shone out from a single point but created a wide triangular like arc in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realised that I had my cellphone on me and I could take a picture of this object.  I fumbled getting out my cellphone to take a picture.  The object had now been visible this second time for approximately 30 seconds.  I snapped a picture of it and as soon as I snapped the picture about 1 second later it dissapeared again.  It did not shoot off real fast or anything, again it just dissapeared.  It left no smoke trail or anything showing which direction it went.  But the original smoke trail it left when it raised from the ground originally stayed visible for approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had ever seen anything like this before and none of us could explain away what it really was.  I do know one other person in line personally but I do not know who the other people are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However when the store opened and we got our video game systems we all had to leave our name and phone number so Zellers does have a record of everyone who saw this event if you would like to research this further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know how to get this picture to you but if you are interested in seeing this picture I still have it in my cellphone and if I am contacted you can explain to me how I can get this photo to you.<n>

I was driving n look up n there was this lit object moving very fast in the most metaphysical ways.  Up down n back around.  It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side. I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only telephone number.

I know that every known aircraft over north america is to have anti-collision lights this had no such flashing strobes on, I pulled off in a frienzy and amazement bout 1 block from the Chevron stn. there. There were 2 men ready to tow a rig that had broken down. i went up to them saying &#34;tell me i am NOT seeing things.. I pointed one gentalman excaimed &#34;Good Jesus!&#34; the other either sceptical or not wanting to be called a nut said ahh thats a pasenger jet.. I pointed at a passing by to the left of the craft Southwest airliner going to Reno i said &#34;THAT is an airliner it has anti-collision lights, this does not!&#34; we just stared at it in aw.. all i can say is put your pointer middle and second to your pinky fingers out like your signaling a &#34;3&#34; hold them out and slowly rotate them immaging the tips of your fingers the orange lights rotating thats what this was doing. for about 3-4 mins then its lights went dim never saw it after that. I do believe it was military I know this because my job for a brief time was testing the new unmanned flying wing that landed on the USS John C. Stennis in 2003. This i wish to say for all you disbelievers.. Yes a pilot would become mush if it did the manuvers people claim they see in OUR dimention..

At that time the plane seemed to turn slightly south and proceeded in a ESE direction.<n>

The object was south of the circle, a few degrees above the horizon. I did lose sight of it a few times due to vacinity to trees (on the circle itself). I know it is difficult, even for proffesionals, to judge shape, distance, altitude, and speed of moving objects from the ground, but I will make my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft itself appeared to be the size of a commercial airline transport. It appeared to be low and slow, I would guess 2000&#39;MSL and under 100KTS. The craft originated from the south west travelling north east. When it was due south of the circle, it vectored to its right, now heading south east. It travelled in this direction until obscured from sight by buildings and other ground clutter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During its turn to the south east, the craft appeared to bank much the way a conventional aircraft would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I saw the craft from almost head on. It appeared to be a large aircraft with several landing lihghts (very bright, white lights, facing forward). During its turn and bank, I could see its underside. The ventral surface seemed to have a large white light at its tip, and two more aft of the nose. The second two were very far apart laterally, and appeared to be at the tail end of the craft, implying a delta or flying-wing shape. In the middle was another white light. There also appeared to be standard aviation anti-collision (strobe) lights about half way between the nose and tail, but no position (colored) lights, nor a red beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside, and the craft did not make any noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic. I would have suspected a jet powered aircraft in that proximity, but with exhaust facing away from me, to at least make the tell tale turbine &#34;whine&#34; A reciprocating engine aircraft of that size in that proximity would have made the ground shake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was an extremely long round shape, like a cigar. Wings straight out that looked too little for the long craft. Behind the first wings were some square shaped ones with the corners cut off.  There was a space between the first regular wings and these wings.  Then a regular tail, with center part straight up and the two parts on each side, not swept back or at an angle. As it got almost over me I noticed two smaller lights on both wings, they were not bright at all.  It was so round and long, that I thought if there were pilots in there, they would have to sit behind each other.  I did hear a sound, but don&#39;t know if it was a jet or props. No sonic boom. It looked to be a yucky green /gray color..Coming from Chicago area and traveling west.  I have looked at over 700 photos of airplanes on the internet and haven&#39;t found any that match this.  The closest to it is the U 2 spy plane.  But, it didn&#39;t have the bright light in the nose of the plane like this one.  Why would they need such a bright nose light. Also their wings were longer.  This happened right after they gave up loooking for the mountain climbers in Oregon, so I thought it was  a heat seeking plane? I saw no other lights. Since I can&#39;t find this plane: thought perhaps you could help me figure out what it is. Can&#39;t get it out of my mind. so wrapped up in looking at it, didn&#39;t think to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/15/06 15:00|East Providence|RI|Circle|3 or 4 mins|Round flying object travelling slowly with lights around the bottom|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55335.html|191|ndxe200612| Round flying object travelling slowly with lights around the bottom<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling by car down the Wampanoag Trail, East Providence, RI, towards Seekonk,  MA, and looked up and saw a round object with lights all around the bottom of it travelling slowing high in the air towards my direction in the distance.  I stared up at it and saw one person sitting in the front through what looked like a window area.  I saw a large steering wheel like that of what we have in a car or truck.  The person had both hands of the steering wheel of the circular craft.  It was travelling slowly above but towards my direction.  It had lights all around the bottom of it.  At first I thought it was a round, man made, blimp with lights around it, but was not sure.  I kept looking up at it as I drove forward down the Wampanoag Trail.  As it continued to head towards my direction, I began to get scared and my heart started beating very fast and I was about to make a decision as to whether I should turn my car around and head in the opposite direction away from it.  I stopped my car for a moment and looked around and I was the only one on both sides of the highway.  As I was about to turn my car around, I looked up again and the person operating the blimp or whatever it was, looked over the steering wheel and down at me and I think he realized I was afraid, so I saw him look over the steering wheel down at me and he then turned the steering wheel in front of him and the round floating objection turned around and headed slowly in the opposite direction towards Seekonk, MA.  I thought this was probably a blimp or a manmade craft with lights around the bottom of it. If this flew at night, someone might just see the lights around the bottom of it and think it was a UFO.  It might have been, but I thought it was a man made blimp like round object with lights around the bottom of it.  I did not report it to the police because it turned around and headed out of site over Seekonk, MA and I thought it might have been a round blimp with lights around the bottom of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the difference because my cousin and I saw a real UFO around 1968 while driving on the highway in Portmouth, RI which I have already reported at this site.  That one was nothing of this world, it was a bright luminous tilted circulor object hovering over the water.  It moved sideways over the water and was to the right over our car.  I looked up at it from my car window. It was tilted, luminous, sauser shaped and had a haze like ring around it and it was just moved sideways over the water and stopped up in the air to the right above our car.  I looked to the right through the car windwo up at it and saw it in close proxsimity and it was disc shaped, tilted luminous with a hazy ring around it like the planet Saturn.  It did not look like it was made of anything of this world.  It then suddenly shot in an instant across the hemosphere to the other side of the sky over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I wanted to report this because there may be some man made blimps or flying objects also shaped round with lights around the bottom of them and I did see this about 3 or 4 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

12/15/06 15:00|Littleton|CO|Oval|30 - 60 seconds|Black oval / disk shaped craft banks around low white puffy cloud.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56176.html|192|ndxe200612| Black oval / disk shaped craft banks around low white puffy cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was shaped like a football that was somewhat flattened with it&#39;s points cut off and black as the ace of spades.  You could even say it was capsule like shaped.  The crafts was approximately 3 to 3.5 miles to the north and about 1200 - 1500 ft in the sky.  The reason I know the distance is because it was fling directly over an area I bicycle frequently.  The point at which I sighted the craft was the enterance of our condominiums.  The reason I can approximate the height of the craft was because it approached a &#39;low&#39; white puffy cloud (east of the cloud) and banked around the puffy clound going from a southern direction (at me) to a west direction.  This cloud was only one of two clouds in the sky.  My back was to the south the craft was almost dead north to my vantage point which means the sun was hitting this craft  directly head on from my vantage point.  Their was a passanger jet aircraft further to the northwest of this craft. It was flying west.  I can even approximate it&#39;s distance because I know this area very well in miles.  The black oval / disk craft was traveling at a speed relevant to that of a piper cub would travel in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I was in a car with my fiancée and she likes to (shall I say) talk it up, when I saw this craft in motion.  We were heading south out of the complex she had to slow down for the speed bumps as you exit and wait for traffic at the street.  It gave me enough time to observe the craft before we truned and drove east, the craft already banked around the cloud at that time and was heading west.  I dare not interrupt my fiancée while she was talking besides she had to watch the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having a lifetime experience of observing aircraft at the same height and distance in the sky, as this was, I can say with certainty this craft was at the same length as a commercial / passanger jet.  Also, and this is very important, I saw this very same exact craft in a archived UFO photo with a Vietnam era fighter aircraft with it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, this is not my first sighting.  However, it &#39;is&#39; the most clear and closest sighting thus far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Mr. Davenport I heard you on the Jeff Rense program I hope these paragraphs are the way you wanted them.  I also, found your info on the frozen methane to be fasinating.  I will look further into that, thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

I saw what looked like a &#34;top&#34; and it was silver way up in the sky.  There were no contrails nor any noise. It looked like it was going vertical and I strained my eyes to get a better look at it.  I looked away for one second and when I looked back it blinked out. I did not see any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so fast that I thought I had imagined the whole thing but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I consider myself a naturalist, loving, and spiritual creature who doesn&#39;t dismiss something just because I&#39;m either unknowledgeable of the material or haven&#39;t witnessed it myself. (People love to tell you what you&#39;ve seen, which is wrong IMO)  At the time of the event it was around 9 o&#39;clock or so at night, and while I was driving down a road (like I normally did for work a million times before) and all of the sudden my car&#39;s headlights, interior lights, all lights blacked out for about 15 seconds. (it seemed longer/almost slow motion) I was scared, yet calm all at once.. like I knew I would be alright. I was app.: 3-4 months pregnant at the time it occurred, but everything was fine... (I had to catch my breath once my lights finally turned back on though)  I&#39;ve told this little story to my husband and he thinks maybe I was abducted and that they were interested in the pregnancy..?? I don&#39;t have the answers I&#39;m looking for still...  My beautiful girl is now about to turn 5, but I&#39;ve had a hard time baring anymore children.  I&#39;ve had 3 miscarriages since her, last time was twins... I just wonder...seems odd...???   Now, I know some may think it was just a technical glitch with my car, but to this very day I feel like they are communicating with my...  I see a flickering light outside of my window pretty frequently, and I have (for some reason) stronger than normal electrical currents/frequencies via my fingertips...  Also, I hear noised lasting about 5-8 seconds at a time (only occasionally) that sound like radio waves..  Similar to the sound a radio makes while searching for a station, but it&#39;s fuzzy... I heard it in both my ears (and I have great hearing) and their was NO radio on...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not to try to make myself feel unique, but I wonder if I&#39;m a star seed???!!!  I talk to them every time I see the flickering bright light outside my door...  It&#39;s NOT an airplane…  their is a HUGE difference!!  Hope I don&#39;t sound to freaky...

It is a bright center light, with colored, almost spider like lights coming from the center light.  Most of the time it was in the same position, but then turned and looked triangular, with lights on the side.  We observed it on both occasions for 30 minutes, but don&#39;t know how long it was there - we stopped watching after 30 minutes.  The first sighting, was accompanied by a craft which was very low flying with a red beam of light, sometimes pointed to the ground - NOT A PLANE.  We actually thought at first it was a helicopter with a light searching for someone / something, but it wasn&#39;t making any noise.  We couldn&#39;t believe it wasn&#39;t on the news.  I&#39;ve been looking to see if anyone else made a report.  I probably wouldn&#39;t have made a report myself, except this is the 2nd time we&#39;ve seen it, the first being about 11/24.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a landing light, which can cause the visual effects the witness describes.

We were just chatting when I noticed a star that was especially bright and seemed to almost bob up and down.  It was a little windy that night so I can see its movement.  It would move across the sky in strange patterns and sometimes would just stop and observe.  I felt watched.  Deeply.  My friend started to cry and after the event neither of us could describe it without getting tongue tied.  I still remember it.  It was so bright and looked like a big metal ball.  It almost seemed to have a character about it.  As if itself were a being.  It was the most mind altering experience and really brought out the truth in me...

It looked like they were just hovering there for a few seconds. Then one or two would go out, then 3 more, and then finally they were all gone. At first we thought it was a bridge at our school, lit up with Christmas decorations fof the Holiday... so we went out to look at the bridge, and the shape of the ropes that any lights could be on is like ^, whereas what we saw was more a V. And the size of the lights, and the amount of light they emitted, were larger than any Christmas bulb decoration.

12/14/06 09:30|Summit|IL|Circle|7 seconds|Midway airport area, sphere or disc hovering and then accelerating rapidly|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54400.html|208|ndxe200612| Midway airport area, sphere or disc hovering and then accelerating rapidly<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 9:30 a.m., I was driving northbound (inbound to Chicago) on Hwy 55, The Stevenson Expressway, approaching the Harlem Ave exit ramp.  In the sky, perhaps at a 45 degree angle or so from me and apparently at least 1000 feet up or so, I noticed an object.  I would estimate it&#39;s location as being directly above the area of 54th Street and Oak Park Avenue, possibly somewhat farther east-southeast.  I noted that it was black and round, not much larger than a BB at arm’s length.  My first thought was that I was looking at a bird or an airplane end-on, but it quickly became obvious that it was neither.  There was a solid gray cloud cover, the shape of the object was starkly visible, and wings if they existed would be clearly seen.  No plane would be ascending towards or descending away from nearby Midway Airport (about two miles east-southesast of there)so steeply at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now I had viewed the object hovering in the sky for about five seconds.  Suddenly it bolted, at a bit of an angle right-to-left, headed roughly eastbound and upward, toward the clouds.  The black circle rapidly shrank into a pinpoint dot and disappeared into the clouds, clearly moving upward and away very fast.  It took less than two seconds for it to accelerate out of sight.  I did not see a hole in the clouds where it entered the solid cloud ceiling.  My impression was that it was disc-shaped because of the flat appearance of the black (no shading at the edges like you&#39;d see with a sphere).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason I saw this object is that I had a shocking daylight sighting of a large craft back on November 9, and since then I’ve been scanning the skies every chance I get, hoping to see another UFO, which amazingly enough I did.  These two sightings were very different, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truthfully, I’ve been reluctant to post this sighting, as I’ve been discouraged since my previous experience.  Since I was alone at the time, and I&#39;m not a pilot or a police officer, it seems that I might not be qualified enough to report that a gigantic, very clearly defined black rectangle which I observed at length, slowly flying in high-visibility conditions before it camouflaged itself, is not a “weather phenomenon” or some other nonsense like that.  Even though I’m in my 40s, a stable family man with a science degree, that’s lived in the Chicago area with it&#39;s teeming air traffic basically my whole life, to boot.  Worse still, you feel you can’t discuss it with anybody, because even your closest friends or family members will think you’re a nut case or want to come up with some ridiculous debunking.  If I had gotten photographs, those either wouldn’t have been good enough, or they would have been too good, i.e. fake.  So the whole process of seeing and reporting a sighting is really very frustrating, even though I’m joined by tens of thousands of other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weatherman said the Geminid meteor shower was occuring that night, recommending the best time to view the event was before midnight.  I went outside and looked up towards the E/SE sky.  It was a clear, crisp night, allowing the constellation Orion to easily catch my eye off to the right of my peripheral vision.  After only a few moments of star gazing in that same direction, 5-6 reddish-orange/burnt orange lights appeared out of nowhere just above the few tall pine trees that border that side of the property.  These lights shined as if they were large, bright stars, and appeared in a straight line with equal distances between each (&#34;• • • • •&#34;).  I believe these lights to have been the tail side of the object, possibly part of a propulsion system. It sat in a completely still hover for only a couple of seconds and then quickly accelerated without a sound toward the E/SE, tilting as it appeared to turn slightly more south and gain in altitude till out of sight.  It was quite an experience and I began questioning whether or not I had just seen what I thought I&#39;d seen.  In the next ten minutes or so, I also got to enjoy more than a dozen meteors as well.  I did a quick glance on nuforc.org and found the following entry that is very similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 12/2/2006 18:20 (Entered as : 12/2/06 18:20) 	Reported: 12/2/2006 7:38:20 PM 19:38 	Posted: 12/7/2006 	Location: West Dundee, IL 	Shape: Formation 	Duration:30-40 seconds 	String of 6-7 lights equally spaced apart, about 1000 ft up 	  moving quietly West to East in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking in my back yard, letting my dog out and getting 	  some firewood. I looked up to see how the stars looked on this 	cool  crisp night when I noticed what appeared to be a flock of 	&#34;lit&#34;  birds...but turned out to be a string of lights, 	approximately  1/3 high up in the sky.

I started to get freaked out after about 15 minutes and went the window.  I saw an aircraft of some kind flying VERY low--in contrast to commercial jets in the sky, which from a ground view have tiny blinking lights, the proximity to this aircraft was such that the lights appeared to be the size of grapefruits.   I couldn&#39;t see the exact shape, only that three lights (white-red-white) were kind of lined up in a straight line, and they cast a glow on a kind of underbelly shape I could only glimpse.  My thought was that the shape of the thing was almost rectangular, or a straight line, with a very slightly convex underside. The lights were strong enough that I thought, &#39;they can see me!&#39; through my window, though who knows, and I went away from the window and the aircraft nosies lasted about another half hour.  It sounded to me like there were more than one thing zooming around and around.  I don&#39;t have a whole lot of experience with stuff like this, and there is probably another kind of explanation; I&#39;m only reporting it because I found it very mysterious and thought it might make sense to someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I turned around and we watched a dark amber colored object fly about 4 miles in 15-20 seconds.  The object was about 1,000 ft. above the ground and approximately .5 to 1 mile west of us.  You could make out that there was a craft there, but we were too far to see any kind of shape.  The object never made a sound and got about 3 miles south of us, appeared to make a left turn and instantly dissapeared.

A second later an additional light appeared and moved down and to the right making a distinct triangular shape. There was still no apparent movement of the objects through the sky. (by this time I had slowed my vehicle into the median to watch) After sitting in the sky for about 5 seconds in this formation, all three lights faded out together just like a light bulb being turned off.

On Wed. Dec 13 2006 at exactly 19:35 Eastern, I was driving South on I-65 at mile-marker 71 near Columbus, IN. to the West/South-West at approximate 30 degree angle from ground and at what I estimate to be 5 to 7 miles out, I witnessed an object in the night sky. The sky was dark with a slight backlit auburn haze and distant low cloud blanket and even further out clear sky. The Object was diamond shaped with 8 light formations on what I beleive to be the belly of Craft.The Craft was a vague silloette to my eyes. The Ligh Formations on the Craft were a yellowish-white color and 8 in numbr. each of the eight light formations were composed of two rectangular segments of equal size forming a 45 degree angle pointing towards apparent front of craft. (examp. &gt;). The 8 formations of lights were arranged in perfect geometry to the shape of the Craft. example:      ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ The individual light formations seemed to intensify while object was stationary and as light intensified, The Object began to move upwards at a 45 degree angle to the Left of It&#39;s position. The Object suddenly faded from sight as it accelerated.The Object appeared to be the size of, or larger than; a Lockheed C-5A transport plane.In my estimation, the lights did not appear to be flaming or fuel burning outlets or exhaust ports however, My gut feeling was that they had some sort of propulsion function. The Object never reappeared to my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the other part of this event was; at the moment I assumed the object had &#34;disappeared&#34;:I witnessed directly South and Approx. 30 to 35 thousand feet up at a distance from Me of est. 5-8 miles out, Two Fighter Planes rapidly pursuing a path towards the tradjectory of the craft&#39;s distant path. My reasoning that the 2 aircraft &#34;in pursuit&#34; were Fighter Jets was 1.) their speed and altitude 2.) the marker beacons on each aircraft.(one strobing white and blue marker light on each jet.) Looking at a Road Atlas later on, I noted an Airport exactly West of my position at 20 miles.(Bloomington, IN). I also know of Louisville,KY&#39;s airport/A.N.G. base to South.  I have lived near Air Force Bases and am certain that no aircraft built in U.S. have been made public knowledge, of this nature.I can accept that this craft could be Man-made or of Extraterrestrial nature. I also theorize that It could be visable by some while not visable to other Humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. I had an identicle sighting to the detail in the Mojave Dessert approx. 2 years ago.(Did not report It,then.)<n>

I went out on our back deck facing west.  It was dark outside and I observed a stationary 4 window bright luminous light barely above the tree line over the woods behind our house.  It was fairly close to our house and silent.  I&#39;m not sure how far away it was because I&#39;m not sure how big it was in perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately ran up stairs where my wife was to have her see it out of the upstairs window but the lights were gone.  While looking out of our upstairs window, we were shocked at what we were seeing.  We cranked open our casement window and observed 15 or more luminous craft moving in every direction a distance away.  Some even flew high over our house then disappeared.  The sky was very clear out back of our house.  The craft were silent until one would completely stop high in the air and then it would start to glow with what looked like fire and it growed in size and roared like the sound of a very loud jet engine. It would take about 3 seconds for the sound to reach us.  While the craft was stationary and glowing with fire, a luminous &#34;pod&#34; dropped off out the left side toward the ground.  We witnessed this exact thing 4 times during the 20 minutes or so that we watched them.  I estimated them to be about 2 miles away.  I called our local police department twice to report this event but I think they thought I was nuts.  I am a business person in our city and afterwards I wished I hadn&#39;t called them. They said they would send a cruiser out that way.  To summerize what I said in the beginning of this report is I believe the very loud stationary jet roar above my house was one of those craft that became stationary with stabilizing rocket engines and dropped the luminous 4 window &#34;pod&#34; out back of my house that started the whole incident of us witnessing all of this.  After 20 minutes or so, the dark sky became empty of craft and all was quiet.  We are both still nervous over what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a sort of dull sheen to it.  It resembled a small airliner, in fact at first I thought that&#39;s what it was.  It caught my attention as I drove up a small hill, it was far too low in the sky and travelling very slowly, almost hovering above an urban space.  I feared it would crash.  The craft is a stream-lined oval shape from the side viewed it from. The front was pointed, not a sharp point, but slightly rounded.(I assume it was the front from the direction it was traveling). I don&#39;t esactly recall what the back looked like, although I think it was similar to the front - there was no tail.  The wings were not the usual shape of a plane, they were a sort of semi-circular shape, they were short and wide and close to the craft. There was no other colour or letters on the craft, no windows, no lights and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to keep it in my vision, but couldn&#39;t contstantly watch the sky as I was driving, the craft was moving (though very slowly) and my view quickly became obstructed by trees.  I feared when I reached the corner at the top of the hill (about 1/2 a block)it would have crashed, as no plane could fly so low or slowly and stay in the sky.  However when I got to the corner it was gone and there was no crash.  This all happened within seconds and it took a few seconds to realize that this was not a usual aircraft.  I was quite shaken by the experience and kept watching the sky, wanting to see it again - to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local air control center and was told there was no aircraft in the area at the time I saw the craft other than a small plane doing flying practice and a helicopter - both were several miles away from the location I saw the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My boss and three other employees get a ride to and from work by our boss. Apx 10miles out of town, Mark (an employee) notice&#39;s a light in the western sky. As our boss Larry pulled over on the side of the road. Us four got out of the truck and observed a flashing blue and purple light in the sky. It was flashing in the pattern of  blue purple purple blue purple purple blue etc. Larry stated that he thought it was a satelite. Which i thought it was aswell, until about 10 mins went by, the &#34;light&#34; changed from purple and blue to a redish maroon color and than the object (light) started to move to the east at a decent speed, than the object stoped flashing and we couldnt see the light anymore..than about 2 mins. later we located it in the southern part of the sky and this time it was moving in an awkward curving motion. than the object vanished. I believe this object was possibly a star because i do not believe in &#34;ufo&#39;s&#34; lol but just thought i would inform what i have seen. Have a great day!

I was standing at my back door having a bit of fresh air five hours later and saw something similar five hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright white, round with a long green tail and shot from north to south, it wasn&#39;t a meteor as they don&#39;t have a slight wobble as they move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since saw it again two weeks back on th 20th of January. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve saw something strange as in 2005 me and a friend saw a cigar shaped cloud with what looked like flashing lights inside drift past us in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been interested in this subject and think if more people were a bit more observant they also might see these craft. Scotland on a whole is a hot spot for UFO activity and I hope this is a start of a flap here in Coatbridge.<n>

(apox 7 minutes) stoped aprox 20 times (or more)to use that blue light. it was about the size of my thumb nail with my arm fully extended, was maby 3 miles or less from me in the southern sky aprox 1000 feet alt. no sound that i could hear. always seemsd to stop every mile, (guessing at the distance traveled) and back up and the blue light under it came on. the light goes off at the spot it first stops ,then backs up and again the light comes on.  all quick stops and movement no slowing down or changes in speed.had a small orange light on the front and a bluegreen light on the back , If it was not disk shape. to dark to tell.was traveling at about the same speed a passanger plane travels coming in for a landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 9:30pm at night and Clairemont dr was pretty quite. I think I was the only person on the road at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came around a bend in the road I saw a gold bright light... I did a double take cause I thought it was the police helicopter that normally is flying around my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldnt make out what the object was. I noticed no other lights and the police helicopter has two lights... red and green and I didnt see those. When I first saw the object I was looking about 200 yards to my right out of my trucks winshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as I got closer and realized that the object was not a helicopter I then thought it was an airplane but the sky was over cast and it would have been impossible to be an airplane flying that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to feel very nervous cause I couldnt make it out. All this happened so fast that I was unable to figure out what to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued driving and I kept glancing up at the object. It didnt move an inch. When I came right up on it I noticed it was about 3 telephone poles in height in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasnt very big, but it was bright like a like was hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it as a drove by it. I slowed down and was trying to look at it out the back of my truck window but the furniture was in the way. I got a little further down the road and could see the spot where I saw the light over the furniture in the back of my truck and I didnt see it anymore. It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go ahead and continue to dump off the furinture and when I came back Clairemont drive I decided to go driving around the back streets where I saw the object and I came to the cayon rim and I noticed something flying around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought for sure this time I was looking at a helicopter flying around La Jolla mountain. I was facing north at a dead end of a back street. I then noticed the supposed helicopter was making very sharp turns and speeding up and slowing down real swiftly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I wasnt looking at a helipcopter. It was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of this object and so I got back on Clairemont dr and continued toward my house heading north. I spotted the object again. I watched move around the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was covering a distance of 2-3miles in seconds as it went around in no given pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying low to the ground beneath the cloud cover. When I got close to home I made a left turn and I lost sight of the object for good. I told my wife when I got home. I went out side and smoked a few times throughout the night but I didnt see the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing her to the south while she was sitting on a sofa in front of a big window in our living room. The curtains for the big bay window were pulled (as we normally do in during the winter months). Then, I suddenly saw what looked like a white/greenish streaking of light that quickly from the sky to the horizon and out of sight. The light moved from the southeast to the southwest. There is an airport near that part of Iowa City, but I have *never* in the past 5 years living in our house witnessed that bright of white/greenish light moving so quickly and then suddenly vanishing at the horizon. Furthermore, I have never seen anything so bright through our dark red curtains. Finally, I did not hear any kind of noise coming from the lights as when it finally disappeared on the horizon I immediately went to the window, pulled back the curtain, and listened for any aircraft noise (i.e., thinking it might have been an airplane landing at the airport). However, I did not hear a sound of something that large landing--it was silent. The event was a bit frightening and I haven&#39;t reported this to anyone until now. I can&#39;t remember the exact date, but hopefully someone else saw the same thing and will see this description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were no lights and it made no sound.  It flew from the northeast to the southwest in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rather large and it didn&#39;t look like it was very high, I guess that it had to be about a couple thousand feet in the air.  I watched it fly in my direction and I pulled over to see what it was. I watch from the cab of my truck and when it flew overhead, I got out and watch it fly to the southwest.  It was really low and quite.  There were no lights, just a black triangle in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been driving trucks for over nine years and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. I didn&#39;t notice anything about onboard electronics, everything worked fine. The object seemed like it didn&#39;t interfer with my truck.<n>

These  lights were arranged in a triangle shape. 2 of the lights were white or possible a pale yellow in color then one bottom light was red. Gentry is a very rural area, with no traffic or other light disturbances.. I went outside and the lights zipped across the sky, from left to right, almost like a shooting star sideways with NO SOUND! Then it paused on the right side of the sky, then immediately zipped back across the sky to the right. This time the red light was on the top not the bottom. It was so dark that I could barely see the actual craft, so I am going by the shape and light pattern as to the EXACT shape. It was matte black, not shiny. This was NOT a typical airplane. It was so fast zipping across the sky and NOT a sound... Made a sideways &#34;N&#34; zig zag pattern, then disappeared completely into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was travelling south on Route 50 towards Bridgeville, heading home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just about a 1/8 to a quarter of a mile up from where I turned onto Route 50 from the road that goes to Walmart&#39;s parking lot, I saw bright lights coming at a high rate of speed directly towards the road I was on and in my direction... (ie- the lights were coming straight to me and the few other surrounding vehicles driving around me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first sighting, it was about a mile or two away in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself that it was an awfully bright light for a plane, and I started looking for the FAA lights.  I didn&#39;t see any FAA lights on the plane.  I then thought to myself to grab my camera phone and try to snap a shot of what I was seeing.  I came up to the light on route 50 at Thoms Run Road.  It was a red light about to turn green.  This is not more than a 1/8 of a mile from when I made first sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, the lighted craft was in plain sight, about hundred feet in front of me, and maybe and about three hundred feet to my right.  I&#39;m not sure how high up in the sky it was, as it was moving very quickly, and I&#39;m not very good at determining how high in the sky stuff is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the craft appeared to be somewhat circular in shape- the front of it facing me looked like a half circle or bananna kind of shape parallel to the horizon), and appeared to have lights surrounding the part of the craft facing me, but not on it&#39;s rear.  These lights, about 7 or 8 ( a guestimation), all seemed to blend into one horizontal light around the front of the craft...and much brighter than any aircraft I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traffic then started moving again, and cars were going very slow, curious about what the object was.  I snapped a picture of it at this point, and as it saved, the craft came very close to my car, directly above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the craft appeared to be triangular in shape, with a very bright light eminating from the center of it.  Then the craft moved in a circle from where it was, went behind my car, and came back around.  I snapped another picture of it when it came back around, moving in  what appeared to be a complete circle...and then it flew out of my sight in a north/north eastern direction- moving very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got two pictures on my camera cell phone, both show the date and time to be the same.  That should tell you how quickly this was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it, I did notice another airplane as I drove further down route 50, and it was much higher in the sky than the one I could not identify, and I could clearly make out the FAA lights.  It is typical to see low flying planes here in Bridgeville, as we are close to the Pittsburgh Airport (about ten to fifteen miles away).  The craft I could not identify was much lower than anything I have seen here before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I decided to take a better look at the pictures with my roommate.  He is a paranormal investigator, and can, most often, disprove a lot of things that people can&#39;t indentify.  After zooming in on the images, neither of us could identify what this object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My professional background is mostly in mental health, as a program director.  My personal background- I have an interest in the paranormal, and volunteer heavily for a paranormal research and investigation group.<n>

The last time I saw something flying almost as fast was a Harrier Jet (their base was not far away from my brothers house and it was nothing out of the ordinary for him) flying at night above a small village. The sighting of whatever I saw happened when I was coming home from dancing lessons I had just turned off the Birmingham Road and was traveling at about twenty miles per hour up a very steep hill( Do not know the name of the road but can find out) the weather conditions were cold with a completly clear sky with no moon. I do not know the direction it was going but it appeared in my sight line at about 1 o&#39;clock and disappeared at about 10 o&#39;clock, or right to left. (it is hard to tell the hieght but it was low). The size was about three times biger than the stars in the plow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, a star-like light zipped by VERY fast, silently, no red or green blinking lights.  The object moved horizontally from south to northeast. I estimate it was about 1 mile as the crow flies, from where I was standing. It was high enough that I could see it above the rooftops and tall trees up the hill from where I live, but about as low as a small plane might fly. I have had multiple sightings in this area since I moved here 4 yrs. ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I&#39;d say it was about the same altitude as a small plane would be, lower than the jets from Miramar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When I reached our house, I got my step-dad&#39;s binaculars to get a closer look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got it in focus, I could see blue lights on top, red on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that moved in alternating patterns. The object stayed stationary for half an hour after I noticed it. The lights shut off and I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not five minutes later, I saw another bright light to the right (south) of the first location. It was the exact same as the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put down the binaculars and called the sheriffs office.  When I looked at it again, it had changed into three red lights in a triangular shape. The bottom right light shut off, and the bottom left light moved in a horseshoe pattern to join with the top light.  This happened for a half an hour also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this one dissapeared, there was another farther off in the distance to the left (north) of the first location. I couldn&#39;t see this one as well. I checked to see if it was there every five minutes or so, and after another half an hour, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 12-7-06 I was driving home from work again at 22:30, when I saw a bright white light come from the south towards the road I was on.  It was the fastest thing I have ever seen.  It stopped right before the road for half a second, and flew off at a 90 degree angle from where it came.  It moved so fast that it just vanished over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two seconds later, it came back over the horizon towards our home. It slowed down and descended to the ground. When it was no more than fifty feet off the ground, the light shut off. This was less than half a mile from my bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main part of my story is what has been happening to our community. The people that live around our farm have cows. When the owners of the cows go to check on them, they sometimes find one mutilated.  Half of their skin is torn off their face, no blood in their bodies, and missing organs. This happend on my grandpa and grandmas property, just two miles from our house, at the end of October<n>

Through most of the trip we are talking about UFO&#39;s and supernatural programs on the History Channel.  I can admit that I was looking everywhere to see if I saw something unusual in the skies since I know Arizona has a high volume of sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the sudden we see an old airplane maneuvering north of us near Yuma,AZ.  It doesn&#39;t look military; it just looks like someone is playing around.  All of the sudden I look further behind the airplane and I notice something just sitting there in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty far away and we could not tell what it was.  The objects were in a disk shape and white metallic color.  The object was pretty bright for a clear sunny day.  We pulled over to see if I can take good pictures of it.  My co-worker mentions of rotation on the object, but I could not see it.  The object stayed in the same spot for quite a long time and barely moved.  It looked like it would grow slightly in size and go back to the original size.  We could even see the object entering Yuma.  That same night there was a high activity of black helicopters near the MX and AZ border.  I do not know if it was the Border Patrols or the black helicopters that I&#39;ve heard try to chase UFO&#39;s.  This event happened on December 11, 2006 and pictures will be e-mailed.  I also noticed that some of my pictures are similar to the pictures that a person from Argentina submitted on the 25th of December in mufon.com main page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (ANOTHER sighting that happened in October 20006.  Unfortunately no pictures were taken.  SEE BELOW.)  I was flying from Dallas to California on a business trip.  Something up to the date of this event told me to have my camera in hand during the flight which I unfortunately didn&#39;t.  We are over 30,000 probably over New Mexico or Arizona, not sure.  Clear bright day.  All of the sudden I see that a big red round object is floating in the air about 2:00 and about 500 feet down in relation of the airplane.  My first instinct was that this object was not suppose to be there.  It looked like a giant bowie (sp).  As we are flying by it I noticed that on the other side there was this metallic object attached to the object.  I looked around the airplane to see if anyone hesitated, but no one seemed to see it except me.  I researched weather balloons and this thing was at least 10x bigger than the weather balloon pictures that I googled.  Also, in my opinion, a balloon will probably not be floating over 30,000 in the skies.  I&#39;m still kicking myself today because I did not have a camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was so loud that I had to use my hands and cover my ears.  I could see a woman running in the distance, so I approached her and asked, “what is that sound?”  She said “What sound?” and when she said that, I saw a bright flash go across the sky and the sound stopped.  I said “never mind”.  It was incredibly weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first, I thought what I was seeing was a star or planet,  but then it started getting closer.  I pointed out the light to my husband. The light seemed to parallel the highway traveling basically southeast.  Since I was seated by a window, I had a brief view as it passed by.  It was a  black chevron with at least 5 amber lights. I have no idea of how to judge the altitude, but it looked to be a large craft.  As far as I know, I am the only passenger to see the chevron, but my husband witnessed the light as it was approaching.  My background is education.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my seat by the window, I could see the object; it was a black (or dark colored) chevron with at least 5 large amber-colored lights on the underside. The object looked to be rather large. With no lights on its wings like the conventional aircraft, I thought perhaps it was a military craft.  As far as my background, I work at a public school.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

WNW at approximately 80 degrees elevation, I saw a slow moving light (or sunlight reflection).  With 7x50 binocs, you could see two yellow disks tangent to each other. A silver white probe extended out from the lead disk in the direction of motion (toward the NE). The probe like extension was about the length of the two disks diameters. There was also another shorter extension parallel to the silver white one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes until they were hidden by cirrus clouds in the NE. During the sighting, a commercial jet airliner flew over from East to West. The UFO appeared to be much higher than the jet. Because the UFO was above the cirrus cloud when it “disappeared”, and because of the resolution in the binocs, it’s my opinion this was a huge object or objects at very high altitude (60,000 to 70,000 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that the two disks could have been spheres, but they looked like disks to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was larger than a commercial airliner, and through binoculars it appeared to be a long, oval shape.  The light emitting from it was extremely bright, yellowish white, no other colors observed.  It was stationery, maybe 3 miles up. It appeared to be between 5 and 10 miles distance from my location in Pittstown, NJ.  It remained there for approximately 10 minutes.  I stopped viewing for about 2 minutes.  When I returned, I thought it was gone, but it had changed position dramatically.  It was now about 200 to 300 feet above the distant tree line, and was more to the north east.  I continued to observe for perhaps 15 minutes then, the object began a slow descent, and began traveling in a northwesterly direction.  It was still about 200 feet up, was following the tree line, and the brightness of the light had dimmed. I continued to observe until it was no longer visible.  This object, in my opinion, was not an airplane or helicopter because of the size, shape and dazzling brightness, nor was it a celestial body because of it’s changing and deliberate course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source of the report intended to indicate a date in 2006.

It was between 2:45am and 3:00am.  I was outside because it was said that Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter were going to be so close together that the naked eye could see it.  So after searching the sky, I looked straight up and saw a falling star.  No more than 5 seconds later, an object moved across the sky, then dissapered.  It then immediately reappeared and disssapeared again.  The oject appeared pretty big, but made no noise.  I knew it was not a plane because a plane being that close would make alot of noise, but the object was quiet.  It was shaped like a triangle, but with one side carved in.  It was almost shaped like a stealth plane except this object had light around the edges of its sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped the car and viewed it.  No sound was heard. At 10:50PM it is still present in the same location.  This is the second time I have witnessed a triangular vehicle hovering over the Quad Cities region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two summers ago, at 3:00 AM I witnessed the same shape hovering north of my home over interstate 74 directly over Bettendorf.  This vehicle was much closer to the ground and easily defined as a black triangular object with multiple colored lights and much closer to the ground.  There was no sound. I would guess the size to be about that of a football field.  It is difficult for me to estimate the distance from the ground. I would not say it was fearfully close but close enough that one could distinguish the colors of its lights which were multi colored and discern the triangular shape of the object supporting the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regard to what we are witnessing this evening, given the distance of the sighting I have to state that this object has to be significantly larger than the one viewed two years ago. IF that is possible! It is presently far enough away and high enough in the sky that one cannot determine what supports the lights. The shape is defined by the pattern of the lights only and no difference in color of the lights is able to be distinguished. All lights appear white to my grandson and greenish white to my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:30 PM the object is still in the sky but has changed location moving North West. I would estimate its distance is approximately seven to ten miles south of my home and the height in the sky has to be considerably higher than the sighting two years ago because it is easily seen above heavy timbered hills in front of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did take a video but the image recorded on tape does not represent what both of us view with our eyes which is a triangle.  On the video perhaps due to hand shake (VERY cold here) it appears as a bright white ball that moves and changes shape.  I shot it between the branches of trees in front of my home this is not the first location that we noticed it from however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There will be two sections of video the first is 9:45 then a break in recording followed by the fatal attempt to zoom in on it with night shot. I was freezing cold and the hand shake makes it appear like a white ball bouncing around the screen. I did zoom back and shot through the same trees as the first video so you could see the movement relationship to its location between 9:45 and 11:30. Unfortunately the video does not reflect what we see viewing this object. It is definitely a clearly defined triangle when viewed by the human eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you want to see the video I will be happy to mail it to you for what it is worth. Perhaps you may find some value in it. I am disappointed as it does not clearly reference the shape we both concede is a triangle.<n>

Within seconds a white &#34;shooting&#34; star?? came from the area the red light had been and disappeared from my view (lower than tree level). We have some red towers in Wewa but this was much higher and larger than the towers. I called Tyndall AFB in Panama City to see if they had any planes up in case one had a problem and spoke with 2 different people. The first one wanted to know if it was &#34;santa claus&#34;, and the second one did not show much more interest other than say they did not have any planes up. I am guessing they did not take me seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When they landed, to inspect the formation, they could not detect it from ground level.  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 09, 2006 &#34;  the answer is that rings in dry lake beds , of this type , are commonly found all around the western USA.  they are used / were used during WWII and the Korean and are still used in places as bombing range target markers, for pilots to practice with, to drop bombs.  dozens of places like this exist , the ones that are hard to see ( like these ) are older ones that haven&#39;t been used in a long time ( see B on the map I included ).   look at the acme map I provided , at locations B , C, and D for other examples of these types of circles.  these particular circles are found on Nellis Ranges in Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Http://www.acme.com/mapper/?ll=37.48759,-116.22823&amp;z=15&amp;t=S&amp;marker0=37.64472%2C-115.74278%2Crachel%20nv&amp;marker1=37.49876%2C-116.39225%2C27.1%20km%20NW%20of%20Belted%20Range%20NV&amp;marker2=37.51269%2C-116.24295%2C19.5%20km%20NxNW%20of%20Belted%20Range%20NV&amp;marker3=37.48759%2C-116.22823%2C16.4%20km%20NxNW%20of%20Belted%20Range%20NV<n> <n><n> <n><n> hough they look unusual, the rings are a common sight to experienced desert rats.<n>

It was triangular shaped, the corners were rounded, and there was a tiny red search light in the middle of the bottom of the craft.

While investigating an outage, ( unrelated to UFO activity), I observed an orange light in the sky to the northwest of me. There was no flashing light on it, as all aircraft are supposed to use at night. I was in my truck,and got my 10X binoculars for a better look.The object had a dull, orange light on the bottom of the &#34;front&#34;, and 3 brightly lit &#34;windows&#34; toward me. The brightness of the lights made it impossible to see a sharp outline. Object was moving slower than a light plane would fly. It was very clear weather, with temperatures in the mid-teens. I left my truck&#39;s engine running, so I heard no sound. Object went behind a hill and I did not see it again. After I got home, I looked the area up on a large-scale map, and found that the object was at least 3 1/2 miles from me. I feel that it was at least as big as an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were traveling north on route 95, we were driving about 60 mph and I observed a stationary light on the west side of the highway, about the height of one of the large powerline towers.   I thought to myself a powerline must cross the road there, and it was lighted for aircraft.  We were talking and driving, and as I approached where the light was (I could not see it without leaning foward and looking up) I noticed there was not a electical powerline tower there.  It was odd, and I leaned foward and looked up (as did my wife). We both observed a cylinder shaped object, about as long as a city bus suspended in air.  There was a window across the cylinder, and the window appeared to be at a 45 degree angle downward facing towards us.  There appeared to be a panel of somekind the entire length of the window.  There were figures seated at the panel across the length of the object, and what app! eared to be several figures standing behind them.  My wife and I both got the feeling the figures inside the objects were looking at us.  The interior of the object was illumintated, and we could see clearly inside.  As we passed, we were both surprised because the object appeared to be suspended in air.  I asked her if she wanted to turn around and go back, and she said yes.  I found a place to complete a U turn, and as we approached the object from the north a hundred yards away, it &#34;streaked off&#34; in a southeastern diretion towards Las Vegas, on an horizontal plane.  It rose abrubtly over a mountain, and then downward over the top...and disappeared.  From the time it started south, to when it disappeared was within a couple of seconds.  There was no noise as we passed by it, or as it left the area.<n>

Decided to report when I saw the recent updates from Ottawa, IL and Pittsburg &amp; St. Ann, MO from the same day/time describing this event.  To give some perspective of the size/intensity, the witness in Pittsburg, MO would have been approx. 90 miles SSW of my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

12/7/06 22:30|Conrad|MT|||Strange Incident Near Conrad ICBM  Most Recent Sighting, One of Many at Nuclear Bases  BY ROBERT HASTINGS|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87775.html|299|ndxe200612| ((NUFORC Note:  We extend our gratitude to Robert Hastings, a celebrated author in the field of ufology and nuclear facilities, for sharing this story.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange Incident Near Conrad ICBM  Most Recent Sighting,  One of Many at Nuclear Bases  BY ROBERT HASTINGS<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I lecture on UFOs, I am often asked, &#34;When and where was the most recent UFO sighting at a nuclear weapons site?&#34;  Given that these incidents are ongoing, it&#39;s entirely possible that such a sighting occurred at one missile facility or another very recently, perhaps even last night.  However, as far as I know, the last reported incidents apparently took place near Conrad, Montana, in December 2006.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 12th, an indivi-dual, not identified, posted an intriguing sighting report on the National UFO Reporting Center website.  It seems that the previous night, while driving home, the anonymous source had sighted a UFO just east of Conrad, Montana.  Moreover, according to the post, he also had another sighting, four days earlier, at almost the same location.  Although there was no mention of nuclear missiles in this report, I knew that the town of Conrad is literally surrounded by Minuteman missile sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a hunch, I contacted NUFORC&#39;s director, Peter Davenport, and requested the source&#39;s name and contact information.  Davenport then contacted Ryan Riewer, now a student at the University of Montana, who readily agreed to speak with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a telephone interview, Riewer told me,  &#34;I live on a farm nearly three miles east of Conrad.  On December 7, 2006, I was driving home from work at around 10:30 at night. I was on Sollid Road, probably a mile away from our house, when I saw this light out of the corner of my eye, coming from the southwest. It was the fastest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It came racing up almost to the road. It stopped dead for a moment, then took off at a 90-degree angle to where it came from. It went southeast, over a hill on the horizon. A couple of seconds later, it came racing back toward me. Then it began to slow down and descended toward the ground at an angle. When it was about fifty feet up, the light shut off. It looked like it landed about a half-mile, or maybe a mile, from our house. That was really, really weird.”  I asked Riewer if there was a missile site in the area where the UFO apparently landed. He seem somewhat surprised by this question but confirmed that was indeed the case. “Yes, there is a missile silo out in that direction. I saw it one time when I was hunting with my dad,” he said, “I would say that the distance between the missile site and where the object landed was about a mile.”  Riewer continued, “Four days later, on December 11th, I was driving home after work again when I saw an extremely bright light in the sky, dead east, directly in front of me. As soon as I got home, I looked at the light with binoculars. By then, it was southeast of us. I saw blue lights on top, a red light on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that kept moving around. I couldn&#39;t make out the shape of the object, just the lights on it. My mom looked through the binoculars too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary for half an hour or so.  I would estimate that it was two to three miles southeast of our house.  Then the lights shut off and I could no longer see them.  About five minutes later, I saw another bright light. It looked exactly the same as the other one.  The second object was the about the same distance away, but dead south of us.”  Riewer continued, “I put down the binoculars and called the sheriffs office.  The person I spoke with just said, &#39;Thanks for reporting this.&#39; He acted like it was no big deal. There have been lots of reports of weird stuff going on around Conrad. He had probably heard other reports like mine, so he wasn&#39;t too excited about it. After I got off the phone, I looked at the object again. By then, it appeared as three red lights in a triangular pattern. After a few minutes, the bottom right light shut off. Then the bottom left light moved up to join the top light. All of this took place over a half an hour or so. Then these lights disappeared too. After a few moments, I noticed another object farther off in the distance, north of where I saw the first light. It was northeast of our house, but dimmer, and I couldn&#39;t see it too well. About a half an hour later, it was gone.”  After speaking with Riewer, I consulted my large, Air Force-issued map of Malmstrom&#39;s Minuteman missile sites and discovered that the Papa Launch Control Facility, designated P-0, is approximately 2 miles north by northwest of his family&#39;s farm.  I also found that the boundaries of three 564th Strategic Missile Squadron flights—Papa, Quebec, and Sierra—all converge nearby. According to the map, Launch Facility S-40 is approxi-mately 2.5 miles southeast of Riewer&#39;s house, and Launch Facility Q-15 is approximately 5 miles northeast of it. Riewer&#39;s estimate that the object southeast of his house on December 11th was “2 to 3 miles” distant seems to place it in the vicinity of S-40, while the dimmer object sighted northeast of his farm was conceivably near Q-15, although that is less certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked Riewer if he had heard or seen military jets either near the objects or in the general area during either sighting. He said that he had not. I then asked if he had noticed any unusual Air Force activity on the ground immediately after either sighting. He responded that he had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When asked if he had seen other unusual lights or objects in the sky on other occasions, Riewer  replied, “Yes, one night, maybe a year or so before my other sightings, my step-father and I heard what sounded like a helicopter flying really low. It was really loud. We went outside to see what was going on. We saw what looked like a helicopter, but really high up. That was puzzling because we expected it to be close to the ground. It was so high we could only see the lights on it. Then another helicopter came into view. The two met up and just stopped in the sky, really close to each other. Then the noise quit and both of them were silent! By then we figured they weren&#39;t helicopters. Then all of the lights slowly faded away, like they were going out. They just disappeared. Those two objects were southeast of the house, in the same general direction where I saw the other objects [on December 7 and 11] and about the same distance away.”  Riewer continued, “I mentioned my sightings at school and got laughed at, but one of my teachers backed me up and told us about his own UFO sighting, which happened while he was out hunting. After that, some other students got brave and told us about their sightings. So I&#39;m not the only one around Conrad who has seen things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In his posting on the NUFORC website, Riewer had mentioned that a mutilated cow had been found on his grandparents farm at the end of October 2006. He told me, “My step-grandpa and grandma have a farm near us, five miles east of Conrad. About a month or so before my sightings, a neighboring rancher had his cows grazing on their land and one of them was found mutilated. Its genitals were missing and the skin on one side its face was peeled off. As far as I know, that was the last time that kind of thing was reported in the area, but cattle have been found that way [on other occasions] in the past.”  According to the Montana press, cattle mutilations were first reported on ranches around Conrad, and elsewhere in Pondera County, in the mid-1970s. Then, after a nearly-three-decade lull, more mutilated cows and steers began to be discovered in the county beginning in 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Robert Hastings, author of UFOs and Nukes, Extraordinary Encoun-ters at Nuclear Weapons Sites, is a researcher and lecturer who has interviewed nearly one hundred U.S. Air Force veterans involved in nuclear weapons related UFO incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: At the time of their experiences, the former or retired USAF sources who Hastings interviewed held positions ranging from nuclear missile launch and target-ing officers, to missile maintenance personnel, to missile security police. The incidents described and documented occurred between 1963 and 1996 at the following  Air Force bases: Malmstrom (Montana), Minot (North Dakota), F.E. Warren (Wyoming), Ellsworth, (South Dakota), Vandenberg (California), and Walker (New Mexico, aka: Roswell). Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith (Michigan) and Loring (Maine), where B-52 nuclear bombers were based during the Cold War era.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1966-67, when Hastings’ father was stationed at Malmstrom, and during the time of the reported UFO activity at the nearby Minuteman missile sites, he witnessed five UFOs being tracked on radar in the air traffic control tower (having befriending a radar technician). The incident led to his decades long project and documentation of UFO inci-dents related to nuclear weapons sites. A portion of that documen-tation includes reports from at least six former or retired USAF personnel—Minuteman missile launch officers stationed at Malmstrom in 1967 who divulged their knowledge of UFO involvement in two separate, large-scale missile shutdown incidents. Despite the testimony of missile launch officers, the United States Air Force formally denies UFO-involvement in the officially acknowledged missile shutdown incident at Malmstrom AFB. The official disavowal is found in the 341st Strategic Missile Wing’s “unit history.”  Significantly, according to Hastings, the unit historian, Dav! id Gamble, reported that while compiling material for the official history, he had learned of reports of UFO activity within Malmstrom’s missile fields. When he made inquiries, Gamble received “no cooperation” from those in-the-know. He further said that written changes regarding “the UFO aspect of the missile shutdown incident” had been made by superiors. The final version of the unit history states, “Rumors of Unidentified Flying Objects around the area of Echo Flight during the time of the fault were disproven.”  Hastings presents his findings to colleges and universities nationwide and encourages former and retired military personnel to contact him regarding UFO  incidents related to nuclear weapons launch or storage facilities (email: hastings444@ worldnet.att.net).<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a more extensive presentation of Robert Hastings’ findings, including many eyewitness accounts by airmen stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base and other bases that store or deploy nuclear weapons in the United States, see ufohastings .com.<n>

I &#39;m traveling down highway 6 doing 70 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe it was a milliary helicopter convoy, but helicopters don&#39;t move like this. There was one of the lights that was bigger/brighter than the other seven.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon they started flying in complex formations, forming different shapes and quite frankly doing things that would kill a human if subjected to those kinds of g forces.  The lights flickered rapidly all kinds of colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 35 years old and the last time I saw something like this is when I was four years old in new mexico. We lived outside an air force base because my father was serving.  I was hopping this would be on the news because I don&#39;t see how no one else didn&#39;t see but me.  I even pulled over and filmed a small segment of it.  But I have to say the quallity is not top notch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please tell me someone else saw this, it was incresible!<n>

It flew steadily with yellow/orange lights on its rim that circled intermittently like a neon sign. It has two small red lights on one side that didn&#39;t blink. There was also a sequence of rectangles on its underside that pulsated out from its center like this: [[[[ ]]]].<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew steadily over the city and out of sight, at one point passing a plane that seemed to take no notice. But seeing it juxtaposed againt what was obviously an airplane made it seem even stranger looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was 02:30 (London Time) and according to the in flight map provided by the airline we were apprx 200 miles SE from Halifax. We were at 38000 feet and travelling NE at apprx 548 MPH. The plane was a Boeing 757 and I was sitting in Row 15 seat F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a bright orange glow on a cloud which must have been at least 10 miles away. The sky was clear above the scattered cumulous which reached up to about 1000ft below our altitude. I do not remember seeing  the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was just inner cloud lightning but thought this was odd because of the bright orange color. As I continued to watch I saw an intense bright orange sphere of light which was smaller than the size of a pea from that distance. The sphere hung in the air and did not climb or decend and remained at about 10 miles. The object lit up the cloud behind it with a bright orange glow similer to athe glow achieved by a fireplace. It was orange. The object remained very bright. Almost laser bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke to the lady sitting next to me in seat 15D and asked her if she could see the same thing. She agreed. She could not guess what it could be. We both watched as the object remained and we moved Eastward. We watched for at least 5 to 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then started to desend through the cloud causing the glow to follow down against the clouds behind it. The object desended vertically through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about another 4 minutes we lost site of the object but the glow took longer to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did consider that I had witnessed an inflight collision but on landing in London there were no reports of air accidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watch the object for a few minutes and resumed my business as I pordered what I saw.

It was a bright red light, with another red flashing light next to it.  I thought it was an airplane of some sort at first, but this was drifting far slower than airplanes we normally see.  Too, the flashing red light just didn&#39;t look right.  The lights were big, not the small red lights one usually sees on an aircraft.  Too, there were no other lights. Most aircraft usually have a flashing white light, don&#39;t they?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless, the lights were vertically overhead when I saw them, and drifted ever so slowly to the south.  As I got to the dam, the lights had only moved a bit to the south, no more so that I was still looking up about 45-50 degrees over the horizon.  It was no where near going behind the horizon or the mountains here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, the lights both went out and I could not see any craft, or lights any more.  The night was clear and cold, and there were no clouds for the lights to disappear behind.

I was first driving in my car going home to my apartment around 11:45pm on December 5th 2006 and I saw a red firework go off in the sky toward the Air Base(I actullay have no clue if it was an actual firework; It looked like a regular big red firework alot of red little dots in a circle shape). And then the trees blocked my veiw. I immediatly told my girlfriend. She kinda got excited and wanted to see. So I told her toward to look toward Travis(AFB). We hit a couple corners toward the house and had an open view and no fireworks... So we get into my apartment parking lot and shes still looking back for the fireworks. And I notice a red light in the sky straight infront of us while I was driving toward my parking space. My girlfriend tells me... &#34;Do you see that?&#34; I replyed with a confirmed face and nod. &#34;What is that?&#34; It looked to be a &#34;Red Star&#34; very bright. Like a dot or light. I hit a corner in my parking lot and parked to get out to look. There it is... a weird red star looking thing. So I call a homeboy accross town to instruct him to go outside and look toward my apartments. This is around 11:50pm He does and laughs. &#34;What is that?&#34; No Clue. A red light shining in the sky. Shortly after I called him the red dot started pulsing.. Slowing... But pulsing. Bright and Dim. While I was on the phone with him a white light came from the middle of the red dot and shot BRIGHT real fast and a white line traced down from the bottom. It looked like a white tracer bullet but shot out and only went a very short distance away from the bottom of the red light. I was still on the phone with my homie and he had 3 people with him that all seen it. After the white light shot down, it was once again solid red. I then noticed it was moving down slowly. I got off the phone with my friend and then my girlfriend cal! led her mother. Told her and she had 3 other people with her. We all seen it there are 9 of us in 3 different parts of town. When it dissapered it started moving to the right and then started to pulse faster but still slow.(Maybe  each about 700ms&#34;) and then did the same thing the white tracer line thing did and shot down about an inch in my eyes and dimmed away with a consistant pulse. It all happend for about 10 minutes It stopped about midnight to the minute. What I think happend if it was an alien =P. Is that of course they would be smart and they wouldnt go into lightspeed parallel from us. They would go away from us... Please reply!!!1<n>

I was amused at how nice of a contrail that plane had and started looking at how long it was when I first observed the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 1/2-3/4 mile behind the United flight and appreared to be almost stationary just above the contrail.  Its attitude to the contrail was approximately 15-20 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it appreared to be a scratch on the window I was looking through, but when I observed it from another adjacent window it was exactly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For most of the observation, it looked as thought it was kinfe edge toward our plane.  Then for a brief period of time it rolled to reveal its real shape (circular).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the passenger next to me if he had a camera I could borrow he said yes and proceeded to get it out of his bag.

I keep hearing a very strange, un-natural noise coming from oustide. When i first hear something, it sounded as if a large, heavy object was bouncing outside on the street. It ceased only a minute later. Shortly after this happened, not even 10 minutes later, i heard something else. This was a very strange noise as well. I can compare it to so few things. I could tell by the sound that it was high in the air, much like you can a jet. But this sound was stationary, possibly 10-15 feet to the side of my house. The best why i can describe it is that of a jet engine, with a waving sound. The almost hovering noise would pulse in and out. It sounded like a jet had stopped moving, and the engine was turning off and on very quickly.. i do not know how to put it. Than while i was hearing this, i heard the bouncing noise again, this time on the side of the house. This stopped quickly again, than the jet like sound trailed off as well. I have not yet went outside.. it is 2:08 am, and i am feeling quite uneasy about this. What ive just said may not seem like a UFO, but it is not the first time i have seen or heard something. I will describe this quickly as it may help to find out what happened. This event occured many years ago, possibly 6 years. I was younger, and across the street from my house with my brother, and his friend. There is a long drive way leading away from their farm, which we were riding are bikes down. it was very dark, and getting late, possibly 11pm. When the three of us got to the end of the drive way, we all stared at an object hoving over a field, maybe 1/2 a mile away. it was a very large disk/saucer shaped object, with long sides, there were also lights on the sides of it. I remember this very clearly. It may sound like a hoax, or something different from a UFO. But it was very clear for how dark it was. And i know it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon.. nothing like that. We were kind of frightened by th! is so we turned around and rode back to the house. I tired to tell my parents.. but they did not believe us. I would really like to be contacted about this via my email address. Have similar sound been reported?<n>

The crafts looked like a really big explination point (!) but the bottom was attached to the top and much larger. The larger circular part was leading the entire ship, as if the round part was a control center. It had red white and blue lights all over the bottom of it that had a glow bright enough for me to see it in daylight, and after those 10 to 15 seconds were over the bottom started to dim, then got REALLY bright and then it was gone, it left behind a blueish fog that disappeared fairly quickly. It was so weird and the vibrations made a close by parked car alarm go off..i wish i&#39;d of had a camera (i&#39;ve never seen anything UFO like it before has anyone else seen this type or is it just me?)

12/4/06 07:00|Apache Junction|AZ|Disk|15 min|ufos emerge from three small geometric clouds.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53837.html|343|ndxe200612| ufos emerge from three small geometric clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at 0700 my wife noticed an odd cloud in the SE sky, maybe 2 mi from our house.  If 2 miles is about right, then I would guess it&#39;s altitude to be about 1000 ft, and it&#39;s size to be about 100 feet high.  No other clouds were visible anywhere.  The cloud looked flat, was vertically oriented, and had perfectly straight sides, and was diamond shaped.  My first thought was that it was some kind of huge kite.  I  looked at it through a spotting scope, and could tell that it was clearly a cloud.  Then I noticed a round object above the cloud, which my wife could see without the scope, and through the scope it had a frisbee shape, with what looked like a hole in the center. The object looked solid, and had clearly defined edges. It began to move downward, extremely slowly, and changed it&#39;s orientation so that it looked almost edge on to our viewpoint, then went behind some low hills just south of the Superstition Mtns.  This took place over maybe 2-3 minutes, and while this was happening, the cloud kind of disentegrated into a more or less normal cloud looking shape, and drifted slightly north of where we first saw it.  At this time my wife had to leave for work, and I went back in the house, where I continued looking at this cloud through the scope.  Then another cloud appeared very suddenly, in about the same place.  It appeared to be more edge on, and looked more like a slash, but I could see that it had the same square edged appearance as the first one.  As I was looking at it, a small round piece of it slowly bulged out of the side, near the bottom, and began the same slow drifting kind of descent the first one did.  Thia one however didn&#39;t have a definite shape, it just looked like a small piece of cloud, trailing cloud/steam/smoke/? in a very short tail behind it.  It also finally went out of sight behind the hills in about the same place as the first one, and the cloud disentegrated in about the same manner as the first.  Before this second one disappeared, a third cloud appeared, in jus! t about the same place, with the same thing coming out of it.  I called my wife on her cell phone, (she had just gotten on the 60, headed west), and asked her to look in the rear view mirror if she could and tell me what she saw.  She could clearly see three clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say &amp;quot;YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE&amp;quot; So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard&amp;quot;YOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE&amp;quot; so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor&#39;s back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I&#39;ve never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn&#39;t so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I&#39;m going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn&#39;t believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked &amp;quot;GOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> couldn&#39;t handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I&#39;m in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn&#39;t been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth. I also have a picture of the mark that&#39;s underneath my arm and two picture&#39;s I took of a UFO on my birthday March 27 of 2009<n>

The skies were totally clear,with a bright moon-one night short of a full moon. The craft had an oval shaped bottom, with a round, tall, beehive shaped body to the structure.

They were rectangle and flashing randomly at the rate of 5-10 per second with no pattern like aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it in the distance as it floated approx 1000 to 1500 ft. above ground, I noticed that the flight path was like an &#34;S&#34; pattern heading south.  And as I stared at it I thought that I could see it slipping from side to side and made the &#34;S&#34; pattern the craft was flying kind of jerk back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden the light stopped for about 5 seconds and I could make out a dim white globe floating above where the center of the light bar would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights started up again and it floated away, not caring one bit as to who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe what I saw, look at 10/28/06 ufo reports and find the one for Strawberry Ca.  It is 40 miles north of me and the hunter saw the same lights.<n>

12/3/06 18:30|South St. Paul|MN|Light|2.5 hrs|Green lights from georgia to Minnesota?|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54162.html|353|ndxe200612| Green lights from georgia to Minnesota?<n> <n><n> <n><n> May be related to the Georgia Green Light Case. We left the BP Gas station near the intersection of US HWY 10 and Jamaica Ave S in Cottage Grove, MN At approx 1830 hrs. We were headed NW direction on US HWY 10 from Cottage Grove, MN towards St. Paul, MN. As we were driving past the exit for 80th St and US Hwy 10 the sky above the refinery became visible. The sky was overcast, dark and a fine mist was in the air, the temperature was above freezing, perhaps in the low 40s. My daughter Kourtney (14) and I (34-M) were in the front seat while my son Chris (12) was in the back of our Durango SUV. My daughter and I could see a distinct Green Light that appeared to be sourced within the clouds or a bit below, shining down, and flashing as if taking pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was a dull Green color that repeatedly flashed sometimes from slightly different positions over the Marathon refinery. This green beam was a dull color that did not reveal its source. We could see only the hint of a shadow with no definete outline. The mist helped to show the definete beam shape ( like  a spotlight) as it aimed for the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As each flash of the light occured, the vapor that was in the &#34;beam&#34; during the flash became charged and glowed like an Ionized gas. These towers or columns of light (possibly ionized gas or mist)remained much brighter than the source that appeared to be creating them. In the three to four minutes that it takes to drive towards the refinery we saw perhaps ten to fifteen formed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer to the refinery the columns of light/ gas floated away from the refinery in an eastern direction at the wind speed. I would estimate this to be about fifteen to twenty miles an hour with a lower elevation of approximately 1500 feet and a terminal elevation of 2000 feet. they were that tall...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the lights seemed to be overpowered by the refineries bright tower lights. as our eyes adjusted to the brightness, it became harder to see. I doubt anyone at the refinery would have noticed these at all.  There were no spotlights at the refinery either, which  I looked for as some kind of explanation. As we passed the refinery, they seemed to disappear. I continued to my destination (near downtown St. Paul) and spotted the lights forming again on my return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the green light seemed to be a pale white or yellow light (like a sodium lamp color) but still the columns of gas/mist would form and glow and float away from the refinery, for miles! This second sighting was approximately 1900-1910 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone so I returned home and picked up my wife (36) my step daughter (16) and my friend Mike (38) and we returned to as parking lot in Newport, MN (across the highway from the refinery) and watched these lights form repeatedly. At one point the lights were so numerous they looked like a photo of a &#34;galactic center&#34; with neboulous clouds and colors. This peak of activity occured around 2010-2030 hours with all of us witnessing these columnsof light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few columns appeared over the inver grove heights river valley, and some of these &#34;stragglers&#34; flew directly over our head at this time. They looked like florescent lightbulbs- sort of. We listened with the windows open and did not hear a sound coming from the sky. by 2040 hours, the lights were gone and most of the columns had blown away with the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The approximate lattitude/ Longitude location of the refinery is:  44.51.08 N 93.00.10 W  our observation point where the columns flew over us:  44.52.28 n 93.00.02 w  The columns that flew  above us originated approx:  44.52.23 n 93.01.17 w  I did see a dark streak shoot across the lower cloud elevation suddenly at the termination of the event which was not observed by the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No electrical effects were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear and the sun was obviously reflecting on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped on the road and continued to watch the object as it appeared to turn to one side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see that it was a long object like an airplane fuselage, but without  wings or a tail. There was no contrail or signs of any type of exhaust. It wasn&#39;t moving forward or backward, but just sort of hung there.  It appeared to be no more than a mile from my location and probably no more than 4 or 5 thousand ft. above a tall bluff.  I lowered the car window to be sure that I wasn&#39;t seeing a reflection off the glass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a couple of minutes and pulled to the shoulder due to traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back the object was no where in sight.  Even a fast jet could not have gone out of my range of sight in that short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very familiar with the aircraft in our area since we live about 80 miles from Ft.

We thought at first it was the moon behing some clouds unitl we realized we don&#39;t have clouds that looked like these vapor cloud things. The other clouds were not like it anyway. There was a brightness in the area surrounding this. We went inside because we were comming home and watched the bright cloud or vapor thing. There were at least 15 in the group. Two at a time they stared to fade. Some just got brighter then were gone and the others turned organgeish white and just shot away. This continued until the 15 were gone. Under the conglomeration was a line of the vapor type clouds it remained even after the others left. I called my neighbor during this time and she and her husband started to watch. I thought it was over and I contacted our local news to see if anyone had reported anything in the sky of course it hadn&#39;t. Then the line that had been there got a huge fireball on top of it and I realized that is also what I had seen in the sky that I thought was the moon. It looked like a sunrise but it was in the west and it exploded and disappeared. It took about 3-5 minutes for this to happen so it was watchable. Not like a split second that was what was so amazing. I was loudly asking my friend on the phone if she saw it and she did. The other little clouds under it did the same thing orangeish reddish explosion. But it really looked like they were taking off and they were so powerful and fast that it created that light. I wonder if the cloudy vapor things were a cover or that the  technology of the ships created the vapors. It was really the most incredible thing I have ever seen. I&#39;m not the type of person who believes things easily and I even brushed it off when I first saw everything. But it was undeniable and fantastic. I wouldn&#39;t even allow myself to believe it at first thinking there must be a logical explaination. The only logical explaination is  alien life in our atsmosphere observing our planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work only 2 miles from where I live.  I was out smoking a cigarette on break looking due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again I was observing 4 separate jet liners and there contrails. There were two groups of two. The two jets to my left were about 2 min. apart and the same with the other two jets to my right. I was talking with a co worker when I first noticed something glowing and stationary in the sky just to the right of the group of jets to my right. At that same time my co worker noticed something moving from north to south perpendicular to the jets flight path. The stationary object vanished as the second object moved at a high rate of speed passing through all 4 contrails then also vanished. I and the co worker speculated about it for a little bit, and then he had forgotten about it. When I saw it for a second time in as many days I knew had to let someone know. So tonight Dec 6th 2006 I searched the web for sightings in my region when I came upon your page for similar sightings in eastern pa. I hope this information can help u and maybe help me as well. I have no witness for the first sighting but I can get a statement from my coworker on the second one if it helps. Keep me posted on what else I can do or anyone to contact on this issue.<n>

It was an awkwardness where we all stopped and looked at each other, and noticed the night sky got really dark. It&#39;s difficult to explain, but we all felt something was odd and stopped our conversations and tried to figure out what was different on that beach.  We all saw a huge object hover low above us.  It was just above the low lying scattered clouds.  It was like an enormously big shadow that hovered from east to west over the ocean.  While it floated above us, you could &#34;hear&#34; the silence, it was too quiet, it was like the noise of life stopped.  I remember standing there watching the once moonlit sky turn to black and saw the massive shadow float across the sky towards the oceans&#39; horizon.  We all knew this was real as we saw the shadow of this object on the oceans&#39; water.  The water was ref! lecting the moonlight and when this object floated over, the water turned black.  We all watched this object float away onto the horizon.  The object was about 400 ft wide and even longer in length, maybe 500-600 ft.  It was hard to see its actual shape because it was a shadow over the clouds, but I remember it being like a mammoth sized blimp-shaped object.  I have seen other sightings in the desert that I cant explain, but this one really got to me.  It&#39;s been with me for all these years and I decided to search around and see if anyone else saw any sightings this particular night.  I&#39;m glad to see another report was made on this particular night in Newport Beach, CA.<n>

To make sure it wasn&#39;t an optical illusion because the clouds were going in the opposite direction, we used electric and telephone wires above us, to focus on and watch the lights quickly cross behind the wires.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for almost five minutes until there were no more moving lights and all that remained were the stars in their stationary positions.  We were not able to get an accurate count, but there may have been as many as fifty or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may have been others that had passed overhead before I noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coordinates: 43.5280 N, 71.4710 W<n>

I looked up to see how the stars looked on this cool crisp night when I noticed what appeared to be a flock of &#34;lit&#34; birds...but turned out to be a string of lights, approximately 1/3 high up in the sky.  If I had to guess less than 1,000 ft up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog began barking but other than that the sky was dead quiet.  The 6 lit objects almost looked like stars but were a dull orange or pink tone and moved in perfect unison.  This could have been one object.  The object moved from West to East at a slow but steady pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to think about all possible alternatives and ratonalizing this but cannot determine what this is.  It definitely was not a natural occurrance and has shaken me.<n>

I had taken along my camcorder to catch some video of the dogs.  Walking to the far NE corner of the yard I stood under a small oak tree. The limbs of the tree blocked the sun from my view which was midway in the southern sky. Thats when I noticed the object in the sky.  It sat SSE of my position at a 45 degree angle up and I quickly turned my camcorder on the object and took just over a minute of video before loosing sight of the object.  It appeared to be oval in shape.It also appeared to be self lit. The object made no noise.The dogs did not react in any way to the object.The weather was clear that day as seen in the video.Having worked at the Mobile airport for a number of years re-fueling all commercial and freight Aircraft I can tell you this was no plane.

Saw shadows in woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a 2 story appartment with my wife and 4 kids. Our bedroom is on the second story of the unit facing the back.  There is a small patch of woods in back of the appartment. My wife had a dream that she saw a cone shaped UFO flying. She said it was a very realistic dream. When she woke up, she went to use the upstairs bathroom. As she was tinkling, she heard the basement door down-stairs shut. She was frightened and hurried back to bed. She tried to wake me, but I was sound asleep. She laid there still with her eyes open. After a few minutes, there was a bright light that shined in the bedroom window. She said it was so bright, it lit the room up like daylight. It lasted just a few seconds. after a minute she got up to look out the window. She said see saw a couple of shadows moving around in the woods. She then woke me up and explained what she saw and heard. I looked out the window and went down-stairs but didn&#39;t see or hear anything. The next day I looked out in the woods and the businesses behind the woods, but couldn&#39;t find anything. But I know my wife heard and saw things that there is no reasonable explaination for. She was 4 weeks pregnant at the time. Thank you and God bless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling through Mills River from a concert in Charlotte, a friend and I spotted a large, glowing, yellow sphere coming out of the Blue Ridge Mountains ahead of us.  I had seen a similar (if not, the same) sphere a few weeks prior.  Although the sphere was glowing yellow, it did not illuminate any of the mountains around it.  The sphere appeared to be roughly 1-1/2 miles in diameter, and was about 10-15 miles ahead of us. We both watched it, until (just like the first time i saw it), we came around a curve, and it had disappeared.  Both of the spheres i saw occurred over the same mountain range in North Carolina, and both appeared and disappeared in roughly the same amount of time.  I do not know the name of the mountain range where i saw the object  I have already reported the first sighting of the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had lost power earlier that night and the wind and rain had been pretty bad.  The sky had cleared up by this time and there were many stars visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in the sky as I always do and noticed what looked to be 3 BRIGHT lights moving slowly just above the trees, very low,  I told my boyfriend to look at this because I did not think it resembled any type of plane.  He did not see it because as we continued driving it disappeared behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a mile further down the road I observed this object in the sky again, it was very low and almost right overhead.  I pulled the car over to observe and show my boyfriend.  It had about three large yellow/white lights that were extreamly bright (hurt your eyes to look at)  and a few other smaller, dimmer lights that were blue and red it didnt even really seem to be moving much if it was it was Very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there observing for about 5 minutes trying to figure out what this could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights just like shut off, it just disappeared, nowhere to be seen. we then just drove home, rubbing and blinking our eyes because of the extremely bright lights we observed.<n>

As it approached town it seemed more like a helicopter, as it starting descending, al this point you could see others lights of diferent colors rotating, until thier where all sorts of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately after crossing Mexican airspace, and entering U.S. airspace the aircraft gained altitude and speed,doing ackward movements. Descebding and then ascending very rapidly with more multicolor lights, still in a very akward way, at my not at all familiar knowledge of aviation, it seemed like the erratic movements where either evasive moves or it had been hit by some friendly fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This conclusion I draw, considering that at some 30 miles away due northwest of Mexicali, there is a U.S. Air Force Base at Seeley California, as well as at some 40 miles due east there is another U.S. Air Force Base in Yuma, Arizona, that leads me to conjure that after being detected by either Mexicali International Airport or U.S.A.F. at Seeley, Ca. or Yuma, Az. once in U.S. airspace Aircrafts and other measures had being taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note the speed in which it approached Mexicali, from a southeast direction was much faster than any comercial or military aircraft seem around this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, hope this may help in anyway possible, saludos, amigos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date or time of sighting.

It was in the south east of my location, and it was headed northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded the short distance home, grabbed my Steiner binoculars and looked at it.  There were no FAA lights on this thing (no red or green blinkers).  Not knowing the physical demension, I could not estimate the altitude it was at.

They were moving horizontally from a N to S direction at about 5000 ft.( Our best guess)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between us and the lights was maybe 1-2 miles and our viewing was just from the West side of the 15 Fwy looking out towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a hazy yellowish or orange color.  Because we live near a private airport, we are used to a lot of air traffic as well as traffic coming and going from March Airforce Base and Miramar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also because of the Palomar Observatory, all of our street lights are dim to allow viewing.  So because of this, we also see very clearly on almost every night meteorites coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These 2 lights were going so quickly that it startled us. There was also no sound coming from them, and believe me, after spending time my whole life around military bases, nothing can fly at that speed without breaking the sound barrier and causing some kind of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way to descibe their formation would be to illustrate it.( -_ ) Thats pretty much what they looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Took about 5 seconds to across the sky and then just disappeared.<n>

I glanced out and up of the passenger side window of my car.  I have no idea why I did this because I had to bend down to look up at the sky to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three sets of double aqua green lights in the shape of a narrow triangle.  I could detect no movement and appeared to be hovering.  The double lights capped each corner of the triangle, and the inside light was a little longer than the outside light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no circular red light in the middle of the triangle and I couldn&#39;t make out a solid interior.  It appeared to be about the size of a small house and was very low to the ground, I can only guess but maybe 200 to 300 ft. up.  I rolled down all my windows to see if I could hear any engine noise but hear nothing other than traffic.  I pulled forward to the red light at Fairlawn Rd. and came to a stop, I tried to look back out the passengers window and could see nothing.  I crossed the road and looked again--nothing.  I tried several more times to see as I came to the grocery store at 21st and Belle. I got out of the car in the parking lot and scanned the sky but I couldn&#39;t find what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before it was amazing.  It wasn&#39;t like the triangles that were seen in Belgium and Illinois.<n>

I didn&#39;t pay much attention at first because we are near the Richmond Airport but I then noticed that it was not flying in a straight line such as a normal plane would. I slowed down and pulled off the side of the road as my girl-friend screamed at me for doing so but it was flying as if it was circling looking for something. I watched it go from what seemed like about ten miles in about 2 or 3 seconds. It was what looked like over the airport then it was over the field in front of my neighborhood in a flash. It seemed like it was almost checking me out as it passed over I heard a hissing noise and there were blue and green lights on the bottom and side of the triangular shaped craft. It didn&#39;t send out any beams or any type of lights to search around but it seemed like some of the colored lights were flashing more rapidly than the others. The whole time my girlfriend was yelling at me to get into the car and she saw it but didn&#39;t have any interest in it other than to say lets get the heck out of here. This is the first time I have ever seen anything of this nature and I don&#39;t know if it was the same craft everyone else had seen or even if this was some government craft we don&#39;t know about. However being a flight enthusiast myself I know that no known craft could perform the flight characteristics displayed that night. I don&#39;t drink or do drugs and was not on any medication so I know what I saw and nobody can convince me otherwise but I sure would like to know what the heck it was. I can say this much if I had doubts of UFO&#39;s before I have been totally convinced after witnessing this that we are NOT alone after all. I think the government needs to come forward with the information that it has concerning UFO&#39;s and tell the truth because sooner or later one is going to land on the Whitehouse lawn and ! then its all over. I have always believed in this stuff because in being a devout christian I find it hard to believe that GOD would have created such a vast Universe and that we are the only creatures that enhabit the entire Universe. It seems like an aweful waste of space. My girlfriend will not talk much about what happened that night and she doesn&#39;t like to watch shows about stuff of this nature but one thing is for sure what we saw scared the heck out of her and she no doubt is a believer now even though she won&#39;t talk about it to much. I will close with saying thank you for allowing me to talk about this because I didn&#39;t know who to talk to and even if someone would believe me or think I was nuts but I want to thank you for being about to tell my story without being ridiculed. I only wish that I had a camera or something that I could have used to support what I saw because it hung around for what seemed like forever but it was only a couple of minutes but long enough to realize that this craft was not a conventional ship that we know of at this time thats for sure.<n>

My boyfriend was not directly in front of the window but heard a humming and felt a vibration. When we walked outside by the window nothing was there. It was very windy and had been raining. We went out the front door and my boyfriend saw the sky light up wit a blue-green light, but didn&#39;t see a specific object.
