In one of them Mr. Davenport is trying to get exact dates and locations. Perhaps these two are related, maybe this will help piece things together:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27190.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17601.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are approximate for both sightings.

1/1/44 12:00|San Diego|CA|Cigar|3 minutes|A sighting of one silver or white enlongated cylindrical or cigar shaped craft without any visual control surfaces heading west to east|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38233.html|2|ndxe194401| A sighting of one silver or white enlongated cylindrical or cigar shaped craft without any visual control surfaces heading west to east<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured in 1944.  I don&#39;t recall the exact date nor the time but I do rmember it was around mid day.  The exact location of the sighting was ((deleted--XXXX)  35th, San Diego.  A friend of mine and I were standing side by side and talking about something. I, for no reason looked upward and about five or ten degrees north.  I saw a silver or white obect which was in the shape of an elongated fairly thin cylinder either rounded or pointed at each end.  I do not recall seeing any control serfaces.  It was not an airship.  The sky was sunny but with patches of cumulus clouds.  The object was moving slowly west to east.  There was no sound from the object.  As I recall there was little or no wind at ground level.  The object was seen for approximately two to three minutes and then disappeared behind a cloud formation.  I alerted my friend about the object and asked if he saw it.  His answer was yes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t say anthing to anyone else about the sighting but I have remembered it for all of these years.  Since I heard about your organization I thought it was time to say something about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/1/44 10:00|Wilderness (near western MD)|WV|Disk|3 weeks|US fighter planes shoot down pre Roswell UFO then military scour crash site & bury UFO remains at wilderness site|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27190.html|3|ndxe194401| US fighter planes shoot down pre Roswell UFO then military scour crash site &amp; bury UFO remains at wilderness site<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to Roswell US fighter planes shot down an UFO in the wilderness mountains outside Washington, D.C. (West Virginia or Western Maryland mountains.) The fighter plane bullets made holes in the craft which was shaped as two saucers together but each hole slowly closed back up until there were so many hits the saucer wasn&#39;t able to recover. Parachute devices ejected. The saucer was lost in the clouds. Crack crash teams left Bolling Air Base or Andrews Air Base. Civilian and military members found the remains. A gigantic hole was found in the side of mountain near top with large trees sheered in half as craft plowed into top side of mountain. No survivors were found. No dead bodies were found. The craft exploded upon impact. Many of the thousands of pieces from the craft were field tested. The exercise lasted 3 weeks in complete secrecy. All the craft pieces not taken away were buried in a large hole with dynamite. All the men were ordered not to talk and could not bring any of the material from the craft. The metal had many qualities such as being as lite as aluminum foil etc.<n>
