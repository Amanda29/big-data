4/27/91 21:00|Sacramento|CA|Changing|20-30 min|Object in CA defied known laws of physics.|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47545.html|1|ndxe199104| Object in CA defied known laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving in somewhat desolate area on White Rock Rd near Aerojet.  Noticed stationary lights in sky at a distance.  Drove past and for some reason decided to turn around.  I turned my vehicle around and approached the area where the lights were located - again at a distance.  They were above an area that had a chain linked fence and was actually Aerojet property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached I noticed the outline of what appeared to be the outline of a bowl shaped figure.  As I brought my vehicle to a complete stop in the middle of the roadway, I noticed that the &#34;bowl shaped figure&#34; had begun to turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused upon the figure itself as it turned.  While my eyes were fixated on the figure at a distance, I suddenly and instantaneously sensed a very close presence.  Within the blink of an eye - the object that began it&#39;s turn at a distance completed it&#39;s turn two feet from the driver&#39;s side of my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to defy known physics and made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it completed it&#39;s turn, several very bright lights came on.  I did not feel heat but the lights themselves were somewhat blinding.  Due to the closeness of the object to my vehicle and the lights - I could not see the object in it&#39;s entirety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The portion of the object that I could see at that point, however, was not particularly bowl shaped but, rather, appeared somewhat rectangular and similiar to the front grill of a car (but much larger).  There were approximately a total of six lights- three on each side - that, again, were large and very bright.  When they went on - it was similiar to a &#34;lights, camera, action&#34; scenario where you see movie lights on a camera set turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in the air and at it&#39;s lowest seemed suspended approximately one foot off the ground on the driver&#39;s side and at an angle.  The rear - that I could not see clearly - appeared  to be, perhaps, higher.  There was a window of sorts - somewhat similiar to the front window on a vehicle but smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I detected movement from within but could not see anything clearly (and did not want to).  Initially I froze and then absolutely floored my vehicle in an attempt to get away.  As I swerved down the darkened two lane road, the object that was facing the driver&#39;s side of my vehicle turned with the lights remaining on and faced the back of my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it in my rearview mirror - fearing that it would follow.  It did not but, rather, turned once again, in the opposite direction.  I drove to Hwy 50 (nearby) and took some comfort in the fact that I was surrounded by other (known) vehicles.  To my left, however, as I drove a stretch of 50 heading home - I looked to my left and could see the lights of a very, very low flying object - flying parallel to me and at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was me, my mom, my sister and a friend of hers.  I saw a starlike object in the sky from a few miles away, and told my mom that I didn&#39;t remember seeing that there.  I love to watch the sky.  Anyway, we got closer, and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my whole life.  We saw a UFO.  I screamed for my mom to pull over, because it was getting lower and lower and I wanted to see it.  She pulled into a driveway, and we were in awe gazing out the window.  Being in such amazement, I stumbled out of the car, my family screaming in fright.  I was directly under this thing.  It was a huge oval shaped craft about 20 feet above my head.  Lights went around it, different colors.  They blinked.  I heard nothing.  It just sat there, over my head as if to let me look at it.  I saw a small square in the bottom, like a door.  The dimensions were hard to tell, I was only 16 at the time.  I do remember though, there was definetly not enough room for an adult to stand up in there.  I was so dumbfounded, as I had always read about UFO&#39;s but never really believed.  There I was, a young small town girl, seeing what was the most amazing thing in my life.  It hovered there, what seemed like hours, but was 2 or 3 minutes.  Then, before I could blink, it sped off like lightning.  NO SOUND!! Nothing, no whirr, no hum, nothing.  I was in shock.  Thank you for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving one night in Southeastern Idaho and I was northbound on I-15, shortly after i passed the small city of Malad, I saw something falling out of the sky to the west of me. There were larger bright lights , also there was a cluster of smaller lights as well. It reminded me of a shooting star at first, but there were too many lights and it didn&#39;t appear to be all that far away. I thought maybe it was an aircraft crashing, although It vaished and I do not know whether it ever hit the ground or not. So as soon as I could get to a phone, I called the Bannock County Sheriff&#39;s Office in Pocatello to report the possibility of a crashed aircraft. They imformed me that they had received NO report of any aircraft crashing in the area. Alot of time has passed since then and i hadn&#39;t given it alot of thought, thinking it was something that could be easily explained, but today I shared this eposide with a friend and he imformed me that alot of UFO&#39;s had been spotted in the surrounding area and that he too had witnessed UFO&#39;s in that area along with his son and a man in another vehicle who had stopped along the freeway to observe three UFO&#39;s in the air. If anyone else had observed UFO&#39;s in that area in the counties of Oneida, Power, Bannock, or Cassia Counties, please email me at ((address deleted--please submit report to NUFORC, so witness can read your report here.

I&#39;m a church going person and I&#39;m not sure what to think of what I seen. A friend, my brother, and my self were playing in the yard about 120 yards away. I was on a down hill slope and looked up at the friend who was also on a large wood pile. I seen directly over his head in the distance a large Disk. It was four times bigger than the house( which would make it wide as a football feild and tall as a three story building. The best was I can describe it is - someone drew it in the sky with a pencil and then erased it. I could see it but at the same time I couldnt. Basicly transparent, the only way I seen it is because I was looking right at it when I was looking at my friend.  Me and my brother seen it at the same time and yelled to the friend.  He turned around and fell down from the quick shock. Being far away the first thang we could think to do was run to it so we could make out what it was. In our we asumed that it wasnt aware of us but as we ran close it droped down and dashed out of sight. No flames , no sound , and it was gone in less than a sec.  No human could live through those g-forces and what ship do we have that fast with no sound. Every one we told did&#39;nt understand. I was about 12 and know im 24. I have found jesus and here latly I have been talking to people about what I seen and I have a lot of questions for the lord when I reach hevan. As for now I pray what I saw is answered in time. I&#39;m honest 100% positive that we all seen it fast and looked like I was standing in front of a large football staduim , but it was nearly transparent...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in the lead heading up a ravine when I turned around to see where my companions were. They had gathered around a deep crevice and were checking it out. One of them had a camera and was taking pictures. I looked at them, then looked up and saw a very large diamond-shaped object moving slowly, from west to east, across the sky. It was gray, metal-like, hard-edged, resembling a squarish box tilted with sharp corners perpendicular to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it float by and yelled for my friends who couldn&#39;t hear because of the noise of the water rushing through the canyon. Finally, two of them hiked away from the guy taking pictures and looked up at me pointing to the sky. They turned to look and saw the object for about ten or fifteen seconds until it went behind a ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we were all pretty amazed and had no idea what it was. Unfortunately, the person with the camera had not seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Because of the time of the observation altitude is only a rough estimate, however at the time I was an Air Traffic Controller in the U.S. Air Force, so it was my job to be able to determine such information by sight, this also means I had radar equipment at my disposal to track airborne aircraft under my control, and at the time of the observation neither myself nor the other two witnesses were able to observe a radar signature of the craft. It appeared to be about 1 mile south of our position in the control tower at Scott A.F.B.. The object made no noise whatsoever.<n>

My nephew and I  were driving on a remote hightway in the mountains of Colorado between Durango and Pagosa Srings, Coloradoat 11:45 PM.  This is a secluded stretch of highway where the mountains come down to the road on both sides.  My 23 year old nephew who is an areonautical engineer was driving while I was keeping a lookout for elk on the highway.  All of a sudden, the highway above and ahead of us for several hundred yards was lit like with street lights, although the light was indescribably soft and misty.  It did not alarm us.  Knowing this stretch of the road I knew there were no highway lights but accepted them and then looked up through the windshield to see their source.  There was a car coming from the opposite direction about a quarter mile away.  As I looked up through the windshield, I saw a huge round disc like soft light with grey metalic material surrounding it.  Then, I looked down the road above us and was able to count seven similiar lights.  They seemed to be approximately 40-50 ft. in diameter and about 100 feet above us.  I had just finished counting the lights when the object disappeared in a beautiful curving motion.  I then looked up in the clear dark sky and saw the object which in a split second went from something that seemed 400-500 yards long to a tiny two inch object way up in the sky where all we could see were the row of lights.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my nephew not to discuss what we experienced until we got home 15 minutes later and wrote down our observations.  Our observations were identical with the exception that my nephew thought the object was only about 75 feet above our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and talked with the airport manager.  He said a neighbor of his had a similar long lighted object hover over their home which was about 35 miles from our encounter.  WE reported our sighting to the local Sheriffs office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about the experience, it was obvious that the UFO was traveling the same speed as our car (about 45 MPH), as the lights appeared to be stationary.<n>

I decided to take a nap in her room.  Her and her sister were watching T.V. in there also.  I dont remember how long I was asleep but all of assuden they woke me up calling my name.  &#34;Hurry, Hurry, get up&#34;, they said.  My freind had a huge window in her room.  So I got up to what they were talking about.  They told me to look out the window.  So I did, and there it was.  It was as low as the street lights, and it was gray a metalic material.  There were red or orange, (I cant remember) lights goign around it like Kit the car on Night Rider.  All I remember is I was just staring at it, almost fixated.  While I was staring I remember my friends they said to get a camera to eachother, then I remember the flashes of the camera.  Then that was it.  I dont remember anything after that.  But what was wierd is that I finally remembered that night three years later.  I dont know how to explain it, its like I forgot that moment it happened, then remembered it three years later.  When I was telling the story to one of my friends, they asked if I ever asked my friend and her sister about it.  I said no.  So I called my friend and I got her sister.  I asked her if she remembers that night and she said yes.  So then I asked her what happened after we saw the UFO.  She said she deosnt remember.  So couple years later I finally ask my friend.  I asked her what we did after we saw the UFO?  She said, &#34;Didnt we go outside or something?&#34;  So I dont know.  But it was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was not point on the ends but rounded off.  it floated there not making a sound.  It didn&#39;t move for a few minutes but as I started to  walk away from the object, it seemed to follow me.  I ran into the building and never told anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aftee class was over, I took the same route home but not found no object.  I thought it could have been light fixtures around the building but it followed me.  I was a 16 year old black kid living in a rough neighborhood.  I didn&#39;t report anything because I thought only white people saw things like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was silent and did not move at first.  I watched it for approximately 2 minutes then closed the door.  Several minutes later I could still see the light from the UFO shining through the windows in the top of my front door.  I opened the door and watched it again for about one minute.  My 3 year old daughter then ran up to the door asking &#34;Mommy what are you looking at&#34;.  Just then the ball of light &#34;activated&#34; (got brighter) and started moving slowly and silently over the condo complex, parallel to the ground, only about 20 yards over the tops of the condos.  It disappeared from view once it got over the woods behind the condo complex.  Saw no aliens.  Was not hurt.  Was amazed.
