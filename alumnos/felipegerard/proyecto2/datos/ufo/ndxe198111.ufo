I saw the triange 18 years ago!|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05629.html|1|ndxe198111| Corrections Officer brother and sister have seperate events. I saw the triange 18 years ago!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter Davenport, One evening between Nov. 1981 and Feb. 1982 at around 8 PM., I was driving home from work, northeast on route 94 in Vernon, NJ towards home in Warwick, NY. I saw what I thought was a 747 ahead of me to my left. It had a red and a green and a white light. I paid it little attention. As I proceeded, I saw a huge solid triangular craft through the bare trees in the sky not far above the tree line. The triangle was traveling way too slow to stay up in the sky; I’d say about 20 M.P.H. As the craft came closer (it approached at a position of about ten o’clock) each of its three corners were now illuminated with only one white light. I rolled down my window to listen because it should have been deafeningly loud at that point. As it passed overhead, I could not believe my ears - it was completely silent and there were no lights anymore, just a dark triangular shape. I had never seen anything so massive. As big as a football field was how I explained the triangle’s size to the police. The body was darker than the night sky behind it although I could not make out the craft itself. Immediately to my right was the steep incline of mountains. The craft rapidly accelerated in an upwards motion in order to clear the mountain range and lifted in a manner that I have never seen any aircraft maneuver - sort of like when you make your bed with someone and raise the sheet by all four corners quickly, then air gets trapped under it and it sort of floats down slower. My engine was still running, so I sped home where I immediately called the Vernon New Jersey Police Department. I gave them my story and asked how many others had called in, but to my amazement, he said no one else had called at that time. I never took UFOs seriously before. For years I kept this incident to myself because I had no explanation and I felt terribly alone and confused. Now, after reading Dr. J. Allen Hyneck’s NIGHT SIEGE and hearing your reports on Art Bell, I know that others have seen exactly what I had seen 18 years ago. What I found out recently, was that in 1985, my brother had also seen a UFO. I asked him to write down his experience for me. Here it is: March/April, 1985, 8-10PM Main Building, Housing Unit 9-2, Fishkill Corrections Facility, Beacon, NY As I worked one night in Housing Unit 9-2, which is a dorm-style ward, an inmate approached me at my desk and told me to look out the window facing one of the facility’s exercise yards. The window was open except for the bars. Directly over the yard and approximately 100-150 yards in the air I saw what appeared to be a circle of bright white lights which illuminated the yard below. As I watched for nearly 3-5 minutes, the circle of lights remained motionless and completely void of any noise. Eventually, the circle of lights began to move slowly over the unit in a northerly direction. It was then that I went into the hallway outside of the unit and watched there from one of the windows as the circle of lights moved slowly towards and eventually over Interstate 84. During this time trucks and cars traveling on Interstate 84 either slowed to a crawl or stopped altogether to watch as the lights passed overhead. When the other C.O.s and I questioned our supervisors about this, we were informed that what we saw was a group of planes out of Stewart Air Force Base flying in close formation.<n>

My husband was asleep beside me and I couldn&#39;t move to wake him.  The figure pointed toward the living room and I knew he wanted me to go there, but I was too frightened.  I remember shaking my head &#34;no&#34; and he shook his finger in the direction of the living room again as if demanding me to get up and go in there.  I looked away and then looked back.  He was still there.  He was wearing a cloak with a hood over his head, but I could see his eyes...they were the biggest eyes I&#39;d ever seen.  I kept watching him.  The cloak changed colors and he vanished.  I laid there awake worrying about my children across the hall, but I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  It seemed as if only a few minutes passed before it was morning, although I had not slept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I did not report this for three reasons: I did not know where to report it to, he does not believe in UFO&#39;s, I did not want to sound nuts.  There was an article in a local free paper.  I remember incidents reported in the park when I was younger.  Hence this report<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/25/81 22:00|Stowe|VT|Rectangle||While snow plowing down a mt .rd. my truck lost power and lights and  Isaw two long objects with litup windows at tree top level.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67641.html|4|ndxe198111| While snow plowing down a mt .rd. my truck lost power and lights and  Isaw two long objects with litup windows at tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working at a resort as the maintenence manager. During the winter my family and I would sometimes stay in a vacant three bedroom condo at the resort.It had been snowing a couple of days and it was one of my jobs to keep the road and parking lot clear of snow. MY WIFES Godmother and family was visiting from New York City and we were going to have Thinksgiving at the resort. The night befor Thanksgiving I was plowing snow so guest could make it up the steep mt road to the resort.My wifes Godmothers son was with me in the truck. As we were heading down the mt the truck suddenly shut off. We had no lights or power at all. So we got out of the truck and started back up the mt to the resort. Just as we started to walk up the mt we saw lights that looked like a large lowing flying airplane. It was so low we could see the wimdows and what looked like people looking out. Right behind it was another one. My first thought was two airplanes were in trouble. I remember them being very long with maybe a doz. windows. But I did not see wings. There was no sound and the air seemed to have electricity in it. There is a small airport near Stowe but it could not handle anything that big I was thinking. After the two objects were no longer in site we continuied to walk up the hill to the resort. Befor arriving we met my boss driving who can looking for us. We drove back to where we left the truck and found it with the lights on and the truck started up. I told my boss what had happened but I don&#39;t know if he belived me or not so I didn&#39;t talk about it again. We did tell our family but did not get to much in to it until I started to here other stories years later that sounded like mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

11/25/81 22:00|Angleton & Pearland (between)|TX|Sphere|10 minutes|Driving to Galveston @ 10 p.m. Nov. of `81, I saw 100s of saucers, got out of car and pointed upwards but 3 other cars wouldn't stop.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68220.html|5|ndxe198111| Driving to Galveston @ 10 p.m. Nov. of `81, I saw 100s of saucers, got out of car and pointed upwards but 3 other cars wouldn&#39;t stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know someone in one of the other three cars driving behind me on that deserted highway that October or November night between 10 and 11 p.m. in either 1980 or 1981 would remember me getting out of my 1969 yellow Toyota Corolla and pointing up to the spacecrafts, if they were one of the people in one of the other cars that were driving behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 6&#39;5&#34; and at that time I weighed about 185 pounds, with 70s-style brown hair so I know I must have looked really skinny then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading south on Highway 288, I believe, but as I said, I was lost so it could have been on another south bound deserted stretch of freeway on my way to where I lived in Lake Jackson, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three other cars driving behind me when I came upon the sighting and this is what I saw:  I saw hundreds of sphere or saucer-shaped spacecraft soundlessly landing and taking off in the vacant field or pasture along the freeway. There could easily have been 1,000 of these flying saucers. They had lights in the middle bottom part of them and this &#34;light&#34; is what seemed to propel the crafts. They landed three-at-a-time and the moment they landed, three others would launch. They seemed to hover momentarily, then in a beam of light, they would be gone, straight up and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the other cars traveling behind me, I knew that I was not the only one who had witnessed this hard to believe sight so I pulled to the shoulder of the highway, exited my car and began walking toward the oncoming cars. I waved and pointed upwards in hopes that someone might have a camera to document the incident. It surprised me when the driver of the first vehicle accelerated and kept going. Soon the second and third vehicle basically did the same thing, leaving me there alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, one of the smaller saucer-shaped spacecrafts traveled directly toward me, stopping almost overhead, hovering without sound above me. If I could have picked up a rock and thrown it, I know that I could have hit it but it never crossed my mind at the time. There was a noticeably lit dome on the top of the craft which was opaque so I couldn&#39;t see into it. I had the distinct feeling that I was being confronted and fear overcame me. I ran to my car, jumped into the driver&#39;s seat and with seconds feeling like an eternity, I turned the key.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The engine strained and I thought I was doomed but soon, miraculously my car started. I threw the car into gear, floored it and never looked back, however, it seemed to me that I drove away in extra slow motion as the car strained but seemed to continuously pick up speed. It was still dark when I sped away however, looking back on it all now, it seems that I somehow lost several hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember arriving home around daylight the next morning and my wife accused me of being out all night, drinking with the guys. I remember that she had said I was &#34;a day late,&#34; but at that time I just shrugged it off and was just so relieved to be home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2005 I was diagnosed with an AVM in the left lobe of my brain. I have never considered that I could have been &#34;abducted&#34; that night, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that I actually saw what I saw. I am positive the other people in the cars behind me saw the incident as well, however they did not stop as I had expected they would. It upset me that nobody stopped to talk about it with me, but now I realize that they were probably just extremely scared, exactly as I was the moment I realized I was alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t talked about this incident to too many people. I probably wouldn&#39;t believe the story, myself, had I not experienced it first hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often thought about that incident and have wondered who the people in those other three cars could have been so I Googled `UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981. Anyone remember this?&#39; and I saw the story of the guy who said he could see in his peripheral vision that the other driver was pointing upwards. The question I have for that reportee, is, &#34;Was this other driver a tall, skinny guy standing outside of a yellow 1969 Toyota Corolla?&#34; If the answer is yes, then my question is, `Hey buddy, why didn&#39;t you stop? Do you know I could have been killed, or worse yet, abducted?&#39;  The people in those three cars probably thought I was crazy, but I honestly thought they&#39;d stop, otherwise I would have probably never gotten out of my car. If I would have known they were going to leave me standing there, I would have stayed in the car, too, then floored it and left, but being the social type . . .. I have to say that as I stood on that dark, deserted freeway late that night, that was one time that I wished I hadn&#39;t been as tall as I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My current wife said that in about 1973 or 1974, after a Friday night visit in the wee hours of the next morning, she and her family were walking some (visiting Channelview, Texas) neighbors out to their car in Sheldon Woods, north east of Houston, Texas. She said that as a group, four grown adults, a 13-year-old boy (my wife&#39;s brother) a 12-year-old girl (my wife) and a 9-year-old girl (my wife&#39;s little sister) witnessed, slowly traveling north over the housetops of the houses in that neighborhood, a huge, though silent, 400 to 500 feet-long rectangle-shaped spacecraft with lights all over it that seemed to be actively surveying the quiet neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although as a group, they all just stood and stared up at the hard to describe spacecraft, my wife, her little sister and her parents remember the incident but her brother and the other two adults profess that they don&#39;t remember the incident. In fact, they never discussed it until recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife joked that her big brother and the two visiting adults must have been abducted therefore they probably don&#39;t remember. She is kidding, of course, but entertaining the thought that I could have been abducted that night in October or November of 1981 (and it could have been 1980) is actually not an entertaining thought. I&#39;d be interested in reading what others may have to say about what the chances are that I could have actually been &#34;abducted,” and if AVMs are associated with this type of scenario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say that at times I have had an extremely difficult life with more than a normal person&#39;s share of trials and tribulations. I have always said that most of the difficulty I&#39;ve experienced has been from the unwise decisions I&#39;ve made, so it would be comforting to learn that it was never me, but the ALIENS, all along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seriously, despite the health problems and other difficulties I&#39;ve had, I&#39;ve now got my life headed in a direction that I&#39;m content with. After making two incompatible choices for marriage partners, I was blessed with six beautiful children so I am thankful for these women for that. I finally married my high school sweetheart, (who has six children of her own, making it a dozen for us altogether.) She happens to be a professional writer and helped me put this hard-to-believe actual U.F.O. sighting into a flowing, readable story so I truly thank her for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you were one of the people in one of the three cars behind me, then it would be great to have someone validate my story, and if you feel like I have felt all these years, have me validate your story, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most people report seeing one strange U.F.O. or experience, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone else ever seeing this many U.F.O.&#39;s in one sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I then saw a blue line in the sky, on a cloudless night.  I ran upstairs to get my father. Looking out the window, we told my mother to go get the bonculars.  While she was gone, the blue line in the sky, was now starting to arc flashes of white light coming from the blue line.  There was smoke coming from the blue line, as the smoke thicken, the craft appeared, motionless almost squared in shape with a round white top, this craft had serveral landing gears all around the object.  In size comparson, I would say that it was like a delivery van.  As this craft was sitting motionless in the sky, a smaller craft appeared caddy corner, which could have not been more that 20 to 30 feet from the first craft.  This one had no light, and was about the size of a car.  As the smoke disapated, the crafts were gone.  There was abosolutly no sound, this all happen before my mother could get back with the boncluers from the living room.  No one from our town reported any strange sightings, however there were two sightings from the next town over, Montera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/21/81 21:30|Delmar|DE|Light|5 minutes|My sister and I witnessed six bright red lights shooting green lights up at six blue lights that were positioned directly above.e|9/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31241.html|7|ndxe198111| My sister and I witnessed six bright red lights shooting green lights up at six blue lights that were positioned directly above.e<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date and time I entered is very approximate, but the experience is forever etched in my mind! My sister had and I had just left a toy auction in the tiny Delaware town of Delmar and were heading north on Alt. Route 13 toward Laurel (DE). As I was driving, I looked up at the sky and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. There were six bright blue lights evenly spaced across the sky. Directly below the blue lights in the same perfect straight formation were six red lights. Needless to say, I called for my sister to look up. At that moment, the six red lights shot green lights up at the blue lights in perfect synchronization. We were speechless, and I know our mouths were hanging wide open! Then, just as quickly as they seemed to have appeared, the lights disappeared from view. When I got home, I called the DE State Police. Whoever answered the phone seemed agitated that I had called, but did tell me that a jet had been sent from Dover Air Force Base to investigate, and that there had been no word as yet as to what - if anything - had been discovered (Obviously others had seen what we had!). I never heard another word about the event, and my sister and I rarely talk about it!?. NOTE: (1) The lights were the three colors described, but the red and blue lights could have been reversed, (2) I have experienced other sightings, one several years earlier was even more profound than this one. I&#39;ll report on it at a later date. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/20/81 20:00|Broken Arrow|OK|Oval|5 minutes|Large craft hovering within 75 feet of us, emitted glowing ball before taking off at amazing speed!|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54997.html|8|ndxe198111| Large craft hovering within 75 feet of us, emitted glowing ball before taking off at amazing speed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were walking home on a new street built through a dark field between two new subdivisions.  The stars were very visible, so we were looking at them when we noticed a brighter one, very visible, that seemed to be moving in a linear fashion.  It could have been something very normal, but as we watched, a smaller light seemed to emerge from the brighter light, flying straight down from it, then turning at a right angle to continue flying. We thought this was pretty strange, but what happened next still frightens me! My friend yelled at me to turn and look behind us.  We couldn’t believe it, but there was some sort of flat-bottomed craft hovering maybe 30 feet or so above a telephone pole that was about 50 feet away from us!  I remember that it was hovering at just about double the height of the pole.  It was so close that we felt that it must be observing us, since we were the only people out in the deserted field at this hour.  We ducked into the low underbrush beside the street for cover and continued to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It surprised me that it was not brightly lit, although it seemed that some sort of soft light might have been coming from the top of the craft, because I could make out the outline of the craft in the dark sky.  It seemed to be a little more that 25 to 30 feet in diameter, which was easy to estimate, given its proximity to both of us and also to the telephone pole.  It had a somewhat oval shape, not quite round.  The lights from our subdivision illuminated the bottom of the craft well enough for me to just make out some sort of protruding cube-like structures on the bottom of the craft, and possibly something that looked like ductwork.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I realized that the texture of the bottom resembled the flat top of an apartment building, turned upside down. It hovered for quite some time, and it did have a sort of windy, whistling hum to it, but no engine sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We really felt threatened, or at least observed, and continued to hide and decide what we should do, feeling quite panicky. We were frantically taking notes together, blurting out the things that we noticed, confirming that it was really happening.  Finally, the craft started slowly moving at the same low altitude to the east, toward the subdivision where we both lived.  We then felt brave enough to stand up, out of the brush, and follow it on foot, since it seemed to be departing.  We followed for a few seconds, then suddenly it zoomed off at incredible speed, disappearing to the east.  All of this with no increased noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend told me to look to our right just as it left, and we both saw a glowing greenish ball of light, electrical looking, float gently to the ground and disappear just a few feet away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand why people would be skeptical about many of the sightings reported, but obviously, they have never seen this type of craft at such close range.  It did not behave in any fashion according to the technology that we had in 1981, or even still.  And the other craft, further out in the night sky, were also unexplainable. And then there’s that glowing ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both very intelligent honor roll students in the 10th grade at the time, and very credible people who just happened to be in the right (or wrong) place at the right time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

11/20/81 19:00|Sherwood|OR|Other|5 min|I looked up in the sky, and right above me, about the height you'd see a landing airplane if you were near an airport, were two flying|1/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11432.html|9|ndxe198111| I looked up in the sky, and right above me, about the height you&#39;d see a landing airplane if you were near an airport, were two flying wing-type craft.  Both flew north and disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look up into the sky quite often, anytime I hear a flying object in the vicinty, be it man-made or animal, or anytime I wish to take pictures, look up at the stars, the cloud formations or the local weather, especially thunder and lightning storms.  Rarely do I see some unusual natural phenomenon.  I have seen plenty of those high, distant lights that move acros the night sky, many repeatedly stopping, then starting again in a different direction.  Satellites or what?  I have also seen how people can mistake a common airplane for a UFO with certain angles and lighting and I believe I would be able take a photograph of said object and presto! a UFO.  I&#39;ve even considered writing a book about how to fake UFO photographs with everyday objects. So then, there I was standing in my front yard, facing north.  It was dark and somewhat cloudy.  I look up and lo and behold, straight above me are two flying wing-type craft, flying close together like two fighter planes in close formation, one slightly ahead of the other, below the clouds.  The one ahead was to the east.  They made no noise and left no trail.  Judging by the size and speed I&#39;ve seen of landing jetliners, they appeared to be of the same height and size and traveling at the same speed.  Are there places a jetliner could land so near Sherwood Or.?  Mainly what I could see of them were their lights.  The lights were in the same formation and color (white) as the string of lights on a jetliner, I believe on the bottom, back edge of the wings.  But there was one difference, these objects had NO blinking lights.  As I watched them they slowly flew north and the one to the west, which was slightly behind the other, moved slightly ahead, about as much ahead as the other was before.  I still heard no sound and saw no blinking lights.  They disappeared into the cloud cover.  If I stretched my arm out above me and measured hand-width from where I first saw them and where they went into the clouds, it would be about  two-and-a-half to three hand-widths.<n>
11/11/81 03:00|Plum Grove|TX|Circle|unknown|Apparently obvious craft hovering without making a sound|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39404.html|10|ndxe198111| Apparently obvious craft hovering without making a sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im only reporting this now becuase im no longer worried about it.It&#39;s been long enough nobody would remember the incident other than me anyways.I got up to use the bathroom,went back to goto bed and looked out window. Made mental notes of the weather and temprature in order to get an idea what conditions would be like for the weekend.Off to the west i noticed what appeared to be military craft of some sort doing manuevers.After watching for about 3 minutes i noticed there was no way any known craft could make that kind of speed from dead stops and those tyes of angles being flown.I decided it wasnt worth wondering about any longer because i had to get up in a couple of hours to go to work.I went and layed down and went over the weather conditions in my head.I noticed that it also appeared to be a full moon and was attempting to remember the last full moon in order to figure out if it was on the incrrease or the decrease. then i remembered that me and a hunting buddy had a full moon out the previous weekend when we were night hunting. Didnt make sense so i got back up and put my face against the screen to get a better look.I could make out one full globe with a dull shine and the edges of two more in a triangular position. At first i was thinking it was a big weather ballon and it was descending over head. This thrilled me to death and i was hoping to get to see what type of gadgets they used for collecting data and reporting a downed balloon.Looking more careful i noticed that it didnt move at all and there was an outer &#34;rim&#34; this was all one object! A true sense of reality clicked in.This wasnt lil green men! This had to be a military craft with &#34;silent propulsion&#34; it was real! I was standing there looking at it! Then i was terrified, it hadnt moved and any technology of that scope would also be able to know i was standing in my bedroom observing as well. I slowly went back to my bed, looked at my wife and began to pray for our lives. I never told anyone for years other than my wife the followng day. She just glared at me and thought i had a dream. I didnt argue the idea. I didnt want anyone to know... god forbid if i saw something i wasnt sposed to.Amazingly it was probably a few years later that UFOs were big TV stuff and there was also a report of a lady,daughter and her mother in a car out on Dayton hiway in Liberty county a9around the same time i think i saw what i did) who was exposed to hi radiation and had burns to prove it.They swore they saw military heliocopters around this thing. It even bleached the road where it had crossed!!! I knew then that i had did the right thing by not reportiing it or making it into a big deal Or going outside to take pictures or signal the stupid thing to hover down and pick me up! I never made jokes about UFOs again and I never wish to see another one.I do know it was real and im totally convinced it was military. We didnt live but approx. 40 miles from a major airport.Theres no way someone couldnt see these things.This may sound stupid or made up or who knows. After this long a dont really care. BUT! if someone else was around where I lived at that time and saw the same thing, maybe it would help put there mind at ease they werent alone and they didnt imagine it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  With permission of the witness, we will forward this case to John Schuessler, International Director of the Mutual UFO Network, who has written the definitive work on the Cash-Landrum case from Dayton, TX, which occurred on the night of December 29, 1980, and which is alluded to above.

It was approching dusk but there was a lamp post approx 40&#39; south.I looked upward at the edge of the buildig and noticed somthing moving at the edge.Suddendly I saw what appeared to be a small-15&#39;x4&#39;wx3&#39;body h x 6&#39;fin-boat shaped object approx 25&#39; at a 70 degree angle to me. The object was silvery with a soft orange tint-it made no noise-had a slight glow-the sides of the &#39;&#39;boat&#39;&#39; were angular like a boxy rowboat,with a box type double segmated ridge around the center.A large fin double was on the rear of the craft- it hovered in place for approx. 10 sec.-when suddendly a second craft dropped to its right side-this was the second &#39;fin&#39;-they hovered side to side for approx 1 min--they were so close I could have litterly hit them with a rock-I went into a state of nervous,elated shock-mostly with the realization that I was actully haveing this experience-I had a strange mixturs of emotions- a blend of joyus fight or flight urges-I wished to go with them but I was nervous that they might actully comply with my thoughts- after hover-they suddendly took off-traveling at a high rate of speed,banking up and around the side of a ten story building westward- within 20-30 seconds they were over the Golden Gate Bridge-appearing as two orange lights.-This is my only experience I can swear too as being an actual ufo sighting-but I was so close-that I am 100% convinced that they were exactly what I claim them to be.<n>

I just found this site and decided to relay information on what I saw this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I have forgotten the exact date, but it&#39;s as close as I remember it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad was diagnosed with cancer just a couple of days before this and was a patient at what was then St. Elizabeth&#39;s Hospital (I believe on South 70th St.).   My husband and I lived in South Lincoln South of Old Cheney Road between 27th &amp; 40th St.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving home from the hospital we saw what looked like a monstrous round spaceship.  I actually feel silly putting this into writing, as most everyone I know would write me off a kook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spotted it about 5,000 - 8,000 feet up in the air over South Lincoln near 48th St.  It was in the air long enough for us to come home and watch it literally &#34;hover&#34; in the air without a single sound (other than a dull hum) from the time we spotted it at approx 48th &amp; O St. to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were literally frozen.  We don&#39;t remember hearing each other talk, although I know I was speaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we asked people at work and found just one person who witnessed the same object hovering in the air that night before.  The best way to describe this object was that it was very similar in size &amp; shape as the &#34;Mother Ship&#34; in &#34;Close Encounters.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would swear under oath about this experience.<n>
