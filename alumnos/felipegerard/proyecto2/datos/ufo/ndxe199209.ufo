I was very young roughly 4-6 but I want to say 5.  This puts the time frame between 1991 and 1993.  I believe it was in the late summer months possibly early fall.  It was dark so the time would be roughly 7pm to 9pm  PST.  Couldn&#39;t be much later than that I would&#39;ve been forced into bed at  around 8:30.  Fair Oaks, CA.  Roughly 15-20 miles east of Sacramento.  Within 1/2 mile of the American River.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent.  It was moving slow and seemed to be only 50-100ft off the ground.  It was disc for the most part much like if you were to take two plates and stack one upside down onto the other.  It wasn&#39;t just a disc shape though.  Imagine you have the two plates again now take 3-4 small plates, saucers, stacked properly or and set the original two on top of them.  That would be pretty much to scale.  A large disc section with this lower section roughly 2/3 the diameter of the main section protruding.  This lower section is round and flat on the bottom, it has a taper to it.  Smaller at the bottom tapering to somewhat larger where it was joined with the large disc section.  All around the edge smaller bottom section were panels, each a rectangle, but only about 30 around the entire ship.  These panels ran the entire height of the lower section, the bottom had no features that I recall.  Each panel lit with each color imaginable, changing colors every second, not in some un! iform pattern, it seemed each was doing its own thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the lawn of my grandfathers house.  I believe some family members had been over that evening and they were about to leave.  There were roughly 5 of us out there.  I saw the craft, low and slow, going right down my street towards the river.  I reached out for it and started running after it as fast a small boy can.  I recall one of my sisters screaming at me to stop.  It was all so fast.  I reach out and start running, simultaneously she starts screaming, &#34;No Matthew Stop!&#34; I didn&#39;t.  I ran about 25 yards and I was keeping up with its slow pace but suddenly it sped up and I mean like snap your fingers, boom, it&#39;s gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve asked all my sisters about this incident none of them recall this ever happening, but I know at least one of them was there.  Brought it up to a few family members but I don&#39;t get taken seriously.  Guess I&#39;m crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

9/25/92 21:30|Golden Valley|MN|Flash|2.5 hours|A flashing bright, white light hovered over my neighborhood for over 2 hours.|4/1/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12429.html|3|ndxe199209| A flashing bright, white light hovered over my neighborhood for over 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in late September, 1992. The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street when I saw a bright, white flash apparently emanating from a large cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices). I think I remarked out loud, &#34;He&#39;s too low!!&#34;. He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St.Paul airport. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I&#39;d seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It appeared to come from inside the same cloud as before, although it might have been below it and in front of it, creating its own haze. Since I had sighted it from 2 different angles, I was able to mentally triangulate its location, and later used a city map left over from a Street Light Project to do the same with a ruler. This thing was located approximately over a neighbor&#39;s house or front yard across the street, not much higher than the tops of the trees - perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 times the height of the local elm trees. I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating from the south, going around in a circle. Whenever the searchlight beam aligned with the object, there would be a flash apparently in the cloud. The searchlight beam was far too high to hit the object and cause a reflection. The closest advertising searchlights (used by car dealers, etc.) would have been about a mile away since the area is entirely residential up to that point. At that distance, a searchlight beam would have been hundreds of feet high by the time it intersected my neighborhood. Why I didn&#39;t try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I&#39;ll never know. I simply stood there and thought, &#34;Isn&#39;t that interesting....&#34; - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o&#39;clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and when I came out at perhaps 11:00pm, the clouds had drifted away. But the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight!! The flash seemed to be enveloped in a haze when it occurred, but there was no visible haze in the air prior to the flash. There was also no &#34;object&#34; visible. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type), and he had never heard of anything like it either. Since that episode, I&#39;ve purchased a videocamera and a 500,000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight of my own! Maybe next time (if there IS a next time), I&#39;ll tape it!<n>

Saucer craft remained motionless in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been a long time, but it still haunts me, or intrigues me; I&#39;m not sure.  I had just picked up my ex-wife from school in Ontario, CA. An hour, or so past dusk. It had been several months since we moved from the Chino farm home we were renting, to live with my parents to save money. Something provoked me to take a detour that night, through the desolate farmroads of where we had begun our marriage.  It was a fairly clear night; a couple scattered clouds. Thinking back, the whole thing sounds staged. We saw what we thought was an eclipsed moon, at first. I only caught a glimpse, then made a right turn, but continued looking at it in the rear view mirror.  Although the light surrounding it resembled the moon&#39;s corona, it was clearly oval in shape, and some sort of craft.  I looked forward, as I was driving and there was the moon in front of us. I had to stop. I turned around, drove toward it slowly, as we approached a stop sign. Here is the corny part; just past the stop sign, there was a mid-80&#39;s sedan, stopped in the middle of the road, the interior lights on, the headlight on[I think], all four doors open, and unoccupied, apparantly.  We continued to stare at what we now clearly identified as the &#34;typical&#34; saucer shaped UFO, somewhat concerned with the empty car in front of us. The craft was extremely still, and although it&#39;s appearance was not vivid, it was well defined; that is to say, it could have been a hoax, but it was the most elaborate hoax ever.  We looked on uttering silent profanities for roughly 10 minutes, maybe 10 seconds, maybe an hour, who know&#39;s.  Then, a streak of light. Suddenly, the patch of light was visible in another location, farther away, but how much farther, I couldn&#39;t say.  In fact, I don&#39;t know if the craft, while in front of us, was 100 ft., 1000 ft., or higher in the sky.  Hoax? Goverment craft? I will never know.  But I will always know it was not an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The second sighting was in September 1992 in Western Utah.  I was traveling west on U.S. Highway 40 to Salt Lake City with a friend.  It was around 10 o&#39;clock in the evening.  It is VERY dark in this remote area of the world with no street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a very bright green light that was descending from the night sky at a very slow pace.  As I drove I was watching it for several minutes in disbelief as it silently approached the ground.  It was probably 2 to 3 miles away.  Remember, this is the American West where views can be 50 to 100 miles.  And we had unobstructed views of the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was most memorable about this sighting was the slow rate of descent.  Amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I did, I noticed 2 golden sphere shapes in the window.  At first I thought they were a reflection of the amber colored street lamps in that area.  Then I realized that they were actually outside the window, approx. 30 - 40 feet from the vehicle.  They were moving erratically, around each other almost following the car, staying about the same distance away.  I told my family to look, and they also noticed them.  I wasn&#39;t scared, however was a bit anxious, not sure why.  They followed the vehicle on the waterside (driver side) for approximately 10 minutes before they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on watch duty at that time. We were in the gulf of mexico when this orrcured. I was looking east and I saw 4 black craft coming out of the ocean.The only thing I herd was the sound of the water coming off of the craft.They moved very quickly. The other wittness saw this also. We both contacted the OD and he told us not to put this in our logs as this might be a black ops  base. But these craft looked like nothing I knew of at the time. At that time we knew nothing of the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter. But these craft made no noise. The looked like triangle. No visable formation lights or any kind of markings that would make them any kind of united states air craft.I herd some of the brige crew in the mess hall make the same kind of statements on seeing the craft. I ask a radar operator if he knew what it could of been. He denied seeing the craft or seeing anything odd that night. I lost contact with the other witness he was moved to another ship that was all they told me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My brother and I were people watching in the apartments around Hell&#39;s Kitchen (mid-town on west side).  The object came over the apartment building and stayed there motionless.  It clearly had no markings and was featureless except for a band of orange lights that pulsated from yellow to orange.  After hovering for nearly five minutes it began to climb until it disappeared.<n>

I was at home alone finishing dinner when I heard my pack of dogs start up|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42606.html|11|ndxe199209| On approx. September 12 of 1992 (a Monday, Tues. or Wednes.) I was at home alone finishing dinner when I heard my pack of dogs start up a chorus that means something&#39;s up that needs checking into. I walked out to the edge of my deck and looking east(and a sliver south) could see 3 small white lights in an equilateral triad configuration(somewhat obliquely presented) hovering a few degrees above the ridge of a hilltop but to my crude estimate maybe a mile or two beyond it. I said to myself &#34;I know what that is--they&#39;re back&#34;, instinctively recalling my sightings of August 29,1991(see NUFORC database). I watched this triad for about 8 seconds when it&#39;s three lights broke formation and seemed to swarm around each other like bees in approx same amount of sky. After maybe 6 seconds they reformed to original triad. Another 8 or so seconds they buzzed like bees again. And then again returned to rigid triad config. Seconds later one of these tiny lights shot forward toward my direction and in 2 seconds manifested itself as a glowing sphere of fluorescent white light I guaged to be 5 to 7&#34; in diameter positioned maybe 3 to 5 feet above the top of eastern hilltop ridge(about 1500&#39; from me) and immediately began descending said hill along a sandstone outcropping, all the while nicely illuminating the scrub oak and manzanita about 4 feet below it. I was so startled I turned around to fetch my rifle thinking some one was running down the hill with a light(tho&#39; there are no trails and it was way above the bush). I caught myself in two steps and quickly faced back to keep observing. The orb descended at about 8 to 10 mph following sandstone outcrop at an angle and then abruptly cut level to the right for 20 or 30 feet then followed another similiarly dipping sandstone outcrop for about 40 feet---lighting up tops of the scrub-brush for 25&#39; in all directions. Suddenly a smaller globe of white light came on about 2 or 3 feet below it, this one maybe 2 or 3&#34; in diameter with similiar intensity. They continued on in tandem for another 10 feet, made an abrupt leveling to right for 30feet or so and then began ascending the hill. After rising 5 feet the small orb seemed to swing as if on a pendulum maybe two swings and then blinked off. The large orb continued it&#39;s ascent to the top of the hill and then shot eastward back to rejoin original triad. From beginning to end of this &#34;probe&#34; action might have been 40 to 60 seconds. Once rejoined in the distance I watched for some 10 to 15 minutes the same bee-like/re-triad sequence. At this point I hauled my 4.5 &#34; Celestron refractor to a good spot to observe but two small white lights,one larger than the other, with the smaller one moving back and forth a couple degrees in 8 to 10 second cycles, towards and away from larger light, almost or maybe touching it on &#34;inward&#34; part of cycle. This action continued for 20 minutes or so followed by a breif re-showing of third light and then back to the two. I got bored and came in for coffee. Went back out and sure enough it was still there. I continued watching and the two lights now seemed to rise at same rate as nearby stars. I tracked this for another half -hour as the two rose several moon widths--went inside for a few minutes--came out and it was gone. Soon after, I went to bed, shaking my head, trying to sleep and wondering just what in hell I had seen. It then seemed to be a bit scary. Next morning told mother and sister of it and how it looked like triad craft I&#39;d seen a year before. It was then I realized I hadn&#39;t told even them of that earlier sighting---which is what really spooks me! My sister thinks I well could&#39;ve been abducted on first round--I have no recollection of such--but still to this day cannot explain not telling even family, til this second sighting. I conveniently procrastinated taking hike up to sandstone ridge to look for anomalies and such for atleast 4 years afterwards--and found nothing unusual ofcourse when I finally did. As said in other report, I would&#39;ve reported this sooner but just found this great website. Already have seen similiar accounts of probe-like orbs. Must say I&#39;m a true believer that &#34;they&#34; are here --seeing makes quick believing--and what I saw,-- I don&#39;t think humans have even back-engineered yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was just before dark and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband likes to view the moon through the telescope and he was not at home this evening. We were having a full moon so I thought I&#39;d set the telescope up just before it got dark so we didn&#39;t have to do it later. I set the scope up facing east and was scanning the sky for the approximate placement of the rising moon when I saw a triangular object hovering just above the tree line. It was still light enough to notice that the leaves on the oak below the craft were not moving (no displacement of air) and the craft was absolutely silent. I do not remember seeing lights. There may have been but I don&#39;t recall. The craft was no more than 100 yards in front of me, a dull almost invisible black. I could see a bulge in the center of the craft kind of like a cockpit area. It was angled towards me so I never got to see the bottom. I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculars. It was still there when I came back out. I had the distinct feeling of being watched. I held the binoculars just below my face to get a fix on the location but the instant I put the binoculars to my eyes the craft had disappeared. I can&#39;t say whether it flew away very fast or just disappeared, but it was instantaneous.  I can&#39;t say whether I lost time or not, but I can say that by the time this was over it was fully dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Saw what looked like a house window light in an area I knew there were no homes (very rural).I Slowed way down, then we realized the light was over the (Clearwater) river. At first I could see only one sq. window like light. Then it seemed as though we came around to the other side and there were three sq. lights and one round light. Like an exclamation sign on it&#39;s side. The sq lights were shaped like the legs of the &#39;Hilton H&#39; (tighter in the middle and flared at the ends). The craft (object) seemed to float (no noise heard) over the top of us-about 100 ft high..then rise over the timbered hill to to the south of our then stopped vehicle. There remained a glow of light reflecting over the top of the night horizon. After a few minutes, just &#34;a&#34; round light came over (seemd to just &#34;pop over&#34; the hill top. It halted for a short amount of seconds, then expoded with speed straight up to the &#34;heavens&#34;. It seemed like it was in outer space in just a few seconds. The color of the light faded to a white color and the path seemed to bend as though it was changing course to more westerly direction. Common sense would tell me the path was optical illusion and just &#34;bent&#34;.<n>

When I started watching it more closely i notice that it would move as a plane did, then it stopped and hovered as a dog is trying to find the right spot on its bed.  Then it started to, very quickly, shoot diagonal, up, down, and sideways again.  Then stop once again and hover.  All as the lights are going around and morphing into the next.  (I had another experience with the same kind of craft, but multiple, and a different night.  Look for another report on 10/24/11)<n>

They where sitting there motionless, Anyway, about 35 seconds later another identical saucer buzzed in out of nowhere....sat there about 10 - 15 seconds, then took off at the speed of light , maybe faster. About 2 seconds later the other 3 followed suit in the same direction. I never saw them again. I did have a large bottle cap looking ring on my right forearm for weeks following....can you tell me anything about this????<n>

As I was looking up when a large black triange-shaped craft with a yellow/white lights at each of the corners with a red pulsating light in the center of the craft.  It was flying very low, slower than most small airplanes in a northeast to southwest direction in the general path I-69 follows into Indianapolis.  As the craft flew towards Indy, I could see its silhoutte against the city lights and I saw a small red orb-like light fly up to the craft then a short time later fly back towards the ground.  At the time I didn&#39;t think too much about what I saw, but I seen the same craft that was seen in Belgium, Illinois, etc., and when I realized that others have seen this craft I knew I wasn&#39;t imagining this thing.  In my opinion, if this craft is one of ours then I believe it&#39;s some sort of low and slow stealth reconnaise craft.  This football field sized craft obviously wasn&#39;t concerned with being seen since there was probably 10,000-15,000 people at the show.  But during a loud, bright rock concert not too many people are paying attention to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
9/1/92 21:00|Streamwood|IL|Triangle|20-30 seconds|triangle pulsating ufo shot from many miles away stopped instantly,spinning and moving slowly over houses|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55102.html|19|ndxe199209| triangle pulsating ufo shot from many miles away stopped instantly,spinning and moving slowly over houses<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9pm i was leaving the locale 7-11 on my bike(pedal bike-i was 14 yrs old at the time of sighting) like i had done for several years. As i was riding down bartlett road i noticed something way off in the distance. I remember thinking it was a firework and also thinking where in that direction would be having works and for what ocasion. So i stopped by bike and waited for it explode and instead of exploding it shot within about 100 yards of me,stopped or at least started moving very slowly.I would say from the moment i noticed the object to when it stopped travled and least 20-30 miles in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  Triangle in shape,spinning/rotating slowing while still moving forward,pulsating bright white lights,approx. 8-14 bulb like lights down and maybe 16-24 across. I did not see any lights on the bottom but did notice what appeared to be a circle outline in the bottom middle of the craft. As this was happening i was looking around like out of all the times nobodys on the road,i was also looking at the townhouses across the way hoping to see somebody also looking out the window but i did not notice anyone. By this time the object was approx. within throwing distance and extremely bright,and i thinking i didnt want this thing over me. I dropped my drink that i got from 7-11 and pedaled as fast as i could to my house,ran in and tried to get the video recorder but couldnt find it. So i ran up down to the end of the block and caught a view of the craft slowing moving over the houses on the opposite side of schaumburg road. I wish i had been able to get a photo of the object and video, cause it was right there. Dont know for sure what it was or where it came from but the abilities it exhibited i know we dont poccess here. And if the excuse people use about it being a usa secret plane,then why has it not been used? Its 14 years later and we are at war,why wouldnt they use this technology?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/92 20:00|Port Elizabeth|NJ|Rectangle|15min|The Dorchester WaWa UFO|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41487.html|20|ndxe199209| The Dorchester WaWa UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> This, I will never forget. I was about 20 then. It forever changed my view of things. I can&#39;t even listen to skeptics talk, espcially the ones that say as a matter of factly &#34;there is no such thing as ufos&#34; If they only could have seen...I&#39;m not saying that there are aliens, but there are ufos for sure. After riding dirt bikes in port all day, my 2 friends (from port elizabeth) and I decided to go to Ocean city that evening. I was taken home by one of them to put my bike away and get cleaned up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were to meet back up with my other friend at the Dorchester WaWa store. All went fine and we were headed back when we noticed 2 huge bright lights in the sky. we actually joked that it looked like a giant set of (certain)car headlights. At that point we were heading south on rt 670 about 3 miles north of mauricetown. Our conversation went back to the events of the day, until we got to the mauricetown bridge. At that point we realized that the lights were still there at the same spot, we got a good, strait on view of the front(?) of this object. We judged that it was about 500 ft above the treetops, it wasn&#39;t moving, it was HUGE, and it looked like it was hovering over the WaWa, exactly where we were going. It gets better, as we decended the bridge it was a clear, strait shot to the WaWa and we kept our eyes glued to the object the whole way.  The closer we got, the more surreal the event became, almost like real life startrek or something. When we pulled in the lot we were practically histerical. The thing was so big and close, it looked like a floating city. We pulled around to the front of the building to a normal flow of WaWa patrons and realized that no one had even noticed yet. Our friend was on the payphone out front with his GF. As soon as we stopped the truck I jumped out, ran up to my friend, shook him and pointed up. He almost dropped the phone and just said OMG. Without stopping I ran into the semi crowded store and yelled &#34;hey everyone there&#39;s a ufo out here&#34; some just looked at me like I was nuts, but most people came out to look. I remember one woman screaming and jumping into her little white car and speeding off. And for about 5-10 more minutes 10-15 of us just stood there stairing strait up at this massive rectangle shaped craft. It was dark in color, grey or black with an irregular bottom and rounded or slanted corners. It sat silent and motionless, yet afterwards we all agreed that there was a vibration or hum of energy of some sort. The size was the most impressive part. I can&#39;t really say how big, but I&#39;m talking mother ship or floating city or whatever. Finally, very, very slowly it started moving west. Toward the original direction of the 2 lights (remember those) As soon the craft made it past the horizon of the stores&#39; roof we jumped back in the truck and took off in it&#39;s direction to follow it. (Ocean City was the other direction) When we pulled out it was still moving slow, visible directly out of the drivers side window. But was speeding up fast. After only 10-15 seconds it was pulling away fast and starting to incline about 20 degrees. At that point, in a clear sky, it moved away from us and strait out of sight in less than 5 seconds. You can&#39;t buy tickets to an event like this, and it opened my mind forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My folks claimed to view a disk in Millville in the 50s with a similar type of close encounter. The sightings of that time are well documented the archives here by many others. They told that story to us as kids and I always wondered. I had to believe my parents but I guess seeing is believing. After the dorchester WaWa event, I stopped wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
