We lost sight of them after they passed behind a tree. The red sphere was behind and to the left of the white one as if flying in formation. They moved from SW to NE and began flying upward just before our view was blocked by the tree. We both lost sight of them at that point.  The spheres appeared to be about twice the size of the star Betelgeuse which was visible at the time. The sky was clear. We didn’t hear any sound.<n>

As I got to my exit they were to my right side about a mile far they would move in different directions and get to ground level and go back up over and over repeating this for varoius minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could still see them when I got home as my house is right by the freeway.  They were above the freeway moving as a mentioned earlier up and down side to side.  I ran inside called my brother and he saw them too.<n>

I was headed southwest on Route 3 and was a half mile south of the Rappahannock River bridge.  It travelled at right angles to the road I was on. I would estimate its height as between two of three tree lengths above ground.  It was a 5 ft diameter reddish orange sphere coming across my field of vision.  I wished there was a place to pull over and that there wasn&#39;t oncoming traffic.  It is a two lane 55 MPH road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer I could see sparks coming off of it.  It must have impacted within a minute but I didn&#39;t see any smoke from fires - it might have gone in the river.  Two unusual things (at least to me): it seemed to move slowly for a meteor and it didn&#39;t have a steep downwards trajectory as I might have expected.  It travelled mostly horizontally. Instead of steep, I would estimate the angle of decline as 10-20 degrees away from the horizontal.  It travelled more like an airplane slowly decreasing altitude for a landing.  It did have the appearance of a fireball - perfectly spherical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to report it here but then opted for American Meteorological Society. I have a long-standing interest (40 years) in UFOs but didn&#39;t want to clutter your database with fireballs.

I walked outside to see my neighbor and her father outside looking at the lights.  I witnessed three of the lights in a triangle formation then two, then they faded out.  The lights were not blinking and were orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I call our local airport (MLI) and they had not seen or heard of any incident.<n>

About thirty seconds into our conversation three bright lights over the 60 freeway in Chino caught my attention.  At first it looked like incoming aircraft far off in the distance, because there were obvious aircraft blinking in the sky.  Suddenly two of the objects seemed to zoom straight into each other and become one object, the third object faded away when this happened.  The remaining object which at the time seemed FAR away looked like it was just hovering when all of a sudden it was right on top of me.  It did not appear to even move fast at all, if I had to explain it I would say that it defiantly was not following our laws of physics.  The object probably had just traversed at least a distance of ten miles without even appearing to move, ending up directly over the 60 freeway and my car.  I explained to my girlfriend what I was seeing and suddenly I could make the object out and it gave me goose bumps all over to say the least. I observed what looked to be a floating upside down white triangle. It almost looked like it could be a different color and the shade of white might be heat emanating from the object because there appeared to be no actual &#34;lights&#34; on it. It floated parallel to myself and the freeway for about 10 seconds, I tried to pull of the freeway but by that time it was simply gone. I have always been skeptical of ufo’s, I even believed to have seen one before when I was younger but it was so long ago even I doubt my childhood memories because all kids have a wild imagination right? What I saw tonight changed how I feel about everything, I could not have seen this ANY clearer. I was bewildered by the fact that whatever this was, it was just cruising along out in the open several hundred feet off of the ground for everyone to see.<n>

The second object again &#34;caught-up&#34; to the first.  Both flight-paths were side-by-side and looked almost like they were on &#34;rails&#34;.  This was all within a few short seconds and both objects were moving continuously fast the whole time.  Faster than a jet seen from the NE sky shortly thereafter.

It was moving very fast and it came very low. I live on a fifth floor and my balcony faces west and south west.  It was at a distance but I can see that it made contact with another object and after a minutes I saw what appears to be a missile like object propel from the ground and shoot up to the sky where it continued traveling until it disappeared into the sky….I contacted the airport and was told that there were no unidentified objects on their radar….All this activity took about 12-15 min…<n>

1/28/11 22:30|Galesburg|MI|Triangle|Two events, 3 hours apart|I saw what looked to be a nearly stationary private jet in mid-air, and an aircraft 3 hours later that I can not identify.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79869.html|24|ndxe201101| I saw what looked to be a nearly stationary private jet in mid-air, and an aircraft 3 hours later that I can not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of January 28th, 2011 and the early morning of January 29th, 2011 I and another person, my long time friend,  witnessed two events about three hours apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:30-11:10 pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving heading East out of Comstock, MI, towards Galesburg, MI when my friend and I she being the passenger, were witness to our first incident of the night. We noticed a somewhat bright light in the sky ahead of us, on the left side of the road. At first I thought it was a star, but when we got a bit closer I realized it was too big to be a star and I realized that it was not one light I was seeing but 3 lights in a triangular pattern. I also noticed a green light on the starboard wing and a red light on the port-side wing.  It looked to be a private jet, seemingly stationary at an altitude of less than 2,000 ft.  IF it was moving, (with my somewhat minimal knowledge of physics) I have no idea how that private jet was able to generate enough lift to stay airborne.  I&#39;m sure this plane was a private jet.  Both my friend and I agree that it was a private jet.  The only thing we somewhat disagree on is if the craft was actually moving very slowly, or staying completely stati! onary.  We witnessed this airplane for about 20 seconds, as I was going 55 mph (I know this also factors into whether the plane was actually stationary or not), and I sped up going East, the plane was pointed due West, to get to a gas station so I didn&#39;t run out, so we could get back.  Needless to say, when we went back, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1:52 am<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I&#39;m sure of the exact time because I had not gone to sleep and had staring at the clock intently since 1:21 am because I thought I had seen my clock malfunctioning and going backwards.  I sat up in bed in looked out my window facing due West and the only words I could mutter were, “There&#39;s a light in the sky.”  Immediately, my friend sat up as well and we gazed upon this craft heading towards us heading Northeast.  I noticed it had a green light on the starboard wing and a red light on the port-side wing. This craft as well was flying at an altitude of lower than 2,000 ft, though  higher than the jet from earlier. My friend suggested that I open the window. (Genius.)  When the craft came closer however I noticed that it was white, had very small wings, that looked to be made of a different material than the main body of the plane.  The craft had no visible means of a conventional propulsion system. That is to say that, it had no jet engines, and it had no propellers.  It made a sound, similar to a jet engine, yet more...”controlled”. The sound wasn&#39;t as abrasive as a jet engine, and much, much quieter.  The craft seemed not to be flying at the speed of sound yet my friend and I agree that the sound seemed to “hover” right behind the craft.  That is to say that it wasn&#39;t going the speed of sound, but the same sonic effect in the air.  I had my little brother ask my neighbors if they had heard a jet go over the house at 2 am.  They replied, that they had heard nothing.  I assume that if a jet was flying over a house, in a town of around 2,000 people, at such a low altitude they would hear it, needless to say, they didn&#39;t, yet we heard a distinct sound.  The craft was flat white, that is to say that whatever color was put on the material of the craft was not glossy.  It had two lights located next to the wings either side of the craft 180 degrees apart.  It was triangular in shape (to simply that it was a triangle or triangular doesn&#39;t do the c! raft justice I believe) and widened in the back, the rear extr! emity of the ship was curved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could describe in greater detail if a return call is received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much, for all your hard work.<n>

This point of light moved southerly in a straight line for approximately 5-10 degrees for a duration of 10 seconds. Its light magnitude neither increased nor decreased as it traversed and I would estimate its magnitude to be about 3. There were no aircraft strobes present on the object and it was much fainter than any aircraft I have observed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an independent contractor with an interest in astronomy and I can’t offer an explanation for what I saw.

This caused us to gaze up towards the sky  Within 5 seconds we saw what seemed like a fireball moving in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking at the object which seemed to be approximately 50 yards to our left and less than 1000 feet elevation.  The object was moving very slow and inconsistent in the direction.  It remained in our sight for about 25 seconds and then got dimmer and higher and then quickly disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter and not a normal flying aircraft because it moved so slow.  I thought I might be a parachute flare.<n>

As we approached, we saw that what we thought was one bright light was in fact 4 lights pulsing slowly- green, red &amp; white.   We assumed we were looking at a low-flying plane or helicopter, but as we got closer we could not see the body of the craft at all.   It must have been a dark color and non-reflective surface as we could not see the reflection of the lights on the surface of the object.   At our closest, the object was approximately 250 yards to the left of our vehicle, hovering 75-100 feet above an empty field.    As we passed this field, we were able to rule out a radio/cell phone tower or water tower as the source of the lights as they were very clearly hovering over the middle of the empty field.   Stunned, we turned around in a gas station parking lot to return for another look only to find that the object had completely disappeared in a matter of 30-45 seconds.<n>

I assumed that these were distant ships but it was too dark to see any ship outlines.  I then saw another light zig zag from one of the original lights to the other very quickly and erratically.  It then blinked out.<n>
1/28/11 20:45|Encinitas|CA|Triangle|20 seconds|triangle of lights fly over Swami's point in the evening|2/8/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79896.html|29|ndxe201101| triangle of lights fly over Swami&#39;s point in the evening<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up at a 45 degree angle on the stars I saw 3 moving in parallel across the sky.  They were in pretty much an equilateral  triangle shape.  It went  right over Swami’s Point surf spot paraellling the coastline which is pretty much due north.  I see many planes and choppers fly over this path at apparently the same height &amp; speed  during  the day and  at night so I know this well visually and sonically.  The height &amp; speed seemed about the same. ~100MPH about 100ft over the cliff top &amp; 100ft out from the cliff or 150ft above the ocean so the path is actually  over  the surf zone.  It was very quiet at the time and at this close distance or even if it was much further away and much larger it would be easily audible if it were a plane, or copper (there would also be running lights and the aircraft would be somewhat visible even with all lights out.  The triangle was about visually the size of my fist at full arms’ extension.  If it were 150 feet from me ! (I was about 100ft from the cliff edge) I’d guesstimate that it was roughly 50 ft on each edge of the triangle.  There were patchy clouds from the receding storm about 1,500 feet I’d guess and this thing was clearly below this.  If it was actually at 600 ft then it would be about 600 feet out from the cliff and would be dramatically larger (hundreds of feet on each side of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were quite dim, about the same as a common star with no flashing or special color (just white).  There were no other lights on it and just a very subtle darkening between the lights.  Again, it made absolutely no sound.  This object would not be easy to notice even at this close distance and if it were much higher it could fly unnoticed over anywhere.<n>

It had tiny wings on the side and two red lights and two green lights, plus the head lights.  It must have been 250 - 300 ft. in the air and about 75-100 ft. in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We panicked and ((name deleted)) slammed on the brakes and pulled into snow rd. we drove about 1/10 of a mile and got out of the car.

We had a room with a north facing balcony, overlooking Lake Michigan. On the very first night of our stay, we were enjoying a cold but beautiful view of the night sky from the balcony.  It was partly cloudy, but the stars were still quite visible.  We were looking toward the northwest when we noticed a small flash of light in the distance, right on the water.  The flash came and went, starting and stopping at random, sometimes strobing and pulsing, and sometimes staying lit for a short moment before going black again.  This continued for about five minutes before I decided to try to get it on video.  It looked like a fireball burning on the water, and I was curious as to what it could be. I was fidgeting with the camera, and tried several times to film it, but as soon as I would turn on the camera, or get it into focus, it would go black.  And as soon as I turned it off, or th! e power saving feature would shut it off, it would return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so busy trying to get the “Fireball” into focus and on tape, that I didn’t even notice what was going on in the sky just overhead. Not until I looked up at the sky for a moment, and saw three white glowing points of light, forming a triangle. I immediately put my focus on this new development, and zoomed in on what appears in the video as three lights, still in the form of a triangle, blinking green, red, and white. Standard aviation colors, I know. Still, these lights disappeared when I got a little closer with the camera, and returned several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point, my husband had already gone back inside, and I ran in, because I was frightened, as my mind tried to come up for a rational explanation of what I had just seen. I was huffing and puffing, but managed to get the story across to my husband, who wanted to see it for himself. About five minutes had passed before I initially ran in, frightened. We brought the camera along again, and headed out for the balcony. We focused on the same area of sky and waited. At first there was nothing, but after about a minute we saw it again. We got a pretty good look at it, since it wasn’t moving at all. It would occasionally disappear, and reappear, but in the same spot. We filmed it until our SD card got full, which was only about a minute more, but we got a pretty good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I filmed and photographed the same area of land and water where we had seen the U.F.O, and there was nothing higher than the tree line. So this could not have been a tower, or house, or anything stationary, even though it stayed in the same exact spot both times we filmed it, and was there for at least twenty minutes, until we went back in. The temp that night was in the single digits, so it outlasted us. I really don’t know how long it actually stayed there before it left, but whatever it was doing, it took it’s time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also after I noticed the U.F.O. in the sky, the “Fireball” in the water never came back, at least not while I was filming. The two combined events were just too much to ignore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading!<n>

What caught my attention were the round flashing lights around the perimeter.  It was flying behind the tall trees.  It was silent in its movement, moving in the direction North/Northeast.  It was flying parallel to the ground approximately midway between the height of the trees. I ran to the next open space between the trees to get another look, but the object was no longer in sight.  It had left the area almost instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When small or large airplanes fly over this area at a much higher altitude, the noise can be heard.  This flying object was silent.

At first I thought they may be towers, but as time progressed and I continued travelling, I noticed that the formation maintained perspective relative to my vehicle, and continued to do so throughout the two segments of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first segment of the event, the lights appeared to be fixed horizontally with respect to each other, and were constant in shape, size, intensity and color (dark yellow, almost orange, plasma-like glow appearance).  There were no beacons, landing lights, nav lights, running lights, or similar usual secondary emmiters observed which are typical for most aircraft observed in US airspace.  The angle separation between the two lights from my perspective was perhaps 5 degrees, and did.   The pair of lights continued to track me in perspective for several minutes.  After several minutes, a third light slowly turned on (time constant of several seconds from dark to full brightness), to the right of the formation of two lights (the geometry of which was still unchanged relative to my moving vehicle).  The third light was perhaps separated by 10 degrees angle from the other two, and slightly less luminant (but similar in color and shape).  It stayed on for ~30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I began to reach for my Motorola Droid so I could snap a photo.  When I did this, the lights all went out, so I left the phone alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 seconds after this (~5 minutes into the event), the two lights came on again, at a similar azimuth relative to myself (my ~10 oclock), but this time much closer in appearance (perhaps 1km distant), and higher in elevation (~45 degrees).  I am still travelling I-8 at this on a roughly constant azimuth of ~260 degrees true at 80 mph.  The relative geometry of the two lights is slightly different, appearing now with a slight slope (~10 degrees) downward from left to right.  The two lights have a distict plasma-like appearance, and I could see what appeared to be a thin almost smoke-like trail above each light, illuminated by the glow.  I thought at this point briefly that they might be flares or incendiary parachute rounds (having seen such rounds shot at Yuma myself), but neither would explain the unchanging perspective and movement over such a duration of time.  Then, the third light turned back on again, this time to the left of the formation of two lights. ! It appeared at one point to rotate about its vertical axis, as the light diminished and was occluded partially by whatever structure was with it, and then became full again.  I could not discern structures on either object (my instinct tells me there were two objects, as opposed to three that three lights might suggest...the two larger lights being member to a single object), as it was a very dark night, and the moon had not yet risen...00:54 rise time, half moon for that date.  I scanned through the FM band on my radio while observing, and found no unusual signal.  The third light eventually went out again (~ 1 minute later), and the two lights remained, and continued to track perspective for several more minutes.  By this time I had probably travelled ~15-20 miles from Gila Bend.  There were no vehicles near me travelling in my direction, but there were other vehicles travelling east bound that would have noticed the phenomonae, if possible to view from their perspective! (probably unlikely though, as the relative angle would be ~4 ! oclock t o an east bound driver).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights suddenly went out.  I continued to observe in their direction, and noticed in the far distance (not close, 10 – 20km distant) two flashing aircraft beacons (one following the other, moving fast, changing perspective).  They appeared to travel towards me (north), and then turned west-ward and flew back south again, receding into the distance.  This seems to me to have been an attempted (and failed) intercept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the event concluded, I noticed that the formation had been flying roughly in front of the very bright southern star Canopus, and serves as a good indication of the constant true azimuth of the formation as seen from the I-8 interstate relative to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a pilot myself, this whole event intrigued me very much, as I have never seen anything like it.  I have done a lot of work on many military bases around the country, live near Davis Monthan AFB, and hence have seen a large variety of aircraft and munitions in both night and day.  I have never seen anything like this.  The only possible conventional explanation I can dream up to explain the phenomenae is perhaps two slow flying aircraft (helicopters or light prop aircraft perhaps, that could cruise at 80 – 100 knots) that could hang a flare from their aircraft, turn off all running lights, and fly formation along the interstate for the entire distance, maintaining near perfect perspective to me, with a third aircraft moving relative to the two, dragging a third less intense shorter duration flare.  This seems outlandish.<n>

I took my flashlight and my dog to look around; not seeing anything I stayed out in the cold fresh air for a bit, looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:40pm I heard the unmistakable deep rumble of the same craft that visited my town last year at almost the exact same day and time.  I kept looking up until I spotted this single pulsating red light flying SE to NW, which is opposite the flight pattern of planes flying into the airport.  This direction is the same flight direction these craft took last year, but last year they flew just over the roof tops of houses where I did at that time get a good look at them...they were NOT conventional jets.  The craft I saw tonight, with the same deep rumble/roar, much louder than a conventional jet, were merely a red pulsing light each.  The first craft, flying at about 10,000 feet I would guess, flew at about the same speed as a jet!   However, there was no conventional flying lights, just the single pulsing red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first went over, about 4 minutes later, two more came over, flying at the same speed and altitude and direction as the first, one in back of the other, with the same deep rumbling roar.  The loud roar lasted well after the craft had flown over my house and headed NW.  These were NOT conventional jets, in spite of the cover story on local TV news last year to quell the public&#39;s alarm.  They were not F-16s as reported.  Even the news man reporting was noticeably nervous and quick in his dialogue when reporting live on Channel 10 TV last year.  Obviously, somebody told whoever or whatever is flying these things to stay higher up in the sky and not do acrobatic moves a few hundred feet over peoples&#39; houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wondering if anyone else has seen these things....very weird, I&#39;d say.<n>

The sky was cloudless, but there was haze or smog which was reflecting the city streetlights, making it rather bright.  The stars were visible, notably Orion, which I was looking at while facing East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1911 hours I noticed movement to the left in my peripheral vision.  I was surprised to see a pitch black object moving swiftly from North to South across my field of vision, passing just below the constellation Orion.  While the object was directly in front of me it appeared as an isosceles triangle, the length being approximately twice the width, with the point at the front.  It was angled slightly away from me, consistent with the object&#39;s &#34;wingspan&#34; being parallel to the ground and me observing it from underneath from the West.  The object disappeared quickly into the haze as it departed to the South. I estimate the duration of the sighting as 1, not more than 2 seconds.  There were no lights on the object, it was completely black against the slightly orange cast of the sky.  The edges seemed very sharp while it was directly in front of me, but it was more vague as it approached and departed.  There were numerous airliners and general aviation aircraft visible at the time which were clearly audible.  I heard no sound that could be attributed to the passing of the object.  I estimate the object was considerably lower than the airliners I could see which were on final approach to Orange County and LAX.<n>

There were 2 lights in the sky about the size of a spotlight.  There was a third light that was very faint.  The light closest to me became smaller then headed south.  The second light after about 5 minutes also became smaller and followed the 1st light.  The 3rd light remained faint.  When the first light headed south it appeared to be in a cheveron shape and black.<n>
1/25/11 17:00|San Ramon|CA|Light|15 min|Three bright objects seen over the San Ramon/Dublin/Pleasanton/Livermore, CA sky.|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81741.html|53|ndxe201101| Three bright objects seen over the San Ramon/Dublin/Pleasanton/Livermore, CA sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking Southbound on the Iron Horse Trail in San Ramon, CA around 5pm on January 25, 2011, when I noticed three low-flying bright white objects traveling from East to West across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared as if they were traveling West from the general direction of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The objects moved at a slow-to-fast pace, often at a drift much slower than airplane/helicopter traffic that is regularly seen in this area.  The shape of the light was elliptical in nature, but it was so bright that it was difficult to see the object edges.  For that reason, it is difficult to make a solid judgement regarding the final shape of the object.  I will say that they appeared to be more oblong/disc-shaped, but at some points they appeared more circular and symmetrical as they moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun had already dropped from view, so the objects really stood out across the colored sky.  I stood and watched for 15 minutes as they headed across a flight path that appeared to parallel the path of the 580 freeway going from East to West towards the Oakland/San Francisco area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three objects total. Regarding the flight path and group formation of the objects, I am going to describe this in terms of a grid, from my standpoint on the trail at the time of the sighting.  I work in the technology field, so I&#39;m going to describe it as if I was looking at grid on a horizontal/vertical x/y axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Think of this as if you were looking at the latitude and longitude lines on a map.  That should help with envisioning the explanation, as this is a difficult thing for me to describe otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that in mind, it appeared that each of the objects was flying on a fixed path, parallel with the ground.  Each of the three objects was at a different elevation, but it appeared that each of them stayed on a solid path that appeared to run parallel with the natural curve of the Earth&#39;s surface.  To the naked eye, and given the short distance in which the objects traveled and eventually disappeared in, it appeared as if the objects didn&#39;t adjust vertical elevation at all at any point during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While they each stayed on a consistent and steady horizontal flight path, the group formation and speed of the objects appeared more inconsistent. At first, all three objects flew in a tight equilateral triangular formation.  As the objects moved across the sky, they would independently change speed, eventually flying in a formation that more represented an isosceles triangle, then a scalene triangle, and then eventually back to an isosceles triangle formation.  Each object appeared to be at a different elevation, with the elevation differences between each object appearing to be equal to the naked eye.  The speed varied during the sighting, with each accelerating and decelerating independently at speeds slower than typical air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are 3 major airports (SFO, OAK and San Jose Airport) and many smaller airports (Livermore, Buchanan, Napa) and Travis AFB within a 65 mile radius of the sighting, so we regularly see all forms of air traffic.  These objects flew at varying rates of slow speed that aren&#39;t typical of any of the regular air traffic.  In addition, these objects had no FAA colored lights that are typically seen on regular air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I decided to post this nearly six months after the original date of the sighting was that I had stumbled across similar sightings online, and I decided that it would be helpful to document the sighting since it was so similar to others I had seen in California.  I also was able to capture an image on my cell phone of 2 of the 3 objects.  Unfortunately, the 3rd object was hidden behind a large power line pole, so it&#39;s not visible in the photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is in technology and design, and in my career I&#39;ve also done a lot of work in photography and video.  What stood out to me here was the brightness of the objects, and how I was unable to distinguish the hard lines that would typically be seen around an object.  At sunset/dusk, any object in the sky is going to be backlit by the sun descending down the horizon line.  This means that the edges of that backlit object should be clearly visible.  The brightness of the objects, combined with the fact that there weren&#39;t visible edges, leads me to believe that these objects were radiating a large amount of light on their own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of my roughly 15 minute observation, the objects disappeared from the sky.  It was as sudden as someone flipping a light switch.  There was no fading, or change in color or brightness of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These could be government aircraft from a project at the Lawrence Livermore Labs, but they might not be either.  I guess that&#39;s why I posted the sighting here, because over the last six months there hasn&#39;t been a day that has gone by where I haven&#39;t looked up at the sky on a clear day in hope of seeing this again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a skeptic at heart, but I know what I saw that day was unlike anything I&#39;d seen before.<n>

It moved at a very fast speed I would considering the distance it covered in the short time it was illuminated, it covered at least 60-90 degrees of the sky in a matter of 5s and like going behind an invisible wall it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I will consider that its relative traveling direction was E-SEish from my apartment complex where in relation to an airport just south of me does have heavy air traffic, however having seen hundreds of planes in the night sky travel over my head this was not the normal.  On the contrary no plane at night turns their lights off especially on approach to land.  Besides every plane makes a noise and this was silent making no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having witnessed multiple &#34;shooting stars&#34; I can also say that this was definitely not that either.  It was simply too bright, in my example its as if the lights just went out, like turning a light bulb off w/o the afterglow effect, or nothing like the dwindling light of a &#34;shooting star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

1/24/11 17:30|Lancaster|CA|Unknown|10 minutes|3 amber/orange lights with loud rumble sound move through Lancaster CA|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79820.html|57|ndxe201101| 3 amber/orange lights with loud rumble sound move through Lancaster CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 1730, 24 Jan 2011 I witnessed what I believe to be a UFO.  I am a Jet Engine Mechanic/Aircraft Supervisor.  I have been in the trade for 12 years.  I’ve worked 15 different model/makes of engines on over 20 different aircraft platforms.  I’ve grown up in a family of aviators.  I have lived in houses since my teens directly in conventional aircraft flight patterns.  I know what an airplane, jet, or turboprop sounds, and more importantly looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1730 on the 24th of January 2011 I was standing on my back patio grilling pork chops.  The sky was clear.  The sun was just starting to go down.  We still had blue skies when I began to hear a very deep rumble of a jet engine.  C-130 aircraft are commonly flying over head so it was refreshing to hear a jet engine.  I have watched hundreds of aircraft take off from the EOR (End of Runway).  When I casually looked up curious as to what was there, I did a double take because I didn’t see anything?  I remember asking myself where is it.  It’s not that high based on the clarity of the sound.  I know how the sound of jets can creep up on you when they’re in the air, and by the time you hear it it’s gone.  This was right above me.  After about ten seconds of looking, suddenly right above me, two very bright amber/orange lights came on.  They were easily a few hundred yards apart.  I know what an afterburner (ab) looks like when lit and these were not afterburners, and there! was no sound progression to go with the transition from mil power to ab.  As I watched this slowly move north toward Rosamond CA a third light directly in between, but slightly forward of the two came on, and it was amber as well.  This made a slight triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew what I was watching was something different so I called for my wife who was in the house to come look.  The craft was no longer directly over head as it was moving away from us.  She wondered what it was and referred to the formation of lights as Orion’s Belt.  That’s about the right description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting for some movement vertical or horizontal showing separation, but nothing occurred.  Then each light began going off to the point all three lights were gone at one time, and the sound was still there.  Then one by one each light came back on and then in between the left and center lights two very fast silver lights flashed two or three times and went away.  To me they resembled a light showing formation of the aircraft.  It was too far away to tell if it silhouetted the craft.  From my perspective they were just between the center and left light.  They never came back on while the three amber lights remained visible.  All together I watched this craft move maybe 20 miles in about 10 min until I lost sight due to my neighbor’s house obstructing it.  I will say during the entire ordeal even after losing sight the sound remained constant.  It was a very deep rumble.  It moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a newly built residential neighborhood that doesn’t have a single tree taller than 15ft.  I live near Edwards AFB and waited to see if anything may be flying with it?  I didn’t see any recognizable aircraft come to view.   Nobody was outside lighting off any fireworks or flares.  I am truly perplexed as to what it was that passed over my house?  The whole time I was asking myself is anybody else seeing this.  There had to be?  It was still day light and the weather very nice.  I’ve never reported a UFO of any kind, and kept telling my wife I want to see if anybody else is reporting something?  I only wish I would have run in the house and grabbed a camera instead of being awestruck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and we found him to be an unusually credible witness.

As I looked out the window I saw, what looked like the top of a radio tower with 3 spires pointing up sticking out of the clouds.  It was not moving and very close to the airplane, maybe 200 - 300 meters tops.  So I though &#34;wow we are really close to the ground in thick fog&#34;, then we went through another break in the clouds and I saw the ground around 20,000 feet below.  I&#39;m not aware of any radio towers that tall or big.  It was quite large with the base and 3 spirest was big, probably the sized of a small house (800 - 1200 sq ft) base with 3 long spires sticking out the top (sorta like the San Francisco radio tower).  The spires where about the length of an interstate light pole with other things hanging off of it. It was dark grey like a titanium wedding ring color.  I saw from the time it came to view in the front of the window then I leaned forward! and watched it until we went into new cloud bank. It wasn&#39;t moving so it was like flying by a building 15 - 30 seconds.  A few people looked  concerned/confused on the plane and I should have stopped and asked the pilot but in all honesty I was a little bit worried about asking around.  I can assure you it was not an illusion or reflection, it was solid as a rock and not obscured.  It was just like staring at a building as you fly by.  There were no flashing lights or anything like that.  I did try and take a picture but my phone didn&#39;t boot in time.<n>

I did have binoculars, but could only make out a bright orb.  It moved directly over me as it was performing a wide arcing turn. It eventually was headed toward the east/northeast and I watched it until it disappeared.  The total event lasted around 10 minutes time.  It made no sound whatsoever and never varied its speed or altitude.  It never lost brightness only dimmed as it receded into the distance.  Its altitude didn&#39;t seem as high up as a commercial jet, but I couldn&#39;t be sure because of nothing to compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I left my house at 0:40 and fired up my snowmobile warmed it up and took off it seemed just like always no problems at all.  I rode around my fields for about 10-15 minutes before setting off into the woods and I arrived at the gate to the next portion of my land. I got off of the snowmobile and took a picture of the snowmobile with my cellphone (picture taken at 1:01:23 01/24/11) before opening the gate and taking off.  I was riding about 30mph checking out the scenery when I noticed off in the distance (I was heading south) through the tree tops 2 bright white lights that where heading towards me and I towards it like 2 huge white eyes I could see through the trees. I crashed off the trail where it curved off to the right and dodged trees and brush and shot back up on the trail where I came to a 80-90 yard clearing where there is no tree cover then my snowmobiles voltage regulator went out and my head l! ight and tail light got really bright then burnt out. Then almost immediately after that my engine died completely. The object was now directly over me and I noticed it had an oval shaped outline I could just barely make out against the night sky. I became mesmerized at the object like a deer in the headlights. I stared up at the object for awhile and the object just hovered silently about 20 feet above the tree line. After some time it lifted up higher into the sky and hovered for a moment before shooting to the north in an instant. I soon started to  snap out of my daze and sat down on my sled to just think about what I had just seen. I sat for awhile before I started to feel fear and a panic seemed to set in. I could just feel my adrenaline flowing through out the whole experience but I really felt a big rush when this panic to get home kicked in. I pulled the starter on my sled so many times before I sat and looked at my phone and the time was now 3:47 according to my c! ell phone and I have a great sense of time. I cant explain whe! re the t ime went I know I was not out there for 3 hours.  It seemed like I only experienced this object very for maybe 40 minutes.  But back to the report. I tried pulling again and after many many pulls it started but it just backfired really bad and lacked power. It could barely speed up to 25mph before shutting off and having to pull it so many times until  it started again. I finally got home at around 5:00.  Still I cant explain the time.<n>

I thought it was a star but it was blinking, so I kept a close eye on it.  When I got to it, the object was about 3 feet behind a leafless tree staying perfectly still near Lows Variety.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a lamp post because there was nothing holding it up.  So I slowed down and stopped and watch it.  I rolled down the window and turned off my music and I couldn&#39;t hear anything at all.  After about 30 seconds I got ready to go again and it started moving.   It ended up going over the river to where it became hard to keep an eye on it so I drove up the hill a bit (maybe 100 feet max) and looked back and it was gone.  I had a good view of the entire area and then some but there was no shadow, lights, or moving objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Moved about 1.5 feet per second/really slow and was between 1 and 2 feet tall with about 6 inches of body behind it.  At first it appeared circular but after it started to move I realized it had some really odd shape to it.  It had a curved top and two legs.  One left and one right.  In the center of the top half was a trapezoid type shape that glowed a yellowish orange.  The left leg had a blue light and the right side a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: -2 Degrees Fahrenheit with 6MPH wind<n>

Appears to greet us? and then watch us awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2010-2011...NE sky seen from South Simi Bridle Path area.  Our UFO started appearing about a year ago over the horizon/overlook we have from our horses&#39; stables.  It began as a story the kids began running and telling us after feeding time, and confirmed by me, many times by now, always at or just after dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is just one extra bright star at dusk or shortly after dark falls, that one could say &#34;opens it&#39;s eye&#34;, suddenly, as we are about to go down the final walkway to the stable breezeway...JUST LIKE IT HAS SEEN US COMING AND WOKE IT UP?   That is the part I can&#39;t get over or explain.  The white star will &#34;watch&#34; us, with no other airplane lights, i.e., no red/blue or any colors involved on it, compared to LAX /BURBANK planes that soar over us many times while visiting our horses and while the star &#34;watches&#34; us, rarely moving.  It is absolutely NOT a plane, NOT a star.  I have made sure of that because I feel silly enough about writing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many times, the light gets &#34;bored&#34;?, moves slowly sideways or upways for awhile, with no particular agenda, and then at last shuts off gently,and the show is always over just before we finish up our equine chores! So wierd!  Looked at it with binocs one night and it looked pretty far away and it seemed made of about five or six smaller stars but I can&#39;t be sure.  Wonder if anyone else has seen it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or planet, possibly Jupiter??

I looked out my window and there was no doubt that something was hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that this light could have been seen from Mojave, Edwards Air force base and surrounding areas.  My son lost visual of the light when he was driving in the mountains, but he had it in his sigh for about 30 minutes.  I looked at for about 5 minutes and decided to go back to bed. I don’t own a camera so I did not take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing my cell phone light was going quite bright then dim while I was talking to my son, it has never done that.

I closed my eyes a few time to make sure my sight wasn’t going bad, but it was still there.  A solid, thick black line right over the middle of the almost full moon, with a light on it.   I drove a little ways, and when passing a field, I looked again, and the line had lowered to the bottom 2/3 of the moon.  I drove a little more, and when I looked again, the line had vanished.  There were no power lines in the area, nor overhead lines of any sort.<n>

It was a cold night and no one else in the family was interested in dealing with getting out of the tub in the cold. I have enjoyed the night sky my whole life and can stare at the stars for hours at a time. I had been in the tub for approximately 45 minutes. I was facing a southwest direction. The rear of the two story house was to my right. There is an eight foot high arbor to my left at the end of the deck which is about 16 foot away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four round lights crossed the sky in front of me traveling at a very high speed. They were going from right to left. I first saw them come from behind the house and they disappeared past the arbor.  There was no sound and no tail from any one of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four lights were red, blurry, not bright, and a little darker towards the middle, lighter around the blurred edge.  All were traveling at the exact same speed and stayed in the same configuration during the entire time of my sighting which lasted no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  They were traveling VERY fast, certainly not planes of any kind. They did not change direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I hold my hand up at arms length, the size of the lights was approximately ¼” in diameter and the lights were approximately 2” apart. The three trailing lights formed a “v” shape with the bottom point of the “v” the trailing light. The fourth light was leading the others to the left and forward of the “v” pattern. All light were the same distance apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group was traveling in a south direction and were to the right of Orion’s Belt.  The angle of my sight line was 45 degrees above the horizon.  I first noticed the lights at approximately 5 degrees to the right of vertical as they past from behind the house and lost sight of them at approximately 40 degrees to the left of vertical as they went behind the arbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a similar experience 6 years ago.  That time it was only one red object, delta shaped and that time, the object changed direction while I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has an explanation of this sighting or saw anything similar, please let me know, there was definitely something there and someone else must of seen it. I am a 60 year old Architect from NJ.<n>

I ran into the house to get the video camera.  When I came out about 20 seconds later the object was still gone.  We scanned the sky and then I saw it way over on the western sky.

The light appeared to be burning slowly  in a downward tail of smoke. We then saw two small red flashing lights and we heard what seemed to be an engine flying above us in the direction of Crofton.  Then the light  reappeared in the same position just as bright.  All this happened over a period of ten minutes.  We took two photos with our cell phone, one at 7:31pm after watching for approximately five minutes then the second one was at 7:32pm.<n>

My mom and I were driving home.  We were about a minute from our house when we saw a cigar shaped craft.  At first my mom was trying to figure out what kind of aircraft it was because it had so many lights.  It had one flashing red  light on the bottom of the craft but was flying extremely low and the craft had lights all along the side of it that were extremely bright.  They resembled windows or panels.  We stopped thinking it was a commercial plane because of the extremely low altitude it was flying at, and how bright it was.  The craft was flying too extremely  low to be a plane.  When we rounded a corner, I continued to look at it through the back window. As I was looking it completely stopped mid-flight.  It sat for approximately 1-2 seconds and then made what looked like a complete ninety degree turn.  I’ve never seen a commercial plane or any plane at all fly that low and certainly none of them are capable o! f stopping mid air.  We also never noticed any sound coming from the craft which doesn’t make sense considering how low it was flying.<n>

I would have said that it was trying to be camouflaged, except for the lights on the V.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Details:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. My wife, my brother and I were in my spa.  We were looking at constellations, and I had just pointed out a satellite that was moving west to east almost directly overhead.  I often spend all of my spa time looking for satellites and meteors.  This evening, after about 20 minutes of spa time, my peripheral vision caught the lights of the UFO.  I immediately recognized it as one that I had seen on TV shows, like History and Discovery....the Triangle-shaped type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my wife and brother, who immediately witnessed the UFO and saw it for about 10 seconds.  It was moving quickly, was flying straight and level, and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went over my garage roof, I ran from the spa to my driveway, but a street lamp blinded me.  The event was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and Constable came out.  We talked for 10 minutes.  He had seen UFOs (2 bright, fast flying spheres) a long time ago.  He was nice enough, but said that they only write up reports if a crime was committed....<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, my brother and I all had different perceptions of UFO size, height above ground, and distance from us, but we all saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  After the sighting, my wife talked about how the UFO looked faintly white, like a weak cloud.  I then realized that, while looking for meteors that night, I had noticed an odd, faint, stationary white spot low in the sky.  I first thought that it was a faint cluster of stars, but then I realized that I never saw a cluster of stars in that location.  Then I just figured that it was a small, irregularly shaped cloud, and ignored it.  Looking back, though, the odd looking cloud never moved, and it was the only cloud in the area...it was a clear night.  That could have been the UFO, stationary, before I saw it moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Background: 55 year old white male, Master&#39;s Degree, several professional credentials, 6 years in Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer.<n>

Benning!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d thought I’d do this as quickly as possible.  The first sighting was at 6:35am Jan 22, 2011.  My friend was giving me a ride home from his house.  As we got closer to my home, I noticed an unusually bright star.  We continued driving, but then out of nowhere, my friend and I noticed at the same time, that the star was no star.  The light we saw grew even more intense and then disappeared just as fast.  We herd absolutely no sounds what so ever.  We then pulled into a parking lot and continued to watch.  The craft was hovering very close to Ft. Benning.  As we got out of the car, I flashed a flashlight in the direction of the light; it disappeared very quickly, but with a small delay. Thinking it was over, again out of nowhere, no other sounds or lights; the craft instantly appeared less than a mile away, just a couple hundred feet up.  I saw a disturbing sight.  The light was being emitted from the bottom of a craft.  The bottom of the craft was smooth a! nd flat, but tapered to a blunt top, similar to a spinning top.  On the side of the craft, there was a reddish light.  It was sweeping in a clockwise rotation, if viewed from directly underneath the craft.  The red sweeping light never made a full 360 degree swoop around the craft.  It maintained this close distance for less than a minute, and then disappeared again, just as quick.  As the sun was rising, it kept its position in the sky, and would blink as the bottom craft light grew and dimmed in intensity.  We managed to capture a one minute video of it blinking and changing intensity.  And eventually we lost sighting at about 7:30am the same morning.  Again, this just occurred an hour ago and for the amount of time it stayed visible, I’m very sure that my friend and I weren’t the only ones to see it! And I also want to mention that during the course of this sighting, we witnessed several shooting stars falling at the same time!!!<n>

The area is in total darkness, with no lighting in the area and no people in the vicinity.   There were no sounds of any kind.  Although, I had a headlamp, I did not need it due to the reflection off the snow and the relatively clear sky.  The area is forested with scattered old growth trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a sudden, super bright, flash directly above me.  The flash was analogous to that of a studio photography flash, amplified many times.  The area all around me was illuminated.  I had also described the occurrence as that of a transformer blowing, though the light was white and there was no sound, smell, sparks, or any type of power in the area.  I estimated the light to be 100 to 120 feet above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reaction consisted of being very startled, surprised, and scared.  I  actually did a scan of my surroundings in a fraction of a second and ran for several seconds until I came to my senses and asked myself, &#34;what just happened and what are you running from.&#34; The date of this report is not accurate, as it happened several years ago.  However, there is no fuzziness to my memory or my recollection of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer - super active, early 50&#39;s, Engineering background, has spent thousands of hours in the mountains climbing, hiking, back country skiing, and is comfortable being in remote areas solo and traveling at night.<n>

When we stopped, the light moved rapidly back and forth and went straight above (large distance) the home. We had a camera and began attempting to take pictures. When taking pictures, we noticed the object to come closer to us.  There was  a large triangular shape silhouetted in the moon light, at least 3 lights surrounding the object. The object seemed far away, then zooming quickly to a distance half of initial proximity.  The lights changed from intense white, to dull red,often disappearing and then quickly reappearing and completing this color changing cycle as we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved quickly off to the side and out of sight. We drove less than an eighth of a mile and saw another triangular shaped, lit object; again flying/hovering lower to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and began video taping the event.  At that time, both triangular shaped objects came into view and began zig-zagging across the sky above and around the car. This went on for approximately 10 minutes.  The lights disappeared.  We drove for another 2-3 minutes and came upon the shapes again.  Video and pictures were taken, In many of the pictures, nothing showed up though was quite visible in the full moon light/reflective snow.  The pictures that did develop were of orb-like, yellow/red/white lights that were similar to arcing electricity. We followed the lights for approximately 5 miles and the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers: (2) 40+ year olds, married more than a dozen years. Professionals. College educated.

No visible form just lights in a triangle shape. The side facing me had a bank of orange lights with brighter lights on either end. The triangle shape was defined by this bank of lights and the single less bright light on the other side. It appeared to move sideways and not the direction of the triangle shape.  I first viewed it on the west side of the road just above and before the trees, as I approached closer, it moved across the road DIRECTLY ABOVE ME and the 5 cars behind me.  I strained to look though the windshield above me as I drove underneath it. NO SOUND, no wind, nothing as it moved slowly across the road and me driving underneath (~50 mph). It was at least 100 feet wide.  I still cannot believe what I witnessed with my own eyes. It was NOT! a balloon, plane or helicopter.  I thought about pulling over to take a picture but had too many tailgaters behind me and no safe place to pull over safely until the hills and trees would block my view.

I stared at it, trying to figure out exactly what I was looking at when it dive bombed the earth in a semi circle movement.  I thought I had just witnessed a plane crash, but as I drove along I looked for fire and smoke - any indication of a crash - but there was nothing.  That was not a normal movement for an aircraft to make. It was gone in the blink of an eye.<n>

It was just after sunset but there was still light in the sky, most of the cars had not yet turned on their headlights.  Across the street over the woods I saw a bright green light moving very quickly across the sky at a downward angle of about 30 degrees.  It had an equally bright red trail or light behind it. It seemed to appear out of nowhere and disappeared when it went behind a low cloud.  My first thought was that it was a shooting star but I ruled it out immediately as it was still light enough out not to see any stars and the color was a very distinct green followed by red.  Also it was larger than any shooting star I have seen.  I had just got off the phone with a friend when it happened and called back right away as I thought I might forget the details of it if I did not tell anyone. It happened very quickly.  I could not judge the distance but it seemed far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed a blue ball of light that turned white at the edges in the distance beyond the Toyota dealership.  I thought it was a plane (the airport is nearby), but the ball of light fell quickly, in an arching motion, in a southerly direction and disappeared behind trees/the horizon.  It looked almost like a shooting star, but much, much closer and was surely in our immediate atmosphere.  It was still light out and the object left no exhaust trail.<n>

I looked to the west from my window and saw bright lights thru the trees.  It seemed very unusual and low. I thought it could be a meteor.  If it was, it would not be good as it was low and very large.  I woke up my husband and brought him to the window.  By then it was gone.  We looked out a window facing to the southeast and saw the object, only a few moments transpired between sighting it in the west and then sighting it in the southeast.  It was much higher and further away at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed lights, sometimes multiple and could see another shape, elongated which we thought might be the glow from the lights.  As the object turned this second shape moved in different directions, at first on its right, then on its left and then below the very bright glowing lights.  We found our binoculars.  We observed that at times we saw three very bright lights from the object, then it would shift and we would see six or more.  The second object moved further below the first one.  It was a sphere, with lights, they could have been windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first observed this object, there were airplanes in the area.  We are about 50 miles north and west of O&#39;Hare airport.  While this is a busy time for a large airport, other than one airplane seen early on, no other planes were observed in the area.  We watched this for about 40 minutes.  Dawn was approaching.  I went down stairs to let our dog out.  The object had moved much further away and higher.  Within minutes it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wondered who to contact and came across your sight.  I hope if others witnessed this occurance they will report it.  I watched videos on other sites.  One video I believe from Columbia showed the second object we saw perfectly.  Other sites showed the lights of the first craft.<n>

After looking for a couple minutes I seen light flickering in the sky that caught my attention.  As I kept looking at the object it stayed stationary for around 5 minutes while it was stationary I could see red and green flickering lights.  The object then began to fly side to side at a very slow pass for about 3 minutes after the side to side movement stopped it slowly started to fly toward my trailer.  After flying slowly toward where I was it accelerated very quickly out of my line of sight.<n>

At first I thought it was an aircraft but I work at the airport and know where the runway is and it was way off  from the runway and it did not have any red or blue flashing strobes.  But then I thought it could have been a helicopter because I see them coming from that way all the time but still no flashing strobes, it was moving to slow, and I have seen no aircraft all yellow either.  I was still driving trying to get a good look at it when I made a left turn into work and still looking at it when it moved to the east and then it just disappeared.  I stopped my truck then and stepped outside trying to see where it went or what happened to it but like I said it disappeared.  If it was an aircraft of some sort it must of crashed but there were no reports of any aircraft crashing the next day.<n>
1/20/11 17:30|Tegucigalpa (Honduras)||Unknown||Black object with golden reflection moving straight but later rotating in the sky|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79783.html|89|ndxe201101| Black object with golden reflection moving straight but later rotating in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were laying on my front lawn, just watching the sky and the sun (which was a beautiful golden color before sunset), when a black object appeared suddenly, very high in the sky. It was black and elongated, and despite its altitude, it looked pretty big. It first started moving in a linear motion, but then it rotated in circles showing a golden, shiny reflection and continued it&#39;s linear motion but every 3 or so seconds, it rotated again showing it&#39;s golden light.  It went away in a straight direction, and disappeared into the horizon very quickly, leaving no marks or sound behind.  The whole sighting was less than a minute long.<n>
1/20/11 15:00|Millom (UK/England)||Sphere|12 seconds|Orange ball of light in the sky|6/27/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81893.html|90|ndxe201101| Orange ball of light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a local person to the area I live in and always have been.  I grew up in the countryside, so to speak and have never seen anything as unusual as this sighting I am reporting to you. To my huge regret I did not record the date and time of the sighting, but it was some time over the festive period of 2010/2011.  I am not claiming to have seen an Alien spacecraft,  I just cannot identify what I saw in the sky that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An orange ball of light, which is the only way I can describe this thing, appeared above the rooftops of the houses, which are bungalows, on the opposite side of my street and continued, at a steady pace of about 35/45 mph, to travel in a north,  north west direction and over the rooftops of the houses of my street.  This ball of light was travelling at the height of about 3, 2story houses, and was about 8 houses away from me, so not very far at all.  It was completely silent to my surprise, as I was waiting for a roar of an engine, but there wasn&#39;t one, I could just here the birds tweeting and the odd car engine in the distance from the streets beyond.  It was broad daylight, there were a few clouds in the sky and so it was very clear to me where the spherical object was and how big it was.  If you were to draw a circle around a helicopter, including the props, that is probably how big it was, it seemed to be travelling at about the same speed as you would see a helicopter t! ravelling and in a very straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange ball of light was like nothing I have ever seen before and probably never will again, although I eagerly await its return.  Since I saw this I have become quite obsessed with watching the sky whenever I can and watching relevant programs on T.V.  I have also been keeping my camera with me, at the ready, where ever I go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that I have become a believer, so to speak, in that there is something happening or going on that the majority of people are unaware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happened to be standing, outside my back door, having a cigarette and there it was right in front of my eyes for many seconds. I was then, still now and always will be 100% sure of what I saw.  This changed the way I think about related issues.  Unfortunately, the naivety of people in general prevents most of them from understanding and believing you because they have not seen to believe.  Not that I blame them for that but for example, some suggestions to explain my sighting have been, a Chinese lantern or several of these tied together.  Or because I likened my sighting to a helicopter in size, someone said &#34;couldn&#39;t it have been a helicopter&#34;,  please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can also report that my mother, who lives in a nearby valley, has seen a large, cigar shaped object, hovering  outside one of her neighbours houses on the opposite side of the valley, as if it was looking into the house through the windows.  She observed the object for several minutes, then decided to rush into her house for her camera but when she came back out the object had gone.  She believes my story 100% as I do hers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience was within weeks if not days of an &#39;earthquake&#39; measuring 3.6 which shook houses throughout the area accompanied by a loud rumble which lasted several seconds, the epicentre of which is only a few miles away,  at a place called Coniston.  One of my very creditable workmates said that, as he and a friend came out of a pub in the nearby area, fair enough they had had a few,  they observed &#34;two orange balls of light&#34; above Coniston which they thought were very strange.  They carried on observing the lights, as they chatted for several minutes, until the lights simply disappeared.   This accompanied with some very strange whether patterns and all being around the same time is beginning to become quite a concern or perhaps just very interesting to me.  If anyone can tell me what the orange ball of light is, you will be doing me and my overactive mind a massive favour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please don’t say,  &#34;Oh, it could be ball lightening,&#34; or something like that.  I want to know the truth.<n>

It seemed like it was pretty distant and it didn&#39;t look like a normal flickering light from an airplane. I couldn&#39;t see any discernable form, only a light with a fairly consistent pulse to it. At first I thought it was stationary but realized it was moving, but not what I perceived to be in any one direction, like a plane does.  I was driving in a car so it may have been moving in one direction. It was hard to tell. It also wasn&#39;t traveling quickly across the sky like a plane would. It was slow moving. I lost sight of it after a few minutes.  It just disappeared. I searched and searched the skies but did not find it again. It was weird.<n>

We were headed west just past the Nichols exit about  5 minutes traveling about 65 mph. Light disappeared just as quick as it appeared. Possible shooting star bc it shot horizontally.

It came to a stop about a couple hundred yards from the house over a field across from the house.  I thought i was hallucinating at first but it stayed in one spot for about two minutes.  It looked kind of like a cone and i couldnt make out details other than it was a bright light that seemed to throb every few seconds.  The strangest part was that it was completely silent...i heard no noise coming from it whatsoever. after hovering a good 50 feet off the ground for about two minutes it rose up higher than shot into the sky like a reverse falling star. the entire thing was the most bizarre thing ive ever seen!  I really hope you can explain this one to me as it completely freaked me out!<n>
1/18/11 22:30|Ferndale|WA|Triangle|4 minutes|Triangle Shape, no noise, no lights|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79784.html|108|ndxe201101| Triangle Shape, no noise, no lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to place tape over an exhaust fan duct on the side of the house,to keep it from flapping in the wind.  I do this just about every night.  Nothing unusual.  We live in a dark, semi rural area. There was a bright moon and quickly moving clouds at various levels.  I was staring at the clouds as they passed over the moon and between all of this I noticed an odd &#39;triangular&#39; form moving slowly east.  I kept thinking it was another cloud, however it was not moving as fast as the wind was moving the clouds.  Hard to see as some of the clouds were larger and blocked out the moon. I saw this shape about three or four times between the clouds and siluetted in the moonlight.  I could not figure the size and it did not directly pass in front of the moon. It was &#39;off to the side&#39;.  Yet the object must have been solid as it blocked out light around it. No noise, no blinking lights, no lights at all. Just this odd black triangular shape, silently moving east.  As I was w! atching it an &#34;odd feeling&#34; came over me. I became a bit &#39;un-nerved&#39; and thought &#39;this is strange&#39;.  I&#39;ve been thinking about it for a few days and started looking around the internet for information on unusual objects. I came across your website and thought I would add this event.  It was most pecular and I cannot remember having such an &#34;odd&#34; feeling after having seen it.  The &#39;feeling&#39; has stayed in my mind more than the actual &#39;object&#39;. So there are two related events, seeing this thing and a feeling I can only describe as &#39;haunting&#39;.  For want of a beter word.  I never saw anything like it before.  We live near an airport landing approach and planes are loud.  This object had no noise and was higher than any plane (I think) in that I could not see any details.  No wings, or landing gear. Just a shape.  I ws watching it for perhaps four to five minutes? As it was moving slow, not like an aircraft approach.  And moving east toward Mt. Baker.  You can contact me via email.  Thank You<n>

The object went just below the three stars on Orion&#39;s belt downward at about a 45 degree angle.  The object was left a reddish-orange streak in the sky.

1/18/11 21:45|Lehi|UT|Light|15 minutes|Two red lights fixed in the sky one of them started sendind or emiting white pulses downwards.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79731.html|110|ndxe201101| Two red lights fixed in the sky one of them started sendind or emiting white pulses downwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My testimony:  Today at about 21:45 at the interception of 2450 N 300 W in front of the Lehi city warehouses and municipal building about 200-300 meter behind them and about 700 m ( less than 2000 feet) above in the sky I saw 2 bright red (with a hint of orange) lights. They were separated about 1.5 - 2 of my fists if I would extend my arm and use them as measurement on how far apart they where and they were fixed in place.  I went walking tonight because it was warm enough as I always do when the weather permits.  I was just a few blocks from home crossing the street when all of the sudden I look to my left and I saw two red lights near and above the sky.  At first I thought to myself that they were a couple of new tall antennas caped by the red lights and I thought to myself how fast they were put in place.  I kept walking until I reach the other side of the street and started walking again going south when I notice that someone may have shoot up a firework up in the sky in the direction! of where the “antennas” where but upon looking the trail of light I realize that it was not a firework. Instead for a brief instant (as when someone tries to make sense of something that quite cannot explain) I thought that the trail of white lights must have been white lights installed in the antenna (only one of them) as a warning to aircrafts because they would light up like in a like sequence from the main red light on top to the bottom of what it seem at first as to be a mast. Upon looking closely to the white lights although they seem to be coming down from a cable from the main red light they were more likely now to what it can be describe as white pulses of light coming down in a straight fashion. At a rate of three at a time but later I realize that there was not really a predictable sequence. I realize that I was not looking at antennas either but it was something else.  At first I thought that they could be planes playing war games and throwing flares but the li! ghts where static and not moving while these white lights puls! es were coming down and descending rapidly from the main red light on the right. They may come in three at the time or one or two then three again but not in any order.  I could not deduct a pattern they seem unpredictable. The pulses were rapid and I could tell they were no flares since flares would have been more bright and will descend more slowly.  Some of these light pulses coming down now seem to reach the ground but I am not sure if they did. They almost look like charges of white electricity coming down of the main red object and they somewhat did resemble warning lights. As I say for a moment also seem to be descending from a cable at first but that was until other lights from the sides started coming down at an angle and they also came down from the main red light but going from the sides at an angle of 45 degrees aprox.  I notice that the red lights could not have been planes or helicopters I should have been able to hear if they were either planes or helicopters they wer! e close enough that I knew for a fact that they were noiseless and static on the sky for almost 30- 40 seconds until the entire white light pulses stop. These white lights were coming from the red object on the right and somewhat below the other object.  While the white pulses were coming down the object on the left move higher and almost on top of the other object from where the light pulses descended.  After the white light pulses stop I could perceive now that the red lights started to move higher and toward the north east very, very, slowly almost imperceptible I realized that definitely that was not helicopter or plane. Having lived in an airbase and worked for a helicopter’s company I know that that was not possible. Planes could not have flight as slow as these were moving and helicopters unless that they invented some kind of completely silent propeller they were just too close and they did not make any vibrations or noise. If they would have been flares the color w! ould not have been the pure white light of these pulses and th! ey would have descended slowly as they generally have parachutes and they also would have been much brighter since I have experience flares in the sky illuminating a training field while I trained in combat with the marines.  Chaffing also is more chaotic and disorderly if thrown from a plane what I mean is that the white pulse neither resembled chaffing.   At that moment my skepticism dropped although I was still looking for a logic to this I realize that whatever I was looking at was not “normal” or familiar, I called my brother while still the lights were moving almost imperceptibly slow toward the northeast and while talking to him the red lights they seem to stop and move backwards and for a moment and them came to a complete halt again in the sky.  They lights were not blinking at all but were continuous solid bright.  They could not be more than a mile away now. I put the size of the red light as the brightness of 10 Jupiter’s or like the brightness of a 60 watt light bulb abou! t 300 feet away.   While talking to my brother one of the lights simply vanished while the other remain there but within a minute or so the other red light vanished as well.  I am still looking to an explanation to what I saw and what those white pulsating lights were. Why they were coming down straight from the flying craft in a pulse like manner. I think that I saw two UFO’s tonight and I hate that there was none else in the street to observe what I saw.  I wonder if someone else in Lehi saw what I just experienced.  I wished I could have a camera at the time or someone else to corroborate my testimony.  I know that I saw these two red lights and I know there is not known aircraft in the military that can fly the way these two UFOs flew. I still wonder what the white pulses of light were and if there is some type of mark on the ground or evidence of these light reaching the ground or some type of material or trail left behind that can be found. I wish I would have the way! to get into that complex and investigate.  Regardless this is! my test imony. I know that what I saw is not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now believe that UFO’s are real. I apologized to those that I ridiculed in the past.  If you ridicule me I would not blame you  I was one of you before tonight.<n>

I started to make a wish thinking it was just a falling star, but then realized it was much to low for that and it went in more of a vertical direction and was green in color. The light appeared to be just above the school gymnasium rather then high in the sky like you would see with a falling star.  I then said something to my daughter sitting next to me and she said &#34;wow, you saw that too!  I wasn&#39;t going to say anything because I just thought that was my imagination&#34;.   Once we were home from the game and we were eating dinner my younger daughter and I started talking about it and that&#39;s when my older daughter spoke up and said &#34;You saw that too?! I just happened to look up in the sky when I was out on the soccer field and saw this green light fly across the sky above the gymnasium and then disappear.&#34;   I find that inte! resting because we had not said anything about it being green or right above the gymnasium, so it appears that she saw the same thing that we did.<n>

The best I can describe the noise is like a fluctuating “woor...woor....woor...woor...woor”  At first we thought it was a car with a loud speaker system but the noise got so loud that it shook the walls and windows of the apartment complex and it caused the alarm systems in the cars in the  huge parking lot to go off. After the noise reached its peak it got faint within 2 minutes and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our next theory was that it might have been a train but that was unlikely as the train passed by an hour after we heard the loud noise and I have never heard a train sound like that. We also thought of a low flying plane but we have never experienced that before in the 4 years we have lived at our apartment and in all the years prior to that when I lived under a flight path right by LAX . We quickly checked the news because we were concerned  about what we had experienced but neither the local news or national news reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t see any craft as we were so bewildered and concerned by what was going on that we didn&#39;t dare to look outside the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The name of the apartment complex is called Solara at Mill Avenue, Tempe, AZ<n>

They resemble stars, but are not because they float around in different directions at times &amp; then go back to being still.  They sometimes flash all the colors of the rainbow but the color is only viewable with a telescope or binoculars. This movement is hard to spot with no refrence of a stationary object, (like tree limbs or a house overhang) between us &amp; the objects to gauge their movement &amp; ensure it wasn&#39;t our eyes playing tricks on us.  We then brought out a powerfull 280-X telescope which revealed their movement. There is no manmade aircraft in my mind that can be manned &amp; perform the same movements whithout turning the pilot into hamburger. That being said, I was enlisted in the Navy on an airbase &amp; know what high performance aircraft can do &amp; have never seen anything like this level of performance.  We used a very powerfull green laser to signal to on! e of the UFO&#39;s. After that, it began moving more and also moved more towards us, but then stopped moving &amp; stayed stationary. They had been seen by us for over a month almost nightly before the said date.  Sometimes up to ten craft.<n>

Three came first and then two more appeared. I counted them twice…there were five in total. I first thought it was a firework, then as it shot towards me, I thought it was a missile.  I was afraid at first, thinking terrorism, but then they stopped before me and seemed to dance around a bit. Three lights at first, joined by two more.   It was not like a big object, just these balls of orange, bright fire balls, not perfectly round.  There was low cloud cover that evening and as the lights went back up into the sky, we did hear an engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I screamed for my husband and daughter. They both witnessed the event as well as my neighbor and his wife. Another witness was driving down our road, stopped the car and asked what the h*** is that? I called 911, but by the time the police arrived the lights were gone. They were in the sky for what I would say was about two minutes. No rigid geometrical formation…just almost like a dance. I have to say it is the weirdest thing I ever saw, yet very beautiful at the same time and I almost feel blessed. The police took a report, I was NOT drinking. After trying to contact the FAA (please leave a message) and Homeland Security (sorry this doesn’t sound like a terroristic threat)…I felt at a loss. I’m not a loony, I have witnesses to what I saw. I just came across this site.  It&#39;s been over two weeks since the event and I can&#39;t let go of it.  Thanks for listening…I just wanted people to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was standing on my apartment building roof smoking at night when I spotted a bright blue light moving erratically in the sky above the South San Francisco area (I think).  It was hard to pinpoint its exact location as the fog was steadily increasing and gradually obstructing my view, but it was located not too far from the coast.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was flying/hovering about 200-400 feet from the ground.  Since it was hard to tell where the light/orb was coming from, it was hard to judge its speed as it moved from side to side and up and down in a somewhat erratic fashion.  It didn’t seem to be moving at a tremendous speed, but if it was indeed above South San Francisco, I’d guess it was moving at varied speeds, crossing a mile or two in about 5-10 seconds (again, very difficult to judge).   It would move one direction, slow down, and move the other direction in no apparent pattern, sometimes gaining some altitude, sometimes descending.  There was never a sudden jolt in speed.  There didn’t seem to be any other lights and I didn’t notice a spotlight coming from it.  I’m not aviation expert, but it didn’t seem to behave like a helicopter.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then it seemed to descend and disappear.  I went back inside and looked out my window with the same viewpoint and about 10 minutes later saw it emerge again.  I then went back out on my roof and watched it for another 5 minutes until the fog became heavy enough to completely block my view of it.  I don’t believe it was blinking, but its luminosity seemed to vary - but I attributed this to the fog.  Very weird.<n>

Flickering like the flame of a candle or a star, not like a plane&#39;s lights.  My only guess at the time would have been a blimp, but a blimp unlike any I&#39;ve ever seen.  Also, it was more spherical than blimp-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon other identical lights came into view, passing from behind tall buildings on the west side of 2nd Avenue.  I pulled onto the next street I could, 119th Street, and immediately hopped out and started filming on my cell phone.  Total I would say there were 7 lights that were in the sky, but I was only able to capture 4 on my phone.  Three seemed to fly together in a pyramid formation before the 4th came flying into view.  They didn&#39;t fly in consistent patterns either, sometimes changing directions distinctly.  At the end of this experience, which lasted about 4 or 5 minutes, each light seemed to climb higher into the clouds until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If they were balloons, they were definitely producing light and massive in size.  I didn&#39;t see any smoke trails or quick, random movements to make me think they were flairs.  The flight patterns, while they did change directions, didn&#39;t alter in velocity, from my point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 25 years old, from Northeast New Jersey, and have lived my entire life in and around the New York City area.

It was about 20:12 when I saw a Bright, gold, circular object to the east. It was no reflection coming from the windshield; it was not a star because it appeared to move and it was too bright. To add on, it was not an airplane because it had  only one light, not a bunch of lights like airplanes do have and lastly, this object moved like no aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, at about 20:13, the object moved slowly towards the north and then back south to the point where it was directly overhead. After looking straight up at this Bright object for about a minute, my neck started to hurt. I only observed one object. Suddenly, I was amazed to see that the object started to dim in brightness to the point where it wasn&#39;t bright anymore and eventually to the point where it faded into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appears to have a very bright burning center as it changed it&#39;s intensity slightly from time to time.  The &#34;burning-bright center&#34; appeared to have some red in it, but mostly it was a steady bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then made another right hand turn onto 228th St., headed east and could now see the object through the bare trees out of my driver&#39;s side window, over my left shoulder as the object was now headed north-west away from me.   While the object did not appear to lose itensity or colour, it was getting smaller as it headed north-west.  I had one passenger who called my attention to the object in the first place.  My passenger also commented that at least one other person standing on the roadway also appeared to be witnessing what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a plane nor was it a helicopter, in our opinion.  At first the object was close enough to us to us so that if it were any type of normal aircraft, we&#39;d have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area was back lit by normal ground light from homes and businesses in the area.  It was dark and the weather was windy with spotty, low clouds that obliterated the moon from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There is a nearby municipal airport and so such a light might easily be overlooked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light for 30 or 40 seconds(it was flashing an intense array of red, green, white, silvery, and blue) it eventually dimmed over the course of about 3 seconds and began to flash just reddish-yellow, and after another 2 or 3 seconds began to move at a steady pace towards what I assume to be the south or southwest of its position, eventually disappearing behind a far hill in the distance in Westchester County, New York State.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many such lights over the years, always in the west over the hills of Westchester and Putnum counties and always with a similar pattern.  The lights will always be completely stationary and intensely flashing man! y colors, then either blink out of existence abruptly or after glowing just one color(usually red), or over the course of perhaps half a second the light will suddenly zoom off and disappear in a short arc in the shape of a parabola (like x squared from the origin to like x=4, that shape) and I stress they are always relatively low over the western hills where someone that isn&#39;t watching could easily overlook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes I realized afterward that the date I posted that was the 18th and not the 24th.

Pleasant, Tennessee.  The road was a rural by-pass divided 4 lane.  Conditions were over cast with high fog.  The object appeared directly in front of us, high in the sky. It was bright, shiny liquid appearing silver flat object that turned red then silver, again.  Silver on the bottom, red, then silver on top, repeating like a barber pole, but flat.  It cycled 4 times then faded away.  Myself and both passengers witnessed this and one passengers son who lived in the area reported the next day to his dad, that he had saw it, also.  I looked for photos on the web and found one that appeared over China airport last summer to be similar.<n>

It was hovering over a pond I&#39;d say about 60,000 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it my whole body froze and I couldn&#39;t move for a minute and I kinda blacked out afterward.

I assumed it was an airplane of sorts, but soon after it flew straight up, it took a sharp turn down and then off to the right. The maneuvering happened so quickly, there is no way that could have been any air-craft I know.  The total time I could see this light was for about a minute, then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The desert is a great place to star gaze at night and we were looking at all the stars, moving satellites, and airplanes in the sky, this was none of those.

At the moment I was looking down there was a strip mining in progress which looked like huge targets on the ground.  Out of the corner of my eye there was a white, shiny object coming towards the plane below us at a rapid speed.  It was traveling from East to West at about 170o and moved out of sight in 3 seconds.  It looked no bigger than a dime at an arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute later there was a an airline parallel to us traveling in the opposite direction.

The last of the 10 was slow, I was looking through binoculars at them and I was able to follow them but the last one shot across the sky at a great speed. The last one just disappeared and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness #2 17 year old male At approximately 11:30 my dad called me to come and look at something outside and I came outside to see 10+ orange lights slowly moving across the sky. They all looked to be maintaining the same speed except the last one. It looked like it had fallen behind, but just as I pointed to it, my brother and I witnessed it move at a tremendous speed to catch up with the rest across the sky. Once it caught up, the first one dimmed out followed by the second, then third, until the last one finally dimmed out with a heading of South-Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness #3 Father of above I am a Certified Flight Instructor/ATP with 16,000 hours TT.  I have flown in the Chicago area out of Midway Airport as a pilot from 1974 thru 2001.  Subsequent to that I have flown out a flying community airport Brookeridge (LL22).  This observation was seen looking East thru South  from our back yard in Darien, IL (Darien is in approx 20 miles SW of downtown Chicago).  What I saw was amber light after amber light which seemed to be rising from a point east of us.  I would say initially these light appeared about 15 miles East/South East of us.  All told there were 10+ lights.  They all seemed to climb to the same basic altitude and they followed each other on the same course that appeared to be a heading of 200 degrees.  They were not exactly the same distance from one another, but were all in a line at varying altitudes and basically looked like one was following the other.  They also appeared to slowly gain additional altitude and seemed to travel at the speed of a singl! e engine airplane.  When they were more south of our position they appeared to take a slight course correction to the left….say more of a heading of 170 degrees.  They appeared to stay the same brightness the entire time we saw them.  Ultimately they dimmed in brightness and disappeared.  They appeared to be 5 times the size of a planet you might see with your naked eye.  My sons said they saw one of the last ones lag behind and then accelerate to catch up to the group….however I did not see that.  Both of my sons reacted at exactly the same time when this happened.  I was trying to video tape them and did not see this happen.  The video tape results were very poor and I only got several frames of the objects, but in my opinion my recording is of little use.   I did check with flight service station at the time.  I checked surface winds for MDW, LOT and JOT.  The briefer told me almost every station reported calm surface winds.  Winds aloft for 3 6 and 9 were 340 at 12, 310! at 16, 300 at 33.  In my opinion theses objects were not bein! g carrie d by those winds, their course seemed to be 90 degrees to the  winds aloft forecast.  Surface temp was 9 degree F.  These 10+ objects looked like pyrotechnic devices to me….but 10+ pyrotechnic devices leaving a metropolitan area on a course 90 degrees to the prevailing winds aloft??<n>

Then their formation changed, the one in the lead stopped and the one in the back circled around to the front. At this point I could see they appeared more as giant balls of flame and not a light emitted from a bulb or another like source. They continued one slowly with a slowly side to side swaying and then the one in the lead stopped and the one in the back circled around to the front, so now they are in the original formation. They backed up slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled to my wife for her to some see what I was observing. She came out and observed the balls of fire.  It was at this time we noticed another coming from the original direction. When my wife went inside to grab the camera I looked back at the first two, they had started to &#34;burn out&#34; like two large candles losing the last of their burn, I watched them completely fade and then turned my attention back to the third object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife struggled with the camera (it was new and she was not sure how to get the to video setting) at this time a fourth object came from the same area, my wife was able to get a good idea of where it had come from and tried to record video, she instead got a photo.  The third object had burned out so we watched the fourth she had exclaimed that there was another rising up. I was able to observe the trajectory the object, it rose at an angle greater then 45 degrees, more like 50-60 and seemed to plateau out at a certain altitude and continue on in the same direction as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each ball headed in the same direction North-west but took different paths there, we watched the leading object burn out and another rise up shortly after. We were quickly up to the sixth object, the fourth had burned out and the fifth was almost burnt out. My wife had got the camera to the video setting and started to record.  I got on the phone and called my sister (she lives in the same town) I got her to go outside and she too observed the lights. When my wife and I saw the seventh rise up my sister verified she saw it rise up too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again each object took its own unique path and was changing direction, stopping, slowing down, speeding up all without making a noise. I told my sister to get her husband and try to get him to see them too! When i got off the phone with her i called my father (lives a few towns over) and tried to see if he could see them, by this time we where onto our ninth object on the rise. My wife stopped filming we have about 3 minutes of video. The ninth one moved much slower and had taken a drastically different path, it headed more towards our house (West By North-West) it lowered slightly. We could really make out what appeared to be the flame much better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was slightly panicked by the ninth object and its almost curious nature about us. Looking at the time on my phone i realized we need to go get our dinner (they close at 9 on the dot and it was quickly closing in on that time) I continued the conversation with my father (he was unable to see them) while we pulled out of our driveway, we watched the eighth object start to burn out and the ninth change its path back to a North-West one like the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on the way into town we saw the 10th one rise up and start on the North-West path of the others. We grabbed our dinner as quickly as we could, upon returning home the event had stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our video can be seen on the forums here http://forums.vampresearch.com/ under the video section.<n>

Traveling over a field and then crossed the hwy.  and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 15th at 8:00 pm I was  heading south on hwy. 16 one mile past hwy. 63 in Watson, la which is 30 minutes outside of baton rouge, la.  I noticed up ahead some red lights that I had never seen there before and I travel this road quite often.  At first I thought it was a cell phone tower . But something didn’t seem right about it.  There were two red lights together  to the east over a field.  But as I approached I realized a v formation of lights off over the hwy. as well.  With the point of the v facing west. so it couldn’t be a tower.  It had been over the hwy. the whole time as I was approaching,  it seemed to be hovering.  I pulled off onto the shoulder  and stopped the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights pass in front of me from east to west.  It was dark and very cloudy and  I thought they were separate lights but then noticed some connection between them, so it must have been lights on the bottom of a triangle shaped craft.   The lights were red and solid. Above the red lights were smaller lights either white or light colored. These lights were either flashing or spinning above the red ones.  I rolled my window down to  hear the sound , but there was total silence. The craft must have been between 150-200 ft. above, I could see it’s size fairly well. I’m not good at judging  distance in the sky , so this is only a guess and could be way off. But it was close not way off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the craft crossed the hwy.  It just vanished !!  I thought it might be hidden in the clouds and kept watching to see if it would reappear in the breaks of the clouds  but it was gone  like it never existed.  Another car coming from the opposite direction had pulled over as well and watched as  this craft traveled across the hwy.  I drove down the street a bit, turned around and came back to see if maybe it was still up there somewhere and the other car did the same thing. I did not approach the other car because  I was alone and I’m a woman and it’s night and not much around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following sat. night I was visiting my friend in Watson  two miles exactly from where I had seen this craft a week earlier. We were sitting inside and the power flickered. I looked at the clock. It was 8 pm. The exact time I saw the craft last week. I later learned that almost all of Watson had a black out. A transformer went out. There were no storms. Who knows, maybe it was caused by this craft. Maybe it was still out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to the newspaper but they said they had a policy now that they can’t publish  articles on ufo”s anymore.  The tv stations said they would have to have a video of it in order to air it and the radio station  t .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ook my information and said someone would contact me but no one ever did.<n>

I kept taking pictures and took two that appear to have extremely large, saucer shaped objects behind the trails.  There is a visible energy field streaming downward from the craft.  I believe I caught three craft in total although they were not visible to the naked eye.  They appeared more like &#34;shadows&#34; in the pictures as if they were using some sort of cloaking device.  I carefully checked the camera, windows, anything that could cause this kind of anomaly but the fact that one is clearly BEHIND the trails leads me to believe I captured a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/15/11 04:45|Plaquemine|LA|Circle|4:45 to 7:30|A bright white light that floats in the air with no aviation lights|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79864.html|140|ndxe201101| A bright white light that floats in the air with no aviation lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:45 a.m., I had gotten off of my sofa and walked  into the kitchen to the back sliding glass door that lead to the back yard of our home.  As I got to the sliding back glass, I pulled the curtains to the side just a little so that I could look into my back yard.  Since the beginning of October of 2010, I&#39;ve been feeding the deer (white tail) that come into the back yard at night.  As I pulled the curtains slightly to the right, I saw a bright white light falling from the sky as if it was a shooting star.  So, I then called out to my fiance for her to come quick and have a look.  As she ran up to the sliding back glass next to me we saw the light continue to fall. Then it  all of a sudden come to a complete stop right above the tops of the trees while it remained illuminated.   In amazement and awe we both realized that this was no shooting star.  In fact this light was much brighter than any star in the sky.  As it stopped from free falling it wa! s hovering.  The light would go to the right then it would hover to the left.  We decided to go outside to have a better look.  While outside we were looking at this light through binoculars in disbelief of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For one, a shooting star will not stop as it is in flight through the earths atmosphere and two, the light emitted from the shooting star will eventually disappear. Staring out into the back yard, the white light had stopped right above the tree line that stands out about 40 yards behind our mobile home.  What happened next is what really through my mind for a loop.  About 5 minutes after spotting the UFO, an actual shooting star had came into my vision from the left and was going right.  The shooting star was going just as fast as the white light was.  I knew that it couldn&#39;t be an airplane because an airplane has to keep moving through the air to keep flying.  Also, I knew that it couldn&#39;t be a helicopter because of how fast that ! it was going when I first saw it.  Then, after watching the wh! ite ligh t for about another 5 to 10 minutes, I knew that I was watching a UFO ( Unidentified Flying Object).  What really had made my mind up in saying that this was a UFO is that it had no blinking aviation lights on it what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as time passed, my fiance and I where speechless as to what we were witnessing.  As time progressed, the UFO moved from the top of the tree line to almost straight up in the air from where we were looking.  As the sun came started to come up, I then moved outside for the remainder of the time that I watched this flying object.  The white light had now become dimmer due to the light in the sky.  I then braced myself against a pole outside and held the binoculars up to have a real good steady look.  From what I saw, it was a metal object that was again, no airplane nor helicopter.<n>

I looked up in the sky and saw a green glowing light that was very bright. It looked as if it was a frisbee  gliding across the sky. My reaction was stunned.  I was so freaked out i didnt know what to do,  As it passed over our car i turned around to see it and looked threw the back window and saw it still gliding at high speeds and then it dissapeared.<n>

It moved almost at the speed of a shooting star, but was EXTREMELY bright.  Additionally, it was no more than 5000 feet in the air.  There was no sound.  We ran outside immediately after seeing the object, and there was no sign of a vapor trail or the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this was FAR too bright and large to be a shooting star.  The light was not a &#34;fireball&#34; light, like a meteor, but was more so a self-contained light.<n>

At first I thought they were Chinese floating lanterns like in the movie Tangled (Disney) but said to myself they were moving too fast and up too high but still below the low cloud levels of the night and it wasn&#39;t windy.  Then someone said they were night time parachuters or parasailers - but they wouldn&#39;t do that at night unless it was military and we did not hear any motor or engine sound nothing.  And it definitely was not a plane or helicopter or fireworks.  We all came to the conclusion that they had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They sailed silently across the sky lit with red and orange lights seemingly going faster and higher as they head further west.  Once they lined up perfectly 3 across but that could have been due to the angle we were looking at, then the one to the left faded.   I think it got concealed above the clouds.  Then the one to the right disappeared a few seconds later, then the center one just got further and further away seemingly going faster heading west still lit until it faded assuming due to range.  The center one did not fade into the clouds or over the horizon, it just faded into a clear patch of sky while heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my account others may be different but to me and others present this definitely was a UFO (remember the objects was unidentifiable).<n>

This 3rd occasion, I heard it and going outside, I witnessed it travelled from south to north there, probably a mile to a couple miles off I would guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling was, that when I flashed my little red laser at them, on 01-04-11, iit irritated or scared them off, and they were keeping their distance this time...I really feel bad about that.

What i saw changed my life, my perception of how i understood physics, and what i once viewed as possible and impossible.  I have always been interested in the paranormal, since my first memories i can recall an interest in ghosts, spirits, angels aliens etc.. but overall i am a pretty sound and logical person.  The details of my first sighting were pretty much exactly the same as what is described by eyewitnesses of the famous Phoenix lights, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here.  I&#39;m here because this morning at 1:30am, I witnessed something that frightened me to my very core.  Unlike my other UFO sighting experiences in which i was not frightened, just fascinated and curious about the possibilites of what i was seeing i felt a combination of peace, warmth, and awe. what i witnessed tonite was completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gotten home from a little late night shopping at wal-mart.  The time was around 1:30am and i was walking out of my bathroom and down the stairs to my basement to smoke a cigarette, when i heard a very loud rumble as if a tornado was directly over my home.  It was such a loud humming/rumbling sound that i could literally feel the vibration from it.  Curious, i walked out my front door expecting to see a helicopter flying directly over or a low flying jet, but... that is not at all what i saw.  I open the door, and directly in front of my point of view was an ENOURMOUS, solid carbon/black perfect circle shaped craft hovering extremely low and close to my home. The sound was loud enough that i&#39;m surprised... better yet shocked that it didn&#39;t wake the whole neighborhood.   Again, this thing was huge.  In the dead center of this giant circular craft (Which i could see almost perfectly, and it had no wings, no landing gear, no strobing lights and no visible markings of any kin! d) was an extremely bright laser like lighting blue beam pointing in several different directions. I have to admit, i was frightened by it, but i wanted to document it somehow. Now, i own a video camera, but i keep forgetting to purchase new film, and did not have any in it at the time, which REALLY sucked. So, since option 1 was out of the question i ran to get my iphone from off my counter top. Here&#39;s what is strangest part of the story. By the time i got back outside with my phone in hand, this thing, this craft, this... sort of ominous eye of god ship had left. I could still hear it, it was still very loud, and knew it had to be near by. Mind you, I was in the house for all of 15 seconds searching for my iphone. I ran as fast as i could in house shoes around to the back of my house hoping to catch a final glimpse. This craft (or whatever you want to call it) had traveled several miles north, and all i could see was the faint remnant of the beam shooting out of it, and i! t was rotating up and down and back in forth as if it was sear! ching fo r something, and then it dissapeared behind the ridgeline, although the noise emminating was still very noticeable. Wait it gets weirder. SO i hear another loud rumble coming from behind me, althought this sound is familiar. I look up, and there 3 black helicopters with only their spotlights on in formation flying along the same path the craft took, as if they were chasing after it. These choppers were hauling major ass. I knew i had just witnessed something i was not supposed to see. I will remember this day forever, and the unusual ominous sense of fear i got from witnessing this thing. If you would like, i am a bit of an artist, i could send a detailed sketch at a later date. Thank you for your time.<n>

When I had finally finished with my job, I headed home just like any other night.  On my way home I picked up my sister from a friend&#39;s house and we continued driving home, with the music turned up very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably wouldn&#39;t have witnessed what I did in the next few minutes if it hadn&#39;t been for the vibration.  Wisconsin is not well known for earthquakes and so I was suprised when I felt the car vibrating slightly, and then progressively more harshly.  Harshly enough to make me stop the car.  Unfortunately, stopping the car did not stop the vibration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my sister looked very freaked out and I felt the same way.  Once the car rolled to a stop I got out and noticed that the groung was suprisingly sturdy, despite the shaking car.  The vibrating had been going on for about two minutes and it didn&#39;t seem to be going away.  As I looked around outside the car I didn&#39;t see anything.  It was a very dark on the back road we were on.  I could see the city lights ahead but we weren&#39;t close enough to call out to anyone, and we couldn&#39;t have if we wanted to because the car was vibrating so loudly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the car stopped vibrating and the engine cut out.  My sister was very quiet too, though she had been yelling at me just a second ago.  Now it had been six minutes since the whole ordeal started. It was eerie becuase at the moment the engine died, it felt as though all of the hair on my body was standing on end.  Then, in my perephrial vision, I saw this kind of glowing light in the sky. I turned to face the light full on and I realized that it wasn&#39;t just one glowing light, it was a large mass with small lights lining the edge of it.  It was a sliverish-blue color and I couldn&#39;t really make out the shape becuase as I stared at it, it didn&#39;t really seem to be holding a specific shape or color.  It was hovering a little to the left of our car and it didn&#39;t seem to be that high above us, maybe 200 feet.  By this time my sister had noticed it too, and she was not taking the sighting well.  She jumped out of the car and tried to get me to go back into it so that we coul! d drive away.  I gave her the keys and told her to start it.  She tried but it didn&#39;t work, the engine didn&#39;t even sputter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time she tried to start the car, I stared at the object in the sky.  It didn&#39;t move, but the shape still seemed to shift and the colors subtly did, too.  I stood watching the object for about three minutes while my sister messed with the car.  Then all at once our car started, the lights on the object went out (except for the feint glow that seemed to perpetually surround it), and the object emitted a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unlike anything I had ever heard before.  The noise was loud enough to make both my sister and I cover our ears, and it seemed to make everything shake.  It was a deep bass and it felt as though it passed through me becuase my ribcage was vibrating along with my surroundings.  This went on for about a minute, and when it finally stopped it seemed like an eternity had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up the next time, the sky was empty.  There was no evidence that anything had been there, and it was already beginning to feel as though it had all been a dream.  I stumbled back to the car and found my sister sitting wide-eyed, once again in the passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed there for a good 30 minutes after this event, talking about what had happened.  We both decided not to call the police or talk to anyone else about the sighting, becuase we figured no one in their right minds would believe us.  We weren&#39;t even sure that we believed our own eyes.  Neither of us have talked about it to anyone besides each other until this day, when we were led to this website after reading an article about UFO sightings featured on MSN&#39;s homepage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Observed at 10:45 PM for about 10 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Jan 13, 2011 UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from Dallas to my home which is about 65 NW of Dallas.  Shortly after passing through the town of Krum on FM 1173 I noticed two orbs in the sky fairly close together.  There is not much skylight here because it is very rural, so the stars are easily noticed on a clear night.  The moon was easily seen, but the stars were not because of cloud cover.  These two orbs were very evident ahead of me on the left side of the road.  The closer I got, I could rule out approaching planes to DFW Airport.  They were too low and barely moving.  More like a hover..  the outline of the crafts had a white/gold light.  Red light was also noticed.  As I ruled out possible explanations, I decided not to call 911 or my Onstar emergency button.   A.) They probably would not believe me and  B.)  What could they do?  So I called my daughter who was home, to have a “witness” and in case I didn’t get home. During that call, one craft disappeared. I described the other and by this time I could loo! k underneath the craft.  There were red and white round lights under it. Maybe 5 or 6 and not symmetrical.  I looked for the other one.  It was now on the right side of the road.  Those lights were turned off, except some dim red light underneath, but I could see the outline of the craft.  There was some movement from the orbs but very little.  I passed them. When I looked back, I could no longer see either of the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this in case someone else does, to verify or be verified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow, that was a first for me!<n>

It was very high, so I thought it was a falling star at first (because it was coming down and at an angle almost like down a rainbow), but then realized that stars to not fall slowly and this tended to descend at an angle and then went sideways very slowly for about half a minute and disappeared. I pulled my car over and it was gone. Nowhere in sight.  It was so bright and shiny almost silver that I thought it was a falling star.  However, do stars fall that slowly fromt the sky? I dont know.  Maybe it was? I dont know, but just thought I would report it. It definitely was not an airplane.  It was low enough to make out the shape, but high enough and bright enough to not be able to see any particulars about it.  I wanted to take a picture, but by the time I pulled over to look outside, it was gone.  Anyway, just thought I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read my report. :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I first thought a firework had just exploded but the embers did not dissipate, so I studied them more closely.  There were between 9-11 orange lights, bright enough to be very low flying aircraft, but they made no noise at all.  They were flying very slowly northwards (much too slowly to be an small aircraft), evenly spaced, in an arced line except for the last four, which formed a small square.  It looked a bit like the Little Dipper, with less of an arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband outside and he saw the whole formation (assuming it wasn&#39;t larger before I noticed it) and, because it was moving out of view, we ran to our front yard where we saw our neighbors and told them to look up.  The lights began extinguishing one by one, and by the time our neighbors witnessed them, there were only three, but they were still bright and silent.  Then, the last three lights went out, again, one by one, very gradually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that a local news station ran a story about folks seeing strange lights in the sky in the past few days, but no calls to the local Air Force Base or Federal Government have been returned.  Also, it seems odd that similar lights have been spotted across the country in the last month, in areas that do not have Air Force bases or, unlike us, are not near an international border.<n>

I looked at it for a few seconds and then I went in and got my aunt. She said that was just a star so she got her star map on her phone out.  She was inside trying to find it on her star map and she was not able to see it.  As she was doing that I looked at her and said it was moving slowly horizontally in a diagonal way.  She came outside with me and watched it.  As it got higher in the sky the bright light changed to red lights.  It was moving towards the west for a few seconds gaining speed and then it turned around and was going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the object started to change different colors as it did this I heard a loud noise that continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed and watched it for about 4 minutes and then looked away for about 20 seconds and it was gone.<n>

It appeared to “flare up” to a bright reddish ball about twice the size of Jupiter, then would lose luminosity  and size to become a dull red color and about the size of Jupiter.  Even more interesting it would shrink down to about half the size of Jupiter, turn  a dull gray color, and looked almost oval.  It repeated this pattern several times before slightly arching upwards, then it sort of faded out of sight  in approx. 10 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted  90 sec.  My mother observed this as well but didn’t want to report this herself  (sorry Mr. davenport).  What appered to be a Southwest passenger jet was in the air at this time.

I have no reason to lie, and only reporting this because I’ve seen these &#34;fireballs&#34; about 15 times through the summer of 2010.  I just want to know what they are. I doubt I will find out though.<n>

The first was smaller having only two red lights on it, that were on each side, it was hard to tell because it was dark, but it looked triangular/oval shaped.  The craft following it was moving at the same speed.  Neither of the crafts were making any sound that was audible to me.  The second of the two was much longer, and shaped almost like a wide cigar shape.  It had six to eight lights on it which were appeared to be all along the bottom in pairs of two.

The Captain remarked that it might be a planet considering that it was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I made visual contact I remarked that the flickering/flashing light seemed to be a consistent flash and was getting closer hinting to the fact that it was not a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As our flight continued in the next few minutes the light did indeed get closer.  Our aircraft was flying west bound at approximately 380 knots true airspeed and the flashing lights were heading east bound at a fairly slow speed, slow enough that we were able to view the lights for approximately 5 minutes.  I found this to be peculiar considering that in my 5 years of professional flying typically aircraft passing at this altitude pass each other very quickly because they are operating at their cruise air speeds.  The relative motion of the flashing lights just did not make sense, just to slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time that the captain called New York center and inquired with them about traffic at our 9 o’clock position and above our flight level. New York center informed us that there was traffic at that position however it was west bound, same direction, as our flight path.  The lights that we were observing however were east bound and moving at significantly slower speed than a jet or turbo prop aircraft typically does.  In fact, I remarked, &#34;Is that a helicopter?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observed lights did not make any evasive maneuvers nor did we need to maneuver to avoid a perceived collision.  The captain continued a dialogue with ATC as they inquired with other aircraft in the area if they had observed what we had reported, the other flight crews however did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights observed consisted of a large bright white strobe like light at the lowest point as well as three to four smaller white lights that surrounded the main light.  The brilliance of the light lacked the whiteness of modern strobe instead it had a pearlescent quality and flickered rather than flashed however with intensity.  At times then main light seemed to be casting a fluttering shadow much like a flashlight would yield if cast through a rotating fan blade.  In fact that prompted me to question if the craft was a helicopter as previously stated. I looked intently for the red and green navigation lights that all aircraft have conversely none were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight conditions were good; visibility was excellent as the stars made a magnificent backdrop as they typically do on night flights during the winter months.  An overcast layer existed well below our flight level that I estimate to be at 10 to 12 thousand feet.  The flight did experience intermittent light turbulence, as we got closer to KBUF most likely because of the approaching low-pressure system.  Weather conditions deteriorated in the decent to KBUF, which required an instrument approach for landing on runway 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, what I had witnessed was completely unique and somewhat confusing.  Hopefully I was able to convey my experience with some coherency.  If I can provide any other help or you need further explanation please do not hesitate to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Officer ATP/Citation 550<n>

At first I thought it was a planet but as it got closer, I realized that was not the case.  It passed by us at a relatively slower speed than we are used to.  It was between 2 and 4 thousand feet above us.  It had a blinking light in front and between 3 and 4 other lights on it, all white except for an exstremely faint and small green light toward the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached our ten o&#39;clock position, I asked air traffic control if they observed any traffic at that position?  They said they had traffic at that position going westbound.  This craft was eastbound and not in contact with any controllers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The controller then asked other planes if they had seen this craft, receiving replies that no one else had.  Both my co-pilot and myself watched it disappear behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it is common to see other traffic in the sky while flying, the fact that it was so lit up (planes are not usually that highly lit at those altitudes) with lights that were not consistent with aircraft lights and it relatively slow closing speed with us makes me believe that it wasn&#39;t a aircraft as we know an aircraft to be.<n>

It never moved. At first there was only one, then two others joined it.  It was a very, very bright orange triangle and there seemed to be rays coming from it, like the sun (but it was NOT the sun).  The other two shone just as brightly. They were there for about 40-60 minutes.  The morning was very misty, you couldn&#39;t see anything else and yet this was outlined perfectly, very clear and the mist didn&#39;t touch it.  I have no idea what it was, at first I thought it was a metor, but now I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a UFO.  Whatever it was, I have never seen it before and I don&#39;t believe that it was anything of this earth, therefor I can only think that&#39;s it&#39;s a UFO.<n>

I googled what I saw, stumbled upon this website and thought I should report my sighting in case it was at all useful to anyone documenting these sorts of events. I somehow awoke this morning, as I often do, and as always I looked at my phone to see what time it was. It was 5:19 am.  For some reason I rolled over and something in the North/Northwestern sky caught my eye.  There was  one orange/yellow fireball that appeared to have sparks all around it rising upward into the sky from the distant treeline.  It appeared to be about as large as the moon.  There was no tail. The object went straight up for a few seconds and then slightly to the northeast or 1 o&#39;clock direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds I no longer could see the object.<n>

I do not know why I have not sent in a report before now, other than when I think of sending in a report, it was almost as if something was making my mind wander causing me to put it off. Well, here I am now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I left work I have to cross the street to get home and always scan the skies to see if I can see anything of interest. Once in a while I will see a commercial aircraft or the odd meteor streak through the sky. This night was different, very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head left to check for traffic and looked up to the sky as I always do. I then started to scan the skies and immediately did a double take as off in the distance was an aircraft that seemed to be stationary and appeared to about a mile away. It looked to be about 150 feet above the ground and displayed multiple cells. Each cell was multi colored, kaleidoscope like, almost like what is seen in a (Bell??) commercial on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that the object was slowly getting closer and was moving at the speed that a commercial airliner would be moving in the sky at cruising elevation. I also noticed a single blinking light on the nose of the object and a single blinking light at the base of the object. As it got closer I could see that it was football shaped with the nose and tail rounded. These cells had multiple levels and circled the object, almost as if it consisted of multiple objects that formed one object. These lights in the cells were not static, but had a movement to them that was very beautiful and mesmerizing at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got almost directly overhead I could make out a single blinking light at the tail of the object. It was so close and so quiet. I listened closely and could not hear a single sound emanating from it. It looked like a blimp, but no motor sound, no hum no nothing!! All the while these lights, (cells) maybe 50-70 continued to display a light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object continue to cross overhead and continue in a perfectly straight line until it was out of sight. This object seemed to following a line from directly East to West. It took about 5-10 minutes for it to cross the sky.<n>

I saw what at first I thought was a satellite (which looks like a star moving extreamly fast across the night sky).  It was traveling across they sky at the same speed you see satellites cross the sky.  I was going straight north, so I thought it was in a polar orbit.  It was directly overhead when I first noticed it.  As it was moving North, once it hit about a 45 degree viewing angel, it made a perfect 90 degree right (East) turn while keeping speed.  It did not curve the turn like a jet, but made an exact cornet turn like following the corner of a square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it went made another perfect right turn back South, then again back West.  And once it crossed it&#39;s original path, it mase a few curves around.  I don&#39;t really remember exactly it&#39;s path after that because I was in shock.  But it curved around a bit and ended up just a little East of it&#39;s original path, then back! South, and then I lost track of it.  It was a little foggy, so it was hard to see the stars.  You could only see two or three of the brightest stars, and this was a little brighter then the brightest star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It had red lights and blinked a blue/green color. I pulled over to the side of the road and looked up again to see nearly 5 of the same aircrafts spread evenly across the sky (I would estimate 3 miles apart from one another).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw spherical objects with red blinking lights, revolving around the triangular aircrafts. They were very quick and, in my opinion, flew across the sky as a fish would in water. There was not a straight path, it zig zagged through the sky. A few nights prior to this, my husband and I slammed on our brakes leaving Nagoya (in Port Clinton) on Lightner Rd. when we saw a VERY low spherical aircraft with red lights, spinning for nearly 30 seconds before it took off. It sped up, then stopped IMMEDIATELY and disappeared. These aircrafts resembled the one from that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister-in-law and I sat for nearly an hour looking up at the sky at these crafts and they made no sound at all and did not move. They were stagnant, only the spherical crafts moving around the sky. We’ve seen many more UFOs in this same area on other nights, it seems as if they stay around the bay area and near Davis Besse Power Plant. They are very low to the ground, but very quick and I was unable to snap a photo of any of them.<n>

I dismissed it at first until I saw the picture of what was reportadly sighted across america on the 3rd and 4th of july. this is what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the distance of the sighting and the quality of my camera I was unable to take a clear photograph of the incident.<n>

We watched it pass over expecting it to keep on going but it turned to the right 3 o’clock, made a u-turn like it was going to pass back overhead but continued to turn and headed back on original path, still with very little noise like you would expect from a jet at that low an altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 minutes, a friend approximately 15 miles away told me to look at the lines in the sky, they were in the pattern the object had flown.<n>

We thought it came from the wind power plant, but seems a bit too high.  The wind power plant was blinking red and the object blinking white in a ~1,5 second distance of each &#34;blink&#34;.  We decide to drive closer and drove into a field road. I jumped out of the car and saw the object now moving into our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we saw clearly that there were three white lights flashing exactly at the same time!  Only slow 3 white flashing lights could be seen and they form a perfect equilateral triangle!  The object flew above us from North to South and it was gone after the flyover within 1 minute!  Only the 3 white lights could be seen, no other lights and no sound.  It was hard to guess the distance to the object, but I think 150-200 meters high and ~50 meters in diameter.  It was a clearly evening, the Moon with Jupiter where clearly visible, also some stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot 3 fotos of the object with my handy, but the quality is really, really bad.<n>

I suddenly sped up because I started thinking in was something stuck in the power lines cuz it made no logical sense the way it was hovering.  I felt like something was going to fall on us or suck us up.   I drove past 2 or 3 houses on the street and pulled into a driveway  to look back at it and it was gone.  I turned and drove back under where it was because I couldn&#39;t believe it and there was nothing in the sky<n>

The object I noticed nose dived then plateaud  suddenly to about 1000 feet.  The object had no lights, and the front of the craft was pointed.  The wings of the craft drew back at a sharp angle.  The rear of the vehicle had one engine but no exhaust/flames coming from it. The engine produced an irregular, loud noise, unlike any aircraft i&#39;ve ever heard before.It had no propellers, was like a jet engine.  The sound coming from the aircraft was very loud and had a very deep clanking noise,although the speed of the craft did not match the sound it was producing.  It was heading north for a few seconds and abruptly disappeared because of it&#39;s speed.  It was impossible to track because there were no lights marking it&#39;s spot in the sky.<n>

A coincidence but true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time and date as stated above I was in my garden and my eyes were drawn towards the tree line about 1500 meters to the rear of my garden.  Highly intense lights were shining towards me. The color of the lights were of a silver hue.What was shining those lights at first I could not see.  It was a beautiful morning with no clouds in the sky and a temperature of approx 28 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no engine noises or other noise distractions in the wooded area. What was shining those highly intense lights at first I could not see.  After approx 3 minutes the lights immediately went out and it was then I observed a cigar shape moving from South to North in an immediate 90 degree movement at a speed of approx 20 mph.  It kept its trajectory horizontal to the earth.  Each 100 meters it would drop 20 meters and move 100 meters at the lower level and then retain its upper level.  It traveled Northwards for approx 5000 meters then rose vertically and I observed the saucer shape in full.<n>

Pulled over after about a mile of watching it and continued to observe from the sidewalk.  The object looked to be about 40 feet long and  seemed to stay mostly in place over Mira Mesa Blvd before eventually drifting or moving south toward Miramar.  I lost sight of it after about 15 mins.<n>

Ive been watching the sky at night for 2yrs now and whats up there is a whole bunch of different objects 1 that mask its self like a star but it moves from time to time and isn&#39;t high enough to be a star and ive seen other objects come out of it the others objects are hard to explain but some have bright multi colored lights that twinkle all the time red green white and they are positioned across from each other in various formations and patterns.Dont have any answers because the ones that d! o know aint telling us pawns.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A square/rectangular black 3 dimensional object with something sticking out of the top of it (like antenna, or something) was traveling opposite direction (West) on the South side of the road over the cornfield.  The object was not that high.  I am absolutely sure it was not a helicopter or plane.  I am positive it was not a loose kite or garbage bag that caught the wind.  This was an odd object that was very definitely NOT supposed to be there.  When I turned my head to watch it go by as I kept driving, the object was suddenly gone.  I even stopped my car and got out and looked and the object was no longer there.  The object had no propeller of any kind, no wings.  It just kind of flew by, keeping the same altitude the whole time.  It did not stop and hover or even hesitate, that I could see.  But I know what I saw and I know it was an object that was not a normal object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We had just weathered a snow storm but the sky had completely cleared up and you could see the starts.  So I stood outside in the freezing cold for a few minutes to admire, Orion was just becoming visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started to walk back inside I noticed a flicker in the sky.  At first I thought that it was just a bright star &#34;twinkling&#34;.  I stood for a minute looking with my naked eye and there appeared to be a red, green and bright white light flasing in the sky.  It kinda looked like the lights on top of a police car, how they spin around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went inside to get the binos, and my husband to show him to see that Im not seeing things.  We both watched it for a bit, he went back inside and I stayed there watching through the binos.  After about 15 minutes of watching this thing, which had not moved at all, something shot out from the left of it. It was just a dim white light, it moved to the north for about 10 se! conds and disappeared.  My kids forced me inside but I stood outside long enough to freeze to the ground.  I managed to get a picture of it but you cant tell at all what it is nor does it look as clear as what I was seeing through the binos.<n>

At first I thought it was a bright star then I noticed that it would move about in the sky almost shaky like, up down and side to side.  It appeared to have 3-4 lighted orange spikes off of it or orange light emitting from it. As I was watching the light, I noticed a second light in the trees near the ground. This light started to rise up out of the trees and when it got above the trees and I noticed it looked identical to the first light so I woke up my husband.  He saw both lights. I scrambled for my video camera.  As I was getting the camera my husband told me the second light “flew” up and over the house.  It was still dark at this time and I could not get my video camera to focus in on the object.  The object would also dim it’s lights when a plane would go over (we have an airport within 10 miles of our home) making it look like an ordinary star then it would brighten up again.   My husband, my mother and my father all saw the object and we video taped it for some time.  Then it was just gone.<n>

I usually stare up into the night sky to look at the moon and clouds pass by as I smoke my cigarette and this night was exceptionally clear. As I was looking at the stars, a bright orange fireball appeared out of nowhere and was traveling from west to east.  The fireball seemed to only be illuminated for approximately two to three seconds before it flared out. It was bright orange in color and seemed to be fairly close to the ground.  Being that it was only visible for only a couple of seconds, it was hard to gauge size and distance; however, I would have to approximate that it was larger than a basketball and around 1000 yards up.<n>

They saw 3 bright saucer shapes in a triangular formation flying across the sky very quickly.  He had recorded them on his phone.  He said they were traveling at such a high speed that he could only capture them for a short time before they disappeared out of the camera’s view point.  He was with 3 other boys who also witnessed this occurrence.<n>

I stood and watched it for a minute. As I watched it travel closer I noticed that the object was&#39;nt making any noise at all. I ran inside to get someone else to look so they could see it too. I told them that there is a UFO outside. As I did that my girlfriends&#39; sister was talking on the phone with her friend who was across town and she said that she see&#39;s a bright light moving i the sky.  I and one other ran outside to look but it was&#39;nt in our view anymore.  We listened on the phone to her friend who was watching this object with two other people.  She said that another light came off of the object and fell to the earth. They said that they&#39;ll keep watching it and she hung up the phone.  After that me and my girlfriend went shopping and when we got back I asked her siser if she heard anythi! ng else.  But her sister said taht it was probably a shooting star or something. I know for a fact that this was not a shooting star.  I&#39;ve seen so many strange things in the night sky here.  I know for a fact that this was not a shooting star because I have seen many before.  I also know that this was not a plane, satellite, or helicopter because the object did not make any mechanical noise and did not have any lights or beacan on it like the FAA requires, so I&#39;ve heard. Also it was far to close the earth to be a satellite.  This is not my first UFO sighting. Seeing these UFO&#39;s truly haunts me for some reason.  Ever since then I also keep having dreams where I see, to what I think, is the end of the world, not really sure.  And everytime I go outside I can&#39;t stop looking at the stars. I&#39;m also wondering if antone else in Juneau saw this light?<n>

EVERY morning between 2-4am I see this enourmous light or star in the same place.  It is too large to be a star. There are some mornings there are no other stars out because of the overcast, yet this light is clear to anyone who would look upon it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first morning I noticed this strange light I ran into the house and woke my husband. He came out and observed it also for a good 30 mins.  We used his binoculars and noticed a blue ringed light around the entire center light that was the color of a star.  It is there every morning when I step out to have a cigarette.  I would like to believe we are not alone.  This light will stay lit up even as the morning light comes..very strange.  It can be sited to the left of the moon every single morning.<n>

South part of Texas in the Rio Grand Valley.  And on this night 1/8/2011 at approximately 1:05A.M., I was outside sitting with family facing East when I noticed through my neighbors trees a bright orange glowing light.  And I could see it so bright through the branches of the trees and I knew right away it was no plane or anything like that.  My family members saw my face of “aww” and I finally said turn around!  And we all got up and moved away from the trees to be able to get a full view, it was only 500ft-1000ft away from us and it was this ball of glowing orange light, fire like just gracefully floating across the sky, we had perfect view of it (and it was no meteor either I’ve seen that before) heading Northwest with no sound at all. It was completely silent.  My husband even said at one point “Is that an angel?” over and over again. Because it was nothing we had ever seen and we had perfect view of it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family kept saying, “! Get the camera!” but I was not going to miss out on what I was seeing!  I eventually rushed inside to get it and only got 2 sec of very poor quality video. We followed it to the front of our yard were we saw it keep traveling and even though it was already far it was still in sight and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately (literally 2 minutes later) contacted the National UFO Reporting Center to tell my story because sometimes things like this get ignored and I want to let the world know what I saw and it was real.  I have no doubt in my mind that this orb was UFO related.  And I feel so lucky to have been able to see something you hear about on T.V.  And I hope that this can be explained.<n>

The sky was very clear and the stars were visible.  I immediately noticed an extremely bright white light in the sky hovering to the southeast. It was much larger than anything else in the sky. At first I thought it was the Northstar, but it seemed way too large.  Then it started slowly moving. It went up and then to the right.  Then it started slowly moving to the left.  It was moving so slowly that it seemed to be hovering.  It had extremely bright light beams coming out from it in all direcetions.  The beams were very distinct and very long, especially the three that were on top.  All of the light was white, but every few minutes the top beams would begin to glow a greenish color and red lights would appear on the right side.  The center of the object from which the light beams were eminating had a arch shape.  I called my mother on the telephone and had her go look at it (she lives about 3 miles from my home).  She ! could see the same thing.  We watched this object hover for approximately 2.5 hours.  During this time it was moving very slowly to the left and rising.  After the sun came up and all of the stars had vanished, it was still there and just as bright.  We watched it until it rose up and disappeared into the horizon (similar to how the space shuttle does went it is launched). It was by far the strangest and most unexplainable thing I have ever seen.  It was very obvious that it was nothing like anything I have ever witnessed in the sky.  I am absolutely positive that it was a UFO... I am now a believer!<n>

Initially I thought it was a shooting star BUT the size and slow speed did not support this. The coloration was yellow-orange and it had a fireball like tail as it moved. An additional note of an interesting observation: the object(s) looked blurred around its edges as it came down, which seemed very odd. I almost thought I was watching a plane that had exploded in air fall to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the fireball-like object reached about a 23 degree angle it began to split into three balls of yellow-orange light, still connected at the top with the fire-like tail.  Then, once completely separated, the fire-like tails diminished and the balls of light stopped moving downward – just hovering at about a 20 degree angle or so, each ball moving around, separate from each other yet staying at the same level in the sky.  This is when I! knew it was not a flaming plane. The three balls of light remained visible and moving around for 3-4 minutes. The balls of light seemed to dim so my thought was that they were moving away, hence getting smaller/dimming. This whole process was only about 5 minutes in total. And literally in the blink of an eye the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what I just witnessed. I was alone taking my dogs outside to the backyard.

I turned on the video camera on my cell phone, however the record button didn’t work at first, so I lost an additional 10 seconds before I realized this.  I was in the parking lot of a pharmacy and it was well lit, so I walked towards the lights to a fence to an open field, hoping to get a better shot.

There was no sound and no flashing of the lights. They lights were very bright and at eye level with me. The lights looked to be the same height as the local hills off in the distance and the object was just sitting in the sky not moving, just above houses several streets away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was way under the cloud level, I could not see a shape of the object just the lights. I kept my eyes on it for a few minutes when the lights/ object then turned facing the north. The object was about three hundred feet away and about three to four hundred feet from ground level. I ran into my house to get my video camera and it was gone when I came back out to look for it. I have always wondered if they were real, just never thought I would! actually see a U.F.O myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers. PD))<n>

It was located about 45 degrees from the horizon in the west from our perspective.  It continued to fall slowly downward in the sky as a whole for about 20 seconds.  Then it suddenly split into 3 equally sized fiery balls and continued to fall at a slightly slower rate for about 15 seconds, when all 3 objects simultaneously stopped falling, the bright spheres where still as bright as before. They continued to hover in the middle of the sky and moved slightly to the left but did not move downward at all. Then they slowly started to revolve around in a horizontal circle. They only circled for about 7 seconds then stopped and continued to hover in the same spot. Then the 3 floating objects appeared to be moving backwards, away from us, slightly. Suddenly, one by one, all 3 balls quickly vanished into thin air, almost as if they zoomed off into the clouds extremely fast. They did not dissolve slowly or fade away, they abruptly disappeared into the night sky.  I would say the bright objects hovered in the sky for a total time of at least 1 minute.  The whole experience from start to finish lasted about 2 minutes. I did take 4 pictures with the camera on my cell phone.  I took one picture while the fiery ball was falling as one whole, another after the object split into 3 pieces, one more when the 3 spheres where revolving in a circle, and a last just after the objects vanished into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected parachute jumpers.

I immediately looked at where he was pointing and saw what I originally thought was a very large meteor at about a 45 degree angle from where I stood outside on my side yard.  It was glowing immensely with white light and had a rather long tail composed of what my friends I thought looked like bits and pieces of flaming glitter. It was lightly bumpy, form what I could see, and had a white/yellow light radiating around it.   We all stormed outside and gazed up, marveling the spectacular glow. It was west in direction, traveling in a downward motion, much like a meteor.  The size was very large, about 1/5 of the moon (compared to how we see it in the sky).  The sphere traveled down for a good 20-25 seconds then broke into three equal pieces of glowing ball.  It continued to fall for 2-3 more seconds then abruptly stopped in mid air and hovered.  It just hovered there in the sky then began to rotate in a circle formation for a good 10-15 seconds.  The rotating was like the planets rotating around the sun, without the sun.  It hovered for about 25-30 seconds.  I then ran into my house to grab my cell phone to see if I may catch it on my camera then ran outside and began to film.  As soon as my camera picked up about 4 seconds of three hovering lights, it moved downward very slowly and began to head south, then vanished into thin air.  It did not disintegrate or break apart; it vanished, like a magician in movies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked and looked to see if maybe it hid behind a cloud or tree, but after a few minutes of looking, we knew it had gone for good.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/6/11 Wildomar, Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx .   7:20 PM  I was setting in my living room watching TV.  My chair faces the house front windows—drapes were open—and I noticed a fireball falling in the night sky.  I have windows running floor to ceiling in the front of my house.   I jumped up to run out the front door to get a better look—and yelled for my 14 year old daughter and her two friends to come out and look with me.    All 4 of us witnessed what appeared to be a fireball meteor falling from overhead due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all saw the object as it was about 45 degree angle from the horizon.  My house faces due west –and faces Lake Elsinore.    My house sets on a hillside about 2300 ft elevation.   The night sky was very clear and you could see the stars.   Earlier in the evening I noticed the moon was a small crescent sliver—but had already dropped below the horizon at the time of this sighting.   As the 4 of us continued to observe the falling object—I mentioned to the girls that it may be a meteor or a falling satellite—it appeared to falling directly over Lake elsinore—and falling straight down.  I first caught view of the object as it appeared to be about 45 degrees angle.  As the object continued falling—at about 30 degrees—the object split into 3 pieces.  I expected it to then fizzle out—but the three pieces then stopped in mid air—at about 25 degrees angle and hovered.   The pieces did not exhibit the fireball appearance –they were each a bright white light  and seemed to move indepe! ndent of each other—but all three setting on the same level—but lightly moving up and down relative to each other.   They them began a slow movement to the left—or a south direction.  As they continued to move towards the left  I lost sight of them behind a large tree in the yard across the street.  As I moved to the other side of my drive way to get a view from the other side of the tree—they had vanished.    The original fireball size appeared to be about 1/4th the size of the moon—if it were setting in that part of the sky ( the moon had already dropped below the horizon).  The three separate pieces looked to be a size if you were to break the original fireball into three pieces.  As the three pieces set hovering—they appeared to be in size –all three together—left to right—about the width of the moon.    The time duration of the event was probably about 45  seconds from when I first saw the object to when it split into three pieces—and then another 30 seconds watching t! he three pieces hovering, moving to the left, then vanishing. ! About 75 seconds in all.   My first reaction on seeing the fireball was that it was a large meteor or a falling satellite as there appeared to be quite a bit of debris coming off of the object and training behind it.  But—when it split into three pieces that hovered for a period of time—I became curious as to what it really was.   My daughter was able to get about 10 seconds of video of the object  on her EVO phone.  Her friend got 4 still photos on her cell phone.<n>

The aircraft appeared to be dark in color and triangular shaped.  The aircraft was decorated with a lot of white lights and a few red lights.  I turned the corner and when I looked back I could no longer see the aircraft.  This aircraft was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n>
1/6/11 18:43|Dayton|VA|Unknown|15 seconds|Large meteor passes earth|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86393.html|235|ndxe201101| Large meteor passes earth<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: anywhere between 6:42 - 6:44 PM Eastern Standard Time Location: Dayton VA, 22821  Did the world nearly end while I was enjoying a smoke?   At around 6:40PM Eastern Standard Time, I went outside to have a ciggarette.  A few minutes later I looked up about 15 degrees west of overhead to see what looked to me to be initially, a bright moving star. It was too far away to be an aircraft and was obviously both too high and moving too fast.  It was about as bright as Jupiter in the night sky its color was white with a very slightly yellow tint giving off a near constant light, but dimming as it approached the horizon.  I remember distinctly that the object was moving faster when it was over head, than when it was off closer to the horizon.  The object dimmed in a regular (almost linear) fashon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path of the object started from about 15 degrees west from overhead, and continued to about 45 degrees over the southwestern horizon before fading away.  The whole occurance occured over about a 15 second long period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself; &#34;what if that&#39;s an asteroid?&#34;   I thought this was potentially accurate because typically meteors move faster, and are only visible when they burn up in the night sky, and usually they leave a streak.  This was just a bright object like a star. Leading me to infer that what was producing the light was was reflection from the sun.  I wasn&#39;t sure exactly how big an object had to be to reflect an amount of light bright enough to be mistaken for a bright star but I assume it has to be at least 30 feet in diameter.  So I believe the object was rather large, perhaps as large as a plane or maybe much bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I supposed it might be the International Spacestation. But from what I know the spacestation moves in a roughly opposite direction from the object I saw. The object was heading almost exactly southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I can also infer from my observations was that the object was moving tangentially with respect to the Earth. This would explain both the slowing of the object as it approached the Southwestern horizon, and it would explain the behavior of how it faded away (because it reached an angle with respect to me where the suns light no longer reflected off the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The arc length was approximately 30 degrees, maybe more from when I first noticed it. And the whole event lasted about 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given my observations, I can conclude that in all likelyhood, the object was not an asteroid but it was probably (though not definately) a large meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This conclusion is based upon the theoretical limit for meteor speed, which is roughly 160,000 miles an hour plus or minus 3,000 depending upon its relation to the rotation of the earth at its surface. This theoretical limit itself is based upon escape velocity, or velocity at which objects would not be pulled back in from the sun&#39;s gravity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much more can be inferred from my observations without making assumptions because the exact trajectory (particularly along the y-axis {the axis perpindicular from the ground to space}) can not be known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I assume delta Y is 0 (which it must approximate to by about plus or minus 30 degrees) then a rough approximation of its distance can be calculated. From my observations I know the arc length was approximately 30 degrees over a period of approximately 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reports were inaccurate both in its trajectory and in the angle to which it faded. After revisiting the scene I can say with some certainty that the object disappeared about 45 degrees above the horizon (not 20-25) and started about 15 degrees from directly overhead (or from when I first noticed it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the object did not appear to burn up or leave a streak, it is safe to infer that the object did not burn up in the atmosphere meaning it was at least 62 miles above me. *62 miles is the approximate distance from the surface of the earth to the outer edge of the atmosphere given the two constrants (maximum speed limit of a meteor and the minimum distance from the surface from the earth, I can make rough approximate limits of its size and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming the smallest possible size of the object (in order to be able to produce that light) is a sphere 30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming delta Y of the meteors trajectory is 0.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming delta X is 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming maximum velocity is 160,000 miles an hour. *http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/ Assuming minimum distance is 62 miles. *http://www.universetoday.com/25410/how-far-is-space/ Assuming delta T (or change in time) is 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Assuming the meteor had to be at least 30 feet in diameter. (at a distance of 62 miles)  Calculations suggest the distance of the meteor could have been anywhere between 62 miles and 958.27 miles away.Based on assumptions the size of the meteor was 30 feet in diameter at a distance of 62 miles, the maximum potential size would be 463.68 feet in diameter, and it would be traveling at a speed of between 10,351.92 miles an hour to 160,000 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the absolute maximum assumptions are taken to be true, then it is possible that a small asteroid passed earth. But given how unlikely that is, it is probably more accurate to assume it was probably between 100-250 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is also probably safe to assume that the object was larger than the minimum. Due to the unliklihood that a meteor was going slower than what is generally observed with meteors. The range of speed of meteors almost always ranges between 7 and 45 miles a second  *http://science.howstuffworks.com/question486.htm. if the minimum distance of 62 miles is taken to be true. the speed of the meteor would only be 2.87 miles a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from this, the distance was at least 151.22 miles away and was therefore it can be assumed that the object was at least 73.17 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So did the world nearly end? No in all likelyhood not.  Even if the meteor had hit earth, it wasn&#39;t nearly large enough to be able to cause serious damage.<n>

I had to make a stop and the object was gone on the Monday. That day it was stationary for at least twenty minutes.  It was very bright and not a star. It was not unlike other lights I have seen before that would dim and brighten and change colors.  This one only changed color slightly and it was not dramatic.  I had to make a quick stop and it was gone.  The next day I saw it but could not look at it for long due to trees and topography.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 6th I was driving through and glanced at the sky to look for it and did not see anything.

It had a small red light and a small white light on its right side.  That&#39;s it. I watched it go over the field. I was driving and it was so fast I did not get a picture.<n>

1/4/11 22:25|Felton|DE|Triangle|15 minutes|Three triangular objects with rotating, colored lights appear in the western night sky over a mid-Atlantic town.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79540.html|248|ndxe201101| Three triangular objects with rotating, colored lights appear in the western night sky over a mid-Atlantic town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 4, 2011, at approximately 21:00 hours, I was looking at the eastern sky.  It was a very clear evening; there was no overcast at all.  I noticed 3-4 triangular objects in the sky, which I believed were stars at first, but then I noticed that all of them were triangular.  Obviously, stars are not triangular in shape, and I thought it very odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That same evening, at approximately 22:25 hours, I witnessed three (3) objects in the western sky.  Each was triangular, although no structure was visible, with the exception of three colored lights in the form of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object #1 was on the left, or southernmost side of the group.  It was fairly high in the sky … a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.  From that altitude, I could only detect three (3) lights, which were white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object #2, was in the center of the group, and was very low, approximately 5,000 feet.  This object was the most visible; its 3 lights were rotating in a circular fashion and flashing colors of red, white and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object #3 was to the right of the group, or northernmost.  It was about the same altitude as the Object #1, and its three (3) lights appeared to be white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the three objects for approximately 15 minutes.  All of them were hovering in place, and there was no sound or engine noise whatsoever.  Object #2, in center position, continued to visibly rotate its three lights in colors of red, white and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, Object #3, on the right side of the group (northernmost) began to depart the group and moved in an easterly direction.  It moved at the pace of a fast moving aircraft.  However, I noticed that there were no strobe/blinking lights, as is customary in domestic aircraft.  And, again, there was no engine noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 seconds later, Object #1, on the left (southernmost), moved out as well, in the same easterly direction and at the same speed as Object #3.  It appeared to be following behind Object #3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 seconds later, Object #2, in the center position, which had been at an extremely low altitude, moved upwards very quickly; it was almost as if it was transported in seconds to approximately the same altitude as Objects #1 and #3.  When it attained the higher altitude, it also moved to the east, following Objects #3 and #1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to follow the trajectory of these objects because I elected to phone the State Police at this point (approximately 22:40 hours).  When I returned, the objects were nowhere in sight.  I did, however, notice that there were the same 3-4 triangular objects in the eastern sky as I had witnessed earlier, at approximately 21:00 hours.  There was no way for me to know if the three objects I had seen leave the western sky were the same as those I had previously seen at 21:00 hours and again at about 23:00 hours  in the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did receive a visit by the State Police, but they simply laughed the whole thing off and began questioning how long I had been living alone.  In all, it was a very upsetting experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one observer, myself.  I have a background as a 22 year career professional Project Manager for a Fortune 500 Company.  My expertise was in Corporate Tax, Telecommunications and Quality Control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with witness, and do not know what it was she witnessed.  Our first surmise was that she may have been looking at &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, but she assured us that stars were not the objects she was looking at.  We encouraged her to draw an illustration of the pattern of stars around the objects of interest, and then check the same areas of the night sky again on the next night.  We cannot be certain what it was she witnessed.  PD))<n>

If it was a low flying plane it would have still been seen in the short amount of time.  I tried to call my friend on my cell phone and i had no service.

1/4/11 19:00|Topeka|KS|Oval|30 to 40 minutes|Two different air-ships that traveled through a  city and traveling so low and making  no noise at all.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79712.html|254|ndxe201101| Two different air-ships that traveled through a  city and traveling so low and making  no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 7:00 pm on the 4th of January and I has just gone up to the bed-room window and looked out and seen this very big oval shaped object that was moving very, very slow and on the very right side and on the very left side of it had a big brite light that stayed on and all the way on top and the bottom was these different colored lights that were blinking, (some red, blue, green and maybe some yellow colors) and it had passed right over my building, (the one that I&#39;m living in) so it has passed through the middle of down town Topeka, Ks. and it was moving due-west from me, so after that finally had gone out of sight another UFO had just went over me again but this UFO was alot different, it had either one very-big brite light on it or it might have been a-few lights together but it would blink very, very slow but it&#39;s like it would come on for about one second and stay off for about 3 seconds and it was moving about five-times as fast than the first one was! moving at and their was no other lights on it so it could&#39;nt of had any wings on it and both of the UFO&#39;s was making NO-NOISE at all and was traveling the very same path that the first one was traveling, so the first UFO was moving at a speed of about 20 to 30 MPH,, but it&#39;s weird because no planes ever travel this path before, going through the down-town area and both of the UFO&#39;s were at or right below the cloud-deck hight but it was a very clear night at that time and the reason I remember all of this so good is because I wrote the sightings down and drew them both while it was fresh in my mind and I&#39;ve been living here in the same place for five years now and through the years of traveling around to different statea, (climbing trees for a living) and that I&#39;ve lived near a-few different air-force bases in my life and also I have always been a star-gazzer, even when I was a young-boy so I&#39;ve seen just about any and all different planes and their lights too so that&#39;s all! of the truth, as God is my witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know their are alot of &#34;Kids&#34; that make-up lies about this stuff but I&#39;d never say or do anything like that because it&#39;s wrong and it makes people to NOT believe when people like myself tell of what we have seen and I have seen other UFO&#39;s in my life-time and I&#39;ve &#34;Never-Ever&#34; reported them before but sence this happened right here in town and forbes air-force base is about 5 to 7 miles to my south and also I think that these UFO&#39;s might be their air-ships but I look at it and say why would they fly their air-ships right by us, so anyway that&#39;s about it,, thanks for listening and God Bless ya&#39;ll…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports of this alleged sighting were submitted to our Center.  We would welcome other reports, if people witnessed similar objects.  PD))<n>

I know for sure, it was the night that the tv show, &#34;V&#34; was going to air it&#39;s new mid-season, an hour before that, the tv froze on a single picture, and I heard that same loud sound which I heard in my 11-25-10 incident report.  It is a distinct, sound, coming up from the east going westward, and this time, I figured by God, if it is a UFO, at least I am going to get out there to look: (see below regarding the 11-25-10 incident...).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my door so I could see through the storm door window and there, floating over my apartment building coming into view heading west, was the  typical saucer shape craft.  It actually had the same sort of curved shape at the ship in the tv show from the 60&#39;s Lost In Space, your typical disk.  There was a black raised disk on the top, grey metallic in color, with a row of lighted squares in a ring around the craft - estimating from that, assuming these were half to three quarters the height of a man it was 3 floors, red constant lights on either side right and left, the craft did not rotate, and the bottom half looked much the same as the top but, no ring of windows, it had one white flashing beacon below in the center bottom, this light capped the bottom.  I would guess its width at 75 feet - 100 at most, height was I estimate a third to half as high as it was wide.  A very disc like craft, the entire sky around it seemed to glow a bluish grey light, like moonligh! t, which lit the craft quite well allowing me to see the detail of it, a grey silver lead like colored craft on a lighted background, the light surrounded and went with the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was at the height about equal to the building next door stood on end, no more than twice that in height...  Pacing it off, later in the spring, I estimated it&#39;s altitude at a little more than 250 feet, 500 feet at most, and I watched it as it passed down range until it went behind the building next door&#39;s roofline, this is a guesstimate but, perhaps 1000 feet away at the farthest when it was going out of sight.  When overhead, it was maybe 30 feet away to my south east and 250  feet overhead floating westward. As I said, this craft was so loud, though I have since seen it operate in silent mode.  It was almost as loud but not quite, as what I heard in the 11-25-10 incident  (see below) because, I figured it was hanging, right above, or resting on, the roof, the first time.  It had to be the same craft, or same type, by the sound if it, this is so loud, it sounds like the sky is tearing open when your right next to it (or in my case, I believe underneath it) t! hough that 1st time I did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, though I did not have a working camera with film, I grabbed a small red laser pointer I had, and pointed it at the craft.  It did not react, so I began flashing it back and forth, this was when (I require glasses to drive and read signs and was not wearing them), I noticed that in what I thought at first was lighted squares, there was actually shapes in them and moving slightly, these were figures of living beings, I am fairly certain.  This was when I got the impression/feeling, that it was not a good idea, like they did not like this, flashing my laser around but, I was desperate for them to see me.  That was when as it went out of sight, I had the impression, given or otherwise, of course they saw me, that was why they were there, to let me, see them.  I feel rather bad about this, I have since read, that they do not like camera flashes, so, I doubt they liked my laser at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since, seen this craft several times, and each time it has been either at a distance, behind the tree line to the west, or at a fair height overhead but, at no time has it come close again (each sighting was at night and it was not glowing like that, so it is harder to tell the height).  I hope someday, I can apologize in person, for the laser, maybe someday they will permit me a low pass again and I can get a few pictures the next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous Hearing Report; believe same craft...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Nov 25th, at 12:20am Thanksgiving morning of 2010, a morning when there was no snow to speak of here, in Holts Summit Missouri but there were fall leaves, on the ground...  I was watching my usual Thanksgiving movie marathon, laying on the couch in front of my front window (just fyi - the windows faced west) probably starting it around 10pm, I fell asleep about 11pm more or less, awakened suddenly some hour later, by the sound of someone walking around outside my apartment in the leaves.  This is not unusual but, we do have sidewalks and at that time of night, it is a bit strange, knowing each one personally, most of the people here then, were not ordinarily, walking around at that time of night and would not have been outside the windows of my unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being a bit sleepy yet, I opened the drapes and looked outside.  Seeing nothing, I thought perhaps, it was a squirrel, we have a number of large ones that live in the area.  I was, as I said, half sleepy but, moments later, when a small white light appeared over the center sidewalk between my 4 plex building and the 4 plex next to it, at a height of about 15&#39;, it caught my attention in my peripheral vision through the sheer drapes I had up at the time.  As near as I can figure, it must have been moving to this point, which is what caught my eye...at that moment it burst into the brightest white light I have ever seen, a blinding flash of light, with sparks trailing toward the ground which went out, at that exact moment of the flash, I felt, as much as saw it, like; &#34;zzzappp&#34; a very strange occurrence which I will not ever, forget.  I jumped at that, extricating myself from the blanket I was under, moving to the front door, which was at the end of the couch by m! y head, perhaps 30 seconds had elapsed since being awakened...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to open it, when I thought, wait, I have no idea who or what is out there, so, I carefully draw back the sheer curtains, look out again, and could see nothing.  I reached to grab the door handle and was about to turn it to open the door and go outside, when a loud roaring sound fired up, this was immediately over my head, like it was on the center of my roof area and it honestly, was so extraordinarily loud it scared the hell out of me.  It was like someone tearing the sky open!!!! Now I am a grown man, at that point in my late 40&#39;s, and do not scare easily but, this was many times the sound of the space shuttle launch on tv, so loud it vibrated in my body and I could feel it, so loud, that I immediately dropped to a crouching position thinking perhaps the nearby Nuclear Power Plant that had blown up (a flash and roaring boom, it sort of, fit), expecting to be dead in a second I remained crouched down scared half to death but, it just got louder, and louder and then, this immense sound, began to lift away from my apartment roof...  This &#39;loud sound&#39;, did not go west, east, north, or south, it went vertical, straight upward, and continued doing so, putting distance between it and me.  This was the first moment that I began to comprehend that it was something other than the nuclear power plant...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this thing lifted away it quickly got softer, then faded completely in about 15 seconds,  yes, I should have gone out and looked but, it was gone so fast, had I gone out, I doubt I would have seen anything, and I honestly, it all happened so fast, the entire event being perhaps 2minutes in length, and I was truly frightened at first.  Even as the craft departed, I stood there, hand on the door knob, trying to dummon the courage to go outside, I never did.  It may be easy to say &#34;I would have gone outside to look&#34; but, in that instant when this, loudest sound I&#39;d ever heard, like being underneath a booster rocket of the space shuttle, was probably 20-25&#39; from me, over the top of me, you can&#39;t think, you just react and the natural reaction is to duck down and hide...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I carefully walked the grounds but, could find nothing.  I asked around that day, all the neighbors, except the little 98 year old woman next door to me, whom was napping at that time of the afternoon, and no one said they saw anything.  One or two, said they had heard loud jets lately, and one woman said she heard, a low flying jet, late the night before...whether they saw anything and are unwilling to admit it, I can only guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a couple of days before I had an opportunity to speak to the little old lady next door but, when I did, she said; &#34;Ohhh good, you heard that too&#34;, that morning after midnight, she heard an extremely loud, roaring noise, and got up, went to her door and opening it, saw &#34;white smoke rolling at her away from the fence which boundaries the north side of the property (about 25 feet from her front door), immediately shutting her door, she returned to her bed and covered her head, terrified, she said.  I told her, I did not blame her, &#34;it scared even me, I have never heard anything so loud&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really strange thing about this incident, well, one thing, was if this was a craft that landed or suspended over my roof, who was walking around outside my window while I slept.  Had they been inside?  Was I abducted, and have no memory?  What exactly was that, bright white flash?  Why, did I feel it?  Since then, I have seen this craft, in fact they are quite regular visitors now.  Are they interested in my area, in my apartment complex? In me?  I have many, questions?  No answers....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since this time, seen several craft which were, also loud like this.  Maybe the same craft, many times...  I know UFO&#39;s are generally silent, which is odd but, this craft or one&#39;s like it, though unseen on this occasion, returned many times, the next time, I did clearly see it (ie: above 01-04-11 sighting).  I had throughout my years seen lights way up in the sky moving oddly, blinking, etc., however, nothing I could absolutely say was a craft, or a UFO, until 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were talking on our cell phones and I related this incident.  Before hanging up, I happened to say, I don&#39;t know what, it was, but, I really would like to see one up close, I did only a couple weeks later, perhaps they were listening?<n>

This object did not fizzle out, or have a tail.  It was very very high up.

I was walking slower than him, as I was smoking, and looking up at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in a SW direction, at a bright star, or pehaps it is Venus or Mercury; I do not know, but I turned and looked to the East, at the Big Dipper, and then turned back to look again at the bright star/planet, when to the SSW, at approximately a 30 degree angle, I saw 6 evenly spaced white lights, at angles, approaching in a ENE direction, and then make a sudden banking turn left, or counterclockwise, much like a kite might turn, back towards the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a full view of the bottom of the object, which was triangle-shaped, without the points, dark with single white lights on either side of the three blunt ends, and a circle of approximately ten to twelve lesser white lights about half way towards the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The turn was impossibly tight, silent and very fluid; Too tight to be any kind of aircraft I have ever seen, and I have seen many, having spent ten years as a flying crewchief  in the U.S. Air Force, as well as  growing up within a mile of a busy airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see the object quite vividly, as it was silouetted in front of a thin white cloud cover, almost like a light fog, moving in from the South, and it actually moved into the clouds, immediately after turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the front door of the apartment house, still trying to watch the object, and called my friend to come back and see it, when someone turned on a fairly powerful spotlight on the ground, approximately SSW of my position, and shined it straight up at the object. The object and spotlight positions could not have been more than a half-mile from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my friend got back outside, the object had moved into the clouds sufficiently that it was no longer visible, and the spotlight was turned off, so that my friend saw nothing, unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We scanned the entire sky, hoping to see the object, or anything else that might be in the area, but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that in the month I have been living at my present address, I have not seen any low-flying aircraft, and concluded that there is no airport of any type near this town, but this may not be an accurate accessment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a crude drawing of the event, and will attempt to scan it into my laptop, and include it with this written statement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first there were 4, lights in a straight line, then the lights made an almost rectangular shape.  The only difference between the shape i seen and a rectangle was that if you picture a rectangle and the bottom 2, angles were further apart than the top 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the lights completely vanished.<n>

I called my wife outside to see Jupiter in the night sky.  Which was bright and by it&#39;s self overhead facing south west. Until, just north of Jupiter, we saw what appeared to be a plane tracking north from the south.  It was moving around the same speed as the I.S.S. the last time I had seen it, when the space shuttle was 10 seconds behind about to dock.  It appeared as two lights side by side, one light on the east and one on west side. No blinking lights, and no red or green.  Just like watching satellites, it appeared in the sky and moved at one speed in one direction.  Until it got little north of us overhead and disappeared. I know what planes in the night sky look like and I&#39;ve seen many of satellites.  What ever we saw that night had to have been two objects flying together or one massive object.<n>

My friend told me it was a planet but I refused to believe it and kept staring at it. It looked like it was moving and starting to form a sort of trail, I do not know if it was or was not moving though. As I was staring at another dot to the right of it, same description, but it was not as bright. Pretty soon there were six of these dots in the sky forming two triangles.  They were both an obtuse shape and both were the same exact shape.  They were not in any sort of formation though. The lights sat there for about 5 minutes.  We had stoppped at the Pep Boys on Lincoln highway and there were several people that had noticed the lights also and were also looking.  Nobody seemed frantic but everybody was very curious.  I have no background in any of this but I was told they were likely meteors.  I do not believe they were but that is the beauty of it.  I saw something that I can not explain.<n>

The light went away from us, and then returned over us and remained going in this direction until we could see it no more.  We could only see a light, no shapes.  It just looked like a big star in the sky as it was in the sky very high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night was actually very cold, and there was fog, but we could still see the light quite clearly.  There was no sounds or anything things else with the light.

All of us kids were bored so we decided to go for a walk. We decided to walk towards our friend’s house. He lives just about 5 minutes up the road from my house.  We didn’t feel like taking the road so we decided to take a short cut through the woods. It was pitch black out so we were using our friend’s cell phone for a light.  He had three bars of battery left and we knew we could make it. We were crossing the railroad bridge when we saw a glow in the middle of the woods.   As we got closer, our friend’s phone shut off! The battery had died and it would not turn back on. We kept walking towards the green light.  It kept getting closer and closer and moving back and forth across the woods.   It suddenly disappeared and we saw a shape glowing towards the sky.  We were all afraid and in tears so we headed back to my house. Once we got back we explained the story to the adults and they thought we were crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We grabbed a camera and flashlights to see this time and to prove to the adults that we were not lying. Hoping it would still be there or come back, we headed back to where it was. Once we got across the bridge this time, the glow was hanging in the sky right above us. The flashlights began to flash on and off and then it was gone.  The flashlights went back to normal. We asked our friend to turn his phone on and see if it would work and sure enough he had three bars on his battery and it was back to normal.<n>

It moved away on a 45 degree angel and changed shape.  It appeared to have flames around the bottom and bright light in the middle with florescent green.  It zig zagged and moved up into the sky until it just disapeared. We took video of the object.  We were watching tv in our living room which has a large sliding glass door.  We saw the strange sphere and run out on our porch where we watched it and videoed it.<n>

I am 47 years old and worked in Law Enforcement for 6 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home to Portage, Wisconsin from Madison, Wisconsin. I was driving north on State Highway 51 approaching Johnson Auto Sales (N1255 US Highway 51, Arlington, WI). My Son (14 years old) was in the front passenger seat, my wife was in the back seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an extremely low flying aircraft in the sky just northwest of Johnson sales.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly to the south, toward my vehicle.  Hwy 51 was busy with traffic, vehicles were northbound behind me and in front of me.  There were also several vehicles passing me southbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed to the aircraft and asked my son what he thought it was.  My son said he thought it might be a helicopter.  My wife, a Nurse, said that maybe it was a med-flight helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft continued to move southeast and began hovering just west of my car, right over the Johnson Sales retail store. I slowed way down and could immediately see that the aircraft was not a helicopter or a conventional airplane.  It was hovering approximately 1000 ft above Johnson sales.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I both saw that the aircraft had two distinct white headlamps.  The headlamps had approximately 20 feet of separation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw a third white headlamp toward the rear of the aircraft... and all three headlamps formed a triangle).  There were two blue lights on the right triangular wing, and two red lights on the left triangular wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The body shape of the aircraft closely resembled that of a thin triangular spur. I rolled my window down expecting to hear an aircraft engine or rotor blades, but the aircraft was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the Johnson Sales parking lot.  The aircraft immediately moved silently and slowly to the south, almost as though it knew we were trying to observe it more closely.  My wife was afraid and asked me not to try to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft continued to move south and I drove my family home.  My son, 14 years old, drew a sketch of the aircraft and we just can&#39;t seem to stop talking and thinking about this remarkable event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many vehicles on Hwy 51 at the time, and I was just wondering if anyone else may have reported seeing this strange aircraft.  If so, I would be interested to know.<n>

Couldn&#39;t guess the altitude but it was near enough to see the colour changes quite distinctly.  Changing colours rapidly - white, green, red, amber, pink, blue and yellow.  Looks like a Christmas ornament as the colours flashed in and out.  Hovering, but doesn’t seem to be moving in the sky any more than a star would.   Atmospherics?   We saw something identical some months ago and reported it.<n>

I managed to see it too for about 45 seconds, before it arced and was obscured by buildings.  It was a brilliant orange fire colour and I asked my husband if he thought it was a small plane that had caught fire. He stated no as there appeared to be no &#34;tail,&#34; it was too round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The height of it could have been about 2,000 feet but hard to tell.  It definitely wasn’t a meteor, or space debris entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere, which we&#39;ve seen many times before.  It was very silent and moving slowly as though with purpose.<n>

While observing them with binoculars, another light flew down near the others. Like it was going to close to the ground.

The sky seems wery active tonight and we are continuing to see more strange things. the time started around 7:00 pm and it is now 7:43.  Again the objects were too close to all be aircraft because they looked like they would have colided in mid air.  Then very suddenly the moved very quickly.  There must be more witnesses from the reaction of the cars pulling over to the side of the road.<n>

Object flew from the south west horizon to the north west horizon until it was out of sight. I was able to call my step-son of eight years old to come look at the object. He was very scared and said it looked like an asteroid coming to earth. I was able to take a couple of photos of the object, one with a iphone and another 2 with a canon camera. None of great quality. I have seen many objects in the night sky, but this is the first to say I have no idea what the heck this was. Contacted the national weather service to see if any weather instruments where being used in the area. (None) No abnormal weather conditions exist from forecast office out of Miami.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photo- fire like from a missile, but not visible aircraft or con-trail. Haze around fire.<n>

We watch it come right across in front of us and than at a second notice disappear right in front of our eyes.  There is no way that a plane could turn that fast or travel at that speed.

I have never been so scared in my life. also seen an orb type light moving around the tree line which i only seen once.and it scared me half to death, i yelled to see possibly someone hunting in our woods, no answer but it did move way left and would slighty change to a redish color. i went inside i was so freaked. it diddnt make sense neither, if i would even slightly move to the side i couldnt see it, like it was way back in and i just seen a light through the trees or something, but when it moved it didnt change at all&lt; didnt flash between trees like it wouldve if it were actually in the forest, it was like it was just out side of treeline, but even then while mving and staying totally constant i would move my head to the side or somethin and it would dissapear and then id go back to the exact spot! and id see it again it dont make any sense to me how thats possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so. freaking. weird. and nobody lives in that direction for a very long distance no houses no nothing, theres a river way back there that would be hard to cross too. ive never seen a person out there niether. i keep taking pictures, but its on a blackberry from like 09 or somethin and camera sucks, all that shows is blackness. but they look like stars, move in rapid ways randomly that dosnt make sense to me why, and sometimes just remain constant. if you would like more info or if these pics would come in handy to you my email is anthonykeagle@yahoo.com lots of the latest youtube vids from all over the world are pretty similiar, but i have yet to see one with this amounts of them. the characteristics of them would vary slightly, some brighter some were dim, some appear to be spinning, and some flash. I will do my best to get ahold of a better camera and email pic<n>

I looked sideways and saw something that did not budge.  I found it strange and kept looking.  There were three round lights on the underside of a light green, white in the middle and right light orange.  The lights were strong and were suddenly little intense.   I called my husband who was sleeping and when he came to the object has moved slightly to the right.  The lights are still getting stronger,   And my husband was in the garage to get the binoculars the object as it moved upward.  Not hear any sound, but it moved with the lightness that I love. It seemed a pity flying.   When my husband came with the binoculars I saw something that was not here on earth.  Nothing I&#39;ve ever seen with my eyes. I was about 4 to 6 miles away from my window and loudly.  Had a disc format and the lights were only on the bottom of it.  Unfortunately began to blow and the clouds hid the object.  Yet I am sure he saw something that o! nly I saw on television. I was delighted.<n>

As i return home standing out on my pourch i notice a train being left in the clouds above me maybe about 500 to 700 feet up as ling as a football feild was the length of the trail the object was not seen almost transparent as it quickly moved across the sky then off in the distance about 7 miles away i notice a haze forming in the clouds not a natural formation this haze was in the form of a large object with clusters of smaller hazes surrounding it. then out of nowhere they all vanish.<n>
1/1/11 22:27|Doylestown|PA|Fireball|10 minutes|Witnessed approximately 70 flaming balls travel across the eastern sky in a semi circular trajectory.|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79491.html|286|ndxe201101| Witnessed approximately 70 flaming balls travel across the eastern sky in a semi circular trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of January 1, 2011 I picked up my girlfriend from her place of work, off of S. Clinton St. across from the Doylestown train station.  The time was approximately 10:25pm EST.  We proceeded to drive south on Clinton street making our way towards Hart Ave.  While continuing down the hill I noticed numerous bright objects in the eastern sky.  It was immediately evident that this was at the least something uncommon or unusual.  We made a left turn at Hart ave. and pulled into a parking lot behind a bank.  At this point we both exited the vehicle and stood in the parking lot to get a better look.  The time at this point must have been about 10:27pm EST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially we saw about twenty of these objects moving relatively slow from south to north across the eastern sky.  They were following a semi circular trajectory, appearing out of the dark in the southeastern sky, moving towards our position slightly while continuing north.  After covering much the length of the sky, they began gaining altitude and moving away from us before disappearing again into the darkness.  They continued in a constant stream like this for about ten minutes, with new ones appearing in the south east as they disappeared to the northeast.  For the most part, at any point in time there was somewhere between 15-20 of these in the sky at once.  They all followed the same general trajectory but individualy they carried there own paths(almost as though they were travelling in formation and connected by a string).  As they made their way across the sky, most of them maintained their relative positions to each other.  However some of them were bobbing around.  ! They all seemed to maintain a constant speed the entire time.  At 10:36 a placed a phone call to mother for her to meet me in town and bring a camera.  At about this time the lights started to appear in fewer numbers.  Eventually dwindling to about 2 or 3.  Finally the last one went across at about 10:40.  Of interested note, shortly before the last one went across the sky my girlfriend and I heard the sound of a jet, but did not visualize any planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no point in time did the objects make any type of noise, additionally, they moved unlike any aerial manned objects I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects themselves looked like balls of fire.  Some were slightly larger and brighter than others.  They ranged in color from a deep red to bright yellowish-orange.  However all had an appearance similar to that of a campfire at a distance.  They almost looked like bioluminescent deep sea creatures moving in the pitch dark of the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is difficult for me to judge the altitude of these objects, I can say they appeared to be flying much lower than a typical commercial liner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially when we first exited the vehicle, I freaked out on my girlfriend because she didn&#39;t know how to use her crummy camera phone(blackberry), however we did get it working and managed to snap a couple pictures.  The pictures by no means do justice to what we saw, and the actual objects appeared much brigher, larger, and in greater numbers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read stories and seen videos of the chinese lanterns, and though they look similar, I stuggle to understand how they would appear/disappear, change color/size, and follow a semi cirular trajectory.  I am also unaware of any local group that releases such lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, there was some light fog with an overcast sky.  It was difficult for me to tell how low the cloud cover was.  About 30 minutes after arriving back home it began to rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I watched the fireworks, I turned the opposite direction and began to walk towards the house, when I noticed a strongly flashing star above the tree line.  Having seen my share of satelites, planes, shooting stars and whatever else you can think of, It immediatly caught my attention as something more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it began to move from side to side in a jerky motion.  I ran inside to get my boyfriend, and we ran out and watched for a good 15 minutes as it flashed and pulsated. It was far enough in the distance, that we couldnt make out any direct shape, but the pulsating flashes and irregular dashes too and fro; as well as the way it seemed to almost completely dim, then flash to life again in blues,and yellows and red. What probably made me even notice it the first, is that the light stood out so strong against the light pollution/city smog.  It stood out so srongly, where other stars and planes were lost in the orangish haze.  This light pulsated, and hovered to and fro, for near 15 or twenty minutes. I only wish it would have been closser to make out further details. it was undoubtably something strange.. and no way could anyone pass it off as &#39;weather ballons&#39;.. or anything else.<n>

I tried to video without success but my wife and I watched the object until it traveled out of our line of sight. The object appeared to be about 45deg of horizon and the speed appeared to be about the same as a passenger plane would be on airport approach. Object appeared to be at an altitude of maybe 1500 ft. . Speed of the object was constant from our vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Concealed at first by clouds, seeming to emerge below them perhaps descending to a lower altitude, the pair carried on their southern bearing out of view at a steady rate of speed.  At first mistaken as shooting stars, then thought to be seagulls which typically wouldn&#39;t be flying in small numbers at this time of night, no other seagulls were seen in the area.  They looked to be following the western shore of Lake Huron, 1.5 km west of my residence.<n>

It was around 5 or 6 pm in januari 2011.  It moved pretty quick, then stood still, decided to go to the side then stand still again. After a few seconds it dissapeared.  It looked like a orange/red ball of light. I didnt make any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I saw 1 around may. I biked home and when I was home I walked up the stairs and saw this orange/red ball of light again.  It was moving quickly to which would be east.  Again no sound. It should have been around 19:00 (7 pm)  But im not sure of this as it was a while ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive also have seen pretty rare lights, it was back in 2010 when i went with my ex to lelystad.  Back then I lived in Zwolle in the netherlands.  We both saw a very orange &#39;part&#39; of the sky.  The rest of the sky was dark.  It should have been around 1 am. Or 1:00.  It completely differed from the rest of the sky.  Bright orange.  I never had any explanation for this. Me and my ex where amazed. It looked oval or round.<n>

There were no clouds in the sky, temperature was about 30 degrees celcius.  I looked up at an object in the sky , it was a oval kind of shape, silvery white colour which was what caught my eye. It didn&#39;t really look like a plane because the shape was oval like shaped and there were no blinking lights. I kept staring at it to see what it was.  The object did something strange, it seemed like it turned and another side of the object can be seen, it was like a mirror image on the other side all of a sudden very strong silvery white colour. It looked like it opened out, rotated a bit, then closed in and disappeared.  I kept staring at the sky, to see what would have covered it, but as i mentioned there were no clouds at all, there was no place for it to go.  It seemed like camouflaged with the blue sky! As things can not disappear or become invisible. Also what goes up must c! ome down. I still kept staring at the sky but nothing reappeared even after 30 seconds.<n>

I got out of my car and lined a tree up in front of the light to judge if the light was moving or still. I stood there for an addition 10 min. and realized it was staying in basically the same spot not getting closer or farther nor did the light fade. I finally went inside and I have not been able explain what it was. unless there was a star that was very bright on this particular night. It was just a bright light towards the south east that seemed to be to close and to bright for a star but couldn&#39;t have been an airplane because the position stayed the! same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I observed five to six objects flying from south to north on the western side of the sky. The objects appeared to be at different altitudes from each other but in formation. They where approximately at 45 to 50 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought  they were meteors. However, I observed them for 35 to 45 seconds. 	  I used my binoculars to take a closer look. The light they emitted were the  color of road flares and were very bright. They would dim slightly and become bright again. The altitude appeared to be to high for a helicopter and was about the usual altitude that airplanes take when approaching an airport. I could see the light appeared to be located at the bottom of the craft and there were no navigation lights on the craft. I have seen fighter jets flying at night and these did not appear to be jets. They were traveling at a speed slightly faster than a commercial jet and maintained a straight course except for changing altitude. I lost sight of them due to ground obstructions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes passed and I observed one more object flare up and take a similar flight course to the previous 5. I observed this object for approximately 25 to 30 seconds until I lost sight of it due to ground obstructions and light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a someone who was in Orlando at the time and told that person what I had observed. This person observed something similar approximately 10 to 15 minutes after my incident. I hope someone else observed what I did and maybe can provide a logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought that a flare got caught in some kind of wind current and was moving in a southbound direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I found that the flare was not extinguishing and seemed to be winking periodically. Then, all of a sudden a next one appeared slightly more north easterly and vectored to intersect the first one, which just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I am wondering if this is some kind of balloon with a flare attached. The fireworks somewhat stopped but this thing began to change direction and even slow, and then rapidly turn east, then slow again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only when the object paused (10 sec)right in front of my house (about 200ft up)I suddenly realized that this was not a flare because its form became visible and I was looking at what could only be described as a glowing red ball but the light was moving through out the body of the ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I observed this thing until it flew out of sight changing direction often.

They appeared to be in a V or backwards check formation. There were two crafts to the right of the center or lead craft and four on the left side. As I continued my observation, it appeared that the formation was gaining altitude as the lights were beginning to fade. The lights completely faded out where I could no longer make out the individual crafts and it now appeared as a large glowing orb. This continued for approx. for 5 more minutes until it to faded from view. The entire incident lasted for approx. 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At one point we wal! ked by another woman who was also witnessing this phenomenon, and she expressed how she had never seen anything like this, either.  We aren&#39;t sure if this continued on, as we were cold and tired and headed into our rooms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later contacted the FSS and was told that the surface winds were very light, and winds at 500 millibars were southwesterly at 10 knots(at 4 am).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I look to the sky and see a triangle looking thing.  It appears to be traveling very fast from West to East.  It looked as if it had numerous red/orange orbs around its perimeter.  We all looked at it amazed and all shouted that is a UFO.  Others from different homes were running thru backyards looking up in the sky following it.  They were amazed as well.  A member in our party pulled out their cell phone and captured a video of it.  I never saw anything like that ever before in my life.  I immediately looked up someone I could call to report this.  I found the UFO Center and called and spoke to a man and reported it.  He mentioned that there were other reports of the same type of thing.  I am interested in finding out more about this.

Thinking about U.F.O. 15 minutes before this happened which was kinda strange. Looked to be a no sound fire in middle of something square shaped while flying straight and not bobbling at all. Showed a witness who was sitting down on floor who saw it out window from there sitting position. I ran to get camera but the square shape Fire in middle U.F.O. was gone and should of been able to see it. Then Monday around 2 O&#39;clock on channel 9 MGN news reported like 5,000 black Birds found dead all over Illinois on roofs of peoples homes. Then another report of about 5,000 certain type of fish was found dead New Year Morning. I can&#39;t confirm it was 5,000 Black Birds and 5,000 Fish my numbers can be off. I am not sure fireworks all over Illinois do that to just Black Birds or a certain type of fish. Well, I can&#39;t confirm this was a Chinese Candle or Moving Flares. I was! thinking this was an Invisible object that powered on to get away from the Fireworks (maybe). Why just black birds and a certain type of fish? I think what I saw had to do with these dead Black birds and Certain type of goldfish. I am going to find about now about this dead animal report. I think U.F.O. it was headed toward Mount greenwood near Chicago. Look about 40 feet long dark red square craft with fire in the middle. It was around 1000 to 2000 thousand feet hight in the air. Moving about 175 miles an hour I am guessing. Find the news WGN report was played January 3 2011 WGN News Chicago about the dead birds and animal found everywhere. Hope there is other who heard this story on the 3rd of January and I hope others saw the UFO on New Years after Midnight during the celebration. The U.F.O left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I know the sound of choppers and planes. I also know light patterns that these aircraft must use. There were no blinking lights and no green lights in the this sighting. I am a beleiver of outsiders but of course i dont fear them, but it was very interesting seeing this object flying upward (vertically), not horizontally. Afterwards, I saw 3 choppers scattered around the valley make their appearance shortly after my sightinging. Then I saw a superfast object with blinking lights (green and red).... either a jet but im thinking it was a sattelite trying to pickup the trace. I saw it above the northern part of SLC. Not sure if it came from Wasatch Mountains or from the city itself. When I stepped outside seeing it at the beginning of my sighting I would estimate it&#39;s altitude from the ground at ~ 5-7k feet up. I noticed it as I headed to the front door! and heard the neighbors making racket of the new year (which i dont mind). I&#39;m 20 years old and I have had 1 OTHER EXPERIENCE where i saw a UFO 30 feet away from me. Take in mind not to associate UFO with aliens but with an unidentified object. Never been so scared and startled in my damn life from the previous experiece. But thats another story...<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------- So the facts are: -Very Bright orange aura ~ 5-7k feet above ground when i first saw it -Had no blinking lights at all but a strong solid orange glow! -Was heading upward with slight zig zag movements at one point then went straight up -I never saw a speed increase but it&#39;s hard to judge at that distance -I watched it until it left the atmosphere.... I have very good eyes and i watched it until i could not find it in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -3 hellicopters appeared around the valley( I&#39;m from delaware and i know choppers)... They wernt regular news choppers or anything. I&#39;m thinkin military but THAT is just a GUESS -saw a very fast moving object with blinking light ~ 5-10 min afterwards move right past where the object was moving. I beleive this to be a satellite high in the atmosphere scanning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------- I saw something of great importance but email me back or call me if u find anyone else that shares the same sighting. Pardon my sloppy typing, for I am a lazy typer but i did get my message across.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was able to track these objects for about 10 to 12 minutes before they entered obscurity in the clouds, or their inherent light source went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects appeared to originate from the same ground location.  Their apparent angular separation ranged from about ½ degree to 2 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My supposition is that they were large balloons carrying an ignition source well below the balloons themselves (to keep from burning the balloons).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light they gave off was mostly white, with a slight reddish tinge.  The time of their disappearance was approximately 00:20 am.  From the time of first notice, to final disappearance, they traveled approximately 55 degrees azimuthally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought I would write this in case anyone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About midway through November, in the late afternoon, I saw two similarly-sized objects, with about the same apparent luminosity.  They, however (or at least at the time I noticed them), were separated by about 30 degrees, and had much different trajectories.  It is quite possible that their point of origination was also in NE Mentone – perhaps these were test flights?<n>

We were all in the living room, watching the countdown to the New Year on television and were waiting to toast the event. The ages of the people were as follows:  One male 13 year old One male 15 year old One male 24 year old One female (approximately 23 years old ) One male 48 year old One female 48 year old  At approximately 12:02am, we all stepped out onto our deck to scream “Happy new Year” and to listed for others celebrating with fireworks, etc. Almost immediately, someone in the group shouted, “look at those lights!”  We all looked South and observed four orange lights in the shape of orbs. The lights appeared to be more or less, evenly spaced from left to right (East to west) and were clearly moving Northward, toward our location.  Two of our group began to film the objects with cell phone video cameras, while all of us talked and shouted over one another, identifying the obvious reasons why these objects could not be aircraft or other known manmade crafts. Those observations will be detailed below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects came nearer, I (The 48 year old male in the group) decided to run down to the basement and get my video camera. I obtained the camera and went into our backyard, below and in front of the deck, where the rest of the group was still positioned, observing the objects…. Now, considerably closer than when I had left. As the objects continued to get closer, I could see that they were somewhat offset, as well as spaced apart. More specifically, there was one in the lead, the second was a bit off of the left and back and so forth. The “formation” was similar to military aircraft formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects began to pass overhead, the rear most one, began to dim at a constant pace until it appeared to vanish before our eyes. The remaining three continued on and flew over our heads and ass that happened, the trailing object began to increase its speed dramatically. That object was moving directly toward the object that was second in line and it appeared as though the last one was going to collide with the middle one. It sped up and raced right up to the middle one and appeared to pass within inches of that object. As it passed, it’s light began to dim and then the object vanished. Moments later, as we watched the remaining two objects continue North, they both dimmed out and vanished as well. With the lights out, I could still see the unlit object continuing north for a moment, until it was absorbed by the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As all of us were talking over one another about what we had witnessed, someone directed our attention to the south, where we observed three more objects heading toward us in the exact same fashion. These objects were duplicates of the four that we had just seen. The 24 year old male in the group shouted, “I’m going to go get my laser light, and he ran into the house. The rest of us watched as these three orange lights continued north toward us. As they were at about the 2 o’clock  position on the horizon, the rearmost object dimmed it’s lights rapidly until it literally vanished before our eyes. The remaining two continued toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 24 year old male returned to the deck with his laser and activated it. There was a brief exchange regarding the law forbidding pointing lasers at aircraft. He proclaimed what we all knew, that these were not aircraft and the law did not apply. We quickly discussed the possibility of an alien misreading the laser as a threat and the 24 year old stated that he was sure that they would be able to identify it as a simple beam of light. With that, he directed the green laser at the rearmost object, which was now passing directly overhead.  All of us were surprised to see the object illuminate with the green reflection of the laser beam. Seeing this, confirmed that the objects were much lower and smaller than we had originally thought. The two objects continued north to about the 10 o’clock position and then simultaneously dimmed out and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Items Of Interest:  There is a commercial flight path within sight of this location, however it runs from south to southwest. There has never been a commercial or private aircraft that has flown in this path, since we have lived here. That is almost six years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these objects flew directly over the Quantico Marine Base. This base does not have a lot of aircraft activity. In the past 5 and a half years, I have only seen four helicopters and no fighter/fast mover type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All aircraft are required to display one red and one green light, in addition to landing lights while on approach to an airport. There were no green, red, white or flashing lights on these objects whatsoever. These objects were illuminated with an orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us hear any sound associated with these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had any physiological or psychological reactions, other than great excitement, to these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of our group, three of the adults believe in and have observed UFOs in the past. The 23 year old female did not believe in UFOs but has been profoundly affected by this experience. The two children have witnessed unexplained lights (with the adults present) in the past, and seem stressed about the possibility of the lights being associated with alien life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 48 year old male is a retired “Big City” police officer and is currently an investigator for a federal agency. He is also a Veteran Army Paratrooper. Because of the sensitive nature of his career, he is deeply concerned about being identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five of the people in this group are related. Husband and wife, father and three sons, Three of the adults in this group have had multiple UFO sightings throughout 2010.<n>

It was New Year&#39;s Eve night and my mom noticed two red-glowing lights in the sky towards the North.  They hovered across the entire sky and flew past the horizon, making no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15 minutes later four more red-orange glowing lights appeared in the sky.  Upon this taking place, my father ran inside and quickly grabbed his video recorded.  He recorded two of the objects as they hovered overhead.  One of the lights quickly darted to the North, stayed there for a couple of seconds, and flew right back to its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately, the light that re-positioned itself where it was started floating above the other light and disappeared.  About two minutes after the first light disappeared, the second light was gone as well.<n>

We decided to peak out the window to share in their revelry and noticed this red light passing through our field of vision. This was at 12:00AM. At first I thought it was a red stray firework light but it continued heading North East from our location. We watched in amazement for around 10-15 seconds and then ran outside to see if the light was still there. And it was. For at least another 45 seconds to a minute. Then we finally lost it through the trees as it approached Aberdeen Proving Grounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was red and did not pulsate but rather stayed the same brightness as it silently moved across the sky. There were no tails to the light which ruled out a meteorite and there were no light drippings as would be seen from a flare or in our case, firework. It was difficult to determine how high the light was in the sky but it appeared to us that it was either lower than a normal helicopter or plane, or it was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve been looking all over to see if anyone else had seen this occurrence. Please let us know if you hear anymore on this<n>

The light started low from the left in an arching motion, then as it finished its arch flattened out and straight lined across the sky.  It moved at a very swift rate of speed and looked like just another star.  However the trajectory and speed could be nothing like a star or anything Ive ever seen.  Two different movements.  Arching like a rainbow and then flattening out with great speed. Never a believer or witness to such unexplainable sighting, I&#39;m set back by it.  I&#39;m sure this was definitely a UFO.Nothing I know of could move like this.  Again it just looked like a star but moved like no star can.  And definitely not any kind of airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights moved slowly and I thought they were planes but they were too close together to be planes and did not move in a straight line.  The lights moved from south to west and appeared in the lower half of the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband came over and watched as well and we could not figure out what it could possibly be.  I called the police station in the morning to see if they had had any calls.  They did not report any other calls and did not offer any explanations as to the source of the lights.<n>
