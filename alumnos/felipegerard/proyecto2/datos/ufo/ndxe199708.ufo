All three appeard fuzzy or out of focus.  They appeared to be moving at the same speed as the satellites we had been observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, a female friend, and I were looking for satellites.  We were facing west, and it was a clear night.  We watched three or four satellites pass almost directly over-head, when my wife&#39;s friend said she&#39;d spotted another satellite. I raised my binoculars and noticed not one but thee oblong or oval objecs, each appearing &#34;blured&#34; or out of focus  All three were in formation, one directly behind the leader, the third &#34;above&#34; and a bit behind the second one. As the three objects moved together across the stars behind them, I could see stars &#34;beween&#34; the objects, indicating it was in fact three objects and not one. The objects appeared to be moving at approximately the same rate as a passing satellite.  The objects were in view for approximately 30-40 seconds, then they passed behind some high, thin cirrus clouds and we lost sight of them. All thre of  us saw the objects, and all three described the same thing.<n>

Est. object length at 1 mile +.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On about August 31, 1997 at about 10:30 p.m. I was traveling with my 8-yr. old daughter (Bridget) east on Xway from Brighton, MI toward Detroit (I-96).  Traffic was medium both ways.  We were east of the Brighton exit and about 5 miles west of the South Lyon exits on the map. There was a full bright yellowish moon but very high and heavy dense but thinner cloud cover.  There were occasional breaks in the clouds and stars were clear and bright there. Bridget said &#34;What&#39;s that light, Dad?&#34;  I had been concentrating on the road.  Straight ahead of us and appearing (feeling) to be above and slightly north of downtown Detroit was an object I first related to a giant &#34;harmonica&#34; tilted from 12:00 position to 4:00 position. It was visible through a large break in the clouds and was above the cloud layer.  I guestimate that the cloud layer was above 20,000 ft.  The &#39;feeling&#39; about the object was that it was &#39;enormous&#39; - surely a mile or more in length and 20% of that in thickness.  We did not see depth.  It appeared to be stationary. At this time I only recall two to four rows of rectangular windows.  Each window symetrically directly above the window below, each row about a window&#39;s depth apart.  About 20 to 30 windows per row.  What remains clearest is that each window was &#39;square&#39; and extremely brightly lit with a white light but no blurring, no outward beams from the light - very clearly defined. Also, although there was no illumination of the &#39;body&#39;, there was a definite rectangular shape of a body containing the windows.  My immediate first thought on noticing the object was of a &#39;harmonica&#39; with the lighted windows being the small square holes on the backside.  The object was tilted with the upward end being at 12:00 and the lower end to the right (south) at the 4:00 position on the clockface. We watched it for almost ten minutes as we continued on the expressway to the next exit which was for South Lyon.  Although traffic was steady but not heavy, I wanted to get off the X-way and away from the other car lights to observe the object.  The lower cloud cover obscured the object just before we reached the next (South Lyon) exit. I took this exit and traveled some six miles south, then another 3 miles east, mostly on dark country back roads hoping the cloud cover would open up again but it did not.  We did not see the object again. The lights were not &#34;On&#34; but rather &#34;from within&#34; the object. There was no trail and no haze.  No beams of light were emitted.  It did not change color.  We did not see any other objects exiting, entering or in the area of the object.  No other aircraft were seen in the area. ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

IMMENSE size.  Above clouds.  Moonlight. Viewed for 10 min, 8 miles by 2 parties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> See above for description.  First observer was nine year old child.  Second observer was 51 year old with extensive newspaper, news photographer experience.  Object was viewed unmoving in same location despite turns in road, therefore not a vehicle window reflection.  After 10 minute observation from moving vehicle on freeway, driver turned off freeway to seek a less lighted location to view but cloud cover closed and object was not seen again. Impression was of tremendous size.  Also that multiple square windows were exceptional in brilliance but did not radiate their light.  Above reference to tilted, interiorally lit harmonica is strange, but accurate.<n>

We didn&#39;t see them approch, They started off together , Then they stretched into a line with some right above the others and they were flying around each other. We watched them for 5 min , we couldn&#39;t figure out what they were but UFOs. Then they seem to come back together and were gone. The light didn&#39;t fade away from us, we didn&#39;t follow them until they couldn&#39;t be seen anymore. They Disappeared to nowhere as they appeared from nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Does unearthly maneuvers, then vanishes from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I had just finished watching King of the Hill, when she went to the patio door to let Pixie and Desi, our cats, out. I noticed a strange group of lights, flying in direct patterns (they would go up, then stop, and go straight left or right. Their patern was like this: o ----- white 0   0   0 ----- yellow, white, yellow 0  0  0  0  0 ----- blue, yellow, white, yellow, blue 0 ----- white ,etc. I&#39;m a Trekkie, and X-Files fan, who would do nothing to harm any alien theories. Every week or so, I wake with strange marks, and an ugly metallic feeling in my nasal area. This began approximately one month ago, and each of these mornings I have flashbacks of alien encounters.<n>
8/31/97 17:00|Lincoln|NH|Formation|60-90 minutes|A static formation of 15 metallic spheres observed by about 150 people in a clear daylight sky.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43640.html|6|ndxe199708| A static formation of 15 metallic spheres observed by about 150 people in a clear daylight sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, son and I were attending a stock car race in Lincoln, New Hampshire.  It was late afternoon, between races and the announcer was talking to people in the stands using a portable transmitter that broadcast through the overhead speakers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly he said &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, will you look over to your right, up in the sky?  I&#39;ve been looking at that thing for the last few minutes and I don&#39;t know what the hell it is.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the ~ 150 people saw was a static formation of 15 spheres having the appearance of brushed stainless steel. They were arranged something like the Honda &#34;H&#34;, each side forming a curve of 5 spheres with a long bar of 5 spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole formation was off in the distance at an ~ 10 degree angle to the horizon. It was visible for ~ 60-90 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watch on it even as I watched the other races. Later on, I did see the whole formation go through a slow, single arc to the left only to return to it&#39;s original position. It then started to move away slowly; I was alternately watching it and the race.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, I looked up  and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the date because when we returned to the motel, all that seemed to be on the television was the death of Princess Diana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The length of the formation was roughly the same as the diameter of a nickel held at arms length.  And finally, none of the &#34;characteristics of object&#34; apply to this sighting.<n>

Thats when I saw a blue reflection in the trees coming towards us, (my Son had just come outside of the tent and saw these objects also.)  My wife and other son remained asleep in the tent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camcorder in the tent but I didn&#39;t think I could retreive it before the eggs were out of sight, so I just stood there with my Son and watched them drift over this small clearing nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both eggs glowed blue,they were incandesent, glowed from inside like a lightbulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were about 200 feet away and moving maybe 25 to 30 mph.The were following each other about 100 feet apart and about 200 feet or so above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lead egg had a black line moving around a few feet from its tail,and it slithered about like a snake as it moved around the rear of it. The other egg did not do this.  Both objects lit up the pine trees around them,and also the ground.  I had a pair of binoculars on the camp table so I took a look using them.  I could not see any windows doors or seams in either object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my Son and I just watched them float away over the trees and out of sight.  Also no sound from them.  I think about this sighting almost everyday,sometimes it really bugs me.<n>

Actually what the most wondering thing was that the lights were moving as if they were smart objects. In fact one of the points (it appeared as if it was the mother ship or so) was moving slower than the rest wish stopped moving suddenly till the slowest arrived close to them and  disappeared together in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in three minutes and what made this too serious that I was not alone my friend also noticed that minute by minute from the beginning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I decided to inform you once I get your website on the net. I have always been very interested in such topic. Thank you.I aged 30, male<n>

I am unsure of the exact date but we took the trip around the time of my birthday (8-31-64) annually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were lodging at the Anchorage Marina hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night we walked to an area between the hotel and the Coast Guard station and sat near the water.  There we saw several bright white lights in a curved line shape.  The lights looked to be very close to us.  Some of the lights &#34;faded&#34; out, and then re-appeared.  The lights remained in the same geometrical formation during the time that we looked at them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound although the wind blows heavily on the island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were stationary while we watched them.  They appeared to be connected although we were unable to make out an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is very little light pollution on the island so the lights were very bright and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we were intrigued by what we were looking at but we began to feel uncomfortable and walked back to the hotel after 3-4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that year we saw a TV show about the lights over Phoenix.  The video shown on the TV show looked identical to the lights that my wife and I saw that night on Ocracoke Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently watched a TV show called “I Know What I Saw”. The program begins with the Phoenix lights.  This prompted me to report our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might be interesting to researchers that my wife and I saw the same lights while in Ocracoke, NC around the same time that people in the Phoenix area witnessed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt this makes any difference but I’ll provide my wife and my backgrounds.  We lived in Raleigh, NC at the time of our sighting.  I was and remain a building contractor although we have relocated.  My wife was a stay at home mother of two children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/30/97 18:00|San Jose|CA|Formation|5min|I saw round solid color objects flying in pairs in daylight|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40779.html|11|ndxe199708| I saw round solid color objects flying in pairs in daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> While heading back home from my friend&#39;s house, I happened to look up in the sky. It was almost dinner time when I was heading home. I looked up to the sky as I was walking home and something caught my eye right away. Since the object was very high in the sky, I had to check my vision my looking at nearby objects such as a tree to reset my eye focus. Then I looked back to the sky and saw the same thing. I saw tiny objects flying in formation heading south, parallel to highway 101. They were solid objects and were not omiting lights. They look like small metalic balls with different colors, flying in formation. They flew in pairs. About 5 total. One flew alone in front and had a pearly red color while the other 4 flew behind it and was a pearly blue color each. The four that flew beind flew in pairs so when you looked at them, you would see the red ball infron by itself, two blue balls behind it, and two more blue balls behind the first pair of blue balls. They were moving and was heading somewhere, not hovering in one place. There was no sound and no trail behind them to indicate it was a high flying aircraft. If it were high flying aircrafts, there would be a distinct siloute, an airplane shape to it. Usually, when you see high flying planes, they either have smoke trails behind them or they fly solo. These balls flew together without any trails left behind them. That was the first time I saw UFOs. Later on I saw a UFO sightings show called &#34;Sightings&#34; and saw a story about a similar sighting. They described the exact same thing I saw; the color, and the formation. Everything was exactly what I saw. The sighting on the show was dated around 1920 to 1930. At that moment, I knew that it had to be real since I just saw something that someone else saw more that 50 years ago. It couldnt have been military because I don&#39;t think that the airforce from the 1920s would be flying in the same formation in the 1990s. Also, the sighting from the 1920s was seen in a diferent state I was in. I hope that if anyone out there saw the same thing, the same flying formation and color, they should speak up so it can reinforce what I have just said. The more sightings there is in different areas, the more credible it will be. Also, i&#39;ve continued to research and watch shows on UFOs and havent seen any story of sightings similar to mine. All the sightings describe the same thing, triangles and lights. Mine was different and I still continue to wait to see if there is anymore sightings like mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Having a serious interest in UFO and aliens, and having read a lot abut that topic, I marveled at how much my baby daugher looked like a Grey alien, with her huge blue eyes in her tiny face, and I wished that the aliens would know telepathically that I was thinking of them for that specific reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, around the day and time specified, I was driving back home (alone) from the hospital for some reason, when I saw this little silver sphere traverse the sky in the general dirction I was traveling. It appeared suddenly over the rim of my windshield and traveled forward in the sky for about 10 to 15 secondds, until it go hidden by buildings on the side of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to me as having the size of a toy marble and I could tell it was a sphere and not a disk because it seemed tridimensional to me and it had a thin waving yellow-and-black rim around its circumference that seemed to indicate that it was enveloped in heat or in some sort of (electromagnetic?) energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted only from 10 to 15 seconds but I was convinced that it was the aliens&#39; way to letting me know that they had gotten the message about my daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in a convertable and I don&#39;t recall any noise from the craft because there was a simi truck next to us braking.   It looked very similar to the sightings of March 13, 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed out through the windshield to a small bright orange light hovering in the night sky. We watched as I drove slowly trying to keep an eye on the road at the same time. The light seemed to shine and glimmer as if a star or satellite does to the naked eye. I turned on to a side road we used for a shortcut home. As I slowed more to keep an eye on the object, it seemed to grow in size. I stopped the car but did not get out. We kept watching as it grew bigger and bigger. It finally split into two distinct balls of bright orange fiery lights about 1000 feet above and ahead of us. It made no noise as it glided directly over the roof of our car. However, the car and ground shook as it passed and there was a slight rumbling as it passed. I tried to watch it by looking through the back window. We were both a little shook up and I decided to just take off. At the time I lived in Wilton. Which was about 15 miles further away. When we arrived at my house I looked up into the night sky to see a dim orange light fading into the darkness. The disappearing act took about 2 minutes and then it was gone for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It moved slowly and the setting sun caused it to reflect light very brightly like an object of very smooth metal or glass.  The shape was that of a disk with a slight indentation in the center. It made no noise.  They have never seen anything like it before and did not really believe stories I had told them of UFOs I had seen before their birth.   I report this because I note that other sightings are being seen in the Wyo.&amp; Colo. area.  I also may have seen another one myself on about 8/4/97 just at sunrise, also over Lyons.  It too was reflecting the sun very brightly.  I kept it to myself because I did not see its shape.  It too made no sound though it was not very high over town and traveled N to S.<n>

It was about 1.30am and the road I was walking down wasn&#39;t very well lit up, as it was cold and a bit of mist was about due to the temperature. There was no-one else on the road and all was quiet. I heard a faint swishing noise and looked around to try and locate where it was coming from. As I looked about, I happened to look directly above me and saw a very dark object alarmingly low (25-30 metres) moving horizontally over me. It was really quiet and seemed to have a non-moving centre piece, and on each side of this were these semi-circular wing type objects which were turning end over end (a bit like a paddle steamer cylinder) It made very little noise, like something flapping in the wind. There were no lights that I could see, the only thing I can compare it to would be is a dark shadow. At first I just stopped walking and tryed to keep an eye on it, but the object was so dark I lost sight of it within 10 seconds or so. I stood there for about half a miniute and tryed to figure out what I had just observed I said to myself &#34;That&#39;s some freaky shit right there!!&#34; and carryed on walking. Trying to understand wether or not I had just seen what I thought I had seen, a second identical object passed again directly overhead, or maybe it was the same object that had done a full circle and came back for another look. The object was not very large, possibly 15-20 metres from wingtip to wingtip, and about10 metres wide in the middle. This is the first time I have told anyone about this for fear of looking like a nutcase, but it has been preying on my mind ever since it occured. I am a 29 year old computer graphics student and I swear on my life that this happened as I am relating it to you.I also swear I was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident.

The other one seemed to fall out of the first kind-of like a meteor. It was red like a fireball, and moved very fast. The triangle shaped one moved slowly and was at least 30 yard across maybe more. I got scared cause I was out side at the time, a firlfriend of mine called me and said it was coming up my direction, so i went out side to see if I could see it. Then all the sudden it was right above me,a curled up inito a little ball, because i was scared to death. It moved of after a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the other people that were there that night had left very suddenly, and left myself out side by myself for the rest of the night.  I can only say it was 35 minutes long because that&#39;s how long it seemed to be. when i went out side to look at what ever it was, it was about 10:30-11:00pm, when I went back in the house it was 4:22am.  I don&#39;t no what to make of that. My husband said that&#39;s called missing time, but I don&#39;t remmber any thing happening. I do know it was cold out side, but i went in side and felt as if i had been in side the whole time. I wasn&#39;t cold at all. Does that mean anything?  If so please let me know. That night has been with me for awhile now. I keep having , well dreams I guess of things that I did not see that night, but my girlfriend and I both have the same dreams alot. I thought that I might have seen this object once before, but it was all glowing red, like it was on fire, this time it was all black with no lights at all, other than the one that came out of it!<n>

PAGE-LAKE POWELL ARIZONA  AUGUST 1997 ((This is the eigth and last to date of several of these experiences, all of which I now feel are connected. If visitors to this site have any questions I&#39;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&#39;d appreciate a reply. I&#39;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My then 14 year old son and I moved to the gloriously beautiful Page ~ Lake Powell in the extreme north-central Arizona, and camped a few days on the awesome beached of the Colorado River...in a place called Lone Rock ~ technically in Utah. While our trip was filled with wonderful events, and a fabulous experience being &#39;stranded&#39; in Roswell during the 50 year festival, and meeting Derrel Simms, David Adair,  Dr. Lier, (I&#39;d been their waitress at the restaurant where they dined on the last Saturday of the festival), as well as Whitley Streiber, Stan Friedman, Robert  Ghostwolf,  and many others, we had still had money struggles and I was upset and nervous we&#39;d be REALLY stranded. Once we reached Lake Powell, however, things changed for the better. We set up &#39;camp&#39;, ate, and later when we turned in, I&#39;d said a little prayer and apologized for having an earlier tantrum (ie: lack of a little faith in the &#34;Bigger Picture&#34;) and just after the prayer, I&#39;d seen a shooting star. It filled me with hope and I asked for some sign that all would be okay. I gazed out thru the mesh window of my tent at all the zillion sparkling stars and the glorious canyon backdrop for another 5 minutes when I saw one of the &#34;stars&#34; begin to move quite erratically across the sky. It had a steady, straight path but every &#34;inch&#34; perspective-wise, it would light up to a bright white, then fade back to a dim star (almost going out) and jag across the sky another inch or so, on and on until it had crossed the sky and disappeared from my range of vision. Its motion was like a zig zag, and at each alternating &#39;point&#39; it would stop, light up, zig, stop, fade dim, zag...etc. It had been high enough to be similar to a satellite, but too erratic. It was too high for a plane or jet. The same thing happened again the next night, but both events were about 8:30pm. On the first night, as I watched it zig zag across the sky (over a period of maybe 15 minutes), I became aware, in a sort of &#34;singular&#34; fashion, (as in, this had been my only thought and seemed to take over my bouncing thoughts and steady them to this one) that they were our neighbors; but more, that they are the Watchers, and had done this (appeared this time)  to let me know all is as it should be. It&#39;s real and there&#39;s no reason to wig out about it...(this trek to AZ had been part of a higher calling that suddenly seemed to go awry) and they are always there. They show themselves when requested to do so to those who need to or have recognized the &#34;Path&#34;, and will either assist in the Awakening, or lead the Waking into knowledge and experiences they need for individual purpose, as well as a collective one. The second night I seemed to &#34;understand&#34; (about them) as tho they were telling me that  now that they&#39;ve proven themselves as I asked,  I won&#39;t see them much in the near future, but will eventually begin to encounter them more often ~ things (for me) would now change. And they did. For the record, from August end 1997  until this date of posting (Dec. 20, 1998), I have gotten pregnant, moved from Arizona to an island off the Virginia coast, been flooded off the island, returned to Arizona over a &#39;vacation&#39; journey thru New Mexico and Arizona, situated in west central Arizona,  had a beautiful baby boy, bought another computer, been introduced to Art Bell (the program), become a  webpage designer (actually getting business, that is!), lost one car, got a new car,  and returned to Louisiana...having wonderful holidays and feeling like this is the calm before something extraordianry takes place; I have no idea as to what. Since August of &#39;97, and this event, I have seen no further &#34;lights&#34; in the sky, on the ground, or anywhere else, nor  had anymore of these experiences. If anybody has any ideas about any of these posts or would be interested in more details, please contact me. hrc@ciai.net *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1.

It was a cool night quiet night on a Sunday when I looked in the sky to my left I saw a small orange object about the size of a quarter moving fairly slow almost due west. I didn&#39;t think much about it because was heading toward the airport. I watched it fly away then I saw another.it was closer about the size of a coffee sauser flying in the same direction, it was orange almost translucent and round. I was watching it and it dawned on me...no sound at all. It was moving slowly from the ground it looked about 20 miles an hour. At this point I ran inside to get my roommate. When we got back out side we watched it for about a min before it flew over the mountin. I was watching for more to my left when my roommate yelled &#34;what the hell is that!&#34; when I turned to my right the same orange color but it was about the size of the early full moon flying over the house next door(we were about 20 feet from the house next door) It shook me up no sound what so ever. While we were standing there watching it it split into two seperat circles and started flying side by side. At this point I ran in the house and grabed the phone and called the police department and ran back outside.I ask them to see if they had an officer in the area just to see if they could see it but they blew me off, so I called the Sheriff&#39;s dept but there was no one in the area where the lights were going. After the what ever it was went over the mountin there were no more. The next day when I went to work I was talking about the objects and the shift Sgt that was on the street that night(he was patroling north of where I saw the lights) said that about that same time his electric locks in his car started flicking back and forth for about 30 seconds.<n>

Great work you’re doing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I’m writing is that I would like to report a UFO sighting, although I’m not sure if you’re the right person to receive it, as this incident happened in Germany several years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you know of someone who is more interested in international sightings, feel free to pass this along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize in advance for all of the important information that will be lacking in this report, but I think you’ll agree that every little piece of information contributes to the overall picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am completely at a loss as to the timing of this sighting.  I was in Germany from June of 1995 until the summer of 2001.  This happened sometime between ’96 and ’98.  That&#39;s as close as I can get to giving you the timing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a soldier stationed in Wuerzburg, Germany from June ’95 until August ’97.  I remained in Germany until 2001.  My friend and I often visited the Café Haupelshofer, a popular café downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, my friend was driving us to the café when he noticed an object in the sky.  He asked me &#34;Dude, what the hell is that?&#34;   I looked toward where he was pointing and saw a bright light in the sky.  I told him I didn&#39;t know what it was.  He asked me to keep an eye on it while he drove.  I was able to keep it in view continuously until we parked the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stepping out of the car, it was still in view, about 75-80 degrees above us.  We walked the short distance to the café, keeping it in view the whole time.  It never seemed to move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to the Haupelshofer and stood outside in the alley to the left of the café watching this hovering light for approximately ten minutes.  As we stood there, several German pedestrians would pause for a moment as they walked by us, looked up and wondered aloud, &#34;Was ist das?&#34; (What is that?) before continuing on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night with plenty of stars in the background.  The whole time, the light never moved in the sky.  By contrast, there were airplanes crossing the rather narrow field of vision. We were in the alley close to the corner of Sanderstrasse, so the streetcar tracks were right behind us, looking up at the strip of sky between the buildings.  The light was basically centered in this narrow piece of sky, and planes flying much higher than this object were crossing in the background.  It was obviously not a plane, nor a blimp or balloon.  It COULD have been a helicopter, only it was low enough that had it been a helicopter, I&#39;m sure there would have been sound, but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could see of it was a single, bright, white light - I couldn&#39;t see any hardware. It wasn&#39;t very high up, but higher than the altitude of the average hot air balloon.  If I held an object up at arm&#39;s length to hide it from view, I could probably hide it with a dime. We could not positively identify the object, so by definition, it remains a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually we got tired of staring at this light, just hovering in place, and we entered the café.  When we left, we paused in the alley and looked up, but the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have more specific details to give you.  Interestingly, I found a picture of some folks eating breakfast at the café.  If you look at the picture, you&#39;ll see four windows behind the people.  My friend and I were standing just outside of the two windows on the right hand side when we watched the UFO.  I&#39;ve also included a rough sketch of the view looking up at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this is something you can use.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep up the great work!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Changed color as it moved around a very small area of the sky. Erratic movement and very fast for the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was  in Meadow Creek which is in the middle of some of the most rugged ground in B.C.  The brightness and movement of the Light caught my eye. It was extremely fast for what would pass for an extremely bright satellite. The path was not predictable as a satellite is. The whole time I watched it, it never left &#34;Its area&#34;.  The light had a range or area it was flying, very small in the sky.  If you held your hand  outstretched, you could easilly cover the whole area.  The color went from silver- white to pale yellow and occasionally blue. I cotinued to watch for 20 minutes as it darted around . I spend a large amount of time around all types of aircraft,and there is nothing on the books that could do the speeds this object did. It was crysatl clear, no other lights to interfere, as Meadow Creek has a population of about 300. The light was in the western sky quite high off the horizon of mountains. It did not leave, I left,  I had to be up early for work the next morning.  I had just finished work, had not been indulging in anything to deprive my senses.<n>

Then they rotated a few more times in unison then sped off with such an incredible speed that I have never seen before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My wife and I were driving|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32051.html|24|ndxe199708| The object appeared to be a large airplane, but it was a dark grayish color unlike any any military planes. My wife and I were driving along the highway, neither of us remember any other traffic on the road. We first noticed that the craft seemed to be   be standing still in the sky so we slowed down and finally pulled over to the side of the road. We opened the window and even though the (plane) was not very high i n the sky, it made no sound. Eventually I got out of the car and walked to the side of the road. I remember the gravel under my feet. My wife says she doesn&#39;t rememeber me leaving the car, so that remains unclear. Shortly after the incident, my wife and I just returned from a party were entering our home when the phone rang. The person on the other end said he was with a ufo group that met regularly at lakehurst navel base. He asked if I had seen something unusual or reported a ufo. Since My wife and I had told no one  of our sighting, and because he got my first name right and my last name wrong and I had never heard of the group he spoke of I quickly rejected his offer. My wife and I discussed again what we had seen. We surmised that we had seen some new military aircraft, larger than a 747 that could remain staionary for almost a half an hour without making a sound. We felt after that phone call it might be best to stick to that story, even to ourselves. But that is only where the story starts. A couple of years later, to quick smoking we both decided to visit a hypotherapist. The sessions worked, but later my wife admitted to remembering something she had never told anyone. She told me that years before our sighting, she had experienced, missing time while driving near her home, in Woodbridge NJ. She said that it was almost like waking from a strange dream, angry and frustrated because she appeared to be lost only a few miles from her home. It was then that I was able to tell her that I remembered a similar occurance. While we were still just dating I was driving home from her house to my house at the Jersey shore, when I felt myself getting drowsy. The next thing I remembered was awaking at my exit, some 30 miles later, only checking my car&#39;s clock it seemed to have taken an hour to make a drive that usually took half the time. As we talked, my wife also related something else that raised the hairs on the back of my neck. She said that one night in bed she woke up only to see someone or something seated on the edge of our bed. She said that the figure said nothing only quietly stared at her, while she unsucsessfully attempted to wake me. She than said that she went back to sleep, and until the night she told me had forgotten the incident, chalking it up to a bad dream. For all these years since we have laughed off all those incidents as bad dreams or silly misconceptions, until last week, @sept 25th 2003. My daughter who is married and a mother, living with her family in Georgia, (we currently live in Arizona) was talking to me on the phone when she mentioned a strange incident. She told me that she had awakened a few nights before to see a troll like figure on the edge of her bed. When I hung up I told my wife she shouldn&#39;t have told our daughter about the troll, as we&#39;d called him for years. When she swore she hadn&#39;t and I saw the look of concern on her face, I knew she was telling the truth. We decided then not to tell our daughter anything, but to tell our story and see if some one else has experienced something similar. Nothing has happened to us persoonally recently but the incident with our daughter has left us perplexed. Are there any other intergenerational events like ours. By the way our daughter has never to our knowledge seen a ufo, though when she was in the second grade she won an essay contest by writing a story describing being taken up in a space ship. Her teacher was so enamored by the reality of the story she asked us if she could keep it and thinking nothing of it we let her. Now we are sorry we didn&#39;t keep that story, because it might have been a  true accounting of an encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Staring at it for a few seconds, we noticed an undulating heat wavelike emanating from it.  One second, it would have appeared to be straight but then began to enter the wavelike stage.  Then a soccer ball flew between our heads and I ran to pick it up.  Then, after only about five seconds of not looking at it, I turned my head toward the same place and it was gone.  No military aircraft or device of this earth could have been traveling so slowly and then accelerated to a speed so quickly that it could have disappeared from the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was working as VP of an English school, and freelancing to the Mexican Govt.&#39;s tv station.  After supper one evening about 10&#39;clock, In the back yard I sit and watch the sky as I do every night. Now, I&#39;ve seen things almost every night, stars that would fall for a couple of minutes then streak to the right or left and so on.  But this one night I was looking towards the sky where the airplanes would fly to the Hermosillo&#39;s airport.  Then it happened!  A large white boomerrang spaceship (three times the size of a passenger jet) decloaked (like in Star Trek) floated down a few seconds, stopped (no sound), and then ... warpped to the north, just like on Star Trek!  Now the hair stood up on skin, where do you hide? ( I&#39;m supposed to be a tough guy). I couldn&#39;t tell any one what happen because I couldn&#39;t speak Spanish enough to explain what had happened, so a week later a Mexican-American was visiting his relatives and I told him.  He said his cousins (3) saw it to.  Same time and same place in the sky. Then a few days later the owner of a computer cafe house told me the same story but it appeared to him while he was driving. Three days later I picked up an am station at night on my radio that was the Art Bell Show Coast to Coast.  Believe me, my life has changed 100% since I saw the space ship.  My beliefs and everything has been challenged!!<n>

I thought they might be helicopters untill the light`s got closer. When they were really close i noticed that there was no sound. The light`s at this point looked like they were trying to form a circle formation then broke up and became a line again. Next the light`s got right over the house and hovered in one spot for about 8 min...then the light`s started to leave going up, at such a high alttitude that they disappeared within minutes. About 5 minutes later, I looked up again and saw just one light that hovered for 2 minutes then left in the same fashion as the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a party that was being held outside a friends house when this happend. There was at least 20 other people who saw the same thing that night.  My boyfriend and i were outside no longer then 10 minutes, when I looked up into the sky and saw these lights coming towards us.  At first, i thokught they might just be helicopters, but as the light`s got closer, i noticed there was no sound.  At this time, i asked my boyfriend to take a look into the sky to look at these lights.  The lights started out as a straight line, but as they got closer they looked as if they were trying to form a circle formation.  The whole time this was occurring, they seemed to be getting closer.  This formation also seemed as though it were floating downwards.  At this point, the lights hovered there at least 8 minutes.  After this...they just seemed to take off.....they reached such a high alttitude that you could see them disappear within mimutes.  In other word`s....they didn`t faze out like a flare would.  You could still see them for awhile,they went straight up...until they were no longer visible to the human eye.  It was not like an airplane that travels north, south, east or west...the light`s went straight up and then disapeared.  After about 5 more minutes, i looked up, and much to my surprise, i saw a new light.  This light was one light by itself.  It hovered for about 2 minutes and then ascended like the other lights did previously.  That same night i called the burbank airport police, to find out if they had witnessed anything unsual, and they said they had seen nothing out of the ordinary, ubt gave me the number to a UFO Hotline.  I called the Hotline the next day, and they gave me the number, of the Section Director for Mufon, a mutual UFO Network.  I had a meeting with this man a few day`s later.  At this meeting, i discoverd that there had been other sightings in california that same weekend.  The sad thing of this whole story is this....i only knew one of the people at this party, my boyfriend.  I had just! moved to california not too long before this happend.  The party was thrown by a girl i had just met a week after i moved out here.  i know longer know how to reach her.  One last thing....the time that this happend, there was infact an airplane that flew by this thing.  Th airplane was not as high as these light`s, but was very close to the lights.<n>

They object stood stationary for sevral minutes while I went into to get my Game Boy camera and a film camera and took 2 pictures on my gameboy camera(it made the gameboy camera zoom in even ya know that it doesn&#39;t have a zoom lens) and 1 on my film camera which did not come out well (it looked like a blothy red spot). At this time it was still stationary about 30 seconds later the object moved from SOUTH to NORTH at a extremly fast speed covering miles of the sky in seconds. Then we noticed that the object had stoped and about 2 or 3 aircrafts chased it as it made a flash then disappered into thin air. Then it apeared as 7 lights in a circle for a split second then disappered once again The object was roundish maybe oval, a turquoise colour to a whitish yellow at the flash, Approx the size of a 747 but in an oval shape but had no tips or ends, it was a stream line shape on the sides making an oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 2 pictures of it<n>

We noticed that there was what I thought was a helicopter that had been hovering in the same spot for a long time. We watched it for a while and wondered if it was a sightseeing helicopter as it had been moving slowly back and forth high over the water along the coast off Esquimalt harbour. The more we stared at it the more we thought it was strange. Light seemed to be emanating from it. It didn&#39;t seem so far away that details wouldn&#39;t be visable yet we could make none out. It slowly began to move away from the shore out over the straight. It hovered  for a few more minutes almost directly in front of where we were standing. I waived at the object as it seemed to be watching us and the second I did that it streaked accross the sky at a speed neither of us had ever seen and then in a white flash it was gone. It disapeared. I saw the light flash and the object vanish well before it reached the south eastern horizon. It made no sound.<n>

I had been watching the Southern horizon because there were some interresting cloud formations starting.  As a watched, a bright object came up from behind the mountains south of Billings.  It continued in a straight line headed due North.  We thought it was a comet as first, but there was no tail.  As it flew overhead, we could all distinctly see a cigar-shaped object which reflected the light of the sun, which had gone below the horizon (not precisely sure what time this was, but the sun had been below the Western horizon for about 30 minutes).  The object continued in a perfectly straight line directly over our heads.  We lost sight of it as it passed behind the roof of our house, and we didn&#39;t have time to reposition ourselves to continue to view the object.  There was no sound from the object, no trail of debris or anything, just a shiny, cylindrical object flying as a substantial speed from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Color of aircraft silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving north on I69 just before exit 67 the craft first looked like a  dot reflecting in the sun (thought to my self, boy that airplane sure could be mistaken for a flying saucer). Then, as it neared it appeared to be a triangle rapidly desending directly toward me from the front of the car a little less then 10 oclock high. I could not believe my eyes. When it was about 2-1/2 inches wide at arms length it suddenly rotated 45 degrees counter clockwise in less the a second and kind of skidded or suddered in the air and changed direction so it was moving to my left and still desending. I think it was moving about 100-150 mph. At this time I could see there was a long pole about 2/3 the length of the craft sticking out the front of the craft with a small wing near it&#39;s end. A small ball a (1 to 3 feet) was at the end of the pole. I believe the small wing was used to rapidly change the direction of the craft when it &#34;skidded&#34; in the air. I believe this craft was a man made craft, NOT a flying saucer. The way it moved it must be a new design. I have never seen anything like it before. I think it was about the size of a fighter plane. It looked like it was made of aircraft metal. As it moved off to my left I was able to see it from my side window and its view was momentarily blocked by some trees I was passing. I then saw it for a few seconds before it became to low to view. Just after it passed from view I saw a light aircraft desending along the same path to my left so I guessed they both were headed for the Anderson Airport? I saw only the bottom and the rear of the craft. I saw no engine and no exchust and no landing gear. Please let me know if you have any infomation about this craft. Thanks<n>

This trail ascended for a short while and silently erupted into a fireball that grew in color from white to yellow orange.  From this fireball there emerged what appeared to be a fighter jet climbing vertically very rapidly.  The outline of this jet was approximately the size of a pack of cigarettes.  The &#39;jet&#39; climbed and leveled off and then flew slowly overhead to the northeast.  The only lights on it were two large half-triangle panels that were lit and were white - there were no other lights.  There was no sound throughout the time of the observation and the duration was probably only 8 to 10 seconds. The reason it stood out so much is that the entire phenomenon was outlined against gray clouds. It actually looked like a shuttle launch, though I don&#39;t live in Florida and am too far from the ocean, and would not have been able to see it, and there is to my knowledge no facility on Long Island which would launch something like this. It was not a flare - nor was it a meteor - as it came from the surface up.<n>

It was very low and getting larger fast. It was about 500-800 ft a.g.l. moving from north to south at a very constant speed and heading. as it passed over me I could clearly see three cylinder shaped lights going into the craft with the light being very dull yellowish color. Also as it went over the stars disappered behind it, giving me an outline of its shape. This thing did not make a sound and it did not have any navigation lights. I estimate the size of the object being the same size as a four engine airliner. What really buged me was even if the engines were shut down it was close enough that I should have heard the air rushing around its frame. It went out of sight after about 10-15 seconds and the only thing I could do was verify the time it happend, 11:00 p.m.<n>

The lights won<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived on Portage lake in Michigan, near Ann Arbor. My friend ((name deleted)) and I were standing on the dock and noticed seveal lights approaching from the west , they were quite high- estimated at at least 20,000 ft. They were travelling at a very high rate of speed, and approx 70 degrees overhead, they slowed and almost stopped.They were &#34;flying &#34;in a V formation. several minutes after the initial sighting, comin from the same direction that the lights had come from, several more lights appeared going toward the lights. We soon recognized these to be jet planes(presumably military). As they got closer to the lights, the UFOs departed at an incredible rate of speed, leaving the &#34;chase&#34; planes far behind. The time frame for the ufos to dissapear from overhead to the horizon was maybe 3-5 seconds. The planes remained in the general area flying a search type grid for 10 minutes more, and then returned back in the direction they had come from. Within the next several days we talked to a number of other people who lived in the area within a 10 mile radius of where we were, and they had witnessed the same objects, complete with &#34;chase&#34; planes as we had within the same time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry the date is only an estimate, I have never documented the incident until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What can only be described as a circle of lights changing colour rapidly, from yellow to orange to blue to green to red to yellow and repeating.  The circle seemed to be shaking and moving in the air.  It then split into two identical objects as previously mentioned.  Then flying parallel to each other they became joined by beams of light as if they were one large object.  I continued to watch until I realised I had never seen an object such as this in the sky before.  It wasn&#39;t a plane or a satelite, I can say this with confidence as I live in a very tall building and frequently look at the sky at night through a pair of binoculars; and the cloud cover was too low to see any stars.<n>

About the time of new term starting at schools daughters said. it was a moonlit night and the clouds were boyant bt plenty of clear sky between them- as if it was fairly windy high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE had to take a country road for about 11 or 12 miles through some small hamlets and one or two small villages but very quiet. The raod was welllit by the mon depsite the fast moving clouds which did not except sporadically obscure any significant part of the sky. WE had I think it was when we had the Audi with a sun roof but it might have been a Renault car I am not much good about cars. The point is we had a tinted glass sunroof. My daighter and I had been comenting on the lively night and sky when something caught my attention. WE must have travelled perhaps three miles out of the town. First behind a cloud then unshielded were three green or gey green faded but clearly there, green spheres. They would have been pretty big, I suppose if we estimated them to be er!!! flying below the clouds sometimes I dont really know what height the clouds are at!!! But at that hieght they would seem to measure about I would guess half the size of football pitch!! maybe a third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I measured them as an artist using my thumb down a pencil- the tip of the pencil being put at the visual edge of one of the spheres and my thumb moving down until my eys sees it as recording the oposite edge and my arm straight ( if you know this methods used to measure distant objects bye artists!!!I would say they would be about three to four inches across at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought there were some  kind of laser show, (we had seen one which had given us a scare when the images appeared  over our fields,)  But these  interchanged positions altering height slighty as the way a car does on and unneven road. Also of the road tured they altered thier path to follow us blatantly drawing close to one another to take the turn. At first watching them partly throught the sunroof and partly by craning our necks was just interesting then we becaem disconcerted when we saw they were following us and it becamwe more urgent to get home fast. In fact they trailed us for all  but th last mile home when we reached a village and took the sharp turn left they swung around and went into the distance growing smaller as they went. we didnt know what to think we were sure they were some kind of spacecraft. There  were no seperate lights as I have heard described though, just a continuous ring (pale green) each of them had and the middle was obscured somehow. we are used to seeing helicopetors as we lived on thier flight path from a military base some 12 miles in another direction, and also planes and airballoon but none like this and theses were moving fact and had great propulsion faster than a jet plane when they went off but not a sound.  My husband met a neighbour( about a mile away) a week later and when he went to mention it the neighbour said&#39; that is odd we were also followed by those &#39;exactly the same&#39;. Then in the local paper for Cornwall (and I have a picture someone took) was a report (up near bodmin I think it was) of this Ufo &#39;one only&#39; but very like the ones we had been followed by, but this was taken in the day at sun set!!!! Around the same time  ( and this may be accountable any other way, I do not know, may be unconnected but those were very real no question) I was awakened in the night by a very bright white light blue white. The road ran next to the house, so I thought at first and so did hubby it must be a car!! I actually had made little shutter fo this side window but they didnt fit very well so they let light in along the edges and it shone straight on my face. I opened up the shutter to see and there was no car and the moon was not visable or at least I could not find it and also the light was much much brighter and very white with a bue eliment to it. I could not see its course, it lasted a while um! maybe twenty minutes half an hour and went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had often told people about these sightings and they came back with amazing stories but I never found anywhere to report it and find out whatit was, then I was reading the uninvited lately having got it in a pile of books i got at charity shop[ before we left england two years ago. and when I mentioned the light it reminded me and fankly gave me the w*llies. Now I am wondering exactly how far that encounter actually went!!!! at least if you have this information  you can look into it yourselves and it isnt lost forever which I hated because I think anoything lik ethis shou dbe recorded otherwise how can we knwo waht is happening or to what extent?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We skateboarded until the camera&#39;s battery died. Afterwards we sat down and took a rest. My friend and I were talking about something when he suddenly said &#34;what is that?&#34; I looked up from a top the hill to see 3 sphere shaped bright balls in the formation of a triangle. They were moving very slowly, practically stationary and it definetly didn&#39;t seem normal. They continued to hover and then another sphere with the same dimensions and the same level of brightness as the other spheres emerged out of one of the original bright spheres. My friend had suggested that it was the apocalypse. Out of the first two original spheres came more spheres, again the same size and brightness. Then out of the clones came out another clone. This kept happening until there were about twelve spheres. The clones then started to form the original triangle pattern which the first three spheres were in. I know others also saw the incident because their were many cars all around that stoped to observe what was happening. The spheres were just as bright as they were before and then one of the spheres sort of flashed and disappeared. The rest of the spheres did the same and disappeared in an instant. We couldn&#39;t understand what it was , how they cloned each other and how they  disappeared in an instant. Note: we were observing this incident from a top a hill in manhattan. The incident was occuring close to us within clearly visible distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three&#39;s in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw.<n>

My wife, as soon as the door opens to our house in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, crying, hollers my name as soon as the doors open.  Annoyed, I woke up and thought she had another car accident, like maybe smacking a guard rail or the highway divider again (she’d done that once or twice), she said no, but by how bad she was crying, by this point, had me wide awake and I went down in some shorts and helped her get the kids into the house and in bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were done, we went to our room and she was still crying as we sat on our bed and she began to tell me what happened, after she calmed down and drained my iced tea dry.  Then she begins her story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had been driving on Route 209 in Sciota heading back towards Route 33 which she would get on going north to come home after she had been visiting her friend &#34;Beth&#34; and our kids played with hers (she’d been there since that afternoon around 2 I think).  She was driving along, her mind wandering as she listened to music when all of a sudden, a deer jumps in front of her and she slams on the brakes, and the car stops in the middle of the left lane (Rt 209 at this point is preparing to split between the on ramp going north, on ramp going south, and going straight under the highway Route 33, left lane was for going north on 33, while straight and south 33 were in the right hand lane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said she waited for her heart to stop beating so fast and checking on the kids to see they were all still asleep in the car, and the deer kind of taking it’s time crossing 209 after she squealed the tires in her attempt to stop.  When she noticed, in the sky directly ahead of her a huge disk shape that lights on the outer edge of the disk (she never did tell me what arrangnment they were in or their colors), and that it was directly over the on ramp she had to use to go north.   She was too terrified to move, not believing what she was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she watched it, it moved north north-east, as it moved over a Calvary Church that you can see from the on ramp to 33 north, and a mountain north north-east of that.  She really saw how large the craft was, she said the moon was bright, and the shadow as it crossed the mountain covered the church it had passed that a moment or so later she could see it compared to the mountain and it was larger than it as at one point she could see the UFO back-dropping the mountain as it moved off north north-east along a ridge of mountains that led to a quarry a couple miles away before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it made no noise, because she couldn’t hear anything through the open windows or the open moon roof from the craft, especially since she stalled the car when she stopped to not hit the deer (Ford Escort 5 speed manual transmission).  She cried harder, swearing her and the kids would disappear and no one would ever know what happened to them (she told me this as I held her as she cried in our room as she told me the story that night), it would take them and no one would know the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then noticed headlights in the distance in her rear-view mirror, and realized someone else may have saw it or would know they were there, before she started the car and resumed her drive home and my time getting woken up when she opened the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On your website you can compare rough distances as you can come along Route 209 in Brodheadsville, PA, through Sciota to the intersection with Route 33, and if you zoom in right, the Calvary Church was on Haney Road, while she stopped for the deer just a little before Bossardsville Road crosses 209 on your map, with the UFO over the lane she had to take to go north when she first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The concert was a big summer ending event that lasted three days. An orchestra from Portland was performing Swan Lake before the first of three sets on the evening.  During the performance a glider was towed in and released and started doing aerobatics that went with the orchestra.  It was a clear afternoon with very few clouds that were very high in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I were watching the glider we both noticed, without saying anything to one another at the time, a cigar shaped object in pretty much a stationary position directly above us.  The object was very high (I&#39;m guessing at least cloud level] and as I stated seemingly stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed at this location for a minute or so and then began to slowly move.  It never at this point moved straight.  It just slowly moved in slight arcs and almost made a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued this for another couple of minutes and then stopped,almost motionless for avery brief moment [maybe 10 to 20 seconds] then it seemed to elongate and amazingly fast stretched almost 5 to 10 times its original length and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did&#39;t say anything to my wife, nor her to me,for a couple or minutes.  We both told each other the same story and were very bewildered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only told a few others of this. There were roughly 100,000 people at the show. Maybe someone else witnessed the same event.?????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

All of a sudden,when they came back they found me gazeing in shock up at the sky. There we saw a cigar shaped craft, glowing green, and it was setting down in a near by feild. Being the curious people we are, we went to check it out. Suddenly the craft opened, and two creatures about 6FT tall, greyish-blue in color, with what looked like armor on, steped out. At that moment my two friends started to run. But I was not so lucky. Before I could get away, the creatures caught me. They took me aboard there craft, and put me in what was a weird cage. These creatures did not speak with words, instead they used telepaphy. Some how I could hear there thoughts as well as them hearing mine. They then started telling me &#34;that if our world wanted to capure and torment his kind, they would retaliate. I did not understand this at first, but soon did. I then asked where they were from. they told me they came from beyond 300 million light years.i asked how they could travel so far. they then told me something I did not understand. one said &#34;we came at millions of times the speed of light, because we use the speed of gravity which is faster than light&#34;. I asked how it was possible to travel that fast it told me that the shape of the craft in which we travel is key. Only a sauser shape or cigar shape,or round vessil could travel that fast because of the pressure that is excerted on a craft at that high a speed. though we were communicating rather well, something went terribly wrong. We crashed into the mountians at lake lure,i regained consciousness about 1 hr later,and found no signs of anything around.this really happened,i don&#39;t know what to think,except there is other life out there, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As it got closer I realized that it was not a plane. I didn&#39;t know what it was but I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. It flew about two to three hundred yards off the ground and it didn&#39;t make any noise at all. It was kind of a triangle shape with rounded corners and on each corner it had a yellowish white light. In the center there was a slightly bigger light that seemed to swirl, the reason I say it swirled is because it had a curved line that went from the center point out to the rim and it kept going around the rim. I stood up on my friends hood and watched it as it flew west over the lake and behind Antelope Island. I only told a few people what I saw because I wasn&#39;t sure who would believe me but one of the people I did tell was my wife who I met and married 1998. In about Late May to early June of 1999 her and I were in my grandmas back yard laying down and talking about the stars and which one was ours when out of nowhere the same exact odbject appeared above us flying in a southward direction. It made no sound and flew about the same height. It scared the heck out of my wife cause she used to be in the Air Force and had never seen anything like it. Niether one of us is sure what it was or where it came from but we do know that it was something extraordinary. To this day we still sit out at night hoping that we will get to see it again.<n>

It was hovering for abt 2-3min.  Then it flew away, to the south west, up in the sky, with enormous speed.

8/15/97 22:00|Robertson County|TX|Other|15 minutes|Mother-Ship, preceded by four helicopters and some other craft with a red, circular light.|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33089.html|68|ndxe199708| Mother-Ship, preceded by four helicopters and some other craft with a red, circular light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fully understand that people often do not report in a public manner having seen what seemed to be a UFO experience for YEARS.  I fully understand, because I have lived it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband (at that time) and I lived in very rural Robertson County, Texas, a beautiful area with tens of thousands of trees.  We had many neighbors, all living on 10 to 50 acres of land, and lots of uninhabited land in between us, a peaceful, rural area of Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived there 9 years.  When this happened, we had been living there maybe 8 years.  (As a footnote, my former husband lives there now.)  We call our place, &#34;Hole in the Woods&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened was this.  We lived in a silver, metal, aluminum luxury-type mobile hunting lodge, about as big as one can transport behind a truck, 33&#39;, with a travel license.  Of course, it had been immobile since we trucked it in those many years ago.  It was our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When home, we had serenity!  So did our neighbors.  The closest town was Bryan, Texas, (15 miles), twin city to College Station, Texas, home of Texas A&amp;M University.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, my husband had gone to bed.  I was sitting in the living room, which had a view out of a 8&#39; picture window of the beautiful southern sky, enjoying the silhouetted view of a tree-line that was just past a 50&#39; power line cut.  I was peaceful, I was happy, I was just minding my own business.  I&#39;d lived there, and looked at this view, for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next rocked my world.  And I do MEAN, ROCKED.  Suddenly, a massive sound started, and then, as I was LOOKING out my window, four helicopters were flying directly towards the window, at an amazingly low altitude.  It seemed to me they were not hardly far above the top of the major power poles crossing the land.  Not very far over them. The sound became deafening, I saw the four helicopters, in a rectangular pattern, two in front, two behind, so low, so loud, that the ground, the house, everything was shaking!  I was freaked out.  And then, to make matters worse, beside the back two helicopters, off to the left (from my perspective) I saw also a somewhat pale, but definitely red, round light flying in what seemed to be in tandum with the back left helicopter.  I noticed that it seemed to not be making any sound, and I sensed a body, but couldn&#39;t see one. But the overwhelming experience was, the horribly loud sound of those four helicopters so close to the ground!  Shaking everything with their roar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This came upon me very quickly and I was overcome with confusion, and seeing the red light also confounded my experience.  Next thing that happened was that my husband came stumbling out of our room, from a deep sleep, yelling, What in the hell was THAT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him what I&#39;d just seen.  The noise was now gone, and he went back to bed.  I was left sitting in my chair with an uncomfortable thought, aliens.  What if they landed in the woods and are coming to our house!  Believe me, I had never spent any time thinking about aliens!  I had not purposely ever read one single thing about aliens.  But I had a memory of having read that sometimes, helicopters signal alien craft.  Why I thought of that I don&#39;t know, what I knew at that moment was, I was feeling afraid that those helicoptes had maybe landed in the woods and aliens might be coming towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, my husband had gone back to bed, and although I was a little uncomfortable, I guess, I just sort of &#34;got over it&#34;.  NOT FOR LONG.  I was still looking out the window at the sky.  After about 5 minutes (this is an ESTIMATE), I saw something that to this day I don&#39;t know what I saw.  But I know what my mind thought I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, lights in a line, &#34;dropped&#34; into view in my window.  My mind said, &#34;Oh my God, a Mother-Ship.&#34;  It was GIGANTIC. And sure enought, that damned thing kept dropping down, and I could see an outline in lights of what looked to me to be a mother-ship.  Believe me, I didn&#39;t think about or believe in alien spacecraft AT ALL. And it was moving closer.  I sort of freaked.  I started screaming, &#34;((name deleted)), ((name deleted)), get up.  YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!&#34;  My husband came stumbling out of our room again, and I frantically pointed out to him what I was seeing.  He immediately said, let&#39;s go outside.  He ran out the door, and I ran out behind him, down the side of our building.  But I panicked before I got to the end of the house, and turned around and ran inside, honestly, holding my hands on the side of my head, scared to pieces!  When my husband came in, what he told me, I refused to believe.  I refused to believe it so much that I don&#39;t remember what he told me he saw.  I would be lying if I tried to re-create what he said.  What he and I both know is that for the next couple of months, we were &#34;suspicous&#34; of what might happen in the night sky which we had been so familiar with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nervous about it, to be honest.  I kind of didn&#39;t want to look at the night sky, afraid something would receive a signal from me and appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than two weeks later, my husband and I were driving home from work, about 1/2 a mile from home, down our winding, curving lane (Taylor Road), not thinking about anything, when we came into a clear place on the road, the only clear place on the way home down Taylor Road, and we were just looking forward, driving, when we both saw another spaceship.  Just happened.  There was this huge Texas blue sky, with a huge billowly white cloud in it.  And so help us both, we just both accidently were looking at the sky, when a UFO came flying out of that cloud, shrouded, zoomed forward and then zoomed back into the cloud.  We just looked at each other and said, did you see that?  End of story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was nearing dusk and the sky was remarkably clear, not a cloud for as far as the eye could see in any directon and the moon was full and very clear to the west of the sky though the sun was still shining (but nearing sunset).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on our way to Pay Less Shoes at Delaware and Hertel (near K-Mart); traffic was thick and moving slow.  I was going to purchase shoes for my two daughters for &#39;back to school&#39;.  Then we were going to take a family drive to the Tuscaruora Indian Reservation for ice cream, cigarettes and gas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached Parkside - heading North down Hertel, the light turned red and we were the second car from the light.  My younger daughter startled me as she shouted &#34;Daddy, look up! look up!&#34;  We all looked up to the distanct sky directly in front of us, staring about 25 degrees up in the direction of travel and there was an extremely bright round orb of light, brighter than the North Star, BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING I&#39;VE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By distance, it looked like it was over Lake Erie.  The orb of light just stayed in one spot and flickered for the entire time we sat at the red light. When the light turned green, the car in front did not move and neither did we and the people behind us started to blow there horns. I noticed the driver in the front car was staring and pointing at the sphere of light and talking to a female passenger in the seat next to him. We all got caught at the red light again!!  Then the sphere split into two orbs of light!!  Then about 2 seconds after the split, the second sphere or orb just JUMPED TO THE LEFT AND STARTED TO THE EDGE OF THE FULL MOON.  IT SAT THERE FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND; THEN IT STARTED TO JUMP BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MOON TO THE OTHER!!! (traveling the diameter of the moon!!) It did this for about 2 seconds and in that time It moved from the left to the right exactly 10 times before disappering!!  Then the first orb moved towards the moon form it&#39;s place in the horizon over Lake Erie and it traveled next to the moon and did it in less than a half a second!!  (I took my watch off my wrist and held it near my view to time what the orbs were doing)  The light truned green and the second orb was still siting at the edge of the outer diameter of the moon (left side).  Traffic started to jam really bad, it took us over 15 minutes to proceed from Parkside and Hertel to Delaware &amp; Hertel.  When we parked in the plaza in front of Pay Less Shoes and got out of the car, There was a couple (guy and a lady) standing in front of Pay Less and pointing up at the moon and the orb; they too were observing its strange behavior and my wife and I spoke to them breifly about it.  By this time, the orb or sphere shaped light was flicking in and out and each time it flickered out, it would reappear in a different spot near the moon in various places!!  I still get goose bumps thinking and talking about this!!  eeww!!  When we left Pay Less it was still there and we got spooked and did not go to the reservation as it was now dark - we went home and told no one.  during our drive back down Hertel to Main street (head to Dartmouth Ave where we then lived) we observed many people on Hertel in cars and on foot pointing at it and talking about it!!  I&#39;m surprised this sighting never made the news!!  TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD NOTICED IT AND IT WAS CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS BECAUSE PEOPLE DRIVING AND ON FOOT WHERE NOT FOCUSED AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!!  We where too busy watching these two strange lights!!  These lights made no sound and left no trail whatsoever!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

8/15/97 05:40|Lenexa (Greater Kansas City Metro Area)|KS|Disk|5 seconds|An object moving at a high rate of speed, leaving a bright pink trail.|11/19/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04735.html|73|ndxe199708| An object moving at a high rate of speed, leaving a bright pink trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way to work early morning as usual, it was about 5:40am CST, as I always do, I like to take pictures of beautiful sunrises.. This particular morning, I left my house and Pulled to an intersection, where I looked towards the East, and saw the beautiful clouds. I got my camera all ready, rolled down my window, right before I snapped the shot, before holding the camera up to my face, I saw what looked to be a shooting star upwards to my right.. I looked up, and it slowly dissappeared.. I went ahead and took the photo, thinking, &#34;At least I got the clouds and the sky. I wish I Could&#39;ve got the star!&#34; Well, never really studied the picture once it was developed.. Until last week, I was looking at some pictures of furniture, and my eyes were attracted to it immediately! I looked and looked, I could not tell WHAT had shown up on my picture, but it looked as if the shooting star that I saw, had dissappeared to my eye, but the instant I shot the picture, it reappeared.. It must have been traveling at a high rate of speed, and also I had noticed, shooting stars usually do not stop, or turn back around, as shown in the picture.. I have tried to contact some local college professors, or really someone that wants this picture.. I do not know the first thing about UFO&#39;s, I&#39;m just amazed that it finally happened to me! I am very interested (and have been)in the paranormal, ghosts, UFO&#39;s, so this just really struck me hard... It was a great experience!<n>

Lost sight as it moved over hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was training a new driver for my truck route. After we had passed the Ohio/Virginia border, he yelled,&#34;Look at that&#34;.  So, I pulled the truck over and we both got out.  Just to our left, and bigger than my hand as I stretched out my arm, was a black triangular craft with a dim, white, light on each corner and a dim red/orange light in the middle.  It seemed to be so close, you could throw a rock up and hit it.  However, it did not even make the slightest noise.  We observed it for at least ten minutes, as it glided toward the large hills that dominate the area on Interstate 77.  It should be noted that Wright Patterson AFB. is only a couple hundred miles to the west of this sighting. Personally, I do not believe that this craft was manufactured anywhere on earth. It did not have the look of any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen before or since. Also,  maybe you remember the story of Indrid Cold, this was the name of the alien who kidnapped a man from Mineral Wells, W.Virginia.  Mineral Wells, was only six miles more south from this sighting.  After much reading, I find there is supposed to be a vortex of sorts in this general vacinity.  Well, that&#39;s about the extent of what I have to say about this particular incident.  Thanks for listening. I appreciate it. ((Name and address deleted))<n>

I didnt relize what i was doing but i had taken my lighter out of my pocket and started flicking it as if to get its attention. then we got real scared it was real cloudy that night and i could hear a plane going threw the clouds and i could see it here ant there with its blinking lights but just before the airplane got directly above the thing it shrank out of sight, not like a light turning off but like shrinking into nothing but very fast and after the plane was gone it grew back, as if it were hiding. at this point me and my buddie were very scared we decided to jump into my other freind who wasnt home into his car and didnt want to see what was going on my freind fell asleep but i couldnt sleep i tryed but only for what i thought was a minute but we still argue about the time my freind says he slept for at least an hour but i dont realy know it feels to me we were only in the car for 5 min. anyways the thing was still the just watching us at least thats what it felt like. i was so filled with fear i felt like a trapped rat like no place i could go to hide. so we decided to leave the car so i got out and when my freind got out and shut the door the car alarm went off and it was a loud one but we thought it was weird that the neighbors dogs w wernt barking and none of the neighbors even woke up the whole time the glow from this thing was still lighting up the area  so we could see outside kinda and we knew it was still there but we didnt want to look anymore we were to scared. so finally i said to hell with it i just want to get out of sight i went and kicked my freinds door in and after all the confusion as to what was going on. out of exhaustion i fell asleep and the next morning called and reported what had happend the night before I was frusterated that they the cops didnt take me seriosly. but one of them gave me a 1-800 number to call but i never did i just wanted answers as to what happend. im sure the flathead county have me on record, Ive tryed telling freinds about that night now the freind  who was with me tells me to shut up, because when he tryed to talk to some about it they call him crazy, i mean who is going to believe us it reallly happend but it sounds so crazy that its ironic. well i know what we saw that night and it wasnt normal it wasnt earth gas or weather baloon ect. we saw something it to me it didnt have a very freindly vibe to it. since then i suffer from insomnia(cant sleep) and always have to watch the sky on a clear night because im afraid that if i dont that something might happen again. well this is my storie and every thing is told as the way it really happend i know there are many that could say things like this just dont happen but it happend to me so all i can say is wait and see .......thank you for letting me tell my storie<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

During this whole episode which only lasted about 20 seconds, the orange light was moving.....  A beam of white light came down from the orange light, then slowly went BACK UP into the orange light.  It was not a spotlight that is bigger at the bottom like from a helicopter...it was a thin, straight BEAM of light.  The light did not fade out or turn off....it went BACK UP into the orange light.  Then the orange light while still moving south slowly got smaller and smaller until it was just a pinpoint and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

About 5 miles from home I was driving up a hill in Millerstown KY when I noticed three lights hovering above tree tops to my left.   I could easily tell this was a huge triangle shaped object.  This object just hovered. I slowed down to almost a stop and rolled my window down to look out to try to get a better view.  I was driving at this point around 2 mph.  The object looked as big if not bigger than a football field.   I do not remember the colors of the three lights but I could tell the object was either totally black or of a dark color.  It totally blocked the stars in the sky. It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes of viewing the huge object which just hovered it went straight up in a matter of a second and vanished into the night sky.

We were on a week long camping trip in the BWCA, when on the fourth night, we were at a beautiful campsite with great fishing from shore, and I had decided to try my luck at some night fishing. So, I left my companions at the fire and walked down a small trail and onto the rock outcroppings on the shoreline, about 150 feet from the campsite. The stars were out and were brilliant. There was no wind and the water was dead calm. I started casting for a while, and after about 15 minutes I snagged my lure on a rock in the water. I tried getting it loose, but it wasn&#39;t working so just as I reached out to cut my line, something caught my eye above the trees on the opposite shoreline (which was about 1/4 mile away). I saw a bright bluish-white light rise up from the treeline very slowly for about 15 seconds. I just stood there looking at it in awe. If I had to guess at the size of it, I&#39;d say it was as big as a bus, but I couldn&#39;t exactly tell the shape because of the blue glow around it. As it got further above the treeline, it stopped moving and just hovered for a few seconds. I yelled at my buddies, but they were too far away and busy talking around the fire. I kept my eyes on the light the whole time. It then started moving horizontally at about the same speed it had risen previously. It probably moved horizontally an eigth of a mile when all of the sudden, it shot off into the sky and out of sight faster than anything I&#39;d ever seen move before in my life. The object made no sound/noise at all. I just dropped my fishing rod and ran back to camp, shaking and hardly able to spit out a sentence. When I finally calmed down and told my friends the story, they just joked about it and would not believe a word of it. None of us were drinking or had any sort of drugs, unless there was something weird in the fish we ate out of that lake (just kidding).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not making this up. I would never lie about something like this. I wish I could find out if anyone else was camping in the BWCA at the same time and might have seen the same thing, from a different lake or somewhere nearby. A year and a half later, I saw almost the exact same thing in the winter, but not in the BWCA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife and I were admiring the occasional streaks when I happened to look straight up and my eye caught 2 seemingly high altitude, dully glowing, small, silent objects moving at incredible speed, one ahead of the other, towards the the direction from which the meteors were eminating. I immediately blurted for my wife to look up, but she was only able to catch sight of the trailing object. The whole sighting lasted from 2 to 3 seconds before the objects disappeared downrange towards the east. I&#39;ve observed nightime satellites and aircraft in my binoculars before, but these objects were moving much faster.<n>

Me and Megan turned our heads. Staring in amzement we saw five big, bright lights, too bright to be stars. We all noticed that the lights were arranged as the points of a pentagon. I belive that there was only one object. The lights moved rather slow to the right, then disapeared. It all seamed so fast. Right after that we ran inside, and started writting stuff down, like the time, the shape of the lights and other stuff. I remembered my dad, and my brother talking about a contest, and how they were stuck on a question. thats when I noticed this report place. I ran to the basement turned on the computer and came here.      My two friends as far as I know are very trust worthy. I have known them all through elementary school.<n>

The three lights jockey for position, speeding ahead, falling behind, and crossing over each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are working artists in the fields of traditional and computer animation. While meteor-watching in our backyard on the evening of Aug 12 he spotted three small lights moving just below the pole star.  I saw them, then, and we both watched as they moved, a little faster than a commercial aircraft, from north to south, where they disappeared from sight behind the hills.  The lights began in a rough line, from top to bottom, with the middle light slightly ahead of the others. As they crossed the sky, one would speed ahead, then fall behind as another sped ahead, and at intervals one would cross over another in almost a playful manner. The impression I received at first was that of a three-cornered object tumbling, but when the lights passed in front of stars it was clear they were distinct from one another and not part of a larger solid object, as the stars were clearly visible between the lights. The lights were about the brighness of the dimmest of the stars visible, and a warm yellow color. This same night we had observed several meteors and several commercial aircraft. These lights were at a lower altitude and exhibited vastly different behavior than the commercial craft we saw, and were definitely not meteorites, as they were neither bright nor fast enough and left no trails.<n>

Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn&#39;t moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn&#39;t sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn&#39;t believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn&#39;t have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn&#39;t it.  And there was a meteior shower tonight, but It wasn&#39;t that either.  So people might try to say I&#39;m seeing things, but I know what I saw. I&#39;m an 18 year old male, fresh out of high school.  I&#39;ll be attending college in the fall.  I&#39;ve always belived in UFO&#39;s, in fact I think that they aren&#39;t friendly.  They might be nice, but why would they be so secret in learning about us.  I&#39;m not mentally retarded, in fact I graduated the third highest GPA in my class.  I was not drunk nor high on anything.  My friends will prove that to you that I&#39;m not into that junk.  Well, I&#39;ve said enough, believe if you want to.  But be prepared whent he truth comes out, I think you&#39;ll be shocked.<n>

The object was in the shape of two wings almost boomerang shape and was beige in colour. the first night the object, soundlessly flew across the sky from N.E. to S.W. at a high altitude. The second night it flew alarmingly low over my back yard. In fact I wrote a letter to our local air force base complaining that it scared me by flying so low as I thought it was an experimental aircraft. We had a lively correspondence and denials not on radar etc. When I sent a sketch the colonel himself phoned me and we had a very interesting discussion.there was no sound and no lights nor any call signs on the object. It went extremely fast and as it was rather high at the first sighting it was difficult to estimate size althiugh it looked much larger than a 747. The second sighting scared the heck out of me as it came without so much a swish over my backyard and the road at the other side of the fence. It could have been 30-50 feet across because I do not know how high up it was. It seemed to me that it cleared the street light by about 20-30ft. I really can not say with any certainty, all I know is that it totally unnerved me to the extent that I ran into the house and locked the door. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am glad others saw it too. The object had none of the characteristics logged on your list. It was silent and looked like two backswept wings with scalloped edges,plus it had random protuberances on the under side. It scard me. It may have been an experimental aircraft althoiugh this was denied, nor had it,according to the airforce base, been recorded on radar. The base is 60 miles from and i am used to seeing aircraft flying about. They had been flying earlier that night too.I also phoned my local commercial airport about 12 miles away and they had no radar confirmaton of anything like I had seen. It was laughingly suggested that perhaps it was Alien. I did n! ot think it was funny. Incidentally about 60 miles north a crop circle was found the next day and many plants in my yard had mutations. The object I saw was travelling from east to north west. Both nights were very clear and cool.<n>

Lights didn&#39;t seem &#34;twinkling&#34; or shooting-star like.  Didn&#39;t look like searchlights-too far up.  During the Perseid Meteor Showers.  Seemed like they didn&#39;t fit in up there!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out that very early morning to specifically watch the star showers.  Living  in an apartment complex, there was a mostly dark area away from the lights where I laid out on the grass with my blanket around me; my head towards the south and my feet towards the north.  In this position on my back, it was dark enough to provide a spectacular view.  I had gone outside about 12:15-ish a.m. 8-12-97, so this is how I guess-timated the time of this event at about 12:30a.m.  Before the event happened, I watched the usual stuff, and the meteors were coming at about 2 or 3 a minute.  Then, suddenly an unusual configuration of four spots of light, with three on one side and one on the other side, (like it was pointing) start in the east (it just appeared out of nowhere) and moved somewhat smoothly and quickly to the west; straight across without fading!  It (the configuration) didn&#39;t look like it belonged up there; it seemed so out of place!  1.)  They certainly didn&#39;t look like a! group of searchlights.  They were too high up.  2.)  They didn&#39;t have the appearance of &#34;twinkling&#34; or comet-like (no tails).  3.)  The light spots were white and slightly blurred on the edges, but anyone watching wouldn&#39;t be able to miss what I saw.  These spots were in a definite arrangement or pattern, and I didn&#39;t see nor hear any plane or other recognizable shape that would tell me otherwise what this thing was.  It was an event of some sort that made me sit up, take notice and start thinking, as never in my life did I ever see anything like I saw that night.  I had actually sat up to say aloud to myself, &#34;What in the world was that?&#34;  The configuration was definitely moving (purposefully so) east to west.<n>

The object passed over my head at about 50 ft. It stretched across my yard, the ditch and part of the highway . Approximately 50ft.It was a cross between siklver and gold colour, or a light beige, and it had umerous protuberances on the underside. It was more like a boomerwng shape, with scallops on the insides of the wings.<n>

At first it was standing still but then it started moving slowly (1-5 mph.) to the left (what looked like about 5 ft. from 4 miles away) and it did the same to the right and up and down and continued to do so for about ten minutes or so then it went from the size of a streetlight to the size of a pinhead and was gone in about a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((personal data deleted))<n>

It was a clear night and I was out to watch the Perseid meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a university teacher who has lived in Bellingham for 7 years.  I am interested in UFO phenomena, but have never seen anything unusual before.  On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the &#34;satellite&#34; suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the &#34;satellite&#34; seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.  I went inside, through the house, to see if it was visible from my front porch! (I had been on my back deck).  It wasn&#39;t.  I wonder is anyone else has seen something similar?<n>

I drove past my moms house,and continued along the lane that led down the valley,into the river flats,and the farmland that we own. I dont know why I was there at that time of night...I was running on empty,for fuel long ago.But I had a strong desire to be where I was heading. I turned of my car,I sat on the hood of my car while my dog ran around in the tall grass,looking for mice. I was only on my car for maybe 1 min.

Not a cricket,frog,car or any noise juring the entire event...Even more weird...my dog seemed frozen..as if her batteries were dead..just standing there motionless...staring at the door handle of the car...which is where we were both ! headed towards before the light got really bright.

We had just returned from a day trip to Fire Island and I was on my back porch (lived basically next to 231 a north / south traffic artery on long Island) and I noticed a very strange object flying about 40 or 50 feet off the ground north along the wooded area between my house and 231. It looked like a boomerang and was black and was moving at about 10 miles an hour. There were no jets, windows or lights. The wing was about 40 feet across, but the height (floor to ceiling) was only 4 feet. It seemed to flex a little at one point as if it were of a flexible material. It looked like and was moving horizontally like an aircraft though (not baloonlike). I told my wife to run in and get the video camera. It began to rise vertically quite rapidly at that point. By the time my wife got the camera (abot one minute) it was at about 3000 feet. I began filming the wing. A commercial jet flew past, and it kept rising vertically until it disappeared straight up. The video ran out of batteries before it disappeared completely out of sight. I have seen stealth fighters, as some have suggested this might have been but it was not like any of the ones I have ever seen or read about. The object seemed to turn one wing slightly at one point so it did not appear to be a completely rigid object. Are there man made objects that can behave like this? We have no idea what it might have been. I have not seen the video in many years but if I had to it might be possible to locate it in some closet but this is not a guarantee. The video doesn&#39;t show much detail unfortunately anyway because the sky is bright behind it and the bommerang object is fairly small in the image because it had risen to such an altitude by the time I had the camera running.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn&#39;t moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.  I came back out around 9:45 pm and it was gone from the sky.  I was the only one to witness this-I was alone.  My background-Local person grew up here. ((Deleted)) Engineering degree from UW.

8/8/97 18:20|Tadley (UK/England)||Circle|40 mins|cluster of ufo's over Hampshire, England|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14843.html|101|ndxe199708| cluster of ufo&#39;s over Hampshire, England<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt I wanted to tell you about my families experience of what I have no dealt was a sighting of UFO&#39;s on August the 8th 1997. It all started on this warm sunny evening at 6.20pm when my family &amp; I were just finishing our meal in the garden, when for some reason I glanced up at the sky just above the roof of our house, and saw what I thought at first was a cluster of silver balloons of various sizes tethered together high in the sky, they were very high, and as I was trying gather what direction the balloons were travelling, I saw them all moving apart into fixed positions ( see drawing) then move to another, which made me think balloons can&#39;t do that so precisely. I said to my family to look up there at these balloons and tell me what do you see, my wife, son of 22 &amp; daughter of 19 looked and said they look like those silver foil balloons, as they were reflecting the suns rays just like a prism does with rainbow colours. Because they kept forming the same positions over and over again, then reforming into a tight group as they drifted over the sky, we became more suspicious of the first thought, and more convinced they were under some control. I must point out we have never seen anything like this before, and we all know what balloons look like in the sky, as I used to sell &amp; fly all kinds of balloons including silver foils, so we have some idea from our experiences over the years what to look for to identify the object and it&#39;s distance in relation to other things around.But because it was a cloudless sky that day, there was only a number of gliders around to judge how high they were and the size of them, our opinion through binoculars was that they were very large of various sizes and very high in the sky, we estimated about 40,000 feet or more. After about 20 minutes of taking turns through the binoculars tracking them across the sky, they disappeared out of sight right above us. I also thought as we live near the Atomic Weapon Establishment, these objects seemed to be above that site and moving in a south east direction towards Basingstoke. It must have been about ten minutes after the objects had gone, when we were looking around the sky to see if we could spot them any where else, then suddenly from the north very low in the sky, two silver grey round objects one above the other shot across my line of sight (see sketch 4) it was very amassing to see these objects so close up and moving in tandem together, as if they were letting us see them and moving closer together and apart again, just to show they were under control, both objects seem to have a flash of light surrounding them on one side as if they were spinning, and they were completely quiet,they disappeared as suddenly as they appeared, just if they switched them selves off like a light. They reminded me of two large ball bearings about the size , this is difficult to judge when you have not seen anything like this before, so is the problem of height in the sky, I would hassard a guess and say the objects were about10feet across and about 2-3 thousand feet high. We were all struck by the aura they created within us and to this day we wish someone could explain to us what we had seen and if anyone else has seen something like this. I contacted &#39;Quest&#39; and they sent me a form to fill in, I described exactly just what I had seen but I have not herd anything from them, which is why I have written this letter to you in the hope you or someone else with knowledge of UFO&#39;s can enlighten us to what we had seen. Since writting this account, I have been watching many programmes on TV , and have noticed other people around the world have seen simular objects and in this formation, but no one yet has seen what we saw, two objects close up like that. Yours sincerely ((name deleted))<n>

I was standing on West Commercial near the corner of Main Street here in East Rochester watching a centenial parade when I noticed this black sphere slowly moving NNE fairly slowly. My view of it was obstructed by the buildings across the street after only a few seconds and never saw it again. It seemed to be void of any features. No lights, wings, or protrusions of any kind could be seen. Due to the parade, I could not tell if it emitted any sound. I am not a good judge of size and distance so I&#39;m sorry to say that I have no reliable reference. My guess would be that it was maybe a half mile away and maybe 20 feet across. Again this could be so far off due to my being blind in one eye and not having any depth perception what so ever. I was standing with a friend, but didn&#39;t ask him about whether he saw anything until after it was no longer visable. He had not seen it. I didn&#39;t hear anyone else nearby talking about it. This is the second time in about two years that I have seen an object like this. The first was not far away in Rochester NY and was not too far east of the Monroe County International Airport and was certainly in one of the normal flight paths. That one was much higher and farther with no sound being heard from it. I did see another just like it on a TV show (on FOX I believe) last year and recognized it as the exact same thing that I saw. No doubt about it, it was exactly the same. The one in the TV show was video taped from a car and I think it was out of the passenger side window. I&#39;m pretty sure of this but I cannot remember the name of the show and it may have even been one of the programs on TLC, but I think it was on FOX.<n>

The docket is stored in the (offline) NTSB Imaging System. Scheduled 14 CFR 129 operation of SWISSAIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD (D.B.A. SWISSAIR) Incident occurred AUG-09-97 at NEW YORK, NY Aircraft: Boeing 747-300, registration: HBIGF Injuries: 3 Uninjured. On August 9, 1997, about 1707 eastern daylight time, the flight crew of a Boeing 747-300, Swiss registration HB-IGF, and operated by Swissair as flight 127, reported an unusual sighting while in cruise flight at 23,000 feet (FL230) over New York, New York. The airplane was not damaged, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Flight 127 which had departed from Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129, and was operated in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Flight 127 was en-route to Boston, Massachusetts when the sighting was made. According to a report from a Safety Board Air Traffic Control investigator: &#34;Swiss Air 127 was in contact with the Danbury Sector of the Boston ARTCC at Flight Level 230. Voice communications with Swiss Air 127 were of a routine nature until 2107 UTC, when the flight transmitted, &#39;...sir, I don&#39;t know what it was, but it just over flew like a couple of hundred feet above us. I don&#39;t know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direction.&#39; The controller asked, &#39;In the opposite direction?&#39; Swiss Air 127 replied, &#39;yes sir, and the time was 2107, it was too fast to be an airplane.&#39; The controller then asked another flight, Eastern 986 if they saw anything like a missile in the area, &#39;perhaps off your right.&#39; They replied that they would take a good look, but &#39;didn&#39;t think that if it&#39;s going that fast they probably won&#39;t get a chance. They had just seen Swiss Air go by a little bit ago.&#39; &#34; &#34;Swiss Air 127 then reported that they had no warning, &amp; that the object was going way too fast. The controller then asked how far above Swiss Air 127 it was. Swiss Air 127 replied, &#39;it was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don&#39;t know, 2,3,4 hundred feet above. All that I can tell , 127, is that the three of us saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.&#39; &#34; &#34;The flight was then cleared direct to Providence, and told to reduce speed to 300 knots before contacting the next sector.&#34; Interviews were conducted with the captain and first officer on August 10, 1997. The flight engineer had not observed the object and was not interviewed. The captain reported: The flight was abeam of John F. Kennedy Airport, Jamaica, New York, at 2106, and proceeding direct to RAALF intersection when the event occurred. The captain was making a public address to the passengers in the cabin when he looked ahead and saw a white object. He saw it for less than a second, and the only movement he could discern was opposite his flight track. He did not observe any wings, and was not sure it was an aircraft. He thought it was cylindrical in shape. He had never been so close to other traffic before. He was not certain whether it was stationary or was moving opposite of the flight. It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. As the object passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments. At the time of the event, the airplane was flying on a heading of 060 degrees, at 340 KIAS, at FL230. It was clear with cumulus nimbus clouds to the west. The sun was behind them. There was no TCAS warning. In addition, there was no exhaust or smoke, no fire, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 + flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight. The first officer reported: The flight was cruising at FL230. The captain was making a PA to the cabin. The first officer was putting on his headset, and bent over to adjust the volume. As he looked up he saw the object. It passed overhead very quickly. It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them He said it was white and had a round shape. There was no smoke or fire visible from the object. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the number 3 engine. There was no drift, and it appeared to be flying exactly opposite of the aircraft. No actual movement was discerned, and no markings were visible. The object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at an arms length. The engine indications were steady, and the visibility was unlimited. The sun was behind the airplane. The first officer reported that he had previously encountered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. The first officer reported his total time as 7,500 hours, all civil. He has seen missile shoots from the ground. A check with a Safety Board meteorologist revealed the following: WEATHER BALLOONS * Weather balloons are launched twice a day. * The normal times are 1100 UTC, and 2300 UTC. plus or minus 15 minutes. * The time to reach 23,000 feet is normally about 25 to 28 minutes. Sounding balloons are light tan or brownish in color. * PIBAL (used for wind observations) and Ceiling Balloons are black and red in color. * The closest launch point to the JFK was Upton, New York, about 43 NM east of JFK on a bearing of 085 magnetic. A check of winds aloft data from Upton, New York, revealed the following: Date Time Altitude Velocity Direction Temperature 9 Aug 12Z 500 MB 35 kts 350 degrees -14 C 10 Aug 12Z 500 MB 15 kts 360 degrees -12 C 9 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C 10 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C Radar data was supplied by the Boston Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), in the NTAP format. The data contained both secondary targets (beacon), and primary targets (non-beacon). The data was plotted and Swissiar Flight 127 was identified. There was no evidence of an opposite direction target, either beacon or non-beacon. Index for Aug 1997 &lt;../9708.htm&gt; <n> Index of Months &lt;../months.htm&gt;<n>

It searched the ground with beams of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were traveling at night from Quartzsite to Prescott Valley.  We saw a large lighted object approach the hiway from our left.  It traveled extremely slowly, to slow for something that size to stay in the air.  It appeared to be about the size of of an army tank and was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, we stopped in the middle of the road to watch it.  It glided so slowly over the road right in front of us.  It was very low, only about 3 stories above us.  It was a triangular craft composed of 3 round globes of white light.  It was very bright, but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  It was like looking at a soft-white light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed the road, and when it got to the other side, it suddenly shot 3 wide beams of pale blue light down to the ground.  One from each globe.  It actually lit up the ground.  You cound see the cactus, rocks and all details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then started to sort of mosey back and forth as if it were searching the ground with the lights and looking at things.  Once or twice it slowed to a hover, and then almost as if disinterested, it sped up to a slow glide again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved away from us, it just seemed to turn off all lights and disappeared.  We were amazed.  It was as if we just witnessed a miracle.  We finally continued on toward home.  As we started to climb into the mountains outside of Prescott, we pulled over to make a roadside rest stop.  We got out of the truck, and looked back down toward a little batch of houses down below us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a huge white globe of light just sort of &#34;turned on&#34; and just hovered over the town.  It was fairly high above the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a small red &#34;dot&#34; just came out of the top 1/3 of it, and then flew around the big globe in a random pattern.  We watched it for about 8 minutes.  Then the red dot flew back to the same place it came out of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the big globe just turned out like a light bulb and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My reality changed immediately from a UFO believer to a UFO knower.<n>

Saw lights hanging in sky. 2 rows of dim lights parallel to each other (not blinking or flashing)and @ 3-4 second intervals, brighter lights tracked from right to left between the two rows of dimmer lights.  I was unable to see any structure either above or below the lights.  The morning sky was dark.  This object did not move or make any sound.  I decided to alter my route to work slightly to get a better look at the object and as soon as I had gotten into my car and backed out of the driveway and looked over my shoulder the object had vanished. There is an air force base in the southeast part of the city as well as a commercial airport to the west.  I often see and hear aircraft near my home, sometimes some pretty sofisticated types, like the wing.  But, the behavior of this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.<n>

I opened my back door to get a better glimpse so as not to make a mistake about what I saw. There was no sound. I watched as it stopped and then move again. if only I could of gotten closer wow.

It veered, in a wavering motion as if seeing it through heat, from side to side along its flight path, growing brighter then going dim or off at the apex of its pendular movement, then reappearing to the other side of its flight path as it grew bright again.  The movement along the path was reminiscent of a butterfly&#39;s erratic path, but this wasn&#39;t erratic. The four light panels/spots were also similar to a butterfly&#39;s in that the forward two were slightly larger or brighter than the rear two.  The object came from the east, continued west, and eventually veered to the N/NW.  This occured on a completely cloudless night at approximately 2335.  The sighting only lasted as long as it took the object to pass.  The speed required to continually make the turns it was making was what really caught my eye as not being any typical craft. No flying object in my experience flies or lights up like that one did. over; perhaps 5 minutes at most.  My best guess as to its velocity would place it between 200-300kts.  I am a military intelligence specialist and have worked in the aerial reconnaissance field for nearly 3 years.<n>

One of them noticed a slow moving firey orange light traveling in a north to south direction in the eastern sky. He called it to the attention of my other brother, so both of them witnessed the site. My brothers noticed that our horses became excited as the intensity of the object&#39;s brightness decreased. The object appeared to burn out and the mountain valley appeared to become foggy. The odor smoke was quite strong and noted by others who had no idea of what had just happened. I, myself, witnessed the smokey odor and the fogginess of the mountian valley (as seen through the security lights at night). Because of the smokiness, we were concerned about the possibility of a fire, so we reported this event to the sheriff&#39;s office by calling 911. No noise was noted when the object disappeared, so we assumed that the object disintegrated in the air and that there was no impact. We believe this object was possibly a meteriote, and would like to report this to whoever would be interested. Please forward this report to the proper parties.<n>

Between approximately 10:50 PM and 11:10 PM on Saturday, August 2, 1997, I saw the following from my Rocklin, California (NE of Sacramento) home: In the general area of Polaris, an object appeared that looked,  at first, like a normal satellite, except for two things: 1. It was traveling slightly SE to NW, rather than the more common straight W to E trajectory, and 2. It suddenly was joined, in apparent tandem flight, by another object of the same size except this second object was blinking.   This second object was moving slightly faster and appeared to be following the first object. Suddenly the first object changed direction at a 45 degree angle and began moving more easterly. The first object appeared to be trying to evade the second object which, at this point, was along side the first object. I then used binoculars and did pick up one of the objects. Then the first object picked up speed and suddenly both objects disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both these objects were pinpoints.  The second object with a blinking light was much smaller than any high-flying airplane. There was no jet sound; the night was quite quiet. Individually, I would have labeled them ordinary orbiting satellites. The second, blinking object looked like a satellite except for the blinking and the attempt to catch up with the first (non-blinking) object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 15 year old daughter was observing the sky with me and noticed the two objects at the same time I did. She confirms what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted nearby Beale AFB; they confirmed nothing.  I contacted NASA, whose rep suggested it was something from Beale.<n>

I was watching it from the back seat of a car of the I5 freeway traveling north, and looked at it for 7 seconds or so. It was off to the left of the freeway.  It did not appear to move during this time. The driver pointed to the right of the car as she did not observe it.  “Look” she said, and I saw she was pointing in the opposite direction.  Unfortunately, I looked, only to observe that she was pointing to a dust tornado.  I quickly looked back and the object was gone.  Although the driver did not notice the silver object, there was another passenger in the car who saw the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My dogs ran in the house,unable to hear this scream???that is strange too...my dogs bark at anything that is not me.....the scream terrified me soo much,I was tio scared towalk along the pitch black laneway to my truck......Came morning I told my brothers,asked them what I should do,we all came to the conclusion,if the dogs didnt hear it,mabe it was something else???ghost perhaps????so i watched the papers and ther news...no missing anybody......<n> <n><n> <n><n> And besides last time I called the local [police ,I reported 5 armed hunters,trespassing on my property,they walked right by my kitchen widow,with shotguns......I called the police,they put me on hold,then hung up on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what happened in that bush....but i know what i heard....and this was in 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not soon after...I had 2 men on quad-runners...watching my home,from a newly mad trail into our bush.

My mother-in-law and I saw a brilliantly-green fireball go through the sky.  Thinking it was a meteor, I shrugged it off.  But after hearing all these stories about green balls of light and UFO&#39;s, I thought I would add my own experience.<n>
8/1/97 22:00|Palm Harbor|FL|Disk|3 minutes|Two saucer shaped silver metal crafts with opposite spinning white and red lights on top of each other|1/16/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106357.html|126|ndxe199708| Two saucer shaped silver metal crafts with opposite spinning white and red lights on top of each other<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife at the time and I both saw with extreme clarity two objects in the sky hovering and then moving about very quickly.  We watched them dance about the sky for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then they appeared in full view, there were two saucer shaped crafts made of what appeared to be a silver/gray metal and they both had a series of lights, one section red and one section white, on top of each other and spinning in opposite directions.  There was no mistake of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife ran to get the video camera and smacked into a closed sliding glass door.  As quickly as they appeared before us, they then disappeared.  However, they hovered with such grace and presented a very clear vision.  Shortly thereafter, approximately 2-3 weeks later and during a storm that was mostly thunder and some lightning, a strange light came through the house.  We were sleeping in opposite bedrooms as my young son was not feeling well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was observed by both my wife and I and it came through the house slowly and in a streak that was about 2-3 feet off the ground.  The light them came before both of us as the same time even though we were in separate bedrooms and it then popped before our eyes.  My wife yelled out &#34;did you see that&#34; and I said yes.  It was almost like a polaroid light bulb flash had occurred.  But I actually saw the light come through my bedroom opened door area turn towards me and flash pop in my face.  For many years I have thought this was lightning, but everywhere I research I cannot find lightning that acts this way.  I am after several years thinking this was some type of photograph taken of my family and there is a strong coincidence of the encounter with the UFO&#39;s.  I can&#39;t believe we were the only ones to see these two space crafts of such magnitude with flying technology that is not from our universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was walking home with friends, but they were all walking slow and joking around so I walked ahead. I was about 100 meters ahead of them when I looked up over my right shoulder. I saw a small sphere that was baseball size moving along about 10 metres above ground height. It came from behind me and passed. There was a wall ahead and i&#39;m not sure if the sphere dipped after it got past the wall or if it had been dipping its trajectory slightly all the time. When I saw it Ihad just been coming to a bend in the road where the wall was ahead. I was going to cross the road to look over the wall, but a car came round the corner and had the driver not horned at me i would not have noticed the car. The sphere looked metallic and was travelling at around 20 mph. My mates saw nothing except for me nearly getting run over. They believed me though especially because there was no other reason why I would have wanted to croos the road at that point. There is a train track running along the direction where it was heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))<n>

When we got out, they were gone.  One did come into the tent and I got to see it very close up (approx. 1 foot away from my face.).  Completely the most unexplainable event of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on the ground, not in space.  They were more like just abnormal lifeforms of some kind- not space crafts.  Approximately 6 sphere-shaped lights around the size of softballs.  The lights were different colours- 1 blue, 1 orange/red, 2 white, 2 yellow.  The spheres of light would appear and then dissapear (flashing-like).  I was very close to one of them and the light did not dissapear to any source, it was there and then would be gone after its flash.  At times they would flash as fast as a fast strobe light.  They also moved around as they flashed.  The best thing I could compare them to is glow bugs, except much brighter, much more faster flashing at times, and no source of light. If you have heard anything like this before or if you have any kind of information that you could tell me about this, please email me and let me know. If you would like me to go into the details more I will do that too.<n>
