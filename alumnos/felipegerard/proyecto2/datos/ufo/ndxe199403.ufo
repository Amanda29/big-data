3/28/94 17:00|Oakland|CA|Light|40 minutes|I saw the lights in an arrow formation over San Francisco for 40 minutes and they didn't move an inch.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36245.html|1|ndxe199403| I saw the lights in an arrow formation over San Francisco for 40 minutes and they didn&#39;t move an inch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter asked that we tell him about sightings that we&#39;ve seen at any time in our lives on Coast to Coast last Friday.  So, here it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work around late March in 1994.  I can&#39;t remember the exact date, but I do know that it was early spring and about 5 pm and it was still light.  I was driving home from Richmond thru Berkeley to Oakland, CA on Highway 80 which runs along SF Bay.  There was a  HUMONGOUS traffic jam and it took forever, which is why I was looking at the sky.  I was bored.  There, in the sky, and it looked to be over the southern part of San Francisco was a number (7?) of lights in an arrow formation.  One of the arrow pieces was missing.  I looked up a few minutes later and it was still there.  I kept thinking it might be airforce planes or helicoptors, but those things move.  These stayed in one place.  Well, the lights stayed in that place about 40 minutes (the time it took me to get through the traffic jam).  I finally had to turn off to another highway and lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was wierd but didn&#39;t have a clue as to what I saw.  Then, several years later when Art Bell was on, and Whitley Streiber was a guest, they were discussing UFO&#39;s.  I was in bed listening.  Whitley mentioned that UFO formations are commonly seen in an arrow formation.  Man, I sat up in bed like a bat out of hell!!  Wow.  I sometimes tell peole about this and they look at me funny.  All except my best friend, who said to me &#34;If you say you saw it then I know you did&#34;.  What a friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Moon was very bright and just before making my right turn I glanced up and there they were.  They looked to be approximately 20 feet in diameter, shaped like a disk, they looked silver in color,I didn&#39;t see any lights on these things, they were traveling West. They seemed to be about100 yards apart, one was leading the way and the other one was following.  As I traveled West on the Craig Spring Road, they were traveling West on the South side of the Craig Springs Road.  After watching them for approximately 4 minutes they had gotten far away and looked the size of a half dollar. With the bright Moon and the silver color of these things they had a kind of glow and could be seen easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was twinkling, but we both knew it wasn&#39;t but neither of us wnated to admit that it was not white. The other person I was with stated first that it was blue, but I saw a red object. It appeared to be changing from red to blue. It was moving unlike an aircraft. It was not moving in one direction but moving short distances from side to side all the while changing from blue to red for some time. Then suddenly it wasn&#39;t there. It didn&#39;t seem to move away or shoot across the sky of anything like that. It just wasn&#39;t there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/18/94 05:10|Flint|MI|Triangle|5 minutes|In the pre-dawn hours of the above date I encountered a large, triangular craft hovering silently about 100 foot above the freeway.|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07782.html|4|ndxe199403| In the pre-dawn hours of the above date I encountered a large, triangular craft hovering silently about 100 foot above the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this encounter I was 42 years-old.  I have a Bachelor of Science from the University of Michigan (in psychology) and, prior to this event, I had no particular interest in the subject of UFOs.  Like everyone else in the civilized world, I suppose, I&#39;d seen &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34; in the 1970&#39;s.  Beyond that, however, I knew very little about this phenomenon and tended to be skeptical - if not completely dismissive - of the occassional reports that I&#39;d see in papers, on the news, etc. It is noteworthy, though, that on the day before this happened to me almost the entire front page of our local newspaper (The Flint Journal) was devoted to reports of UFOs sighted near Holland, Michigan (the past week) and sightings over crowded, residential areas within the City of Flint the previous evening.  The headlines that day were, in fact, in reference to this spate of sightings. At the time I&#39;d picked up a temporary job in a small factory about 50 miles south of Flint and was scheduled to be at work at 6:00 AM.  Traveling south on I-75 (and then US-23), as my car crested the Bristol Rd. overpass, I saw two very bright, airborne &#34;headlights&#34; off in the distance; it was clearly an airborne object of some sort though the lights were quite low on the horizon.  Since the airport was to my right (at the southwestern intersection of I-75 and Bristol Rd.) I simply assumed a very large plane was landing. For the next few miles my view of these lights was often obscured by buildings and foilage because they were, as I&#39;ve said, quite low on the horizon.  At one point the freeeway curves, and from about three-quarters of a mile away, I could see that whatever the object was it wasn&#39;t moving - and it was, indeed, very low to the ground. Approaching the object I had a very ominous feeling.  It was sitting just to the right of the freeway and hovering slightly above a grove off full grown trees.  The northern-facing &#34;headlights&#34;, even from a distance of an eigth-of-a mile, had a brilliant, phosphorus look that was just plain weird.  I would estimate that the lights were about forty feet apart.  As I got closer to the object, which made no sound whatsoever, the lights seemed to be vibrating or to have some sort of internal motion - it&#39;s difficult to describe. Frankly, I was terrified.  I slowed a bit as I passed almost directly underneath the object.  Bending forward to look up at it I saw that it had a red light that was pulsating on it&#39;s bottom.  This light illuminated the outline of a large, triangular craft whose underside had striations - or a ribbing of sorts - and which appeared (as much as I could determine) to be made of metal.  It was very, very large and yet, as I&#39;ve said, made no sound at all. I floored the car in terror and, then, about 100 yards down the freeway hit the brakes and looked back.  I could see it&#39;s outline hanging there above the trees and it was as motionless as a cinder block sitting on an oak table. At work I talked to 3 other people who&#39;d seen it and we were all dumbfounded - and scared to death.  The next day, an air traffic controller at Flint&#39;s Bishop Airport gave me the number for MUFON (I&#39;d never heard of it) and they came to my home a few days later to take a report.  The air traffic controller, by the way, chuckled as he listened to my story but also stated that he&#39;d &#34;seen a lot of things&#34; he couldn&#39;t explain either (no one, he said, had seen anything from the tower the previous morning - this is something which I absolutely DO NOT believe).  He said, to paraphrase, that since Uncle Sam was signing his paychecks he wasn&#39;t going to elaborate on any of his own sightings. The Michigan director of MUFON came to my home, as I&#39;ve said, a few days later and took a report.  She also told me that she&#39;d been contacted by two women who, while carpooling to work at 10 PM the night before my sighting, had seen what I&#39;d described hovering over both lanes of the freeway at precisely the same location.  She went on to say that the women had only seen the object after they&#39;d suddenly realized that they were inexplicably traveling north on I-75 (instead of south) and had exited and turned around; they had no explanation, she said, for how they&#39;d left Flint on southbound I-75 and ended up a bit dazed and headed north (having to turn around to head in the direction of work). Now - this all sounded like a lot of malarky to me.  Even though I&#39;d seen this thing my initial impression was that the lady from MUFON was some sort of kook.  Then, on Tuesday of the next week, a lady with whom I&#39;d become friends approached me at work, looking very upset, and asked me to call her after work. In a nutshell, she had overheard me relating a few details of my conversation with the lady from MUFON with people at the shop.  She seemed like a sane, sober individual (strong Baptist, sang in the choir at church, etc.) but, on the phone that evening, told me of flashbacks she was having of a classic UFO abduction.  She, too, was carpooling that morning with another young women and didn&#39;t see anything.  Her van, however, started spinning out of control and she thought she&#39;d hit &#34;black ice&#34;, as she put it.  The spinning, however, accelerated and she could remember - she said - &#34;going up&#34;. These two ladies, also, found themselves driving north on I-75 (and don&#39;t really understand how this happened), experienced missing time, etc.  The women I spoke to was hysterical, at the time, and - as I&#39;ve indicated - seemed very normal otherwise.  I have no reason to doubt her story (which included seeing her reflection in the large eyes of some big-eyed being). Obviously, the latter part of this is anecdotal but I believe that these two women had experienced what they described - a UFO abudction.  I know exactly what I DID NOT see: I didn&#39;t see a helicopter, swamp gas, the planet Venus, nor state-of-the-art human technology. I&#39;ve typed this extremely fast so I hope it makes sense.  I hope you continue to get at the truth - someone need to.....<n>

We looked up and seen a UFO that was hovering about 50 to 100 or so feet over a telephone pole.  It was very close and I could see it perfectly.  It was shaped like two bowls with the rims touching together.  It had lights that went all around the center of it.  There was what seemed to be a door that was opened on the side of it.  I kept looking in trying to see if I could see something.  The craft just sat there not moving or making a sound.  Everyone was just standing there amazed at what they were seeing.  We stood there for a while just looking at this thing until my brother started crying and going histerical so we got back in the car and left.  We went to the store and when we came back through it was gone.  There is nothing else this thing could have been than a UFO.  I seen it so close and for such a long time with many people there with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was in March 1994 before the highway was four-laned at the turn of the 21st Century.  The object had no wings, tail or any identifying markings.  It looked like a big black railroad gasoline tanker rolling through the sky at low altitude, moving west to east.  It was visible only for a second or two before it disappeared behind the eastern ridge on the left side of the highway.  The object made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

So this is it . I was walking around my area when i was starting to admire the sky. All of a sudden a streak whent through the sky it traveled in a horizontal position heading towards the west slightly north. if i can recall the colors changed like first it was blue then yellow then orange and boom gone i think their was a boom actualy im pretty sure thier was. all the colors surrounded  a white light streak. i joined the other security police man. they where stationed in tampa but where on a temporary duty assignment in panama. i asked did they see that they said yeah pretty wild and i said well has it been your first UFO many said no. thanks for litsenning COOLBLADE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated is approximate.  It is interesting to note that the celebrated sighting over Lake Michigan, that was witnessed by Michigan State Patrol officers at the same time that several objects were observed on radar by the National Weather Service, occurred on Tuesday,  March 08, 1994.  A dramatic sighting of a very bizarre, fast-moving and maneuvering light, as &#34;bright as a welder&#39;s arc,&#34; according to the witness, reportedly occurred over the University District of Seattle that same night, and it was reported to Peter Davenport within minutes of the latter event.

It was very odd beacuse it made no sound at all?  It looked like the size of a bus! It seemed to just hang over the fields for 3 minutes until it shots a blue beam of light from underenith it! It did this for a minute then stopped and in a matter of just a second shot into the sky and dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went to the field to find all the strawberrys where all dead when the day before they where all freash and full of life!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/10/94 22:30|Mesa (north of)|AZ|Triangle|90 seconds|I saw a black craft floating in the air, no noise or anything.  When I got out of my car to see what was going on, it left.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05702.html|10|ndxe199403| I saw a black craft floating in the air, no noise or anything.  When I got out of my car to see what was going on, it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way back from delivering a pizza, when I saw a quick flash of light.  I looked out the window because I thought that a plane might have been going down.  I saw two lights about 250 yards away in the sky.  I got out of my car to see what they were.  I still don&#39;t know what it was, but it was triangle shaped object with two bright lights towards the front.  It just hovered there, moving slowly forward (towards me).  I was struck with fear, but I couldn&#39;t seem to take my eyes off of it.  It seemed to be a black or very dark blue color.  It got within 175 to 150 yards away from me and then it was gone, it went straight up, moving so fast it just seemed to vanish.  I don&#39;t know if it was the object or what, but that was the only time I remember any noise, it sounded like a whoosh.  The whole thing lasted about 90 seconds.  I know there are two airforce bases close by, or were then.  I didn&#39;t know if it was a new kind of plane or something until it took off.  I called Williams AFB and they said they had no planes flying in that area, and the man on the phone all but laughed when I told him what I saw.  He said that I was making it up, and I should call someone else. I was 22 at the time, married with a daughter, I lived about 10 miles southeast from the location.  I haven&#39;t seen anything else close to that before or since the event happend.  I now work as an equipment maintenance technician and live in CA.<n>
3/10/94 21:00|Olympia|WA|Oval|10 seconds|Two oval shaped, firefly-like, yellow glowing craft, flew overhead at great speeds with erratic movement.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34003.html|11|ndxe199403| Two oval shaped, firefly-like, yellow glowing craft, flew overhead at great speeds with erratic movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and three friends observed a mostly stationary light over the bay from a second floor apartment window.  The light seemed to stay basically in one spot over the bay, but moved slightly, enought to interest us in just why it seemed to not be approaching or moving away, up, down, left or right.  This light appeared to be at least 3/4 of a mile away.  My close friend (age 24) and myself (age 19) decided to investigate from a closer vantage point.  Leaving our other two friends in the apartment, we walked across the street, and over toward the bay, about four city blocks, into a semi-industrial area of downtown Olympia.  This happened on a Friday night, plenty of teenagers cruising the strip in cars and trucks, and at 9:00pm, when most people would still be awake.  These two factors seemed strange to my friend and I later.  Anyway, keeping our eyes on the original light over the bay, we walked into a part of town which has since been made into a new public transit station.  The area was not well lit, but we could still see the main one-way street, the basic downtown area, as well as the apartment from which we had just walked.  We stopped walking toward the bay and watched the light as it began to approach our area, seeming to come straight toward us.  It soon became apparent that it was two lights, both white, blinking lights.  We made a couple humorous and skeptical verbal observations in an attempt to make each other nervous, or poke fun at ourselves, I suppose, for investigating what seemed to be a small airplane.  The lights came directly overhead, and it did in fact appear to be the lights on the end of a small airplane&#39;s wings, blinking in unison.  Although we could not make out the shape of the assumed airplane, the speed at which it (the lights) was moving seemed that of an average small plane.  When the airplane was just passing directly over our heads, two craft appeared above, behind (going the same direction but not quite caught up to it yet), and slightly north of it.  These objects were identical in size, shape, and color.  They appeared seemingly out of nowhere.  They moved at an astonishing rate of speed compared to the airplane.  They moved in the same basic direction of the plane, but in a manner that neither of us had ever seen before.  They seemed to &#34;wiggle&#34; almost, like watching a coin fall down through water, erratic, almost like the atmosphere around them was being manipulated, quite literally looking like stones skipped on the surface of water, like the air they moved through was bumpy, yet they negotiated it so quickly and with such fluid motion (which I know sounds contradictory to &#34;bumpy&#34; or &#34;wiggling&#34; movement).  They were basically side by side, but appeared to move independently of each other.  God, I haven&#39;t had to recall this in such detail since the few days following the event, telling it to my mother.  My body feels nervous again.  Anyway, the two objects shot past the airplane and out of sight to the east quite suddenly.  The total time we viewed the objects was 8 to 10 seconds, which seemed like plenty to us.  As far as appearance goes, like I said, they were identical.  They were oval shaped; that&#39;s the easy part of the physical description.  The part I find hard to describe is the color and, well, how they seemed to glow.  Yellow.  Color is simple I suppose.  But it wasn&#39;t just yellow, they seemed &#34;alive&#34;, I guess, like a firefly, and even in the short time we viewed them, we could see that they glowed not like a traditional light bulb, not like a filament (sp?) inside or like flourescent (sp?) bulbs, but the WHOLE craft glowed that yellow, and not at a constant brightness.  They seemed to &#34;warm&#34; or something, I don&#39;t know.  Like a firefly, that yellow glow seemed to be produced from inside in an almost organic looking way.  I have since become interested in UFO research and have always looked for photographs or descriptions that match the objects me and my friend saw that night.  I have seen somewhat similar looking pictures, but I don&#39;t reca! ll seeing video footage of the exact movement and glowing qualities we saw.  Anyway, the two of us were skeptics before this incident, and I suppose I still am.  My friend has since moved to NYC and I haven&#39;t spoken to him for a few years.  Last time I saw him, in 2000, after our &#34;how&#39;ve you been&#34;s and &#34;nice to see ya&#34;s were out of the way, the conversation went straight for our experience back in 1994.  Neither of us have had a sighting like that one since, and I remain a skeptic, but in the year following our experience, I did see two yellow objects skipping through the sky at night again, and again, DOWNTOWN Olympia, which isn&#39;t a huge metropolis or anything, but there are plenty of people walking around.  I began to assume that people must just not look up or something.  I began to worry that I was MEANT to see these things, among a few other quickly passing thoughts that made me feel insane for a minute.  I phoned the local AM radio station, which is located right on the bay mentioned (we would have walked right to the station had we kept going in the direction we were walking when we went to get a closer look at the original light we saw) the next morning.  I asked whoever answered the phone if they had received any calls mentioning anything &#34;odd&#34; or having anything to do with seeing anything &#34;abnormal&#34; in the sky above the bay, and asked if anyone at the station had seen anything or heard about any strange things in the sky above their station.  I tried to avoid the word &#34;UFO&#34; as I always assume that most average Americans won&#39;t take me seriously.  Nothing.  They said they hadn&#39;t heard of or seen anything, hadn&#39;t had a single phone call about anything at all.  The guy&#39;s voice seemed skeptical; I suppose he thought I was pranking him or something.  This is the first time I have officially reported or claimed this event in any way.  I have told a select handfull of friends over the past nine years, as well as my mother.  I told my mother first, because she knows I don&#39;t lie to her, and I was such a ! wreck for a few days following the incident, I NEEDED to tell someone that I knew would believe me.  I felt crazy and my mind wandered into such new and frightening territory.  That night altered not only my skeptical and analytical mind, but also my perception of REALITY, PERMANENTLY.  I have never been the same since.  I look up with a different appreciation, not only for the sky, but for my place on this planet, my species, and I think most of all, I wonder about all the other possibilities, facts, and realities that our government knows of and won&#39;t tell us about.  If those things I saw were not of this world, then I imagine that our government knows they are there at the least.  If they ARE of this world, then I imagine that our government has technology quite beyond things I&#39;ve seen in movies, and that frightens me a bit more than the prospect of being &#34;secretly&#34; observed by another species.  Overall, I would mostly like to state that this has not been a positive experience for me.  My dreams following this event were not pleasant and restfull ones.  My thoughts are filled with frightening images and questions.  A general feeling of anxiety and uneasiness takes over my mind and body at times.  As I get older, I wish so much that I could be filled with the excitement and wonder and curiosity I&#39;ve read about others feeling when they speak of their own experiences.  I was traumatized by this event.  I shook until the next morning.  While I am interested intensely in this area, I AM quite troubled by the mystery of it all.  I DO want to KNOW.  I used to scoff at this crap.  I don&#39;t even know who you people are or why I&#39;m telling you all this.  Maybe I felt some hope when I heard you on Coast to Coast the other night.  I heard you say something about reporting sightings and then &#34;easy to remember web address, UFO center dot com.  All you have to remember is UFO Center.&#34;  Well, I wrote it down.  Here is my hope:  If there is any chance of me making contact with anyone else that might have seen what I saw! that night, I would like to talk to them or write e-mails or ANYTHING.  I have lost contact with the friend that I saw these things with and haven&#39;t talked to him for about three years.  I feel very alone when it comes to this subject in my life.  If feels pointless and silly to try to talk to even my fiance about it because she is such a skeptic herself that even though she knows (I think) that I&#39;m telling her the truth, she can&#39;t really FEEL it.

In fact, Robert Gribble, founder and director of the National UFO Reporting Center at the time of the incident, was instrumental in the capture of the radar data of the objects over Lake Michigan.  He called the National Weather Service, and recommended that they use their radar in order to detect the objects, which was successful.  It was  NWS radar operator who spoke with a Michigan Highway Patrolman, and both of them were looking at the objects, the patrolman visually, and the operator using radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, there was a dramatic sighting of a presumed UFO over the University District of Seattle on the night of the event over Lake Michigan.

Asking myself what is it.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92865.html|17|ndxe199403| It wasnt lights in the sky, I seen a green radioactive subject at my window when i was a child. Im older now.  Asking myself what is it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to start by saying my sighting. Wasnt a light in the sky. My subject was actually at my window. It was a thunderstorm, after midnight a loud thunder woke me up out my sleep. I looked around, and there it appeared at my window. It was a radioactive green glow, it didn&#39;t have a body like a human. I would say the shape looked like, a ghost. But only the subject&#39;s body material was moving. Also see threw. The eyes and mouth looked the same, like cut out. But only that&#39;s how it was made. Understand it didn&#39;t look nothing like E.T.  Or how the movies predict aliens look.  It wasn&#39;t shape with arms,legs or a neck.  Must I remind you it was up close in personal at my window. Long story short, it made a weird long howl sound.  And the whole time during the scream, it had me frozen with my eyes popped   open like a zombie. I could not move at all.  It made me look directly in its black holes.  Black holes are the eyes. The scream lasted about five seconds.  And it v! anished. In thin air at my window. I remembered what I saw for about,maybe a month after  I saw it. It must have erased my memory until I got older. I swear to God the above statement is true.  I was about four yrs old when that happen. Now I&#39;m twenty four. At twenty one my memory was brought back.  I ask myself everyday since what was that?  Because then I thought someone was trying to scare me.  But I&#39;m older now. Listen too me that wasn&#39;t no costume, that was a real alien.  Not lights in the sky. I never beleved in ghost or aliens. Until my memory was brought back. Now I beleve because I&#39;ve seen one.<n>

I haven&#39;t told this story but to a select few... In the Fall of 1994 two friends and I were driving my car from Glenwood Springs, Colorado to Phoenix.  We got a late start, and did most of the driving well after dark. We passed through Moab, Utah and continued South. I had never been passed Moab, and was surprised when we started passing through some hills on a small two lane highway that was surrounded on both sides of the road by Lodgepole Pines. I recall this distinctly and paid close attention to the sign that read &#34;Welcome to the White National Forest.&#34; As I came over the crest of a large hill, I noticed in the high distant sky what appeared to be three yellowish-white lights that formed a triangle. I thought it was VERY strange, and woke my friend up whom was in the passenger seat. I didn&#39;t say anything, just poked him. We both sat speachless at a dead stop in the road, and watched as the three still lights started to rotate as if it were one. They rotated round and round for a few seconds and then all of the sudden the three lights shot off in the three oppisite directions that each of the &#34;points&#34; of the triangle were pointing towards. That was it... we sat in the middle of the dark desolate highway for a few moments trying to make sense of it. Our third friend asleep in the back never realized what went on while he slept in a car in the middle of the desert. A few years later I lost my breath when I watched the movie &#34;Fire In The Sky,&#34; and saw that the story took place in &#34;The White National Forest.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/3/94 00:00|Albany|NY|Rectangle|6 hous|A repeat and endless loop of an object downtown suny albany campus.|4/18/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87884.html|19|ndxe199403| a repeat and endless loop of an object downtown suny albany campus<n> <n><n> <n><n> While a friend of mine was washing his downtown suny albany campus dorm room window he witnessed the object and ran into my room and directed me to watch out his window.  At first I didn&#39;t see anything and felt a wave of embarrassment while I look back at him to detect any foolish prank and as soon as I looked at him he redirected again to watch out the window.  His words were &#34;keep looking&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I turned back and a moment later the object recreated itself without any warning. a few second would pass and the object would vanish.  Then the whole affair would repeat without end.  A search for a camera return zero results, so without means to record or anyone to report we went out of the dorms and towards the object betting on a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the object until dawn and the morning light and walked back to home base. We never spoke of the events or bothered to look skyward again.  Were we abducted?  If we were &#34;they&#34; did a good job of it.  In the morning hours!  I remember seeing birds, that idea horrified the other witness.  He said &#34;It was not a flock of birds.&#34;   No sound and maybe an outlined with small lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I heard of a field trip just to witness this thing.<n>
3/2/94 23:15|Lindsborg|KS|Triangle|10 seconds|Black Triangle with Slightly Askew Leading Edge|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50597.html|20|ndxe199403| Black Triangle with Slightly Askew Leading Edge<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2315 hours on the March 2, 1994, I was in my dorm room (107) at Alma Swensson Hall on the Bethany College Campus in Lindsborg, Kansas.  I was unable to sleep, and walked to my window to look west across the lawn over into the area of Presser Hall, and, after a few seconds in the window, my attention was drawn upward by an unusual object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, with no adverse weather conditions, and I recall no noise whatsoever.  But, I noted an object, which I can only describe as a black or other dark colored equilateral triangle which appeared from not directly above my building, but rather at an eleven o&#39;clock position.  The most striking feature about this object was that it did not fly with a logical leading edge.  In other words, if twelve o&#39;clock would be straight ahead, and the nose position on a conventional aircraft, this object&#39;s corners were at roughly two o&#39;clock, five o&#39;clock, and nine o&#39;clock.  Continuous white lights were observed at the two and nine o&#39;clock positions, and a continuous red light was observed at the five o&#39;clock position, which would approximate the &#34;tail&#34; of the aircraft.  This object left no contrail, and made no noise whatsoever.  While difficult to state with certainty, I would estimate the object to be approximately 1,000 feet above ground level, traveling due west.  I watched the object pass over the Bethany Campus, and lost sight of it as it disappeared behind Presser Hall and various trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did this object perform any stunning maneuvers, or violate any fundamentals of physics.  At the time, I noted mentally that I was less than 100 miles north of McConnell Air Force Base, and initially attributed the object to a military test of some sort, but soon realized that McConnell is not really known as being a test facility.  I remained at Bethany until May of 1998, and never again saw anything similar to this craft, but did, on numerous occasions, witness various military aircraft in the area over the years.  Aside from the bizarre angle and leading edge placement, I could easily attribute this to a craft of Earthly origin.  However, at present, some twelve years later, I have yet to see anything about new military aircraft that have a leading edge built in such a manner.  It struck me as odd enough that I made a crude sketch immediately after seeing the object.  (In 2004, after hearing a radio program in which Mr. Colm Kelleher of the National Institute of Discovery Science discuss sightings of so called &#34;black triangles,&#34; I drew the object in a more detailed manner, and attempted to place it &#34;to scale.&#34;  I subsequently filed a report on this incident with N.I.D.S. and included my original and later drawings, which I will forward to NUFORC in a separate email submission.)  As the object was so dark and blended into the night sky, I could not tell definitively if the object was a proper triangle, or if the edges were more rounded.  Therefore, in the more detailed drawing, the edges of the object are drawn both as straight lines and as curved lines.  I am certain the object was not perfectly round, in any event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were 3, in a line, it went green light, red light, green light. The UFO was only 2 or 3 metres in front of the car and we had to brake to avoid hitting it. Whatever it was made no sound and moved slowly about 4 feet off the ground. When it got to the other side of the road it just faded into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The bird/object flew very gracefully with very slow movement of the wings. It flew over the roof of my building and was no longer visible.
