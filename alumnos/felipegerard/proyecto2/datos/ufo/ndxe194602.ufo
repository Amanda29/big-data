By chance, I looked west (left) and far away (35 miles or so), a motion in the sky caught my eye.  It was headed SE,and moving in an arc in my direction.  It curved east and approached the base.  The arc took it on a path toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, I could see three spheres, luminescent chartreusse.  They passed about 80 degrees westward over me, arced to the north and quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around for someone that I could say &#34;What the hell was that?&#34; but there was no other person within sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that struck me was the absence of any sound.  Also, it was still daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never heard of UFO or &#34;flying saucer&#34; until 18 months later.  Then I wondered if that was similar to my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t talked much about the experience, and you probably know why.<n>
