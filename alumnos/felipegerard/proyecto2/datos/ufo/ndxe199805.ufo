I was watching the stars as we walked and i noticed a triangle flying from were the sun set just about 30 minuetes before.  I asked my 3 year old son if he saw it and he replied &#34;look daddy a kite&#34;  it was flying very fast and there was no sound.  I believe that kids who were playing in the street saw it too.  i dont know if it was a stelth but it was much slimmer trangle than i thought those are.  and there was no light coming from it except some haze at the top denser than airplane lights.<n>

My dad and my friend called me out of my tent to come and see a UFO, but I didn&#39;t believe them.  I seen a bright light and flew out of the tent.  I seen two saucer-like objects about 30 feet up in the air just at a standstill.  They began to come straight down, then they disapeared.<n>

I was on my bicycle and stopped to watch. It was hovering. It was a metal ball/ sphere shining in the sun. No electric cables were near so it couldnt be something like that things to warn planes. It was noon. After three minutes i looked away for just an instant and it was gone. Quite amazing. I am absolutely sure off what i have seen! I have no further information regarding the object<n>

A cone shaped object slowed down 400 feet next to the left side of my truck. After about 10-15 seconds two more objects came down besides truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first cone shape object to appear came down through the clouds with fire and smoke rings coming off of it.  It then descended to about 400 feet above the ground next to the left hand side of my truck.  The first object then stopped where it then nosed-up to a 45 degree angle and then proceded to descend backwards.  Then the other 2 objects appeared in the same manner as the first, where then the first object began to move forward.  The first cone shaped object was about 1/2 mile ahead of the other two, where the back end of the first object was visible. This tail end of the first object was glowing red hot, such as the brightness and detailed color of a sunrise.  The second and the third cone shaped objects were flying side by side with one just above the other.  All three objects ignored traffic on the highway and the traffic on the highway ignored them.  The first one turned up at a 45 degree angle and turned left away from the highway.  It then accerlatered from the highway with a high rate of speed..  The other two objects did the same thing as the first one.  They were all redish brown in color, no windows, no wings, no markings, no sound, and they looked brand new.<n>

It was realy late so we had to hurry home. As we were walking, i looked up to see one bluish light almost directly above me. Almost immediatly after, to other lights came together to form a triangle. As it hovered, it went around in a circle. I was too scared to actually count the seconds it lasted, so 30 sec. is the closest approximation I could give. After a while the lights just dissapeared.<n>
5/30/98 21:00|Salem|OR|Oval|2105|EXPLOSION OF CRAFT 1998|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70825.html|6|ndxe199805| EXPLOSION OF CRAFT 1998<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was May 30th, 1998,  9 PM Sunday night.  Had just finished watching  “Touched By An Angel “ It was warm and a soft breeze had been blowing.  It was twilight, not light, but not dark, the stores had just closed and people were still out, most likely heading home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my cats, &#34;Patches,&#34; now deceased,  was acting strangely and wanted out, so I went to the door and followed her out and glanced at the sky in front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw it.. a large craft kind of oval in shape, about the size of a car, could not make out the shape, it was diffused light, off in the distance, moving very slowly and seemingly very low altitude towards me.  My husband came out to see what I was looking at and I pulled him down the sidewalk, away from the artificial lights of the house, we were standing by the edge of the house, near the garage. We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a “ plane “ might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said ‘ Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  “ No, it was an accident on the bridge, “ I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, &#34;it could be a asteroid or something&#34;, but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said “ according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth&#39;s  atmosphere at that time.” I said “ You mean it was a asteroid or something ? “ He said “ You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.” Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn’t we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn’t someone else report this?  5/30/1998<n>

It was a whiteish blue going directly east tough to tell how high but it was definetly miles as I noticed it moving I told my wife I was seeing it and thoght it was a satelite until it did a zig or zag and went right back on its course it appeared to have moved around an object in its path I said to my wife she should have seen this we kept on talking less than 2 minutes later I noticed another object moving it was much higher than the first and was a bigger object of different color it was a reddish orange and it appeared to be moving straight up I told my wife i was watching it and had a camera in the truck I wanted to get a picture I hung up and ran to my truck got 3 pictures before it went so high it was gone the film when developed had no pictures on it and we took several other family pictures with it to and none turned out.I also saw cylindrecal object enter the atmosphere at a different time also around 3:30 am at that time i was several miles east and was driving on a road in south alberta when i saw what looked like blue sparks high in the sky ikept watching and stopped my car when it went from sparks to a flame in the flame i saw the object but just say the front 1 3rd or so i kept watching and then saw nothing i looked to see if it hit the ground but saw nothing the instalations that were there was a coast gaurd radio instilatoin<n>

Lastnight we dissided to sleep outside.  The clouds were out so we really couldnt see the stars .  We were talking about something and I saw a large and bright haze in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright greenish object in the sky. I immediatly yelled to my cousin to look up in the sky.  He then saw it and freeked out.  He got up and started to run towards the house.  I was amazed and still was looking at it.  It then shot away and left a green-yellow glow behind.  After i saw it leave i got up and saw it reapper.  Their is a barn close to us and the house and it lit up.  Their were no cars around and this is in a pretty secluded area.  My Cous then screamed.  He said the light was directly on top of him but i was too busy getting my shoes on.  As I was running towards the house all of a sudden it became pitch black and nothing was in the sky.  We remember it being pretty light ouside we could see each other fi! ne and didnt think anything of it.  About 25 minutes before it happened we were setting up a tarp to set our sleeping bags on.  I brought a super high powered flashlight that is used for my fathers boat.  My cousin was flashing it in the sky pointing out different stars that we could see through the clouds.  This might have attracted them who knows.  Throught the whole thing I was amazed at it and perfectly calm.  Next week we are going to sleep out again w/ cameras and if any thing happens i will write back.<n>

The object appeared as a bright star in the northeastern sky from Chandler AZ on the morning of 29 may 1998, 05:10 hours. Object remain stationary from first sighting until after 07:35 hours. Object was gone at 08:00 hours. Object was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. One arm length and the width of the hand plus extended thumb. A ratio of approximately  1 to 4 (or .25).  This elevation remained unchanged even after I got to work where I easily spotted the object in what I assumed to be the same location. The line of sight distance to work is 7 miles to the southwest. This means, as the elevation was essentially unchanged, the object was at a considerable distance. At least 40 miles I&#39;d guess. The object appeared to displace about one eight inch. That is the gap between the index finger and the thumb at arms length. That would be about what you&#39;d get from a street light at about a 100 feet.  The object appeared elongated in the north south direction and I would guess was at least 1000 feet long.  It appear to be white in color. note: sighted an object up close 03:40hrs  13 Oct. 1997 went over the road a head of me. Sighting was only seconds. glowed whitish/bluish, large, going west to east, thought it was an airplane coming in for a landing at first. trees on either side of road limited view.<n>

Surface was reflective and brightness was greater than Venus during full phase.  Object is an ovoid and appears much like a hot air balloon.  However, it has not moved in over two hours, a balloon normally moves with air currents.  Air currents during Phoenix mornings are east to west.  The object&#39;s composition resembles polyethelyne plastic, but the entire object appears to be of the same composition.  Three &#34;legs&#34; can be seen from the bottom of the object and a large cylindrical section hanging from the bottom.  This thing appears to be a balloon of some sort but it is the strangest balloon I have ever seen.<n>

On Friday, May 29th at approximately 2:45 pm, I was returning on American Airlines flight 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas.  We landed from the north at DFW.  About 5 - 10 minutes before landing, I was watching attentively out my window when in front of the aircraft, at about the 2:00 position in the sky, I saw a metalic silver and navy blue disc like object.  It was about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide.  It may seem odd that it was disc shaped with these specifications, however, it was almost as if it were segmented.  Imagine a disk about 8 inches with squared off sides sitting on top of another disc about 16 inches wide, sitting on top of another disc about 24 inches wide.  Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical. At first I though it was a bird, but a couple seconds latter in came into clear focus as we flew only about 200 feet away from it.  It was on the right side and roughly the same altitude, about 4,000 feet.  I am familiar with altitude as I have about 20 hours of flight instruction. It was definitely the most uniquely mysterious object I have ever seen, and I can&#39;t think of anything to explain it.  I believe it was either moving slowly or not at all.<n>

It then appeared to ascend at a very high speed until the brightness diminished and then it disapeared.  The sky was clear. I&#39;ve seen many a meteor as well as the space shuttle. I know it was neither nor an airplane.. I have 20/20 vision. I am the only one who saw this object. My belief in UFO&#39;s has been neutral. I had to see one to believe in their existance..<n>

After the initial flash, the light intensity increased so that the immediate area of the sky was filled with the blue green color.  The duration was short (1 second), but the intensity was so great that the interior of my car was filled with the blue green color.  The flash was observed while I was driving on Flamingo road, somewhat near the Florida everglades, at 22:43.  The object appeared to my West, and was probably over the Florida everglades.  I am an 18 year old student at the University of Florida.  I am studying microbiology to become a medical doctor.  I have never before witnessed a UFO.<n>

I was standing in a parking lot with one other person. As time passed the object changed shape as if it were an amorphous blob floating across the sky. I noticed this because I looked up to see what was making a loud noise and saw two military helicopters fly by travelling southeast. I noticed the blob at the same time. The blob was a group of small white lights. Then I saw what looked like a shooting star starting slightly east of the object. It went over the object and dissappeared and then the object itself faded away. I am a 24 year old married female and the other witness is an 18 year old male. We both work for a delivery service.  I think the shooting star was the object as it was leaving because immediately after i saw the shooting star the object faded away.<n>

It looked like a glowing white sphere against the indigo sky, and was the only celestial object visible other than the crescent moon. It was approximately 20 times the size of a typical star. It remained completely stationary in the sky throughout the course of our sighting. The object brightened then faded several times, and after a few minutes, it began to shrink in size and fade in brightness, shrinking to the size of a typical star over the course of about 30 seconds. This star-sized object was visible for at least a few more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend, her two daughters, and myself were on our way out to dinner. We got in my truck around 8:30 p.m. and were heading south out of my driveway when I saw the object and pointed it out to the others. We stopped the truck and my friend&#39;s daughter ran back to the house to get her binoculars. We stood in the driveway and observed the sighting as reported above. The object was obviously distant. There is no way to estimate its actual size or location.<n>

What IS it?&#34;  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d recognize a UFO unless it landed in my yard. So, here it is.... If you look at a steel I-Beam from the end, it makes a capital I. This thing had that shape, which didn&#39;t change no matter how it turned, and it appeared to be black. The top and bottom of the I were quite thick in appearance. We thought it had to be a real quiet bi-plane style ultralight, as we see a lot of experimental aircraft flying up from the Arlington airport (some look to be little more than flying lawnmowers, to be honest, and make as much racket!). But this had No Tail and No Visible Pilot.  It was a bit larger than an ultralight, and moved faster, at about the same rate a small plane would but was pretty manuverable (sp?).  We could see it circling the water treatment holding ponds across from the Dairy Queen in Stanwood (in the Viking Village/Red Apple plaza).  It then moved a little east over some fields and checked those out, then swung down south toward the Warm Beach area.  It was still light out, but it didn&#39;t reflect any light.  I&#39;d have to say it was only 200 feet in the air.  If we had been coming down the hill from East Stanwood (which is about 200 feet higher than the downtown area), we would have been able to look down on it. (We do have biplanes in the area -- saw one today doing stunts over Pioneer Highway, but like I said earlier the whatsit had no tail and the top and bottom were very thick.  Too thick to be standard biplane wings.) My seven year old has much sharper eyes than I have, and she was going nuts trying to figure out what the devil it was, as it wasn&#39;t falling into any category of aircraft, powered or unpowered, that we had seen.  She&#39;s seen paragliders and hang gliders and she assured me it wasn&#39;t one of those.  I could make out the shape, but not the details, but she said there weren&#39;t any details for her little sharp eyes to see.  My 4 year old also saw this whatsit, but she is very speech delayed so she wasn&#39;t much help. Speaking of the four year old, coming back down from Mt. Vernon today at about 2:45 pm, she let out a squawk and pointed at the sky, saying something had burst out of a cloud.  I saw something streak back into the overcast, but didn&#39;t get a good enough look.  I figured it was just a jet.  Except within two minutes some jets from Whidbey Island shot by in the same direction as the streak.  Maybe they were just practicing.  They have been flying A LOT lately over Stanwood, fairly low too. Oh, you need a little about me.  I&#39;m a 40 year old stay at home mom who wears contacts - one is a toric lense to correct astigmatism.  You see why I rely on my daughter to pick up the details.  I did ask her to draw a picture of what she saw, and it did verify my impression of the whatsit.<n>

I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but realized once I was actually watching it that it wasn&#39;t. The object very faintly glowed a dull brown that would have been hard to see if the motion hadn&#39;t caught my eye. The length of the object was approximately the same as the apparent width of the full moon. It was wider than it was tall: probably a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. I only caught a second of its east to west motion before my line of sight was blocked by the garage. I hurried down the porch and fell in the process. I was unable to see the object when I stood up -- it was moving pretty quick. I estimate that it covered approximately 20-30 degrees in about 1 second as I watched it. I looked in the direction that it had been traveling for about three or four minutes. A single flashing white light emanated from near Arcturus. It blinked 3 or 4 times, progressively getting brighter with each blink. After the final bright blink, which I estimated to be the same luminosity as a medium-bright Venus, it was no longer visible. There were no clouds in the sky, and I could ses faint stars in the location where it had been blinking. There was only a slight haze and the blinking was much brighter than the dim stars that I could see. Thios event lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. I watched for a few more minutes, but all I saw was a satellite traversing the sky in the east -- quite distant from the location of the other two objects. I have worked at this location for nearly two years and I spend considerable time outside at night smoking cigarettes and watching the skies. I have never seen a bird reflecting the street lamps at night -- that is the only the possible explanation for the first object that I can think of. If it was a bird, I probably would have seen the reflection changing as the bird flapped its wings, but the shape of the object and the glow remained consta! nt. The second object may have been an airplane, although it was quite high for the blinks to have been that bright. Usually when a plane turns you can make out different colored landing lights or something, and they usually don&#39;t just disappear as the second object did. I usually only see airplanes while watching the skies at work, but I have sighted a group of 2 UFOs on another occasion. Other than these two instances, the skies over my work are pretty boring. I am going to contact the Dane County Regional Airport to see if they received other calls or tracked anything unusual last night. Other than that, it&#39;s just another frustrating sighting.<n>

My 14 yr. old son ran to me from the back area of the Pony( we had just finished hosting a holiday show/barbeque) and excitedly described the same object that one of the band members &amp; I had just seen. We all kept searching the skies when the object rose very slowly from the north side of Convention Hall. It hung in the air for approximately 15-20 seconds before moving, what looked like, west. At this sighting we were approximately 3/4 mile away from it. It moved sready &amp; slowly until our view was obscured by the incomplete Ocean Mile high rise building.<n>

It went behind a cloud for a few seconds then came back out. It had a tail about twice the size of it.  It made no sound at all and had a haze around it.  My frind and I called over someone else to see it but by the time he looked up it went behind anoughter cloud.  We looked up for about five minutes but it never came out.<n>

My ex step dad was in the air force and told me that they(UFO) are us.. Thats about it.Wish we new the truth on UFO&#39;s!!! I guess if we new the truth if they are true?That uncle sam would worry that no one would follow his ways anymore??

Alot of air trafic is going on this day.Blimps ,old planes. etc.I saw a comm. jet and then a strange shape above it. No wings could be seen,but it was moving as fast as the jet in a cross pattern.It then seemed to tumble or twist as it moved apearing to change shapes.Also a faint circle appeared around it.Everyone there witnessed the same things.It moved northeast as fast as a jet.(oppisite jet stream)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds had just cleared after a brief afternoon shower. Some clouds still remained but they were more of a high cirus type.The object was almost black in color, and at first seemed to be a large egg.I grew up around airplanes,my brother was an airforce pilot witch we would go see often as I was growing up. So I like to think of my self a semi pro spotter and identifer.Many military planes fly around this area so I show off and tell people what they are easily.I said look theres a Stealth,no what the hell is that!!!  We all saw this shape then tumble or turn so that a single point became clear then gone ,then it was there then it wasnt.It moved to fast to be a balloon and it was heading into the jet stream and the wind.   I KNOW WHAT I SAW  BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT I SAW!!! This object was unidentifiable to anny of us.No one knew exactly what to do or say.The only thing that makes me doubt my siting is that it never changed course.  Iwish it did then I would be sure.<n>

The total formation as discribed in the above summary followed the movement of the observer which was quiet scary because the observer was going back and forth to the car not really knowing where to go while the formation followed the observer&#39;s movement. After entering the house the observer went on the balcony to check whether the object was still around. The formation was indeed there right over the house. The distance was hard to judge but moving clouds were sometimes covering the formation. The outer cirle had at least a diameter of double armlength and the individual white spots had appr. the size of a full moon. The next circle of white spots had appr. half size of the outer one.  The centre circle comprised 4 spots close to each other. The whole formation was rotating like a rolling wheel to the right - stopped after one full circle rotation and was than rotating to the left. These movements where continuesly going on for about 15 minutes. At the end all white spots were moving to the centre forming a big white spot (appr. two time the size of the moon) and where rapidly flying away.<n>

A plane flying across the sky heading west came to the area where the two lights were and then a third light blinked on. This third light looked th come very close to the plane and then shot off two the east, in the opposite direction of the plane. The light moved rapidly east waving up and down erraticly.

Est the size to be about the size of a pea held at arms length and of a blueish white color.  No noise was heard which is what caught my attention. Also, most aircraft travel in an east west direction as the airport and airbase are southwest of the city.  Speed was more consistent with that of a jet coming in for landing - slow and steady - covering approx six inches of sky in, I guess, four seconds.  At this point the object simply disappeared - I thought it may have gone behind a cloud but it never reappeared.<n>

After I located the origin of the noise below my open window, I raised my eyes to look west, out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont. I saw what appeared to be 2 wingtip landing lights from a heavy jet aircraft, such as a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, yet steady and no noise was heard. I quickly ascertained that the lights were far too spread apart and far too bright to be aircraft lights. After approx. 10 seconds from initial sighting, the 2 lights began to converge, left light moving toward the right light. At 15 seconds the 2 were very close together and began to head in a northerly direction, left to right from my westward looking viewpoint.

About 15 teenagers, were skateboarding southbound on the street I live on, producing a low pitch roaring sound on the pavement below.  After watching them for a couple of minutes, they were nearly out of sight.

One star was of medium brightness, and the other star, at the 3:00 o&#39;clock position, was very dim, just half as bright, and about the distance of a quarter held at arms lenght from the other star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the dim star, just a speck of light, made sharp, angular manuevers, all within close proximity to the other star.  I remember exclaiming to myself &#34;holy mackerel, that thing is moving&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nearly ran inside to get my work partner, but I was afraid to lose track of it, so I just kept watching. Then the pin prick of light made a circular move, which brought it to the opposite side of the stationary star, to the 9:00 o&#39;clock position. These moves only lasted 4 to 5 seconds, maybe a moment more or less. It hesitated for a split second, and then headed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the presense of mind to start counting: one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, gone!!!  over the southern horizon, where I lost sight of it at about 15 degrees over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This speck of light had no sound and no tail.  It never flared brighter or dimmer. This speck of light, which I perceived to be very high in the atmosphere, crossed half the night sky in six seconds!!  It did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After making its manuevers and going south it did not accelerate, but simlpy arrived at its intended speed and went absolutely straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This once in a lifetime observation has annoyed me since it happened and I&#39;m pleased to report it. I have since retired from that line of work.  I look forward to spending many pleasant summer nights observing the the night sky and watching for stars moving in ways that neither the stars or our known military craft should be able to do.

At that moment we did not think anything of it, so we went back inside. Once inside my airamn asked me if I had heard anything outside, at that moment we realized we had heard no sound from the craft.  We both had a mild panic attack and we ran back outside and it was absolutely quiet. There was no way we could not have heard something from a regular aircraft. I have been around aircraft my whole Air Force career and have never seen a craft like it or craft not maing a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was very clear with no obstructions,i.e. trees lamposts etc. This ffor me was a truly moving experience I am very fascinated by UFO and unexplained phenomena,I was also quite scared! i DO HAVE A REPORT FROM THE LOCAL PAPER BUT MY ISP DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR ME TO UPLOAD IT<n>

I was speaking with my wife and sister-in-law when i noticed an object crossing the sky from West to East in a straight line.  The object was torroidal in shape with half of the radius (outer) in white and appeared luminescent.  The inner section was dark shaded fading to black in the exact center. When i initially spotted the object, (it was at an elevation of aprox. 45 degrees and with an extended arm, would be the size of a dime held between the thumb and index finger) i exclaimed &#34;What is that!&#34;; i rose from the step, and advanced towards the driveway (North) to maintain my view.  My sister-in-law was able to capture a glimpse before it vanished behind the trees to the East of the house.  We scurried to the side yard (East of the house) where there is a fairly open field next to us.  It did not appear again. The field of view during the event was about 60 degrees incl. Skies are perfectly clear.  Wind is out of the WNW at 9 mph. Temp is 82 degrees.  Humidity is 35%.  Dewpoint is 54 degrees. Visibility 10 mi.  Ceiling unlimited.  (data from Weather channel).

On Sunday evening May 17, 1998 my wife and I and a friend and his wife wittnessed the explosion of what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft.  It was located in a N-NW direction from Belle Vernon, PA at about 70 degrees elevation. We watched the object, which was more of less stationary (we had no real reference), from 8:10 PM until 8:50 PM.  At that time I witnessed the object explode leaving a cloud of debris which consisted of many small fragments and one larger &#34;dark red ball&#34; which a few seconds later, split into two smaller fragments. The general apperance of the aircraft was that of a &#34;glowing torriod&#34; with the center being darker than the outside. If you have any information I would appreciate your letting me know what it was that we saw. Please feel free to E-mail me if you desire additional information regarding the event.<n>

The object went into that part of the cloud I could still see it then the 2 lights that did seem to be a solid part of the object both at the same time in sync.widended out one to the left one to the right,moveded in little cirles in sync.the object was no longer visible,one light went back to the NE and one went back to the NW.Both moved in those directions what looked to be about 3inches in the skying,judging between my fingers and just went out or dissappeared.The rest of the object never came out of the clouds.IT made no noise,plane fly over all the time that low and you always hear them,helecopters that lw rattle the windows.Thi! s is close to the airport.I have had a very hard time even explaining yhis,and I did the best I could in words.Can you please let me know if anyone else reports this?<n>

I pulled into the empty school parking lot and got out with my date in aww. We both just stared and right before our eyes it got smaller and disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on the night of my senior prom. After the prom my date and i decided to go back to my house so i could get my tux off, and prepare for the rest of the night. The road back into town is wooded, comming up the road i noticed a light up in the sky, I knew something was odd about this light but it didnt click until my date said something to me, she was not from the area and asked me what the light in the sky was. I first of all would have misplaced it as a plain right off the bat, but it was idle and had no lights that indicated it could be a plain, so i said &#34; you know what i dont know what it is&#34; so at that point we just watched it until we got closer and closer. I was really in sort of an amazement when we finally got to my highschool parking lot and this object was still hovering up in the sky pretty much over my school. Of course we were the only two people there. My date and i got out, neither one of us saying anything, I looked up as intently as i could and observered this; A white glowing ovalish ball, with other off white colors on towards the bottom of the ufo. After about 20 seconds of starring in disbelief the object shrunk right before our eyes to a pinPoint and was gone...just like that. I felt something at that moment, I can say it was almost like it knew we were there observing it, almost like it could feel our presence and didnt want to be starred at any longer like we got a long enough look. Just writing this and thinking back gives me shivers.But let me keep you interested not more than 2 nights later My aunt was smoking outside on the porch and a ufo flew above the sky over the house i was there but not nearly quick enough to respond to a yell of astonishment. I have other relatives who have also seen ufos here in Maine. Does life exist outside our world ? I feel ignorant just typing that (  8 &gt;<n>

My buddy was lying down below trying to catch a quick nap, so I kept an eye on things (making sure we didn&#39;t get runover by some freighter or something). After, roughly 5 minutes went by I saw a glimmer of something again, this time I kept looking in that direction but couldn&#39;t make out anything, but I began to hear what sounded like a faint hum. NO lights, just an object or something off in the distance. I started getting paranoid at this point and decided to turn on our nav lights just in case another boat was coming, but really couldn&#39;t hear anything outside of a faint hum. I woke my buddy up, and told him what was going on, then told him to help me look for something off in the distance, because I knew something was there. My biggest fear was that another vessel was coming straight at us and we just couldn&#39;t see the lights yet. Finally, to the SouthEast of us we both saw what we thought at the time was a freighter coming because of the size, but we both remarked about that in the probably 10-12 years we&#39;ve been fishing together,we have never saw a large ship at night with NO nav lights on.  I started to grab my VHF radio to call and see if anybody knew what the hell was out there when all of the sudden there was this loud screaming sort of sound, not like a jet engine, but like a low pitch whine of a... I really can&#39;t think of anything, maybe a firework rocket inside of an empty dome stadium, sort of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came right at us and over us by only maybe 30 feet or so, but it happened so damn fast that it almost gave us a heart attack. We stood there, both of us dumbfounded, we could almost hear each others heart beating we were so scared. After, about 5 seconds or so we both looked at each other and yelled &#34;What in the F--- was that.&#34; When we finally turned around in the direction of whatever it was went all we could see was that faint glimmer again, but suddenly the faint scream and the glimmer were gone. We radioed out to see if any other boats might have been close enough in the vicinity to see or hear anything, but naturally NO!  Shape and exact size are hard to tell, when it came at us I could barely tell, but it was tapered looking and it did have a metallic type look but not shiny. If you can picture a small airliner buzzing you at about 30 feet thats sort of how it was. Not a terrible amount of wind to speak of as it came by, about like a car coming by you on the side of the road, enough to feel it, but not like it&#39;s going to knock you down or anything. Why didn&#39;t we report it sooner, I don&#39;t know. We both tried to come up with everything imaginable to explain it, and yes, we did consider telling somebody about it, well, we did tell a few people, but nobody of an authoratative type nature, but when my wife came home one night after a PTO meeting and she told me that somebody remarked&#34; ---- been seeing anymore UFO&#39;s lately?&#34; Well, I kinda let it go. I really don&#39;t say to much about it anymore except to my buddy, when he suggested that I go look up some stuff on the net and low and behold I found this sight. So I figured what the hell? Well, thats about all I got to say on the subject, but if anyone else saw the same thing that night/morning, post it on here so I can see it. Thanks!<n>

He seemed very excited but also a little scared. I looked out the window and I saw a bright blinking light, with 2 other lights below in the shape of a triangle off in the distance. The 2 lights below were not blinking, only the top one. I did&#39;nt think anything of it at first, until I saw it move. As I was watching it, the light would blink, then almost instantly, blink again in another spot in the sky. It&#39;s movements were sort of erratic, almost in the same sort of way an eye ball will move while looking at differant thing throughout a room. We live near a millitary base and I just figured it was something they were testing, and I just forgot about it, until I read a report on this site.  That is what I remember, but just for clearity, my brother would like to submit the way he remembers it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying awake in my bed looking out of my window because I couldnt sleep when I saw what at first looked like an airplane with its landing lights on it didnt seem strange to me at all untill I noticed that there was no sound coming from this &#34;plane&#34;  by this time my curiousity peaked and i opend my window in the expectation that i would hear jet engins roaring however when i did all i heard were the sounds of a breez blowing through the trees in our back yard suddenly the light was gone and when it next apeared it was about three hundred feet from my back yard and about 100 feet above the ground. it came up to my house and pased over, it couldn&#39;t have been any more that 60 or 70 feet over the roof top as i saw it pass by it flashed a beem onto the house and the surounding area i followed it as best i could i went to my brothers room to see it(his room is directly across from mine)i stood at his window waiting to see what would happen but it just sat there no sound no movment so i thought quickly and woke my brother as to make sure i had a witness and that i wanst dreaming or crazy. and thats where my brothers story picks up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I told my wife (future) as I stepped out that it was really low in the sky.  As I said this, I pointed at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that precise moment as if reacting to my pointing it made this fantastic manuever that I know for a fact no known human craft can do.  It made a really fast spiral pattern, leaving a light trail behind it. (motion blur).  It then began to &#34;float&#34; across the sky very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove up the street a little further, pulled over into a parking spot and watched it some more.  I noticed a police officer parked just up the street and walked out to his car to point out the object to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see what happened next myself, but my girlfriend (wife now of 13 years) said as I walked up to the officers car the object shot off into the horizon at amazing speed.  It may be one of those &#34;you had to be there&#34; moments, but for me and my wife it was something that we still talk about and are still confused and intrigued by today.  I would definitely like to be contacted about this by an investigator if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be nice to talk to someone with more experience in this field about what happened.<n>

Neither of us spoke for what I estimate was approx 4 minutes whilst we watched the object open mouthed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It spanned approx 3 (2 up 2 down )terraced houses and was really low,it was high enough that I could still see the underside and I got the impression there were 3 lights as when it rose up after being completely stationary above the houses 3 beams of light shone downward it was daytime but the light was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was close and low it made no sound at all, it was completely and utterley silent I just knew immediately it was not anything earthly as it was still, not hovering and so silent, after a few minutes (I think it was my brain was taking so much in it was very surreal), it rose slowly, still silently and went in a westerly direction for a short distance then literally zoomed off, no trail, no acceleration no noise and we could not see it within literally a second, Stretford isn&#39;t too far from Manchester airport so we were used to seeing aircraft landing and taking off and you can see them for miles in the distance, this was just gone. I got the impression it was metallic although it wasn&#39;t shiny by my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I (a work friend) just stood open mouthed for a while before we both kinda started babbling about what we&#39;d seen and what we should do, I mean there&#39;s no ufo hotline we we went outside no one else was in the street it was very surreal we decided to go to the phone box and call the local police, however despite repeated attempts we got the engaged tone so gave up after deciding we&#39;d try the next day, however after both returning home and excitedly recounted the story to various and numerous friends and family it seemed people just wanted to laugh the incident off.  Most peoples reactions were yeh, ok funny joke, I eventually lost my temper with a few people even my mum who (god rest her soul) was really open minded and knew me inside out said to me,I believe that you believe you saw a ufo. Even Paul my work mate, sick of being ridiculed eventually asked me to stop speaking about it as no one believed us and he was sick of the teasing, as you can imagine this rea! lly annoyed me, why would we lie to people we saw something we could not explain, it wasn&#39;t anything that moved like anything humans can currently engineer (to my knowledge) and the speed, the g-force alone would kill a human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway someting positive happened as approx 2 weeks later, and after me losing my temper with a fair few people that knew and loved me, after them not taking my sighting more seriously there was a big article in The Manchester Evening News about UFO&#39;s being spotted all over Manchester and the police main switch had been jammed with calls reporting these sightings, my friend still refused to discuss it and people were so blase about it I eventually dropped it.  About 6 years later I was talking to my new boyfriends mum about the incident and it turned out that she, her hubby and 2 kids had spotted it on the way home from school and had followed it for some time,. I also had a conversation with a new colleague a few years later that lived in Stretford and it turnd out that he also saw the same type of craft out of his high rise flat window although I&#39;m not sure if this was the same day, however to my maths that&#39;s 7 people I personally know that have seen this same ufo in Stret! ford. I&#39;m not saying it was a little  grey was at the controls, but I will bet my life that craft is not from this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems funny how blase I have become too over the years, I guess its because although people say they believe, and act inyerested in what you saw when faced with the facts of the story they try to tell you you didn&#39;t see what you know you did, I&#39;m not a moron, it wasn&#39;t a weather balloon, blimp, chinese lantern, remote control plane, copter etc, it was daylight and very close there wasn&#39;t even camera phones or I reckon I would have had some of the closest footage ever shot as that thing was low! I try not to watch too many things about ufo&#39;s as, aside from my partner and my 4 year old daughter and 8 year old son being sick of hearing me repeat the same story over and over again, I find it frustrating when people are sceptical I&#39;m also puzzled and shocked how the government still haven&#39;t given an honest statement regarding what is going on despite the number of strong sightings, tyrustworthy witness testimonies and video footage. I find that quite scary to be honest as I know without any doubt that UFO&#39;s do visit us so, so must the government, do they have a bad agenda? Is that why the government aren&#39;t speaking up? they don&#39;t want mass panic, I don&#39;t know, all I do know is the majority of the stuff I have seen on the web (usually what my partner has found, afterall I&#39;ve already seen one close up I don&#39;t need convincing) for example the  footage of the triangular crafts are, the same as the one that I saw,  and therefore very, very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You&#39;d think that you&#39;d be different somehow having this knowledge but nothing is different, life carries on the same except now you know there IS life on other planets.  I suppose the possibilities are endless, quite scary when you think about it, so I try not to think too deeply about it all as I don&#39;t have any answers and it looks like the government aren&#39;t gonna provide us with any, at least not anytime soon.  In fact this is the first time I have ever given a written account of what I saw.  I learnt a long time ago people think you&#39;re a bit odd if you start talking about UFO&#39;s so just my loved ones and close friends know these days, in fact one of the things I love about my man is that he believes me despite not seeing it himself, he doesn&#39;t just profess to be open minded, he really is, and he aint faking it, he believes me and that is really quite important to me I&#39;ve discovered, especially when you&#39;ve been mocked and ridiculed by loved ones, no matter how good naturedl! y the teasing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the day I saw something amazing and huge and I suppose it hurt It was afternoon I remember because we&#39;d not long finished work at 2pm but before the end of school at 3pm as it was still quiet outside, myself and my friend were sat on a sofa facing a large window that faces a row of houses, we were just chatting over a coffee when we both seemed to stop talking at the same time and jumped up throwing ourselves at the window in front as directly above the houses opposite us was a ufo, in broad daylight on a housing estate in Stretford! neither of us spoke for what I estimate was approx 4 minutes whilst we watched the object open mouthed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It spanned approx 3 (2 up 2 down )terraced houses and was really low,it was high enough that I could still see the underside and I got the impression there were 3 lights as when it rose up after being completely stationary above the houses 3 beams of light shone downward it was daytime but the light was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it was close and low it made no sound at all, it was completely and utterley silent I just knew immediately it was not anything earthly as it was still, not hovering and so silent, after a few minutes(I think it was my brain was taking so much in it was very surreal), it rose slowly, still silently and went in a westerly direction for a short distance then literally zoomed off, no trail, no acceleration no noise and we could not see it within literally a second, Stretford isn&#39;t too far from Manchester airport so we were used to seeing aircraft landing and taking off and you can see them for miles in the distance, this was just gone.

Afterall why would I lie? Why would so many people that have seen them lie and leave themselves wide open to ridicule and in a lot of cases the witnesses are professional people who could suffer repercussions if they made false statements.<n>

It was dusky dark and the road I was on has two sharp curves the first is to the left and as I turned the curve I noticed a red light coming straight up from a tree line in the east. At first I thought it was an antenna tower from the hills in that direction because it was flashing slowly, bright to dim and back again. It looked as if it were at least a mile away so I didn’t think much of it but it kept getting higher so I stopped my truck and watched. The light first came straight up then it went northwest. It dimmed and changed from red to white dimmed and then changed red again. From the moment it change direction it started moving faster, at first I thought it was a plane but it ended up going much to fast for a plane. It dimmed and it just blinked out. I sat there for a minute trying to figure out what I saw, then two jets flying staggered but side by side came from the same direction as the light did and disappeared behind the hill. It really started to make me wonder what I had seen. The light didn’t disappear behind the hill it just disappeared. Then I seen the two jets fly over and I could follow them the whole way.  The jets appeared just only a minute after I seen the light. I got freaked out and went to my house got my mother and took her to were I saw the light and told her what I had seen. That was the end of that and I haven’t seen anything like it since. I’ve told a couple of people since but no one believes me.<n>

Campbell Ky. It was 7:30am and I was to be the NCO in charge of a range maintenance crew going out to mow and weed eat some of the ranges on post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside of the main range building in the parking lot smoking and noticed a flickering white light drop down out of the low ceiling (500ft) heavy grey clouds. The object moved slowly and silently as if taking a peek from the cloud cover. The object was within 500 meters of where I was standing and never made a noise. It dipped down for about 10 seconds the slowly went back up into the thick grey clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the army for 15 total years and been around many army aircraft, I know how helicopters and prop, jet aircraft sound. This object made zero sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe the flickering light I saw was if you have a circle with 2 white lights rounding its boarder, but each time the lights touched they would reverse direction and continue until the made their way back around the circle and again touched. Almost like a ying yang or an infinity symbol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone on post about what I saw. This is the first time I have even said anything about it other then close family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time and I hope it helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I must stress that i was not intoxicated at the event and neither was my friend! Unfortunately we hadnt some where to stay that night&#34;due to technical problems&#34;, so we decided to go down to the beach for a while. Now it was around 4.30am and we were laying on a ridge in the sand looking up at the sky. I dont know how long it took me to notice but after some time i caught sight of a star shape image but much brighter moving accross the sky at an unusual high speed. It began to go all sorts of directions in the sky, which really caught my attention. So wondering what it was i said to my friend &#34;what on earth is that&#34;, and his replie was &#34;you can see it too&#34;. I admit i was tied at the time but there was no way that i wasnt seeing what i thought i was seeing, and there was two of us that seen it so there is no doubt in my mind that i seen that actualy happen. Due to the fact of being tied i just watched it, saying very little, on the other hand my friend didnt stop going on about it.He was so excited shouting,&#34;do you know what this means&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;star&#34; was constantly changing its direction going up, down, left AND right. It was amazing! Then after about a minute i just lost sight of it and that was it. I have told this to many people, wether they believed me or not i dont know but i can guarantee for anyone who reads this that it actually happend. What it was, i dont know but i sure do want to find out. Maybe i will oneday, hopefuly. I mean if i can find any way of possibly knowing what it was that i seen, i would jump at the opertunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness is semi-annymous.  PD))<n>

I was 7 or 8 minutes from home and out in the country. To my right up in the clouds I thought I saw a light. All of a sudden the sky lit up with lightning. At the point where I saw the light, Aball of light the size of the moon flashed on for 2-3 seconds then went out. I was thinking that a plane might have gotten struck by lightning. I know that lightning can do some strange things, and I did`nt think anything of it, til I got home, where my wife was freaking out about a disc shaped object she had seen in the soutern sky not more than ten minutes earlier. It was in the direction I was coming from, and it had been ten minutes earlier that I saw what I saw. I only saw a light and then the flash, She said that what she saw had a line of lights around the bottom. It moved back and forth over the tree line then blinked out. I`ve never seen a ufo to my knowledge. This is the first time for my wife too. I`d love to think that what we saw was alien.

Silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning home from a visit with my mother in Jacksonville, North Carolina.  It was approximately 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon (clear/sunny).  I was traveling North on Rt. 258, headed to Kinston, N.C. from Richlands, N.C. I was a few miles outside Richlands in the country.  The road was two lanes asphalt.  I was driving at about 55 mph,looking straight ahead down the road.  Both sides of the roadway was lined with large tree&#39;s.  Every now and then I would pass a house, farm, or open field, but ahead of me there were just tree&#39;s.  Suddenly, I observed a cigar-shaped object pass over the road ahead, from my right to the left.  It was flying level, approximately several hundred feet above the roadway.  It wa silver-colored, no markings, no wings, no cockpit or windows, and no exhaust.  On the read top third of the craft, it had what at first appeared to be a 30 degree angled verticle tailfin.  As I looked at the &#34;tailfin,&#34; it appeared to be, not a funtional tailfin (no visible rudder), but instead a part of the craft.  I couldn&#39;t see any shadow to indicate the vertical fin was narrower than the cigar-shaped craft.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  I have seen virtually every type of manned and unmanned aircraft, rocket, and futuristic type craft in or under development (both military and civilian).  I simply could not explain what I was seeing.  I heard no sounds.  I sped up my vehicle to see if I might come to a field on the left side of the roadway, so I might get a look at the craft going away from me.  I did not find any field ahead on the left side of the road.  This sighting was very disturbing to me.  I want to know what is going on???  Does the military have secret craft under development that defy gravity???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was bright enough to wake me from a dead sleep;  bright enough to pass through my eyelids and awaken me.  At first I thought it was lightning, and shut my eyes to go back to sleep.  The flash happened a couple of more times, yet I never heard any accompanying thunder. This was all probably within a matter of 15 seconds.  Eventually, the light went from a flash to a steady glow.  As if the lightning had changed from a flash to a steady light. That was the point at which I decided I would get out of bed and approach the window, because it didn&#39;t seem normal at all.  What I saw next has stuck in my mind over the years.  It was an extremely bright light which w! obbled and pulsated, varying in brightness from dim to bright enough to light up the entire sky as lightning often does. Sometimes it would flash at it did initially when it first awoke me.  It seemed that when it hovered in one place, it was unstable, wobbling from side to side and back to front. I estimated the distance to be many miles, but not more than 10, and the altitude to be in the thousands of feet, but probably no more than 5,000-8,000. At times it would completely go dim, as if it disappeared.   Within one or two seconds of disappearing, it would reappear with a flash of light, literally miles from where it had disappeared.  Scaling at the distance I estimated, it seemed that it could move 5-8 (maybe even 10) miles in approximately a second.  I also observed it doing aerial maneuvers that I have never seen a conventional aircraft perform.  For example, a high speed, lateral movement at what had to be thousands of mph, and then an immediate change of direction in! the opposite direction with no loss of speed.  I also observe! d it mak ing right angle turns at speeds that a reasonable person would find physically impossible for any known or man-made aircraft.  I watched this in awe for a matter of 10 minutes.  I actually had a video camera sitting on the desk in my room, but I was so worried that if I took my eyes off the object for long enough to retrieve the video camera, it may disappear.  I didn&#39;t want to take that chance.  Eventually, I ran downstairs to awaken my father because I really wanted him to see it, too.  I wanted to have someone else verify what I was seeing, so I wouldn&#39;t think I was insane.  By the time he came back upstairs with me, it was gone.  It probably took me about 2-3 minutes to awaken him and for us both to make it back up to my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I woke up and went to school as usual.  I was there somewhat early, and ran into a friend of mine who lived a block north and one street west of me.  His house was probably 80 to 100 yards away from mine.  During our small talk, I mentioned that I was pretty tired because I didn&#39;t get much sleep the night prior.  However, I didn&#39;t tell him why I didn&#39;t get much sleep, and I did not mention what I had seen to him.  What happened next gave me the verification that I yearned for when I had awoken my father that night.  He proceeded to tell me that he didn&#39;t get much sleep either.  He said that he woke up in the middle of the night to fetch some water from the kitchen.  Having been to his house countless times throughout childhood, I knew that his kitchen window faced the east, and would have been a prime viewing area for the phenomena I had witnessed.  Turns out, it was. He was awake the same time that I was the night before, and had witnessed the same thing I! had witnessed.  Neither of us ever officially reported the sighting to the police, and to this day it is something special that we share in common.  From time to time when we meet up, we talk about it.  I would also like to point out that I come from a family of pilots.  I have flown in private planes and commercial planes since I can remember.  I was raised at airshows, I have seen probably every type of high-performance conventional airplane pushed to the limit by the best of the best, such as the F-18 Blue Angels, and the F-16 Thunderbirds.  I have seen the F-117 in flight, and I have seen the newest Joint Strike Fighter that we have present day.  In short, through both experience and observation, I know what a conventional aircraft can and cannot do.  Obviously, I have somewhat of an understanding of the limits the human body can endure in terms of G force through conversations with my brother and grandfather, who are both pilots, along with knowledge I have picked up ! throughout my life as a result of my interest in fighter jets ! and any other types of airborne military technology. As far as what I saw that night, I don&#39;t know what it was, but I know what it wasn&#39;t.  I am 100% sure that what my friend and I witnessed that night was something that was not conventional, and probably not man-made.  If it was man-made, it is obviously a well-kept secret, as it probably should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend and I were getting a bite to eat and then were going to head back to his place in Palos Heights for the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way back to his house was straight down a major roadway, Harlem Ave. We were on 151st and South Harlem and we needed to get to 123rd and Harlem. From 151st to about 135th consists of driving through forest preserve. I was behind the steering wheel that night. As soon as we began heading North, I noticed a super-bright, white light in the sky that was not far off in the distance. I asked my friend what he thought it was. He replied &#34;a star&#34; but no star is THAT bright. As we proceeded on our way, I noticed the light never seemed to move. We approached the intersection of 143rd and Harlem and encountered the light, which was actually shining from the object. It was dark and cube-shaped; like a huge, black box floating in the night sky. We could see it&#39;s outline in the air, It was darker than the sky. We got stopped at a red light and we both stared up through the windshield at the craft. It had the singular light that was beaming down onto the roadway. This thing was huge, it was like a perfect square building that was floating. All the sides appeared to be smooth. It was moving south in the air under 10MPH and made NO SOUND as it moved. When the stoplight turned green, we proceeded on our way, rather dumbfounded. We were both about 18-19 years old and had never seen anything like this before. I don&#39;t think we knew how to react. We were just saying to ourselves, &#34;OK, that was different...&#34;  Also, perhaps worthy of note, 143rd and Harlem in the general area of Bachelors Grove Cemetary, one of the most haunted places in the Midwest. It&#39;s about a 2 minute drive east of the intersection we encountered the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was good visibility with few clouds while the Moon was also visible and approximately 2/3 full in the night sky at an apparently equivalent elevation but well to the south of the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having seen something unusual looking,  I pulled off on to the right shoulder of the interstate and got out of my car to better observe what was occurring.  This bright white light appeared to be a few miles north of me and was slowly moving in a southerly direction parallel to and somewhat to the east of I-95 coming towards my position.  At first, the unblinking white light appeared to have a short contrail which later disappeared when the bright white light changed into a less brilliant unblinking red light which then appeared to split into 2 such less brilliant, unblinking red lights that moved apart but remained side by side and separated by a some distance from each other.  Both continued to move slowly in a continued southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about this point, I noticed that there was a third, unblinking, dimmer red light which preceeded the other two by some significant distance, perhaps one hundred to a few hundred yards, which was also slowly moving in a southerly direction and to the east of I-95 towards my position.  Eventually the 2 following red lights dimmed to the level of the leading dim red light and shortly thereafter, the pair of following red lights continued to become dimmer until they quickly became too dim to be visible while the single nearer red light, though dim, continued to be visible for another couple of minutes until it also disappeared as it approached my position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that even though a short contrail was seen at first, at no time was there any sound associated with these lights as there should have been if what had been observed was merely a jet or an airplane, (the latter of which don&#39;t produce contrails).  Also, jets usually leave very lengthy contrails that remain visible long after they have passed which was not apparent in this case in the night sky that was well lit by the Moon.  I believe that what was seen could not have been a rocket or space shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral (which is a couple of hundred miles to the north) due to the close proximity of what was observed and the slowness with which the lights moved only a few miles over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.  Also, all planes, jets and helicopters have some blinking lights, but none of these lights blinked on and off. Finally, although these 3 lights appeared to move synchronously with each other, the background of the well lit night sky could be seen between them, so that they ultimately could be seen to be spacially separated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an addendum to this report, I would like to state that I had attempted to contact a few police departments local to the vicinity of the sighting at that time in 1998 but that I was then unable to obtain confirmation that anyone else had seen or reported a similar sighting until ten years later in 2008 when I first learned about this web site of the National UFO Reporting Center.  Whereupon, having checked my original written account of the sighting and searching this data base for the same date, time and location, I finally discovered that one other individual had reported a sighting that matched mine with exactly the same date, time and a very nearby location and although his description differs somewhat from mine there are overall quite a few elements in common between the 2 accounts.<n>

I do not recall the names of the other two.  The sky was high and clear.  We had not heard, or at least had not taken note of, an airplane all day.  While waiting to tee off on the 16th hole, our conversation was interrupted by the loud noise of airplane engines. We all looked up to see if the plane was in trouble.  It was a DC-9. The plane was about 5000 feet(guess) climbing and banking hard left to the ENE.  I was studying the silver ball, that the plane seemed to be trying to avoid, when my co-worker said, &#34;Hey!  There&#39;s a UFO!&#34;.  The object was perfectly round, bright silver, and its diameter was about 1/4 of the length of the fuselage of the aircraft.  The object was moving very slowly toward the nose of the plane.  The plane missed the ball by approximately half a mile and flew away safely.  None of us noted the carrier&#39;s name.  The ball did not follow. It changed direction to E, increased altitude.  We assured each other that we all saw it. We played on, checking it every few minutes.  It continued to move slowly to the E. After several minutes, we lost track of it.<n>

Lights faded from view, towards Scorpio, didn&#39;t just &#34;wink&#34; out. Initial impression was that the lights were fixed to a larger, dark object, and that the lights were being &#34;strobed&#34; to create impression of moving out of position. Only one observer, visual by eye, no binoculars or telescope. No pictures or video. The sky was clear. I am an amatuer astronomer and familiar with the sky, and my viewing area.

After listining to the Art Bell show last night I figured &#34;why not&#34; so here I am.  I work for a hospital in the Portland area.  I start work at 2300 hrs and usually arrive around 2245 hrs.  On this night I pulled into the parking lot, and began my short walk to the engineering shop where I work.  I am not sure why, but I just happend to glance in the sky, and I saw this object traveling across the sky at an increadiable speed.  It was not real high.  I would say about 500 meters up.  It was solid black with a strange triangular shape with a lot of sharp angeles.  It had no lights on it at all, and made no noise what so ever.  It traveled from the south to the north, and went from my field of view within 3 seconds or so.  It gave me the chills because I know I did not imagine what I just saw.  I was able to see it because there was a heave cloud cover this night, and the city lights put a white glow on the clouds.  When this solid black object came across the sky, it was not hard to miss against the city lit clouds.  This object was fairly big.  I would say about 75 to 150 feet long, so it appeared to me.  If you do happen to call, please call after 1700 hrs.  I wake up at 1630 hrs each day.<n>

It did not make a sound had no lights and was lower than the jet a third of its hight from my point of view. The shape Icould not make out but it appeared to reflect the city lights and it was travelinga two times the speed of the jet and was not visable in two minutes or less. I am a woodworker I graduated high school and took few collage courses and lived in wyoming most of my life and enjoy our clear star filled nights<n>

As we passed the entrance to KI Sawyer Airforce Base, we could see that the light was huge, super bright, very low (just barely above the pine trees) and stationary.  It never moved!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we neared Southgate Road, we approached the light.  Slowing down directly in front of it, I could plainly see that this object was triangular in shape.  It had one central bright white light (the one we noticed from the distance), as well as one small blue light on the left, and a small red light on the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I couldn&#39;t believe our eyes!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly turned his truck at the start of Southgate Rd to get a better look.  I had turned my head to keep my eyes upon this fascinating object.  As he turned the truck, I quickly turned my head to face the object- and it was gone!  I only took my eyes off of it for a split second- and it was NOWHERE TO BE SEEN!  It totally vanished!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep in mind that KI Sawyer Airforce Base shut down all operations and closed on September 30, 1995.

I CALLED OUT A FRIEND IN THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD HAPPEND TO QUICKLY!  CALLED MY BROTHER IN BOWLING GREEN, OH I WAS AMAIZED AT WHAT I HAD JUST WITNESSED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS STANDING ON MY PORCH GETTING SOME FRESH AIR.  I USUALLY LOOK AT THE SKY LOOKING FOR ANY INTERESTING AIRPLANES OR HELECOPTERS FLYING NEARBY.  THE HOPKINS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS LANDING PATTERN IS CLOSE BY AND YOU CAN USAULLY SEE SOME AIRLINERS COMING IN FOR A LANDING OR DEPARTING DEPENDING ON WHICH RUNWAYS THEY ARE USING.  I WAS SCANNING THE SKY AND NOTICED A FEW AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA BUT NOTHING INTERESTING UNTIL I LOOKED UP TO THE STARS AND NOTICED A LIGHT THAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR BUT IT WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED.  IT WAS MOVING SOUTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  I THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING AT A SATALIGHT IN ORBIT BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH SPEED AND ALTITUDE.  I CONTINUED TO WATCH IT, I FIGURED IT WOULD CONTINUE ON UNTIL I COULDN&#39;T SEE IT ANYMORE AND THEN I WOULD GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND WATCH TV.  BUT THEN I NOTICED IT WAS SLOWING DOWN. KEEP IN MIND THIS HAPPEND VERY QUICKLY.  I KNEW THIS WAS STRANGE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING WITH THIS MUCH SPEED AND ALTITUDE PERFORM LIKE THIS. THIS THING BRAKED LIKE A PORSCHE ON STEROIDS!  I YELLED FOR CARRIE TO COME OUT AND LOOK BUT YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN CAN BE, FIRST THEY ASK WHY!  I DON&#39;T THINK SHE MADE IT OFF THE SOFA BEFORE THIS THING CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND SHOT OFF TO THE NORTHEAST LIKE A SHOOTING STAR.  I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS JUST SAW.  IT DIDN&#39;T SCARE ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO FAR UP IN THE SKY.  I WENT IN THE HOUSE AND WITH MUCH EXCITEMENT TOLD CARRIE WHAT I HAD JUST SEEN.  SHE DIDN&#39;T SEEM INTERESTED SO I HAD TO TELL SOMEONE WHO SHARED MY ENTHUSIASM AND KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT AIRCRAFT AND TECHNOLOGY TO KNOW THIS WASN&#39;T NORMAL!  SO I CALLED MY BROTHER IN BOWLING GREEN OHIO AND EXPLAINED IT TO HIM.  LUCKY FOR ME HE SEEMED INTERESTED OR I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CALL SOMEONE ELSE!  FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE READING THIS WITH GREAT INTEREST I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE WITH A LITTLE RESEARCH I COULD NARROW IT DOWN TO THE CORRECT MONTH, WEEK, AND WITH PHONE RECORDS THE TIME AND DAY THIS HAPPENED.  ANOTHER NOTE: RECENTLY (YESTERDAY)ON THE DISCOVERY CANNE! L I SAW A CLIP OF VIDEO NASA RELEASED WITH MANY SIMILARITIES.  IT WAS SHOT FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE THERE WAS ALSO SOME INTERESTING AUDIO ON THE CLIP.<n>

We were in midtown, around 54th Street and traffic was very heavy so we were basically crawling along. I was driving. So we spot this &#39;plane&#39; flying east to west and then appearing to hover and just acting in a way we&#39;d never seen a plane act before. My partner was in the military service and he&#39;s familiar with planes but he was just as dumbfounded as i was at the way it was acting. So as we were driving south on 9th Avenue, we are keeping our eyes on this &#39;plane&#39; and suddenly it started to fly straight in our direction. We said &#39;Great, now we can see what kind of plane this is&#39;...it must have moved really fast because suddenly it just seemed to glide right over us and that was when we saw it wasn&#39;t a plane but this HUGE triangle thing with many, many round lights underneath. The lights were arranged in triangular rows and there were three rows of them in the shape of the craft if you can picture that. They were very bright but did not give off any glare. This was just before sunset. We hung out the window as we were stopped at the light. Next to us was a woman in a jeep and she looked to see what we were staring at wide mouthed and she got a little hysterical, pretty much as dumbfounded as we were. The thing made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have rarely talked about this to anyone.  I think I&#39;ve told maybe 4 other individuals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a partaker of drugs and have no history of mental illness.  No history of any type of episode out of the ordinary.  I am a healthy adult male.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very real event.  This was a event that absolutely terrified me.  I have never, ever been in such a bad situation.  I have the chills just writing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a remote area of the desert east of San Diego on the border with Mexico.  Jecumba was west of me by maybe 10-15 miles and Interstate 8 was north of me by maybe 5-7 miles.  I was alone in the Valley of the Moon in April/May of 1998.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I proceed further, it is necessary to explain my usual awareness and habit when camping alone.  I always maintain a fire and sleep in about 1 hr cycles.  I wake up and stoke my fire.  It has taken me years to do this.  Force of habit and discipline.  I have a healthy respect for the wilderness and my vulerabilty despite my physical size.  I would also like to add that I consider myself &#34;intune&#34; with my surroundings.  Sight and sound.  I pay attention to the physical terrain, plants and animals that are around me.  I consider myself highy spatially aware.  You have to be.  I do some pretty hard hiking and I have to rely on my sound judgement.  I don&#39;t take risks, though I camp alone.  I&#39;m sure of myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke to a very serious situation.  My fire was out and I had dim coals.  I was absolutely stunned.  I&#39;ve never done that!  Ever! I must have been asleep for hours.  I could not see a damn thing.  Maybe a few moments later, as I busy trying to figure out what was wrong with me, the next serious situation occured to me.  There was no sound.  Nothing.  It was as if the all the sound got sucked up into nothing.  No wind and no animals.  If you have ever been alone and are used to hearing all sorts of things...hearing nothing is always a sign that something happened or is about to happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This next part maybe a little wierd, but I get feelings.  The hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me tell you, I  got switched on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m laying there in my sleeping bag next to a nearly dead fire and clutching my tire iron in one hand and my knife in the other.  I&#39;m telling you, unknown person, that I was in serious trouble.  I felt a threat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This dawning sence of danger and threat escalated into terror.  Thats when the lights turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are not words to describe to you what I felt then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m in a sort of cave made my rocks that have tumbled down off a small mountain.  They&#39;ve piled on each other forming a shelter.  It&#39;s open in several places in the overhead and on the deck.  A powerful blue-white light was pouring in from above!  I mean it literally lit up everything.  No sound.  No sound whatsoever.  I could plainly see the angle of the light coming in at 45 deg.  It then started to orbit my little pile of rocks in a counterclockwise direction.  It was moving pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an ex-Firecontrolman.  USN.  I&#39;ve worked with and still work with some serious electronic equipement.  The Navy taught me a lot of math so as to appreciate how the electronics work.  Well, having done enough firecontrol problems involving range, bearing and height, I quickly had a vision of a upside down cone with me at the bottom, or pointy-end.  The source of that light was at the other end forming the circle, or orbit.  The walls of that cone formed maybe a 45 deg angle.  A best guess.  Knowing my terrain, the mountain was close to the origin, that was my present abode, was very close.  Hell, it was peppered with very large house-sized rocks.  Whatever was above me was very close.  Within a 100ft.  Maybe 75 ft.  Anymore and it would have collided with the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been in the USN, I&#39;ve been around all kinds of aircraft.  I been around a lot of machinery.  Every bit of it makes noise.  Noise from gears, turbines, transmissions, AC/DC drives/motors...it all makes a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever was at the other end of that cone making the orbit within 100ft of me did not make a sound at all.  If it was an helicopter, for me not to hear the noise of it&#39;s turbine, gearbox and transmissio,n it would have been more than a mile in the air, moving at a tremendous speed in it&#39;s orbit and somehow maintaining a beam of light at 45 deg to me through the mountain behind me when it went throught that arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made maybe 5 or 6 orbits and turned off and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must tell you of another quality to this event.  When I say it was gone, I could feel it.  I could actually feel it was gone.  I don&#39;t know what the hell you are going to make of all this, and this new thing regarding my sence, but I could actually feel the danger abade.  I&#39;ve never felt that before.  I mean, I had a clear as a bell since that I was in very real danger, like maybe I was going to die.  I&#39;ve never felt that before or since.  My life is normal.  I swear it.  I&#39;m telling you, however, that I could feel that whatever that thing was, it was evil, bad, malevolent, whatever.  &#34;It&#34; did not have good intentions for me.  I wasn&#39;t ready either.  I&#39;d like to tell you that I was standing on my feet with my weapons, but it&#39;s like I felt I was paralyzed by fear.  It&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t move.  I was frozen and terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to add that I&#39;ve seen helicopters doing patrol through this area.  I suppose they were Boarder Patrol choppers.  You can hear them from a mile off.  They make a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That thing did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I can tell you.  I didn&#39;t see &#34;It.&#34;  I&#39;m not trying to sound proud, or something like that, but I&#39;m a pretty intelligent person.  I know what &#34;It&#34; wasn&#39;t.  Humans can&#39;t make machines like what &#34;It&#34; was yet.  I can&#39;t say what it was either.  Sherlock Holmes said that if you have eliminated the obvious, whatever is left, however preposterous, must be the answer.  &#34;It&#34; was not human.  No one can tell me otherwise.  I&#39;m 100% sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe five minutes later, I felt like I could move again.  The danger was gone.  I got my fire up and didn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigation of the area the next day before I left revealed nothing out of the ordinary that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been fine since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said before, I don&#39;t have a history of drugs or mental illness.  This is the only time in my life where I was unable to explain what was happening to me.  Definitely, it&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve ever been in fear of my life.  I mean, actual fear of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can&#39;t have much more of an intence sensation than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll never forget it.  It&#39;s not &#34;all in my head.&#34;  This happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see similar report from Fontana, CA, from late 1930&#39;s.  PD))<n>
5/1/98 00:00|Rural ("middle of nowhere")|NV|Formation|5 hours|Sighting over Nevada in 1998|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45294.html|105|ndxe199805| Sighting over Nevada in 1998<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my semi eastward on I10 in nevada, just after crossing the NV border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My co-drivier was asleep in the back. I spotted 5 to 8 bright lights in the sky south of us, in a crooded line from about 1 o&#39;clock to 3 o&#39;clock, they were orange in colour and stationary. I figured they were flares until one moved upward. After about 10 minutes of observation, I pulled my truck over on an offramp and parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the place I pulled over, there was noone else, it was a small construction site with a large pile of dirt. I got my camera, a 35 MM auto everything deal, and exited the truck, watching the objects, I climbed to the top of the pile and proceeded to take pictures. they moved a little, blinking on and off, and moving 5 to 10 degrees toward or away (up and down) from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out of film, after taking a full roll (I reloaded once) of 24 exposures and 6 exposures on the other roll, watched for 30 to 45 minutes, then, pursuant to my schedul, I took off. I could see them almost all the way to AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, The film did not turn out, as Walmart&#39;s photo dept is incompetent, however, I still have the negatives, as well as a small notebook with specific date and times from my first noting them, until I lost them in light pollution, but they are somewhere in the chaos I have in my house since I moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather that night was extremely clear, no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wide awake, having just awaken in California, and started driving 3 hours before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) The strange things were that, even though I pulled over on a rough road, my co-     driver did not awaken, as any driver will tell you they will when the truck stops 2) I remember clearly the stop was 20 to 30 minutes, yet, I lost very little time in the log book, I even had time to get back in the truck to recover my spare roll of film!  The objects were clearly round, but not bright like a star or a light would be, more like a glow in the dark decal would be, except not green, but a orange colour. if they were 25 feet wide, I would put them at 1600 to 1800 meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will give a more full report when I find my notebook, and possibly rescan the negatives, when I get my scanner installed. Maybe Walmart just hosed up the prints. I can only hope.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So we ran to a clearing in the trees to see what kind of chopper it was,when over our heads flew this black triangle that was small(about the size of the helcopter we saw later)it had no lights and made no sound.The helicopter seemed o be following it,and it was a army copter(I think it&#39;s called a louch,or loche or somethig like that)Ive never seen anything like it before.And what I wonder is why the helicopter was landing in the woods,was it meeting the UFO?Makes you wander cause the nearest millitary basis about 20 or 30 miles from where we were!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received another report and video from a gentleman, who witnessed and photographed something unusual in the vicinity of the Kentucky Derby later that morning.  The video seemed inconclusive to us, but the witness was quite sincere and animated about his sighting, we felt.))<n>
