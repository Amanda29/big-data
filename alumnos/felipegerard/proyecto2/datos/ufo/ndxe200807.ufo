It appeared to be floating around a small area and they suddenly faded away. There was not any blinking lights or noise from the object while it was in the sky or after it faded away. We live in Northern CA. in the Redding, Red Bluff area out in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/31/08 23:15|None (Voyageurs national Park)|MN|Light|10-15 seconds|Intense light seen in Northern Minnesota's back country skies.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65037.html|2|ndxe200807| Intense light seen in Northern Minnesota&#39;s back country skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and two of my friends were camping in Voyageurs National Park in Northern Minnesota for a couple nights of camping and fishing.  We were camping on an island just a few hundred yards from the Canadian border and were enjoying a campfire on Thursday night the 31st.  It was so clear out and the stars were so bright we decided to walk out to the point and star gaze for awhile.  As we&#39;re standing there just looking at the stars one of my frineds points out a satellite moving across the sky.  We all look at it and confirm to each other that, yes, it&#39;s a satellite.  No blinking lights, just a solid white light in the sky that looked like a moving star, like most satellites look from earth.  Within a couple seconds the &#34;satellite&#34; zooms incredibly close and an incredibly bright light shines down.  I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call it a &#34;beam&#34; of light, just this intense bright white light.  It shown on us for maybe two-three seconds and then turned off and as soon as it turned off it looked like the tiny little light of a satellite again, but moving much faster and within a few seconds was out of sight.  There was not a sound at all and never saw it&#39;s shape or anything, just the light.  My friend said he didn&#39;t think it zoomed down to us, but rather just became this intense light.  I, on the other hand, felt that it came down close because it wasn&#39;t a super intense little spec of light, it was close enough that the light appeared to be a foot or two across.  So distance is still a little hard to describe and me and my friends all have different thoughts on how close it was.  Whatever this was it moved across the sky from the US into Canada.  As soon as this all happened we looked at each other and started laughing because these things don&#39;t happen to us.  This only happens in the movies kind of thing.  One of my friends immediately says, &#34;there&#39;s many explanations for what we just saw.&#34;  But he couldn&#39;t come up with one single explanation and agreed that what we saw was very strange and defini! tely uni dentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 31 year old College Grad., and work as a Purchasing manager for a lumber company.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life, nor either of my friends.  We all agreed to not tell anyone about this because who&#39;s going to believe us, right?  Off course we had to tell somebody, so we ended up telling our frineds and family and off course almost every one of them asked what we were smoking that night.  I guess that&#39;s the response we thought we&#39;d get.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also an object that size would be traveling much slower if in the burning in faze entering the earth atmosphere would of done it much further away and much slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What i saw made a very bight light almost as an explosion to enter atmosphere or to pick up speed. was visible by the light emitted from it for a second if that and then diminish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant say that it was not an meteor, but from all that i have read on them, they move much slower, unless they are very close to when they are faster but no were near the size of what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any one else in the are happen to see it as well. let us know.<n>

This object moved very fast and  shot up and then down before vanishing altogether, this lasted about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object would hover, move left to right, right to left, and up and down. The object moved slowly through the sky, diamond shaped and bright. Colors could be faintly seen with the naked eye, but when the object was viewed through a high powered telescope it looked like watching fireworks. The object had multie color lighting comming off of it and was spinning. It looked faceted like a diamond.  Object seemed to move north west. Objects seem to appear after ten at night to about two in the morning.  Objects have been seen on every night in the past two weeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This was not an airplane, there were no wing, or tail lights.  The object was traveling at a slow rate of speed(200-300Kph)for about 2 minutes changing from gold/orange to white/blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object proceeded to the east on a short, steady(from north to east it made a subtle 90 degree turn)arc for approximately 1 minute on a wavering trajectory, light changed to red, then flickered, and looked as though it had dematerialized, ending the sighting.  All the while there was NO SOUND coming from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was also a witness to this event. I have seen this happen twice at night and once during the day over the last 2 months.  I have seen many satellites in the past, most of the satellites I see are traveling in a straight line in the sky, this object was very different in the way that it traveled, and was much much brighter then most satellites.  The object was much larger then most satellites, and it had a magnitude twice, maybe even three times the luminosity of Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anybody has any information on what this could be it would definitely be appreciated. Peace to all!<n>
7/31/08 23:00|Rochester Hills|MI|Light|10 to 20 seconds|I observed a large flashing object in the sky moving at a fast rate of speed moving from the north sky, east to west.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64919.html|7|ndxe200807| I observed a large flashing object in the sky moving at a fast rate of speed moving from the north sky, east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11:00 pm on July 31st I was sitting on my deck looking to the north east sky when I observed an object bigger than a star that seemed to flash lights moving at an erratic rate of speed. It then jumped upwards at an awkward angle, down again and then just seemed to vanish into the sky, this lasted roughly 10 to 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Orb shot a beam into my face.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64899.html|8|ndxe200807| Orb shot a beam into my face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 31st, 1040 pm… I have reported what I have seen on every single clear night but one night…since June 17th to MUFON, and the National UFO Reporting Center.  I have seen mostly orbs with 2 witnesses…several times per night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have said I will take a polygraph, I have offered for someone to come out and view it with me, and I took 2 photos, and I have DVD video evidence as well.  But tonight was much different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not even looking up to the sky, and a light hit my face from above.  The light blinded me for a second…I looked up and saw in detail a white orb, at a very high altitude, seemingly spinning, and a blue-white beam was shining from it.  As I jumped up out of my seat, (thinking I was going to have a Travis Walton Experience), the beam shut off.  The object was hovering.  When the light/beam retracted, the object changed directions, moved even higher, and started moving northeast at a fast rate, until it was out of sight.  My face right now is tingling…and I am actually shaking, as it scared the hell out of me.  I know this all sounds hard to believe, but I am willing to show you what I saw, and I am willing to take a polygraph.  The object was bright white, and made not a sound.  My face is not sun burned like Richard Dreyfus in Close Encounters, but it is tingling right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want someone to sit with me.  You don’t even have to look up all night at all.  I will spot it…and direct you to where it is in the sky.  For some reason, it seemed to want to make contact with me.  I think this is significant, and I want someone to check it out, follow up on this…before they stop appearing.  This has been consistent since June 17, 2008, but never before had it shined a beam down.  I am 40 years old, never saw anything before…I actually hate being ridiculed, and I cannot stand attention…but I do think this is important…I have a gut feeling…that will not go away.  That is why I go outside every single night…hoping to see it again…They just started showing up…I don’t know why…I don’t know how…but I am beyond frustrated with the reactions I get from people, and at this point, I refuse to talk to anyone except people who will at least hear me out…and have experience in dealing with UFO’s.  Whatever shot a beam down at me…was at an extremely high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t even bother telling the neighbors, or my friends about this.  My parents never believed me either…until they saw it themselves.  I have seen more stuff like this than anyone I have read about…and no one seems to care.  I just don’t think this one can be explained away.  What experimental aircraft makes no noise…hovers….and shines beams down to someone’s face from way up there?  My face has been tingling since 10:40…it is now…11:22.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

These lights formed a triangle with a red light in the center. These lights did NOT blink on or off. This light pattern was not any commercial aircraft that I have observed before. There were other aircraft in sight at a much lower elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled in a NNE to SSW path across the sky. The path took approximately 2 minutes to cross the visible sky.<n>

Thought we saw one but this was going at least 5 times faster (same size, same systematic way) and I thought maybe it was just a really, really fast satellite - it crossed half the sky in less than 3 seconds, but then it just disappeared out of the sky in front of my eyes. Not over the horizon or behind clouds, but poof and gone.  Have seen may satellites, but nothing like this. Definitely not an airplane - there were several of them in the sky at the same time and it was very easy to ascertain their altitude and speed/shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was taking my husband back to work at 10:16pm when we stopped at a red light.  In the east-southeast ww saw 3 yellow lights about 45 degrees up in the sky.  The lights were in a straight horizontal line, and were evenly spaced apart.  They looked like this:  &#34;. . .&#34; I asked my husband what he thought they could be.  I originally thought it was flares that someone had sent up.  As the light turned green and we started to make a left another light appeared above and slightly to the right of the light farthest to the left.  It just appeared out of nowhere.  My husband and I thought this was rather strange, so we continued turning left and then pulled over and parked in a parking lot and got out of the car.  About 10 seconds after the new light appeared, the light on the lower left side faded away.  About 10 seconds after that, another light appeared above the original lights, next to new light, but spaced out more.  ABout 10 seconcds after that the middle light on the bottem faded, 10 seconds later another light appeared next to the new lights, also evenly spaced out.  About 10 seconds after that the last light on the bottom faded away, and 10 seconds after that a firth light appeared next to the others on the top. The were also in a straight horizontal line evenly spaced, but these were more spaced out than the first 3.  They looked more like this:  &#34;.   .   .   .&#34; I&#39;ll try to give you a picture of what happened as best I can on the computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:16pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:18pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:18pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:19pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:19pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:19pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:20pm  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 lights stayed stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes.  My husband called his boss and told him to come look outside, he was maybe 1/2 mile from where we were.  A couple of other people came out also and one of them got a recording onhis cell phone of the 4 lights and them fading away one by one.  I t reminded me of the lights that were reported in Phoenix a several years ago.  I&#39;m not sure what we saw, but maybe you guys can figure it out. Thank you<n>

I wached it strobe and travle in a Northernly direction until it was almost directly over head. It was at a tremendous altitude, as compared to the jet that passed by. When it got to the point almost directly overhead, it emmitted a very bright flash of white light, then very suddenly curver to travle in the direction of North by North East, and accellerated at a tremendous burst of speed. I witnessed it travle over the Eastern horizon within seconds after it began it&#39;s accelleration. when it began it&#39;s acceleration and changed direction it became redish in color, but was too high to make out any detail of shape or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a Denver news station, WB 2 News, and reported it to that entity, to which I was not asked any info, only that they would make some phone calls, but I was not told to whom.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were perfectly clear as there were no clouds in the sky. At first it was a group of 3 then one more appeared then another.  The first 3 spread out and made a straight line joining the other 2. One then disappeared  and left 4. They were perfectly spaced and stayed in the sky for a good 10 min. Then they started to disappear one by one till they were all completely gone.  I called in to the local TV station and they assumed them to be flairs but the military base here had not responded to the stations calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

At around 9:15pm on July 31st 2008 over Mosinee, Wisconsin I witnessed a straight horizontal line of 5 yellowish lights.  The tops of the perfectly rounds lights seemed to have a little bit of red in them too.  They were kind of weak in intensity and just above the tree tops over a potato field about 2 blocks away.  I only saw them for about 5 seconds before I grabbed my Mom’s arm to look at them too.  As I did that they quickly started to fade out one light at a time from the right to left.  She saw that last light sparkling before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued on our walk for about 15 minutes and came to a spot where we could see the sky in full view over the potato field.  We stopped and looked up towards the south to see if we saw something to explain it.  We watched for about 3 minutes.  Then all of a sudden to the SW we saw it again, but this time it was really bright and lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  And it faded out from right to left again, but faster this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never appeared to be &#34;flying&#34; or moving, just hovered there. It was as high up as a helicopter would fly and about a quarter mile away from us.  There was nothing in the path of our view, completely open and clear skies.  It was unbelievable!!!  We are really interested to see if anyone else saw the same thing.  We can’t explain it----like nothing we had EVER seen.<n>

These lights did not move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First one – ‘on’, then ‘off’. (a minute or two pass)  Next one ‘on’, another ‘on’, then both ‘off’. (a minute or two pass as we stare into the night sky above the tree line)  Next one ‘on’, two ‘on’, three ‘on’ (all in a horizontal row evenly spaced) and then all ‘off’. (a minute or two pass)  Then, as I head into the house to get away from the mosquitos (!!), my husband says “one -- two…” so I quickly look back and see one-by-one, four more bright lights turn ‘on’ (closer together than before and more to the left, but still in a straight horizontal line). The six lights turned ‘on’ in sequence from right to left, and all at once, disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the end of our show for the night, but it reminded us of an evening a few years back. We had seen a simlar show, but much closer and much brighter. That night, they reminded me of the rectangle-shape of those bright lights at football games. But these were across the river from us and much higher than any lights would be. Our lights in the house flickered and my phone died while in the middle of telling my mom what we had seen, so I’d had to call her back. It was a similar sequence of light turning ‘on’ in a row, and then all at once, disappearing. If you weren’t looking right then, you’d easily miss it, because they were only lit for about 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never expected to see anything like this again!  Our background:  interest in space, like watching NOVA, but that’s about it. Never imagined we’d see something like this -- feel like we can’t tell anyone, or they’ll think we’re crazy!<n>

Line of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from Madison back up to the Stevens Point area on a Thursday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed bright, white lights in the western sky just north of Portage, WI.  The lights varied.  A single light would appear, and sometimes multiply into many separate lights.  At times there were as many as 5 all in a horizontal, straight line.  The lights would stay in place for a few moments and then disappear, only to appear a few minutes later.  At one point there were two lights that turned into two separate lines of 6 lights in total.  The lights were brighter and larger than stars, but appeared lower than stars in the sky, yet higher than fireworks would appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time, the lights expanded westward and horizontally.  Even though we were traveling 70 mph in a car, the lights remained in the same part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes of seeing these lights appear, disappear, and repeat, they finally stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live near Oshkosh Wi, so I thought maybe it was a plane heading over to EAA.  But then the lights started to wink on and off, in sort of a V shape.  It looked really large too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lasted just a few seconds and then was gone! There were about 4 or 5 evenly spaced lights in sort of a V pattern, that got closer together each time the blinked, until they dissapeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened right over a small town in Wisconsin called Bancroft.  It is in Portage County.<n>
7/31/08 21:20|La Farge|WI||few minutes|series of red lights appear-merge and dissipate-La Farge, WI|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64917.html|20|ndxe200807| series of red lights appear-merge and dissipate-La Farge, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unidentified object reporting: La Farge, Wisconsin Thursday, July 31, 2008 at dusk  6 adults and two children were coming home after a dinner outing.  As we live in the country, we have a beautiful night sky.  We often star gaze and get out our telescope to observe…  Upon getting out of our vehicles, I noticed a light shining through a very large pine tree that is in our yard.  I recognized that it was peculiarly large and so I walked over to look at it.  I walked around the tree to observe the light and realized I wasn’t looking at an airplane or helicopter.  There were approximately 8-12 large red lights in a perfect horizontal line, just above the tree line.  We live on a ridge top so I had almost a 360 degree panoramic view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice a body of the aircraft, however but couldn’t stop saying “oh my goodness, you guys come look at this.”  Everyone was busy unloading stuff out of the car and it felt like I was talking to myself.  My daughter, 8, came next to me and said, “Mama, what is that?”  There was another line of approximately 5 to 6 lights to the left of the larger set of lights, which were at almost a 35 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the very moment I finally said, “oh my goodness, it is a ufo,”  while pretty much jumping up and down in disbelief, the two streams of lights merged together into one and completely disappeared into thin air.  There was no turning around, no smoke from a jet, no noise at all.  I said, “Did anyone see that, did anyone see that?”  My sister in law said she saw the very end of the lights merge together and disappear.  Now, it was dusk and light enough for me to see a body of whatever it was that I saw, but I did not see that.  However, when we went into the house I asked my daughter to draw what she saw.  She is incredibly gifted with art, and has definitely never been exposed to talk of nor seen any movies with ufos.  She had no preconceived perception of what a ufo is…  She drew exactly what I saw with oblong shapes around the lights.  I don’t know why she saw a body around the lights, but she did.  It sounds absolutely crazy, but I think children can sometimes connect with what adults cannot.  Perhaps I was so numb from the lights that I couldn’t comprehend the body of an aircraft type object.  I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stranger yet, I called the police department because I wanted to know if anyone else had sighted this.  They said no and just as I was hanging up the telephone, two US Army jets hovered over the area where I saw the unidentified objects.  It was obvious they were looking for something.  When they couldn’t or didn’t see what perhaps appeared on radar (I don’t know how they would know this was there and where it was, etc.) they turned their jets around and faced our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a moment, I tried to tell myself this was what I previously saw, however it was much different.  The lights I saw in perspective to being on the ground and standing, where comparable to the size of car headlights.  This is how large they were in the sky.  On top of that, when the jets left, they were extremely loud.  It is very clear when jets hover…the object I saw did not make a single sound.  It disappeared into thin air – in a matter of a second or so it was completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I froze, and cried, in disbelief with my daughter at my side.  My family was relatively upset they didn’t get to see what I saw.  My sister in law was pretty frightened, and said, “I am going to pretend I didn’t’ see what I just saw.”  I said, “I hope this is just the beginning.”  My daughter said, “Mama, what is a ufo?”  My story may be crazy, seem unreal, I don’t know what it sounds like. I have never researched ufo’s but I tell you, once it got into my brain, I tried every way possible to discredit what I saw, and I know that is EXACTLY what I saw.<n>

I noticed a &#34;star&#34; in the sky.  I though to myself that is a bright orange star.  Then the object got brighter and stated movin directly straight in my direction.  In all honesty it was hualin ass. Then this object came to a complete stand still and started pusling between a very bright orange and a white/orange.  There is no way that a plane pulses like that and can move this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost came to a stop in the car and another one appeared in the same way. But, this one did not seem to race across the sky. It moved to the right away from the other light and then came to an immediate stop.  These two had the same colors.  I am not a scientist but it seemed as if they were communicating with pulsing of lights.  I kept driving and made it to my friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two hours later I am driving back home and saw an orange light in the sky move so fast that the orange light streaked behing it.  Then the light came to a stand still very rapidly.  No more the five seconds later two more lights appeared and they were stationary.  They did not move from appearance to dissapearence. and started flashing between colors again.   All of the lights were lit up for no more than 15 seconds.  When they dissapeared they just faded back to looking like a star and then the lights faded as if there was nothing even there.  I caled the local authorities to see if any one else had seen this strange sight.  The lady I spoke with said that there were no other reports of these objects.  I know what I saw and I want to find out why these &#34;THINGS&#34; are here or what they are doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it just stopped and hvered under a cloud and we could see a airplane fly 1000 feet right over it. It stayed in one spot for about five minutes pulsating, then it traveled slowly NW over Allentown out of sight range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no clouds in the sky and it was still too bright for there to be many stars out.  The area that I was driving through is all farm fields and forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the distance above the horizon on the west side of the road I saw four spheres of white light that were arranged in a straight line.  The spheres were quite bright, packed closely together but just enough space between that you could distinguish each sphere.  I was looking at the lights for a couple of seconds and they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later I saw the spheres of light again.  This time I actually saw the four balls of light suddenly appear in the horizon on the east side of the road. They appeared slightly larger (closer) this time, again arranged in a straight line, although the angle of the line was in the opposite direction that it was previously.  The spheres were there for 3-4 seconds and then disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no other cars the whole time that I was on this particular road and don’t remember any other lights that would have caused any reflections on the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When I looked out of the deck window at around 4:00 a.m., I was surprised to see a red flashing light. I live near a ski hill, so I figured they were working on some tower or something on the top of the hill.  Then, I realized that the visual line would be wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the window and looked. The light was sort of like a flashing signal light. Shortly thereafter, four smaller steady light appeared in a straight line. I wanted to go outside, but I was rather frightened. If this happens again, I plan to drive to the hill for video confirmation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights would change rapidly from red to blue to green to white and then it would repeat those colors on a regular time interval, but the order of the colors would change. Red and white would appear simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the light for quite some time, and it seemed to be hovering incredibly slowly and in a somewhat circular pattern. Occasionally, there would be smaller lights that would “shoot out” from the main light – it looked like sparks. Toward the end of our observation of the light, the light in the sky seemed to move vertically slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our location in rural Santa Fe never has commercial or private aircraft fly over it, and it was far too high in the air to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us have ever witnessed a UFO, and what we saw completely defied any explanation that we could come up with. I myself believe in the existence of UFOs, but the other two do not. What made this experience all the more interesting is that even with skepticism, we all believe that what we saw was a UFO and we all saw the exact same thing.<n>

He noticed a bright orb flashing green, red and white light.  He called to me and we watched it together.  It moved up, down and sideways.  It made quick sharp moves in a zig zag motion.  We went outside to look without having to look through the unremovable window screen.  It appeared even brighter when outside.  It began to move away and slightly fade.  Then, it became brighter again.  It is now 12:56 am and it is still there.  It is now changing from bright red to green to yellow, along with white.  It is brightly flickering.  It is on the move again, however, still in the same area.  The time is now 1:02am.  It is moving in an erratic pattern.  At 1:06 it vanished.<n>

At first thought I saw what looked like a normal aircraft with red lights on travelling in a northerly direction, at normal what I can only describe as &#39;helicopter&#39; height. As it got closer, the light appeared to glow very red and seemed to hover or slow down for a few seconds. After this few seconds, two similar lights appeared behind it travelling side by side.It was as if the first light was waiting for the other two to catch up with it They just seemed to hover for a few moments, and then moved a short distance, hovering for a while, and then carried on into the distance, remaining in this formation.There was no sound from them. The weather had been heavy downfalls of rain during the day, but was dry at this time. I dont know if it was cloudy, but cannot recall seeing any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was asphalt road, the 1st hole was disrupted about 4 x 5 and the other about 1 x 1.  The material is different sizes and shapes.

Off to the north but almost directly up in the center of the sky a very bright white light appeared out of nowhere.  It appeared to be flying at the same height that the airplanes fly but it did not fly like a plane.  I watched it for a few seconds and witnessed it speeding up and slowing down while making a slight zigzag pattern along the path of flight.  I called my fiancé out to see it after about 15 seconds or so.  He came out and we watched it fly farther to the east continuing in the same pattern previously described.  After about 30 seconds the object began to change from bright white to bright red and then disappeared in the eastern sky. After it turned red we only saw it for about 15 more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Greenwood is in Central Nova Scotia in the center of the Annapolis Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just got home from work when I saw an orange object moving in a SE direction. The object was not very high up and not travelling particularly fast---about the speed of a small plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so concerned that I called CFB Greenwood to report the object thinking it may be something on fire --first time I&#39;ve ever done such a thing in my life of over 50 years. Shortly after talking with the base operator I witnessed the same object at exactly the same location making a second pass. Both times I watched the object as it disappeared into the night sky toward the ENE which took approximately 20 seconds.  Shortly thereafter my neighbor and her son, in his 20s, pulled into their driveway. I asked them if they&#39;d seen anything as they had come in the direction that the objects were travelling toward. As I was trying to explain what I&#39;d just seen, I looked upward and the same object went across the sky in the exact location a third time. (In retrospect--I think I saw three of the same object on the same path). CFB Greenwood called back and ask some questions and sent the RCMP to my house (for whatever reason??).  The three objects were seen in a span of about 12-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was firey orange and seemed to shimmer a red/orange. There were no flashing lights and no sound despite the fact this was a 100% clear night with no wind. The objects seemed to be about the elevation of planes which pass over our town to land at CFB Greenwood which is about 10km away to the SW--not very high up--approx. 1000-1500feet. The objects were not lttle points of light but a significant size in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am university educated and a former school teacher of 17 years. The object(s) I saw seemed to have a bit of a shimmering effect which at times gave the impression of a burning object yet by the third time I witnessed the object (or objects) I realized it was not flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to add, I spoke with the young man (early 20&#39;s) who, with his mother, witnessed the craft on its third pass (or the third one), He has a very good friend who is a MP (member of military police) at the Greenwood air base. He informed my neighbor that the base received at least 15 calls over a forty mile path that evening. The base person I spoke with told me he had received only one call initially. In my last conversation with them that evening I was told me they had fifteen calls going on but they were not related to a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was not any conventional aircraft or flying object I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one week later a German tourist took this video about 100km SE of where I live.  It was quickly explained away as flares dropped by the military.  The accompanying story made the front page in our provincial paper.  http://www.thechronicleherald.ca/photo_news/video/prospect_movie.wmv<n>

We were sitting around a campfire when one guy yelled, “What is that?!!”  Above us, in the clearing between trees, we saw a round, bright object flying above us at low plane level.  It looked as bright as and as large as a small full moon.  It looked illuminated. It seemed like there was a plane just before it and another just after it, but flying below it.  It was not a high-speed chase, more like a casual rate of speed.  We lost sight of it when it went past the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was laying on the hood of my pickup watching the sky.  After about 5 minutes of waiting I became bored and jumped down off the hood and just happened to glance in a northern direction toward OSU.  I noticed a very bright white light that appeared to be very high moving very slowly from west to east. The light was white with a sort of reddish/orangeish hue around the edges, and it was shaped like an orb.  I watched it for almost 30 seconds and it then it just got dimmer until it vanished.  I talked to a buddy of mine and he thinks it could of been just a meteor, that could explain how it got gradually dimmer and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also of note about 5 minutes after this occurred I was watching the sky in the general direction that it disappeared and I noticed what looked like an object with orange lights rotating around it, heading south at a high rate of speed.  I lost sight of this one as it flew behind a tree and I only saw it for about 3 seconds.  I will admit I was pretty excited at this point and this could have been an airplane, especially since there was an airport in its general direction of travel and it was fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing a light aircraft, looked like a twin engine Cessna, passed from south to north about 3 minutes before my initial sighting of the orb.<n>

Both sightings occurred near a beach house we had rented which was directly on the beach. The objects sighted were identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting occurred perhaps one hour after dark, around 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. My wife and I were lying in bed when I happened to get up and look out the window. What I saw was passing the house heading out toward the water at a right angle to the wind. I brought my wife’s attention to it, my stepson who was outside at the time also saw it. It was moving rather slowly and was about 75 feet above the ground. The best way to describe its appearance was that it looked something like the tea candles people place on their driveways for decoration, when they take and place a candle inside a brown paper bag. It was glowing orange and seemed like it was flickering like a fire would, it made no sound, and moved slowly. I don’t remember if we watched it till it disappeared or just went back to bed, but we watched it for some minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I was curious as to whether or not it would re-appear and so I went out about the same time. I again saw the same phenomenon out over the ocean, once again it was a flickering orange glow. I went into the house and informed my wife, stepson, and stepdaughter that it was back, they all came out to watch it. We couldn’t tell if it was moving or not, this time it was some distance from us, and so was perhaps brighter than the previous nights object. After a few minutes it faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I again went outside about the same time to see if it would re-appear. It didn’t, but I saw airplanes from the near Boston airport, fireworks that people were setting off, campfires on the shore, and distant lightning from a storm. None of these were what we saw, but what the objects most closely resembled were the campfires, except, of course, the objects we sighted were in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever had an interest in ‘ufos”, since seeing these objects I spoke to locals who couldn’t tell me what they were, and I also searched on internet to identify them. I was surprised to see numerous reportings of  similar objects, including the report here from Mackey on July 4th in Indiana, I have also seen videos of similar objects. I had never heard of such objects prior to our sightings.<n>

It was moving back and forth in strange rocking motion, and it made the sound of a helicopter.  I thought nothing of it initially -- perhaps something for the evening news.  But the strange movement caught both of our eyes.  All of a sudden, it turned and moved very slowly in our direction and flew directly over us.  As we looked up, it didn&#39;t appear to resemble the shape of a helicopter, but almost like a giant oblong boat.  Although it was night and we couldn&#39;t see it clearly, there didn&#39;t appear to be any helicopter-like propellers.  I would have to say that the lights were probably consistent with that of a helicopter.  Nonetheless, it scared the be-jesus out of the both of us.  We think it was an alien spacecraft of some sort, mimicking the sound of a helicopter at night in a suburban neighborhood in order to fool nearby onlookers.

Friends and family in the A.V.had told me ufo stories,but none were like this, makes me wonder what lockheed and nasa are also doing out here. I&#39;M now a believer of ufo&#39;s!<n>

I thought it was a crow really high up, and about a half mile off.  I observed it moving for about 20 seconds and it completely disappeared.  I thought I had just lost it in my field of view, so I kept looking and maybe 10 seconds later, it re-appeared, (confirming it as unidentified) moving in a different direction, for only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look and it once more had a very ethereal re-appearance, which may or may not be attributable to a trick in the vision but given the anomalous nature of the event I have elected to mention that it showed itself once more very very short, less than 0.1 second, in a fast tight loop.  I had had some momentous dreams the previous night and this was directly after I got up, the morning sky was cloudy, but my mind was not.  It was clearly inexplicable, and quite intriguing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
7/30/08 01:30|Ramstein (Germany)||Light|over an hour|Flashing light in sky, hovered in one spot (didn't move around), then 3 small lights quickly came from it and away.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64860.html|43|ndxe200807| Flashing light in sky, hovered in one spot (didn&#39;t move around), then 3 small lights quickly came from it and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at approximately 1:30am, I was lying in bed, looking out the window. I saw a small flashing white light in the sky. It was a white dot and appeared to be quite small &amp;/or far away. At first I just assumed it was an airplane...we live on a US military base and seeing planes is very common. However, after a few minutes I realized the light wasn’t moving. It was just hovering in one place, flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes from my house there is another military base. That base is a major US Air Force base and has a huge flight line. From my bedroom window I can clearly see the glow of the lights on that flight line. The object I saw appeared to be hovering directly above the flight line. The dot of light mainly stayed white, but occasionally it would change to white at the bottom and red at the top. It flashed the entire time I watched it. About three or four times, it changed shape from a dot into a short straight vertical line. After about 20 or 30 minutes of watching it, it started flashing slower and 3 very tiny white flashing lights came out from it. They came out one at a time and sped off. They each came out of the “light” in a different place (the first on the left, the next on the right, and the last at the top) and they each went off in a different direction (they shot quickly in a straight line from where they came out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband witnessed the object also, but he did not witness the 3 small ones. I kept watching the object for an hour or so, whereas he lost interest and stopped watching after only about ten minutes. My husband and I are both very level-headed, educated people. I am a housewife and mother, a former CNA, and am currently a mortuary student. My husband is an active duty military service member. We do not have a fascination with UFO’s and have never claimed to see anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently other people witnessed it as well though, because I got online today looking for answers about what it was and found a video posted online by someone in a nearby area that was recorded last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I began to look at the stars like I usually do. While gazing upon the stars, I happened to sight a star that looked different. It kind of looked like two stars joined together in an hour glass kind of shape. The object appeared hazy and remained still for a few minutes. As I took my eyes off of the object I looked around and then I brought my attention back to this object. When making eye contact again the object had shifted position and appeared to be moving. After checking my vision, I looked harder at the object and it was definitely moving, in a diagonal direction. Then in a split second it changed direction and began to fly straight towards me. I watched the object come closer to me, then with no hesitation, the object changed direction as if turning away from me. And in a split second the moving object appeared to dim off and disappear. This happened all within a 30-60 second time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was to low to be an airplane seeing as there’s no airport anywhere around the area. I can’t give an exact description of the air craft but the only thing I can say for sure about it is there where about four bright lights on it I tried to get a better look at it but there was a house in the way. I figured it was a UFO because it wasn’t my first time seeing one, but I wasn’t certain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately thirty minutes after seeing that we saw something that I’ve never seen before. I was on my cell phone telling someone about what I witnessed when all of a sudden I saw some flashing lights in the sky, I told the person I was talking to I’d call them back. There where about five of them, it looked as if they where communicating back in forth. One would flash a few times, then another would flash back. The color of the lights looked electric blue. After watching for about 5 minutes they started moving faster than any helicopter, plane, jet or any man made aircraft. They where pretty far away but in a matter of seconds they where flying past our house, they were to high to get a discription of the shape but I know what I saw. That was the last time I seen them all night but personally I think It’s fascinating that they communicate that way, there is a lot of things we have yet to learn. It’s a shame that so many people think that there’s nothing else out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Tonight (29/7/2008) I was going to close my gate that surrounds my property. Whist doing so I happened to see my next door neighbours outside the gate. Wondering what was wrong I approached them and asked the question, they told me to watch a strange object in the sky and pointed to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They have previously told me that they have seen strange lights over the past week or so because the spend a lot of evenings sat outside at night time, plus the area we live in, we can see the surrounding area for quite a few miles as we live close to the top of a hill and the area is quite flat around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said they had been watching this light from (then pointed north west to south south east) as I arrived the light had slowed down and seemed to drop slowly downwards, as it descended the light faded till it disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light could only be described as brighter than a star, white, constant (not flashing) there was no noise from it, the sky was clear as we could see other star’s behind it, it was bright in the dark night sky and it moved in a straight line at a constant speed, then it reduced in brightness at the same speed it fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened in approx 10mins at 22.10approx, it seemed to disappear over the Cannock/Walsall area. It wasn’t a plane or helicopter because I have been interested in aviation from a young child, and know the characteristics of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking the time to read this<n>

Turned right, moved off fading away|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64864.html|48|ndxe200807| Intense white, bright object in sky over Regina SK, CAN. Turned right, moved off fading away<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I went for a walk between 9pm and 10pm local time.  I walked south from my home two blocks to a local park.  There was next to no daylight left at this time, just a dusky orange in the west horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before entering the park, I observed two jets high overhead, I always have a look at jets when I hear them just because they interest me.  This night I also observed Venus, low in the southeast sky, maybe 10 to 20 degrees from the horizon.  The sky was completely cloudless and there was no wind, a perfect night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty to thirty yards after I strolled into the park I looked to the south sky about 40 degrees up and I saw a very bright, white light.  I would say its size was 3 to 4 times the size of Venus (of which I could compare as it was in the sky that night also).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light reminded me of magnesium burning, that king of intensity, but not so much that it would hurt your eyes.  It appeared to me to move in my general direction (northwards) with a slight turning motion, again very bright and very white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for maybe 5 seconds before it looks that it turned sharply westward, once it did that its light lost all intensity and appeared then to be a very faint white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not long (again maybe 5 seconds) before I could not see it at all.  Its motion throughout this observation struck me as craft like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed stars, planets, aircraft, meteors and comets in the skies before.  This object was truly unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, my brother is camping at a nearby lake (40-50 miles away).  He called me this morning to inform me that he saw a UFO last night, and I had to answer back that I had as well.  The funny thing is that in our brief conversation his description of the object was very similar to mine and he saw it about 2 hours later.<n>

The ship gave off no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ran inside but by the time i grabbed my camera the oval was gone. My friends said that it just all of a sudden disappeared.

It didn&#39;t look anything like a plane.  So I kept driving trying to find a spot where I could take a picture with my cell&#39;s camera -- that&#39;s all that I had.  The object stayed in the exact same place for periods of time but sometimes it rotated and you could only see a thin line.  I thought I must be crazy so when a woman walked by (I had pulled over to take the picture) -- I asked her if she saw it too.  She said --- &#34;must be a plane&#34; --- so I asked why it didn&#39;t move --- she said she didn&#39;t know and walked on -- she obviously was not as fascinated as I was --- I drive a little further and see the object is hovering over power lines and near the Arlington, TX water tower.  I called my husband and parents about the event.  I drove home but didn&#39;t return because I had a number of chores to complete before my husband and baby got home.  It was not a plane or helicopter --- very weird.  First time in 31 years that I have ever seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spend a few hours on my deck where you can see aircraft landing at seatac airport on a routine basis. They are easy to identify by there warning lights. This however had no warning lights and was shaped like a oval on a rectangle with a bright white light. I tried to rationalize what it might be right away, but before i could think of anything else it might be it made a staight line of flight west about 5 miles in a split second. I dropped all rational thought and knew what I was seeing. for about 20min the craft zigged around in a 10 mile area and at one point dissapeared south at a alarming speed and came back closer than before. This is how I hear stories told on TV but my god I was there!!! I dont know if I should keep telling this? I know what I saw and I cant even convince myself. I went back in to wake my girlfriend and she is a huge skeptic. When she saw it and its movement she was in disbelief and scared and insisted on going back inside. It is now 3:35 and I am typing this to the first sight I found they are real and I know nobody will beleve me. To end this the craft dissapeared south west in a zigg zagging pattern at about 2:50 it was completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/28/08 22:50|Mount Sterling|KY|Unknown|30 minutes|Different colored blinking lights flying strangely in the sky, some staying still for periods of time, and even some following others.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64845.html|56|ndxe200807| Different colored blinking lights flying strangely in the sky, some staying still for periods of time, and even some following others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children and I watched as blinking lights (red, white, green, and blue on some) moved across the sky at different directions. Then there were several more that even met up and went almost in circles before disappearing. Lastly, we even saw one meet another, then both go in the same direction with one following the other. They were definitely not plane, or helicopters due to the amount of them, lack of noise, and the strange flight behavior. It lasted roughly 30 minutes, and I would&#39;ve watched longer, but I was getting tired. I wanted to film it, but my small video camera would not have captured it very well due to the dark night and they were pretty high up in the air. Some were barely able to be seen if not for the blinking of the lights. It was amazing and I wish someone else would believe us!<n>

I couldn&#39;t see the body because the ditch was deep, but I did see a head of what appeared to be the long eared Chupacabra I saw earlier this month. The head appeared to be hopping forward (North) as I was driving south so I didn&#39;t get the best look at him. It didn&#39;t react to my vehicle. It hopped a total of three times before I passed the Chupacabra really fast at 55-60mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grey head appeared to have long ears, big eyes and a long face looking downward. I stopped the car and veered to the side off the road and backed up to see if the Chupacabra was still there. I didn&#39;t see the creature. All I could see was a local hospital situated far in the background. There were plenty of trees and bushes to hide in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, who describes herself as a graduate student.

J. and C. were drinking beer, but still not nearly drunk. I was completely sober when this occured because I hadn&#39;t acquired a taste for beer at the time. I&#39;m more of a wine enthusiast, but I didn&#39;t have any alcohol in me at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stargazing, and there was an unusual number of shooting stars because of one of the meteor cycles. If I remembered the date, I could be more specific. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t recall the exact date or time of this occurance and I didn&#39;t have a camera handy because I don&#39;t just sit there with a camera expecting odd things to happen. Nor do I expect that any camera I&#39;ve ever had before my newest one could take a clear picture of what I&#39;m about to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, me and J. were laying on our backs looking up at the sky while C. was laying on her chest facing the other direction. Suddenly, an array of about 6 lights flew overhead. Excitedly, both J. and I sat up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Did you just see what I saw?&#34; I asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I&#39;m glad you asked. I thought it might&#39;ve been the beer,&#34; said J.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;No. It definitely wasn&#39;t,&#34; I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;What did you guys see?&#34; C. asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J. and I just looked at eachother and we both said, &#34;A UFO.&#34;  &#34;Or maybe more than one,&#34; I thought aloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J. agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, C. was ticked off because she believes in UFOs and aliens and the like but J. and I are more skeptical but open-minded. Still, I can&#39;t deny that I saw something strange that night. It couldn&#39;t have been a usual airplane or helicopter because the lights were just wrong. They weren&#39;t blinking, and they were in sort of a V formation, but offset like a flock of birds and in the same sort of flight path (diagram below), but making no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *---*---* <n> * <n> * <n> *  I know there&#39;s a Gov&#39;t nuclear site called the INL (previously INEEL) nearby, so perhaps it could&#39;ve been something in connection with that, especially since whatever this UFO was seemed to be heading that general direction. I&#39;ve been on the INL site before, but it was in high school for a field trip and there were limits on where we were allowed to go because a lot of top secret research goes on there. I know they&#39;ve had connections with the air force before though, because of stories from a previous employer. I understand that seeing a unfamiliar aircraft can make a person uneasy as make us start thinking about aliens and all sorts of things because the members of his community had the same reaction when they saw the first airplanes flying overhead and then their first helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, back to my story.... As these UFOs came in, they slowed down and nearly came to a stop (though not directly over us, and I have the feeling whatever they were, they were entirely unbothered by our presence). They were heading s/sw, but shortly after passing over us and slowing, they abruptly changed course about w/sw. To me it seems they were either headed for the INL or attempting to just barely avoid it, or waiting for directions to a landing site. Whatever the case is, they made some sort of course correction, so I highly doubt it was just a group of shooting stars. In fact, that possibility is entirely implausible in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it&#39;s important to also state that there is an airport just minutes from my apartment, nearly due north, but this UFO appearance was heading the wrong direction to have either taken off from the airport or to have been heading for it. It was flying low enough that we should have heard noise and I could almost make out the shape of an object, but not quite, and any shape I might have seen might have been an optical illusion from the lights. My best guess is that if this was a single object though, it was either triangular or even in cube shape, though a triangular object seems more aerodynamic and thus more logical to me. It seems to me this was more than one object though and that they were &#34;connected&#34; but not by any physical means, if that makes any sense. Either by some magnetic field or a programmed flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The trail were in the weireds shapes in the sky, I estimate the 2 craft making the contrails were traveling over mach 3 or faster.  Whe I zoomed in on my compter you cant see the “Jets” in front of the contrail, explain that one? The when I was analyzing one of the photographs I noticed a black cylindracal craft hovering very high above a cumulus cloud that craft could move at the speed of light, in the blink of an eye it would be 10 miles away! I seemed to be observing what was going on, then I spot a domed disc very high above what was happening.

7/27/08 23:00|Fayetteville|GA|Unknown|5 Min.|Star-like object(s) make unusual manuevers in the night sky.|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82675.html|65|ndxe200807| Star-like object(s) make unusual manuevers in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 07/23/2011  The events I am about to describe are absolutely true and were witnessed multiple times by myself and 1-2 other individuals at the same time.  These events were witnessed during the years of 2001-2002 and again in 2008-2009.  Under no circumstances were the individuals involved under the influence of any substance.  The following sightings were observed by multiple individuals without the influence of suggestion, or &#34;wishful thinking.&#34;  Each of these incidents was exactly alike in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of my first sighting I was in my mid to late teens.  It was sometime in the summer months at around 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, as me and a friend of mine were awaiting his car ride home.  We had been waiting outside in the drive way under what was a perfectly clear night sky, for about forty-five minutes to an hour when something caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a bit of a “star gazer”, that is, I enjoy the beauty and awe of a well star-lit night.  So naturally, my eyes are often glancing to the stars, but this particular night I noticed what appeared to be a star in motion.  The object, from my point of view, appeared no different than the stars in the night sky: it twinkled exactly like a star and was the same size of a star from a ground-level perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using my best judgments, the object seemed to be at a very high altitude- almost right outside of the earth’s atmosphere.  It was moving on a steady path at what would have been a high rate of speed in regards to how high it seemed to be traveling- much like how a plane seems to be moving slow when viewed from ground, but its actual speed is about 400 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this strange object make its way across the sky with such curiosity and confusion in my mind regarding its identity.   During this point in my observation, I didn’t direct my friend’s attention to it because it was happening relatively fast and I was trying to process what exactly was going on.  It traveled this path for about 20 seconds from the time I noticed it until it did something that made my heart sink into my stomach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object suddenly came to a complete and abrupt stop in mid-air, made a wide-angle turn at what looked like 4x its original speed, shot across the sky at an even higher rate of speed (without the characteristic “tail” associated with shooting stars) into the direction from which it came, and literally vanished into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In response to this, I naturally started screaming in disbelief at what I had just seen.  My friend laughed and attempted to offer suggestions as to what it could have been (a plane, satellite, comet, etc.) but I knew better.  In an attempt to explain what I had seen to my friend, I pointed to the sky and used my finger to describe the path the object had taken.  Within minutes I noticed the same object a second time, taking a similar path as the first sighting.  This time both me and my friend were observing the object repeat this similar course of travel, redirection and departure.  Needless to say, we were both baffled and I had gained another reason to watch the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several years later on a similar summer night, I was standing outside in my father’s backyard beside a small bonfire talking with my brother and father.  Looking toward the stars, I noticed the same object making its course across the sky.  This time I made no hesitation to direct my company’s attention to the object.  Once again, the strange oddity followed the exact same course flight, redirection and departure.  All of us who were present saw the same events at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no knowledge of any natural phenomenon that could occur as I have described.  There is no technology that I am aware of that could perform the way this object did.  I have no desire to create such stories for attention or for personal thrills.  I am in no way assuming that this/these object(s) are of any particular origin, be it human or “extra-terrestrial”- I simply do not have enough evidence or knowledge of the subjects to support either theory.  The only facts that I can absolutely be certain of are: 1) the events occurred exactly as described above; and 2) the object does exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It had been like this for a couple of days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a 3 year old daughter, who was getting a cold and had a bit of a temperature.  Combined with the heat, she wasn&#39;t particularly happy.  My wife was upstairs with her and I was in the living room downstairs.  The lights were all off, and I was sitting in my recliner listening to a podcast on my laptop.  The windows were open at the other end of the room, and next to me the patio doors were also open, in order to let a breeze blow through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The patio doors lead out to decking in our back yard.  I can also see the front of the garage, which has a motion activated light on it.  (This tends to go off when people walk past, or sometimes when cars go by.  It&#39;s quite sensitive.)  Just as my wife came back into the room at 10.20pm, there was an extremely loud roaring noise outside.  The garage light came on (which may have been coincidental) and I saw the object flash over the garage, from the direction of the house (ie from &#39;above&#39; me), and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to the decking as quickly as I could but it was nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will give the best description I can.  Imagine a dumbbell (two balls joined by a cylinder).  Imagine that the two balls were flattened discs, with black centres.  The bar joining the two discs had a bright white light on it.  The two discs reminded me of turbojet fans, but this may have been suggestion caused by the noise.  From the light in the middle the object seemed to be made of a shiny metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it for about 1-2 seconds, it moved very fast.  It looked about the size of a small car, but I have no way of judging how high up it was.  My wife heard the roar but didn&#39;t see the object, as she was too far away from the patio doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several UFO&#39;s before.  These have been a silver disc flying next to Concorde (at age 12, an din broad daylight), a blue light hovering over some woods at night (age 13-14) and a rotating triangle with a light at each corner at night from a car (also at appx age 13-14).  I am 39 years of age now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of this site from the Jeff Rense show, and know that you welcome reports from anywhere in the world.<n>

The object was witnessed aboard a McDonnell Douglass MD-82 twin jet aircraft traveling eastbound at 33,000 feet and 497 knots. At the time of the sighting the aircraft was at latitude 37.87 and longitude -79.79, placing the aircraft between Covington and Lexington, VA. The aircraft was in radio contact with the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and traveling between the waypoints ASBUR and DENNY on jet airway 42 (J42).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was witnessed off of the left side of the aircraft traveling north (right to left) at an extremely high velocity. The object appeared spherical in shape and bright white and glowing in color. The object appeared to leave some sort of contrail, which may have been a distortion of light due to speed. The object contained no other sources of light typically found on civilian aircraft. The object disappeared from horizontal view within 2-3 seconds, moving at a speed much greater that that of an approaching opposite direction jet aircraft. The object had an apparent size of 1/4 the circumference of a full moon, and looked similar to a shooting star or meteorite. Size relative to the aircraft could not be determined. The object appeared to be between 35,000 and 38,000 feet, 2,000-5,000 feet above the aircraft. The trajectory of the object resembled an ascending arch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to NASA’s website, the International Space Station was not in the area at the time of the sighting. Other aircraft were also in the vicinity at the time. The object was witnessed by a more than one person, including trained observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.

No one else saw this object at the time and I need to know what it could be. I have considered a Solar Balloon and have looked at many on you tube but these solar balloons seem a lot shorter and thinner and they are all black, they also seem to bend around a lot and have creases all over them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it appeared to be the size of a passenger plane<n>

This is the first time we have ever seen a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving my wife to work on Loop 1604 West in San Antonio Texas, Sunday July 27, 2008 at about 13:10. I was driving and she was looking outside the passenger window.  The sky was blue, no clouds in the sky, very sunny. She said she had seen this object  flying to her right, about 200 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said she watched it for about a minute before she realized she didn’t know what it was and told me to look at it.  It was hard to see at first because it was sliver and was like a flat egg, it blended in so easily to the sky but I did finally see it and we watched it accelerate to a very fast pace and then slow down again, at this point it was in front of us, over the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it continued a steady pace to our left, and landed.  It went straight down to land, not like an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to exit and look for it but my wife did not want to. So we drove on.  It was not a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  We did not see any markings on it.  We did not take any pictures with our phones, when it was happening we were in such disbelief that we didn’t even think of takings pictures of it.  This happened before the 281 highway exit on 1604, it landed behind a Shopping center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not think it was a remote control toy because of the distance it was traveling, the height and the speed is unlike anything we have ever seen.  This location is not near any military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else reported seeing this?<n>

I went outside to sit in my hot tub when I noticed about 25 objects,about the size of a compact car hovering over my property. living in a airport community I have seen many different  aircrafts and know basic desgins.these were triangle in shape and the ones close to me I could see a triangle flap that glowed green on both sides of these crafts. I went to my gaurage and grabbed a flash lite and started to signal the crafts near by.This action seemed to scare the crafts and they elevated beyond the clouds. 4 crafts remained for about an hour untill they also elevated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/27/08 02:00|Ft. Lauderdale|FL|Cone|2 seconds|Long cone shaped yellowish-green light beam projected from clouds to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64814.html|74|ndxe200807| Long cone shaped yellowish-green light beam projected from clouds to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving North on I-95 between South Beach, Miami, Florida and Deerfield Beach, driving through Ft. Lauderdale, there was a lot of lightening activity up around the clouds.  We call this Heat Lightening.  None was touching down to Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a certain point, I noticed that a few clouds which had been disbursed and were not overlapping, finally became quite tightly knit together.  This,  I could tell because the light emitted revealed this. I had been watching them for miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, from this grouping of clouds which were intertwined came a beam of light in the shape of a tube/cone starting from the sky projected onto what seemed to be Ft. Lauderdale and this beam took the shape of a cone beam.  Larger at the bottom.  This lasted for about 2 seconds and retracted.  It did not just disappear, it retracted. Since it was at a distance, it was difficult to say whether it was over the ocean or land. At our angle on the freeway, above the rooftops but 1 mile South of Fort Lauderdale, this was difficult to determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with a friend who was visiting Florida and has absolutely no experience or interest in UFOs.  I asked her whether she was aware of what just happened.  Her response was sort of comical insinuating she couldn’t believe her eyes.  We were both waiting for the helicopter to appear and continue to shine its beam but it never happened and the beam was way to intense and wide to be from a copter.  The quality of light was yellow with a tinge of green.  A copter reflector is more white, not as thick in width nor quality.  It sort of looked like a tube of water with light shining through it, from end to end.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/27/08 02:00|Kalundborg (Denmark)||Light|2 minutes|Passengerjet almost collided with a strange light in the sky - at the same time there was power failure in the city below|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68910.html|75|ndxe200807| Passenger jet almost collided with a strange light in the sky - at the same time there was power failure in the city below<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm and starry night, and I was sitting outside in my sisters garden with my head back watching stars. The property I was on is situated on a peninsula on the westcoast of Zealand, Denmark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overhead is an air corridor I think, because you often see passenger-jets crossing west-east og east-west.  At almost 2.am I spotted a jet on an eastern course at an altitude of maybe 24.000 feet. I followed it with my eyes having nothing better to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes I took my eyes off it and lighted a cigarette. When I looked for it again I saw the following: Maybe 20 km away and above the city of Kalundborg in the eastern sky close to &#39;my passenger-jet&#39; was a light as bright as Venus, but it was moving and swelling. &#39;My jet&#39; suddenly switched on its landing light, which couldn&#39;t match the light from the other craft at all. The passenger-jet seemed to make a rapid move to the right, whereas the bright light almost danced around it on its left side. And it was still swelling now with a milky halo, which again were surrounded by a white rim. In size it would still be like Venus in all its might, but the halo around would be ten times wider. The passenger-jet just looked like a jet with its light turned on. The strange craft seemed to almost lock on to the passenger-jet...as if the jet couldn&#39;t get away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite alarmed by this and was thinking: so now it happens. Suddenly the lights of the strange craft went out and nothing was to be seen of it. After five seconds the passenger-jet turned off its landing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For all I know it could have been an advanced military craft getting too close to a passenger-jet, whose pilot in panic would have turned on his lights to warn the other craft. But two things make me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. My own immediate reaction. I&#39;ve seen strange crafts before and have been puzzled. I&#39;ve even reported my sightings to you twice. But I am still a sceptic and search for at rational explanation. But this time I felt a deep fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. There was a blackout at the hospital of Kalundborg that night. It happened at the same time as the strange craft were immediately above the city. My sister works at night on that hospital and has been for 20 years. She told me about the blackout the next day. And said that they had never had a blackout before and for the first time they&#39;d had to power up the generator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this sighting to the danish SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Information), but they managed to lose my report, which they have apologised for, but I don&#39;t really trust them. I wanted the report posted in Denmark in case the pilot on the aircraft were Danish. He might have checked to see, if anybody had observed something from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still wonder about the incident, so I decided that the right thing would be to mail it to you.<n>

I was headed south to my home in Crittenden KY.  I noticed a large, bright orange light (about a half mile in front of me) in the sky along south-bound I-75 around the Dream Street area.  As I got closer I noticed that the light was on the front of what appeared to be a triangular shaped object.  It did not appear to be moving.  My best GUESStimate was that it was about 50-75 feet in the air.  As I drove underneath the object I saw two green lights and one red light, all of which were blinking as opposed to the one in front (the orange one) which was not blinking.  I could not tell if the three blinking lights were on the bottom or the side of the object due to the fact that I was passing under it at around 60mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/27/08 01:00|Fallen Timber Area (Canada)|AB|Light|10 to 15 sec|Very big bright light moving fast zigg zagged above us making no sound and freaked us out.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65261.html|77|ndxe200807| Very big bright light moving fast zigg zagged above us making no sound and freaked us out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were out camping with another couple in the Fallen Timber area of Alberta about 60 kilometers east of our home in Carstairs (the camp site is located in between Cochrane and Sundre Alberta in the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains, a very nice and secluded, quiet spot) and my wife forgot to pack our lawn chairs so we were sitting around the fire on what was available.. In my case it was the kids wake tube that was left in the camper so I was actually lying back and I happened to look up at the night ski and noticed a very bright that was traveling towards us in a southeast direction. At first I thought is was a plane on approach to Calgary. It was a clear night with many stars and It was a clear night with many stars and the moon visible the moon visible. What was funny about this light though was how it seemed to radiate out in all directions - different than say the lights on a plane because there like a cars headlights (projection style) you can see the beam and its intensity changes as it passes or changes direction. This light was intense and also shined into the blue spectrum and its intensity never changed as it approached, passed over and traveled off so I thought this is not a plane or chopper. I thought as well it may be a satellite, I’ve seen them before but they reflect light and this beamed light and at first seemed too low to be a satellite and traveling to fast to be aircraft. As I said the night was clear and just from its approach and over flight I think we were observing something quite large. When I first saw it I made a comment to the other 3 people that were with me and 2 of them were able to pick it up almost immediately in the night sky and follow its path with me; my friend Darren and his wife Laurie. The other person with us was my wife who had trouble finding it in the night sky.     I believe Laurie watched the object until it went overhead then began to talk with my wife so only Darren and myself followed the light I then leaned over to a tree to steady myse! lf as I just got up from the wake tube and wanted make sure the object was tracking straight because I have looked at stars and other fixed lights at night before and if you are not braced against some thing solid a fixed point can look like its moving. Any how as I leaned against the tree I closed one eye and was watching the light move away from us (still just as bright as it was when approaching or over head) the light zigged to the left approximately 30 to 45 degrees instantly then zagged back onto its original course a second latter. My friend shouted, “did you see that thing zigg zagg” I replied “yes” but was dumbfounded at what I just saw. After the zigg zagg we followed it for another 2 or three seconds and it disappeared behind a tree-covered hill behind us to the southeast that was probably at a 20-degree slope from our site      The thing that was seemed funny afterward was how the experience we were watching gave me the Willies and left me feel kind of unnerved afterward. What I have described occurred on Sunday July 27th 2008 at approximately 1:00 – 1:30 a.m.   I am a 43-year-old equipment supervisor for a Calgary Oil company and my wife is a homemaker, my friend Darren is an industrial mechanic - lead hand in a big oil patch fabrication shop and his wife is a farm girl who raises horses east of Calgary. I have spent many nights working in remote areas all over North America and have never seen any thing like this before. As I said it traveled very fast going from as far as I could see on one horizon to over the hill top horizon in 10 to 12 seconds.<n>

It was around 12:30 A.M or something around that and i had to go to the bathroom.  So i went outside to go.  I was on my way back into the tent when i heard a humming sound, so i looked up thinking it was just the helicopter that passes over my neighborhood at night.  I focused my vision because i couldn&#39;t really tell what it was and it was a really bright light that was shaped like a saucer. I called my friend out and so he came out and saw it and we both freaked because it was going really fast and it was flying lower than a helicopter would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So i went back in the tent and posted a bulletin on myspace talking about the alien but only one person believed me.  So then we started to text each other.  I didn&#39;t hear back from her for like an hour or so and she texted me saying that she was looking out her window and that she saw the same exact thing that i described up in the first paragraph and it was heading in the same direction that i said so we both started freaking out about it but i eventually went to bed.  I&#39;m going to be looking out for another one tonight and i&#39;ll try to take a picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We witnessed this light in an orange hue moving at an amazing speed over the horizon and it was stopping and changing direction very rapidly.  It was going from right to left over a patch of trees and shooting straight up.  It came back down over the horizon and would dart into loops.  At one point a second light came off of it this time in a blue hue and they’d dance around like flies chasing each other.  The blue one shone beams down at the patch of trees three times.  After about an hour and a half the lights just disappeared but not in any direction.  It was just as if the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notice a fast paced west/east light unlike my normal star gazing. As it caught my attention, it reminded me of another obeject in the sky that I had seen around 1998 or 1999. Not quite fast or brief enough to be a shooting star, the obect moved steadily at a very rapid pace. I say rapid based on judging against jumbo jets or either lower aircraft that a person usually hears to have that seemingly rate of movement. Even if it would have been low, it still would have been very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it from the east, observing long enough to chain of thought the above mentioned, it stopped abruptly, and stood as though it was a very bright star. From my vantage point, it looked as though it added itself to the big dipper. No more than I thought to myself, What in the hell is that, it turned bright red and appeared to go straight up into the unknown at a very rapid pace. I only say up for the mear fact that the red light progressivly got harder to see until it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I love to spend my evenings sitting on my porch and gazing around, I do this every night, my two year old loves to come and sit with me and count airplanes. The last time I seen anything close to this, the object never stopped but was faster and quiter than anything I have ever gazed at. I wouldn&#39;t have even bothered to send this if I wouldn&#39;t have seen another mans sighting report on biography channel, and he stated the same, white light to red and then gone. Pretty cool whatever it was. And no, I&#39;m not on drugs, ha, I think more of my C.D.L.&#39;s than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Viewed at an approximate angle of 30 degrees the objects were approximately 15 inches apart, to our vision. It would place them, I believe, somewhere over Wales, possibly the Brecon Beacons area. They moved slowly and gradually got fainter until they faded away as if leaving orbit or the influence of the Suns reflectivity. The whole sighting time was about 15 minutes.As they disappeared, a faint star (as it appeared to be) flashed brightly, about 3 times, approximately 3 to 4 minutes apart as if it was a distant sun flaring. Following this a bright white light travelled West to East, appearing to have a trail, to the naked eye, passing under the Plough, the approximate sighting time of this was 2 seconds. Shortly afterwards we observed 2 meteor/space junk burn outs in the Western sky (shooting stars). Nothing further was seen after 23:30. I have experienced a similar sighting about 12 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The scanner was busy as it is on Saturday nights and the Sirius was playing music no problem. Right after I passed the intersection of Hwy 47 and Hwy 147 my Sirius went to &#34;Searching for Signal&#34; and my police scanner cut out in the middle of a transmission from a police officer. This has never happened before in that area. After about 3-5 seconds they both received signal again. I looked at the clock on my car radio, 10:29pm, I did not notice any time loss. I also didn&#39;t notice any lights or aircraft in the sky as far as I could see out of my windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It started as a red flickering dot that moved very easily in all directions, slowly, then fast...then it changed color to white and became a long vertical light, then blue or green...and to a tall triangle and continued to move around, but more slowly.  It mainly stayed red, but the way that it was moving was what held our attention; side to side in a zigzag pattern, circular, up and down.  The whole thing lasted about 15-20 minutes until it slowly moved out of our view line.  Totally amazing sight and we have never believed in this before tonight.  There also happened to be meteor shower of some kind going on simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Helicoters frequently fly over the field behind our house so we figured it was a helicopter.  After about 20 seconds from when my friend said that it was a helicopter my other friend said that it couldnt be a helicopter it wasnt making any sound.  what we where seeing was a orange/yellowish sphere floating about 100 feet from us in the field when it went behind the trees in the middle of the field and the light went out.  I personaly do not know what that light was but it changed the way i look at life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I’m the first one that saw something, it looked like the top of a tree was burning, so I told the others to look because the tree is burning, so everyone looked and the light was moving slowly from my right to left, then it stopped right on top of the lake (no trees, nothing) about 400-600 feet from us, it was oval and the same colour as our fire,about 4-6 feet big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us took a flashlight and went on the deck to try to see what it was, but the flashlight wasn’t strong enough.  The thing started to move away slowly strait backwards, when it got to the other side of the lake there was a white light on top of the trees (it wasn’t the moon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We haven’t really talked to no one about it except our close family, we don’t want to look crazy. We are all average people with good jobs, no drugs or mental problems.

The objects had a triangular white light pattern with a red strobe between the two objects closer to the front.  The first object was smaller in size than the second object.  I managed to track the formation with my telescope for a couple of seconds and it appeared to be one object shaped like an isosceles triangle.  If it were 2 aircraft then I would have noticed irregularities in the distance between the two, but there was no lateral movement between the two, they kept a very static distance between them.  I believe the shape was distorted because it appeared to be between 2 to 5 miles to my South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red strobe seemed to be huge and I could faintly see the outline of the back end in the telescope.  The object moved across the entire sky in less than one minute without making a sound.  When I held my fingers up at arm’s length the object seemed to take up 3 fingers worth of sky.  If I were to estimate the height I would guess that it was probably between 5,000 and 10,000 feet up.  I have never seen an aircraft of this size in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near Tinker AFB and have seen just about every aircraft in the inventory.  This thing was way bigger than a C-5 galaxy and moved much faster without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving in an ESE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was about 10:00 p.m. and there were about a dozen of us there.  I was facing northeast when I noticed what appeared to be several satellites moving through the sky from different directions.  As they moved closer to each other, I became aware that there were 4 of these lights.  I really did not think much of it until the lights moved even closer to each other and then began circling around each other, as if they were moving in formation.  I’ve never seen satellites do this, but shrugged it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all suddenly simultaneously streaked across the night sky at speeds I’ve never seen before, once again in totally different directions.  They did not make any discernible sounds. They moved so fast they were out of sight within a second.  Two of my friends and I jumped up at the s! ame time shouting “oh my god, did you see that?!”  It was as if they had moved at the speed of light!<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I have never heard of any known flying object that can move at such speeds.<n>

There was only one. It looked flat like a dish, was shiny but dark on the bottom of it and it had an orange glow like a plane on fire. We waited to hear an explosion or for it to drop out of the sky. There was no sound and the fireworks were not ready to start yet. It made a wide turn and got smaller until it was an orange dot then disappeared. I&#39;m not sure if anyone else around saw it or not. It was about the size of an airplane when it&#39;s close enough to see windows, if that makes sense. It hovered for a good 5 minutes until it finally started to turn away from us and slowly disappeared. The sky was dark and there were hardly any clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They then disappeared from view behind a building. I would estimate their height at 2000 feet. I am not intrested in UFOs but have never seen anything like this. I have no obvious explanation.

Not a star and definitely not a planet - checked my charts.  Way way brighter than Sirius.  Have large Nexstarr and Ultima 11-inch SCT&#39;s but could not get them out in time to set up so i observed with naked eye and a small Meade binocular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> South - One dot turning into two then three then four.  Sometimes one dot splitting into two and then back to one.  One time saw on edge appeared disk with a ring of lights.  Very far away or very big - not sure which.  Stayed staionary for well over an hour.  It is still there now at 23:02 bur further away.  One in west straight up and sort of west not as clear but seemed to split as well into two dots - see lines of light protruding out of center like an axis every once in a while.  In north thought I saw a meteor streaking but then it stopped abruptly just under Polaris.  Red hue and spinning white to red - not blinking.  Looked back at first one and when I looked back this one was gone. NO JOKE - wife saw them as well.<n>

They appeared to be relatively low compared to seeing a commercial airliner at night.

I normally sit out there when i smoke and i smoke often so i see alot of planes, wheather ballons and what not. This time i saw just a single orange light flying in an oblique line when it suddenly lingered then rose straight up then contiued in the same direction. I tried calling the number and was met with hostility, i really just wanted someone to listen...I&#39;m sorry if in this line of work you get alot of hoax calls but you must know some people aren&#39;t as ignorant.

This round object was very bright and appeared to be sitting on the edge or lip of a cloud. After a few minutes of video taping this sighting, a helicopter comes into view and upon doing so, the object dimmed it&#39;s lights but was still visible. A couple seconds after the helicopter presense, my battery on the camcorder went dead! My father ran in to get another camera as I stayed and watched the object. I then saw what appeared to be two very fast aircrafts come flying out of the A.F.B. up into the sky. A minute or so afterward, the bright object begings to move toward my right (north) about 20 degrees and then toward me (eastwardly). The object then moved right again and out of my view (behind a building).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the last I saw of this u.f.o. The two aircrafts I saw scramble a few moments earlier then flew back into the Dobbins A.F.B. airspace and looked to be coming in for a landing. Around 10 or 15 minutes after this event, there were a lot of airtraffic in the Dobbin&#39;s vicinity which is highly unusual. I videotaped afterward, another helicopter flying around and two big aircrafts (looked to be military ) fly out of Dobbins. I recorded these events on a VHS camcorder and I will convert to digital format and send in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two nights prior to this night I had been noticing that there were becoming more and more stars each night.  This night, as im standing there, many airplanes begin to fly over head.  In total time of about 7 minutes, there were 6 planes.  Two where coming on my left, flying strait from east to west.  Four planes were flying directly over me, two of them clearing way up in the air, while the other two clearly flying low.  All planes were identifiable by their lights, the two four high ones making a small triangle with three lights, one white, and two blinking red and green.  Even the lower ones were noticeable with about 4 white lights in a line and a blinking red light I could only assume at the tail.  As they entered my airspace, I could hear the low planes, same as they left my airspace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first low plane passed directly over me, I noticed a newer &#34;thing&#34; just as low.  It had 4 white lights but these lights were to bright to be that of a plane and not quite bright enough to look as the stars did.  The lights almost made a shape of an &#34;L&#34; with the top two pretty much directly in formation, the third a little more to the right and out of formation and the fourth a little more out of the formation of the third.  Again I was looking at the first low plane that was just beginning to leave my airspace and took note of the sound it was making.  This L one however made no sound, speed was a little bit faster than those of the planes I was noticing but also, I did take reference of how smooth it seemed to go.  Of course it was night and to dark to truly see the smoothness in its ride, but I couldn&#39;t help but think and wonder about &#34;smooth&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So a second low craft is coming over me, and I turn my direction to where I noticed the L thing and as a joke tempting more &#34;stars&#34; as I called this L thing, to fly.  That&#39;s when I see this single white light cruising through the air.  Now this Single, was as bright as a star.  Just as quiet as the L,  but was moving at a speed that was incredible.  This Single, with its speed, could definitely be described as moving really smooth.  Some say it might have been a shooting star, and I&#39;ll go along with it, but it was going to slow to be what I think I&#39;ve seen as a shooting star, but way to fast to be any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen flying.  What really caught me was as it cruised I could see two stars that were directly in its path.  That natural humanistic thing to do was worry about a collision, due to the angle of which it was being seen.  But I kid you not, as they crossed paths, they became one, and as the Single would leave each of the two stars, I did take note that when right next to each other, they looked identical.  Both in size, shape, and brightness.  It was really quite inspiring to see something like this, that I could not explain, but still could not jump to any conclusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this sounds familiar, please contact me.<n>

He was driving and I was seated in the passenger seat. We were in the southeast area of the valley in the city of Van Nuys. We were traveling southbound on White Oak Avenue when my friend pointed out a strange object in the sky directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I proceed to delve into more detail about the sighting, I must emphasize that my friend and I are considered amongst our peers to be quite argumentative and skeptical when any topic of conversation broaches or offends our strong beliefs in logic and reason. Both of us are avid readers of scientific non-fiction and I am currently obtaining my Bachelor degree in science. So, neither one of us are prone to the unquestioned acceptance of fanciful tales of a pseudo-scientific nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live next to an airport and therefore bear witness to a never ending flow of air traffic of all forms of commercial, private, and military aircraft. This object was quite obviously not an airplane or helicopter. This object was in the shape of an ellipse and was a dull gray color. Aside from the complete lack of any wings or propellers, the attribute that was the most immediately startling and indicative of the object’s unconventional design was the array of multi-colored lights evenly distributed about the circumference of the object’s surface. On each side, there was a blinking red light. The rest of the lights appeared to flicker through the color spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance of the object was difficult to judge because there was no way to discern how large the object was. However, it was either close enough to us or large enough at a distance that we could easily see the edges of the object against the sky. This was not just a cluster of blurry glowing dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned left on Vanowen St. and began heading east at which point the surrounding buildings, which had been intermittently obscuring our view, gave way to a wide open field which gave me an uninterrupted period of approximately five minutes to study the object in the sky. This object did not change or vary its position in the slightest. Even after our trajectory had changed, its position in the sky did not. Eventually, the cityscape completely obscured our vision of the object. We were unable to capture a photograph for lack of a camera. However, I have included a sketch of the object drawn immediately after the sighting. Hopefully, someone else has seen this object and can shed some light although I hold no illusions about the likelihood of ever having any form of answer concerning this disconcerting experience.<n>

I was taking pictures of the St. Peter&#39;s Cathedral steeples in downtown Regensburg.  I took the pictures with a Kodak Digital Camera (360).  I did not know or notice the object at the time I took the pictures. This is another explation.I did notice the object when I downloaded the pictures while in Germany.  It was only a few days ago (5 Aug 10) that a co-worker and myself were browsing pictures of Germany from 2008.  We looked at this picture and magnified it to 800x to get a better look at it.  It is our belief that the object is not an airplane, helicopter or any type of aviation device known to humans.  There are no wings, tail, nose or rotary blades.  There is a black haze/mist around the object.  We also noticed that the object had an indention close to the top of the object that might appear to be windows or some type of design that&#39;s indented on the object.  The indentation goes aroun! d the object also.  I have two pictures that were taken back to back.  One of the pictures does not have the object in it.  The pictures were taken about 1 to 2 seconds apart.  I wish that I had noticed and investigated this back in 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.  I was also of sound mind when taking the pictures.  I did not hear anything while taking the pictures.  I was looking at a direction of South/Southeast (approximately 2700 - 2800 mills).  When taking the two pictures, there were trees in the background, a river in front of me (Danube River) two church steeples and a walking path below me.  The Cathedral in downtown Regensburg was approximately 1 to 1 1/2 miles away in a direct line.  The sky that day was pretty clear with some clouds.  It was not raining anywhere around the area.<n>

When I got a little past exit 13 I saw an object to my right over Lake Zoar. It was just above the trees. It moved in my direction, and was infront of my car. It looked exactly like a rocket ship, except it was not as long and thin. It was on the shorter, wider , with no wings, and no visible engine. It looked to be made out of metal, and the bottom almost resembled glass. It was &#34;floating&#34; with the top pointed to the left, and changed it&#39;s direction into an upright position. It made no noise at all, even though it was so close to the ground. It almost looked like it was barley in movement. It had 3 objects on the bottom of it, just like a rocket. If anything like this has ever been seen please let me know, because I feel like I am going crazy.<n>

It was a very clear night.All of a sudden my son said look Dad, and there to the north east was an orange ball of light in the night sky, after a few seconds another ball of orange light flashed what looked to be about 50 yards away from the other object. Both took turns blinking on and off for about 30 to 45 seconds . Then from out of nowhere another orange ball of light flashed directly to the east of the other two objects. They seemed to be flashing on one at a time, in unison.We watched for about 2 minutes and they just vanished. I know this sounds strange, but I only filed this report after reading other sitings like mine in this same area around the same time as mine. This was NOT an airliner, or a flair. I am a 52 year old ,married 25 years and I can&#39;t explain what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Driving Northwest on I-10 Near Phoenix AZ.  More specifically, between Casa Grande and Chandler, East of Maricopa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving northwest in my car on I-10, I noticed off in the direction of my drivers-side sideview mirror, something rise up from the earth.  It was about 300 feet west of the freeway.  It immediately caught my eye because it started flying up from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was moving kind of like a helicopter, but looked nothing like a helicopter.  It was dark but I could make out the shape of the object against the Maricopa lit horizon.  It was diamond shaped, with 1 light(white) on 3 of the corners, pointing down (perpendicular to the craft).  The fourth corner had more of a head light pointing in line (parallel) with the craft.  It was probably the size of an actual baseball infield, just a lot thicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving like nothing I have ever seen from an aircraft.  I started to think it was some sort of irrigation type sprinkler of some sort for a crop field.  The object turned vertical (as if the baseball diamond stood up on one side) and was moving as if it were attached to an arm.   It moved on an arc like path for a few seconds and then returned to a “normal” orientation and started flying, somewhat weaving back and forth, headed slightly more west than NW, not more than 100 feet above the ground.  It was definitely going faster than me (I was going approx. 80) but probably not more than 120mph as it was only moderately leaving me behind. There was a surprising number of other vehicles out which made it hard to try and follow but should also yield some other reports.  It could not have been a helicopter or a normal US airplane due to shape and movement, and I can only classify it as an unidentified flying object.  Absolutely Crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/25/08 04:00|Chandler|AZ|Diamond|2 minutes|Diamond Shaped Black Object Hovering In Chandler Field|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69108.html|115|ndxe200807| Diamond Shaped Black Object Hovering In Chandler Field<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother confided this story to me a month after his observation. I believe 100% his story and observation as he is a very credible and responsible person. My brother who works for my company overseeing my night operations of my business got off work at 3AM. He lives in Maricopa so he travels from Phoenix to his home driving I-10. At around 4AM while traveling eastbound on I-10 as he approached the queen creek exit in Chandler he observed a dark diamond shaped object to his left rise up from a field about 100 feet and it then headed in a easterly direction towards casa grande. My brother said he was driving about 75-80 MPH and there were a few other cars on the road. He said the object made a few moves that made him think this was not a known civilian or military aircraft. It had 3-4 lights similar to navigation lights and it moved faster then his vehicle. He guessed it speed to be around 100-125MPH. He turned off his exit to queen creek/Highway 347 and proceeded on to the Town of Maricopa where he lives. He did not see the aircraft anymore once he left the Interstate freeway. I have lived here since 1996 after getting out of the military. I was in aircrat maintenance for F-14&#39;s and have been exposed to many types of military aircraft. What he described and its movements and speed along with no typical aircraft sounds associated with a jet engine aircraft or any normal chopping sounds of a helicopter type aircraft I conclude what he saw was either extremely new military technology not yet known to the general public or it was a UFO. I know there have been many unexplained events and sightings in the Phoenix area since I have lived here. Bottom line, I believe my brother saw exactly what he described as described. In my opinion, there has been to many sightings by too many people of various types of aircraft doing maneuvers that are just not known to be capable of modern aircfraft both military and civilian. Our current aircraft designs and more specifically, their power plants do not a! llow for this. Even a Harrier jet can not stop on a dime and hover, and when it is hovering, it is very loud because of the nozzel thrust it produces in the downward position. His sighting was a very silent aircraft leading me to believe it utilizes a high energy magnetic type power plant propulsion system and the earths natural magnetisym. Opposite type polarity propulsion system that have been engineered to allow for quite flight, speed, and maneuverability such as the new high speed trains technolog that use magnetics and ride on a cushion of air exist today, just not known to exist on aircraft at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although I do not believe it was that far. The Neon green light sometimes went to red very briefly but at some points the neon green color would be brighter than other times. Then the light would disappear for a moment. From the movement of it did not seem like a plane or a flare or anything of that sort. It just seemed to “dance” up and down swaying side to side. That is the only way I know how to describe it. I watched it for about 4 minutes after noticing it then I drove off to get home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object then turned into a white light, and after about 30 seconds alternated between the blue and orange lights again, continuously moving in a &#34;t&#34; pattern of direction. Gradually, after 4 minutes or so, the object started to move lower and lower, behind a mountain, near the Magic Mountain  area in the Santa Clarita Valley. Finally it disappeared below the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden there was a close up of L.Donovan (I have a 50 inch HD tv), and in the background I saw a streak across the screen. I have a DVR and rewound it, and there are two star-like lights.  One comes from the bottom left on the screen and travels faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen, through a cloud, and diagonally up to the right corner of my tv. As it gets about half way, I see it is heading for another idential looking star. Just as it&#39;s about to get to that star, of course the screen changes and the highlight is somewhere else. It is crystal clear however. One star looking object is stationary, and the other is heading directly at it. It happened so fast that it just looks like a streak live. However, using a DVR, you can slow it down so that you can see screen by screen movements of the one star looking object.  I saw this on July 25th of this year, at 9:21am Eastern Time, on Sportscenter. If someone could look at this, this would be GREAT!<n>

Both happened at 11:30 p.m. on two consecutive night. This seemed to last slightly longer than the night before.  Duration was 5-6 seconds on the 23rd. of July and the 24th sighting seemed a second or so longer. This one came from the Northeast to the Southeast.  Both nights the meteor was huge in size as well as the brightest meteor I have ever seen.  We are very used to seeing meteor&#39;s in the sky.  The lack of light pollution makes New Mexico an ideal place for viewing &#34;shooting Stars&#34;.  But on both nights these were huge and the duraturation lasted longer than any others I have seen.<n>

He was sleeping.  I was in a position that there was a window straight ahead of me.  I was lying there thinking about what I would do the next day when I saw it.  It appeared oval shaped, but it was difficult to tell for sure because it was engulfed in green flames.  It was going towards the ground at a 45 degree angle at an alarming pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it was going to crash into the corn field across from my house.  I never saw if it crashed or not because it left my line of view.  I got up right away and looked out the window, but I couldn&#39;t see any traces of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my brother-in-law in fear.  He told me to go back to sleep and not worry about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was afraid that a charred alien would wander up to the house.

As I passed the Hamburg Street exit (Exit 5), I noticed a peculiar light arrangement to my right approximately 1.5~2 miles away.  The lights were in a vertical alignment, like what you would see if a commercial jet banked 90-degrees.   At the very top was a pulsating white light (not flashing).  Below that were two blue lights.  Much further below (50 to 100 feet) the blue lights was a single red light. As I followed it moving away, it seemed to be a shape like a vertical cigar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my attention and I tried to keep it in view.  I but it disappeared behind some taller buildings in the city to the North.  I then drove around another mile to the Church Street exit (Exit 7).  While exiting the thruway, I saw the same light pattern over my left shoulder.  This time, it was much larger and the light pattern was now 30-degrees from horizontal.  The craft was heading southeast towards Lake Erie and was travelling without making any detectable noise.  If it were a commercial jet, it would definitely have been very audible at the low altitude it appeared to be flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The exit I was on is off of an elevated section of the thruway so I quickly descended to a point where my view of the craft was blocked by the thruway. I raced to get to a location where I would have a clear view over Lake Erie.  I reached an opening about 20-seconds later, but to my dismay, the craft could not be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the close up view (2nd sighting), the red light was bright and not flashing.  The blue lights now appeared to be more of a blue glow like from some type of propulsion system.  I would compare it to the blue lights on the rear of the starship destroyer in the movie Star Wars. The white light was now on the far right side of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From our field of view, the lights first started to appear in the south-south-west area of the sky. I first witnessed two lights that where bigger then the stars around them. One of the lights were red, the second slightly above the first was white. They disappeared a few seconds after I saw them, then 5 degrees west, another red light appeared stationary like the first two and then faded out remaining in the same position. These first lights looked like they were several miles away and were fairly low in the southern horizon. I then told my wife, who was standing with me, that I thought there was something odd going on in the sky and motioned her to see. We then witnessed two more red lights appear, and then disappear, in a relative similar position to the first sighting . Less than a minute later ten red lights appeared in a sequence at an exact 45 degree angle.  Then two more lights appeared at a 45 degree angle away from the previous angle still in sequence with the other angle.  For 15 more minutes I had numerous red lights appear in the sky from south-south-west positions to south-west-west positions of the sky.  The lights appeared to be many miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wife’s statement:  We saw an amazing, unexplainable, display of lights.   Lights were appearing and disappearing all over the sky.  We even saw weird light patterns.  All this transpired about 15 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They would flash twice then nothing for a moment, and then repeat. It was almost as if they had been flying in formation. Then they split up and one went straight east, one went southwest toward the Gulf and the last one shot out toward the southeastern sky. The speed that they were going was amazing. I grew up outside Macdill AFB and never have seen anything that could hit the speeds these were going. The flight path was from Northeastern Pasco County, Florida and they split up at about the Pasco-Hillsborough County line. A plane bound for Tampa flew overhead and I realized that the UFO&#39;s had to be flying at a much greater altitude. There wasnt any tracer trail nor any vapor trail. As soon as they seperated, they had what I would call random movements, a little left, a little right, but continuing in going in their same directions. For all I know the government may have been testing some new aircraft, I just dont know. If we are testing something, at those Speeds, it would be awesome to see in the daylight !!!! It was such a weird event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were about 2 miles from Warsaw, Indiana when I noticed 2 objects off to the Southwest  that  were spaced much farther apart than the lights on an airplane wing.  These lights were round and were moving Southwest on a very clear night.  My Husband dismissed them as air planes due to the proximity of the local airport.  I talked him into turning down a side road to the West in the direction of the 2 orange lights.   Approximately 3/4 of a mile down this road we saw another object lower to the tree line to our Southwest. This object, the same as the first two appeared as a round, orange  complete circle moving / hovering South.  We turned South and then back to the West and found a clearing with a wide view of the horizon.  It was around 11P.M.  With the car off we sat in the entrance of a field facing to the South.  Within 5 minutes we were witnesses to an amazing display of these objects.  First a cluster of 2 appeared,  stationary to the South and then disappeared, one appeared just to the East, two reappeared again and then three more to the West of the other three for a total of six round orange objects in the Southwestern sky.  It seemed as though the objects were communicating to one another.  All the objects were stationary at this time of our observation. At this point a small panic ensued in our car and we left the area amazed, excited and feeling our world as a much smaller place.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My family, consisting of my parents, two sisters, two cousins, aunt and uncle, and grandmother all left to look for fiddler crabs at the beach (though my grandmother stayed at the cottage).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked for crabs with flashlights for a while and we saw a lot of them. My dad and uncle brought beach chairs and beer and sat on the beach enjoying the stars. After a while people began to get bored and I sat in one of the chairs and looked at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fog was creating an effect, which made some stars near the horizons flicker weirdly, and I atched the stars and occasional airplane for a while. I saw something, which my family and I thought, was a satellite but we decided it was moving too slowly and eventually lost sight of it in the fog. We concluded that it was an airplane without the flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between this airplane(?) and the flickering effect the fog gave the stars the night sky was looking a little odd. (Though I must clarify that the night sky was still clearly visible, just hazy near the horizons.) All of my family except my dad, my aunt, and my youngest sister had gotten bored and returned to the cottage by this point in my stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking of returning to the cottage when I saw something in the sky south of us that made me point and exclaim “Holy shit, what is that?” I saw three blinking red lights in a triangular pattern in the sky moving east. My dad, aunt, and sister saw it as well, and though they definitely said something, I don’t remember exactly what.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the sight for several minutes. The red lights moved through the sky in the same general direction. I am not sure if they were three very distant aircraft or if they were lights on one large and very close aircraft. They (or it) made no noise. The lights adjusted formation as they flew, but generally kept in a triangular pattern. This triangle seemed to change dimensions as it flew. If these were three aircraft then they had adjusted their flying formation; if it was one, it was tilting or turning. My dad and I both think that a fourth light may have appeared once or twice but we are not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching I distinctly thought that the lights were one large and close aircraft. I thought I could see a triangular or disk-shaped body but it was probably my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights turned and they appeared to be moving towards us, moving in our direction and getting farther apart. This is part of what made me think it was one aircraft. I said something along the lines of Woohoo, I’ve finally seen a UFO.” (I’m a UFO/cryptozoology enthusiast and wanted to see something along these lines for a long time.) But as it came closer I began to feel somewhat frightened and crouched low to the sand. I thought about shining my flashlight towards it, but it was unlikely to be close enough to be illuminated by a cheap flashlight we found in the cottage’s kitchen drawer. All it would do is obscure the sight of the lights (and perhaps, I thought, provoke the occupants of the aircraft or aircrafts.) 	My sister got scared and returned to the cottage. I recalled what I knew of UFO and alien lore and wondered if I would return to the cottage to find that several hours had passed. After seeming to move towards us for about a minute, maybe less, (it was difficult to judge how long the experience was, I was so transfixed,) the lights seemed to move away from us. My sister had returned to the dune deck near the beach and was shining a flashlight at us. We all yelled at her to turn it off, the light was obscuring our view of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights shortly disappeared. I do not know if they shut off or if they disappeared into the fog shrouding the horizons. With the lights gone my fear evaporated. I grinned and ran back to the cottage. My sister met me on the dune deck and asked me if the lights were gone. I told her that they were and went back to the cottage. I found that there was no lost time and informed the rest of my family that they had “missed the UFO.” My sister (the one who had not been at the beach when I saw the UFO) said that she didn’t believe my other sister when she told her the news while I was still watching the UFO. My dad and aunt quickly followed me and we explained the story to everyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then wrote this down.<n>

It seemed like it was &#34;checking out&#34; what the jet was spraying. It was too far off in the distance to notice any dramatic movements. Basically it looked like a star to me at first then it just kinda disappeared in the distance. It was daylight and getting near dark so I couldn&#39;t see any flashes or lights or like I said above, there was no dramatic movement.

I had thought to myself that there is no way you would see a star at 10:10 a.m. PDST. The object proceeded to move due east and west little bits at a time making right angle turns to the north then south. The object then immediately darted accross the sky to what seemed at least 100 miles then stopping instaniously remaining stationary for some 15 minutes while moving at a slower rate but makeing right angle turns every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued working while it remained in the sky when suddenly I noticed it dissapeared the re-appeared near the moon again 2 seconds later. This time I noticed the intense bright white object was joined with a second bright red object looking to be the same size. They seemed to &#34;play&#34; with each other for at least 25 minutes making more right angle turns at incredible rates of speed in the western half of the sky darting from the north to south side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not really make out what size the UFO&#39;s were, all I can really say is it appeared to be two bright dots simular to stars in the sky. I am an experienced pilot who flew for many years since I was a child then flying for Forestry for the British Columbia Gov&#39;t and I have to say this was by no means any type of conventional aircraft that the public knows. Anyone else seeing anything in the Northwest lately? The thought of the military crossed my mind testing unconventional aircraft/spacecraft such as the T3B reverse-engineered from ET Technology, but who knows right?<n>

I was outside (smoking) and saw the huge meteor as it came from the northeast to the southwest. The event lasted for 5-6 seconds which is a long time for a &#34;shooting star&#34; or meteor. The meteor was bright white with a trial or tail of sparks behind it. The trail of sparks behind it was a bright as sparks from a cutting torch. The object seemed to be skipping across the sky. I am 51 years of age and was wondering if anyone else saw this incredible meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise or smoke trail after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

His father reported this story to the authorities. I wouldn&#39;t bother if there weren&#39;t multiple witnesses. Here goes...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s kind of one my of things, to go outside at night and just look at stars for a while. I like to sit and watch Venus, and that&#39;s what I was doing a couple days ago around midnight. I put out my cigarette and turned to go back inside, but a much brighter light caught my eye halfway through a turn. It was something like 4 to 5 times brighter and larger than Venus appears, and it was red-orange. That light was only seen for a couple seconds before it was just gone. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was seeing things or not, so I continued to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not five minutes later, I got a phone call from my friend, saying that he and his dad were watching three of what I thought I saw. Confirmation made me run outside to see if I was missing the rest of the show, and I was. It gets very interesting here, because it was a little more than just a light show. First off, the three red-orange balls of light were moving very, very fast, AND in classic triangular formations. They &#34;danced,&#34; too. The best I can describe it is that they spiral around each other. As they &#34;danced,&#34; they individually changed in brightness and speed. It was clear there were several terrestiral aircraft in the skies observing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next stage of display included what seemed to be flares dropped from the lights straight down. The &#34;flares&#34; were brighter than the crafts themselves, and a distant &#34;boom&#34; or roar could be heard clearly enough. After that, the formation disappeared east. I continued to watch, but what I saw next was just different. This one was much smaller, white, and not so flashy. It flew north several times faster than the terrestrial craft it came upon. I assumed it could also be terrestrial, but then it whipped around in a circle around the airplane, hooked off the right and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen strange things in the sky before, but it&#39;s extremely rare. The last time I saw something that strange was around the time of the Arizona saucer fiasco. I&#39;m not unsure I didn&#39;t just see the same thing myself. I have my opinions about the UFO phenomena, and then I have my observations. Next time, I would like to have something with which to document my observations on video, but under my excitement, I just didn&#39;t do it. Regardless, it&#39;s clear by the photograph of the object in Mackey, Indiana, that the same crafts or similar ones are being seen in other counties.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The front was triangle or pointed in shape with the rear blocked or square in sharp and the center was rectangle with a ark like shape. It was tilted in a 35-45 degree angle with no movement. The color was a metallic dark gray. The object remained stationary in the air for several minutes. It had no vapor trail. It just remained in the air suspended. I know I was not the only person who saw it due to it not being dark and there was a fair amount of cars heading in the same direction on Hwy 41 plus it was so obvious. At first you would think it was a blimp and I was hoping it was but it wasn&#39;t. I never seen a blimp shape like a block shape battle ship. Whatever it was it was large, heavy, and solid. It was just hanging there like it was docking calm and peaceful. No movement at all. I just watched it as I was alert enough to avoid not hitting another cars at the light. wondering when or if it was going to move. After I stopped and got my lunch for the evening and at local restaurant when I can out it was gone with no vapor trail that hinted in its direction of travel. If the U.S. has something like that in its garage tax payers need to be mad and ask for an goverment audit. We have technology but we don&#39;t have that type of technology yet.

Like most people I have been skeptical about this subject, but after observing what I saw on July 23, 2008 at 10:10 pm, I definitely have more than an open mind on this subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I had just left from an evening of dogsitting.  As we got to the edge of Lagro, (called &#34;old Lagro Road&#34;) heading west to Wabash, I had dozed off only to be awaken with a nudge on the shoulder and him telling me &#34;Look at that, did you see that&#34;.  I then looked out my passenger window and saw nothing. He slowed the vehicle down, but there was nothing I could see. As we got to the edge of Wabash (a very curvy area) straight out in front of us was a amber orangish light that was only visible for about 6 seconds and faded or burnt out.  Now, upon entering Wabash on E. Hill St., we entered town.  Sitting at a stop sign at Hill St. and Wabash St (where the courthouse sits) we proceeded across and noticed, just above the treeline, about a block away this light had reappeared. Let me explain that after observing the light previously, this light then split into five lights, estimating to be at least a quater mile wide. The lights then one after the other faded out.  We then proceeded to an open area on the edge of town for an unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon getting out of our vehicle, we noticed numerous aircraft in the area of the sighting, only to be followed by military jets.  As a matter of fact, we are only 25 miles from Grissom Air Reserve Base, in Bunker Hill, IN.  These jets were low, and at a high rate of speed and seemed to me they were aware of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything of this kind and was in shock at first. We were silent, then went home and sat in the kitchen in silence for at least an hour.  The night&#39;s events were then attempted to be discussed, but I was not ready.  That is why I am here now, because I am ready to share what I saw.  I know that these are not flares!<n>

We talked about it for a few minutes and we saw more lights. They didn’t move they would just fade in and stay on for about 5 -7 seconds then fade out. My wife called in to our 19 yr old son and his girlfriend and told them to come out and take a look. They both came out and we saw a set of two lights. One came on then the second. Once the second had reached its peak in brightness the first one faded out then the second faded. I said that it looked like it was only a mile or so away and I was going to drive in that direction to see what I could see. As I got over by Wainwright middle school my wife yelled into the cell phone that there was another one. I put my head between the steering wheel and the windshield of the car and it was directly above me. That one actually had a secondary light that split way from the original ball. Just before I left the house my son was getting his video camera and caught a few sets of lights on his digital video camera. He got a series of three lights just behind the tree line and the light that was over my car. The video shows the second OBOL splitting off the first one. The light I saw above my car would have bigger than my car if it had been on the ground.   I was directly under that one. There were about 6 different sets of lights that night. Some had only one, some had two and a few had three. There were 5 witnesses for the 23rd of July 2008. We saw tiny white non flashing pin lights flying all over the area where we had seen the OBOL. After we had seen the first two lights my Brother-in-law said “Look at that little white light flying after that airliner. He’s going to hit it!!!” It flew VERY fast and caught up with the airliner and fl! ew just above it until it was out of the area then peeled back and SHOT towards the east where it had came from. The very last light we had seen (I was back home by now) there we two pin point white lights closing in on the OBOL from both sides and when it disappeared the two tiny white lights shot straight up into the air nearly colliding and shot towards the north. In total there were about 4 pin lights while this was all going on. The OBOL showed up every 4-5 minutes in different areas in the NE sky. It was 22:40 when we saw the last one and went in to see if there was anything on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 24th my wife and I had to work the next morning so she went to bed and told me to wake her if I had seen anything. Right on time 22:30 the first one showed up. I ran inside got my wife and this time my daughter was home and I had her come out on the deck to watch. The lights looked the same but were in a different pattern. This time there we several lights coming on at the same time in different parts of the NE sky. On both nights if all lights would have been on they would have formed a perfect horizontal line spanning about a 5-7 mile stretch. My wife called my mother who lives in Clarkshill and her and my brother went outside and saw them. The next day I called my friend who is a police officer and he said he saw them too and had no idea what they were. So on this night we had 5 witnesses in three different parts of the county who saw them. My wife thought she saw one way off in the distance around the Delphi area, but it was too far away and she couldn’t be sure<n>

First we saw a short, horizontal &#34;bar&#34; of orange light which flashed, or strobed in a stationary position, then radically skipped up about five degrees above its previous position...there was no continuity of movement...object seemed to disappear then reappear the same instant at a higher altitude.  It duplicated this maneuver several times, then we saw nothing for ten to fifteen minutes.  When object reappeared (assuming it was the same object), it appeared to be 2x closer, apparently over the middle of the lake.  This time the light pulsed on more gradually, and showed three or four lights along a horizontal elliptical pattern, suggestive of a round or disk shaped craft.  The lights were the same color and shone brightly for several seconds, then faded.  No sounds accompanied the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes after that, a very dim jet aircraft traveling from north to south moved directly overhead (jet aircraft sounds heard).

When we got back to the car we were just relaxing in the air conditioning.  The car lights were acting funny and kept shutting off every now and then.  I noticed a small drop of light moving through the trees and was trying to figure out if it was a lightning bug or a plane, but I never could be sure.  This was nothing compared to what we eventually saw.  We got out of the car with our flashlights and we were just goofing around.  All of a sudden, my friend calls my attention, “come here! look! Look!”  I was completely spellbound by this object.  I kept checking myself to make sure I was not crazy and we kept reassuring each other.  I was very curious and without fear as the object swarmed around the tree tops.  My friend was yelling at me to get back in the car because he was terrified.  I don’t know what would have happened if I continued to welcome the craft.  I did not feel like it wanted to do me harm, but I just felt overwhelmed.  It seemed like the more I welcomed it, the more it moved towards me and became more noticeable.  It was an orb with a revolving disc around it that was covered in lights, and it moved without any noise, and so elegantly.  It was so intricate that it is hard to describe.  It moved in all directions, stopping and changing speed.  It even followed us out to the main road and stopped when we stopped and kept observing us.  It was the most amazing experience I have ever had.  I am not a crazy person.  I know what I saw, but I don’t know what it was.  I stared at it for long periods of time, and at one point it was in full view and it was just so unbelievable, but yet so real.  But there were more than one.  I saw three UFOs tonight.  It seemed like it was responding to me somehow.  I can’t explain it.  All I know is that my eyes and mind are open and I am a believer.  It was NOT a plane.  It was NOT a hallucination.  It was a UFO.  I don’t know what to do.  I am still in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Behold with disbelief, and flying north, at what appeared to be slower than a jet, was a large flying triangle, it was solid grey in color and really smooth looking in appearance. The nose of the craft, and both wing tips were squared off and not pointed.  There were no lights or marking&#39;s on it what so ever, not a cloud in the sky, and as sunny as a 9am morning could get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a extremely high air traffic area, i can immediatley distinguish all aircraft noises from in my house after 20 years of living here.  All jets, cessna&#39;s, private jets, and helicopters can be heard 1 mile before they get to my house. I avidly take part in watching aircraft over my house due to the many &#34;close calls&#34; of two jets crossing the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked out the window there was an odd unfamiliar object in the sky. At first I thought it was a helicopter, however when i went to the window to get a better look i realized it wasnt. The lights on the thing were something i had never seen before. It had a white flashing light that chased aroung the outer edge. There was a sollid blue strip that circled the entire craft and two red flashing lights on top. Never have seen anything like this before. Others in the house heard the noise over the night but didnt see anything. I was able to watch it for about 5 seconds or so and the noise was getting louder and all of a sudden it was gone. I went outside to see where it went but there was nothing. Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Overhead was an orange light. It seemed to be a balloon. But like sort of like a hot air balloon because it was orange with a light inside. The &#34;UFO&#34; continued to follow our car for at least 2 more minutes; finally the &#34;UFO&#34; was so far in the sky it was not able to see. Also the moon was huge and an orange color. Is this a real &#34;UFO&#34; or just a hot air balloon?  This is no joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although, right when we got the phone out to take a picture the object was unsightable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overhead- looking through the sun roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up don&#39;t no what direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In very small town it was clearly not a street light it was very close like 50 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then left and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11 pm at night looked up things online and saw exact thing like what happened in January in France, 08.

Total travel time 3-5 min. read report for details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at a formation of stars that seemed to be in a perfectly straight line for quite some time.  After looking at the stars for a while (they were in the southern portion of the sky) a bright circular light appeared from absolute darkness.  The light started out (Point A) as bright as the brightest star in my field of vision.  The light traveled for about 10 seconds and decreased in brightness towards (Point B) until it vanished into complete darkness.  I was amazed by the disappearing of this light and assumed it was a meteor traveling horizontally across my field of vision.  I gazed at the exact spot in which the light disappeared for roughly around 3-5 minutes.  After 3-5 minutes the light appeared again and began traveling horizontally across the sky to (Point C) the final destination.  The same intensity and decrease in brightness occurred from (Point B) to (Point C).  The lights were not flickering or flashing as a commercial airline or other jet/helicopter would have been.  I&#39;ve seen commercial  airliners approaching landing and seen a &#34;spotlight&#34; similar to intensity, but this light was not flashing or flickering, nor was it low enough to have its landing spotlight on.  This object appeared to be several thousands of miles in the night sky and did not flicker or scatter, it merely appeared and decreased in brightness until it disappeared and then reappeared again.  From Point A to Point C the lights flight took anywhere from 3-5 minutes.  From Point A to Point B the light only took 10 seconds to travel.  From Point B to Point C was also another 10 seconds.  Now this would make the total flight from Point A to Point C take 20 seconds, but the kicker is that the light disappeared for quite some time and reappeared making the total flight time anywhere from 3-5 minutes.  I spent another half and hour gazing at the sky hoping to see more commotion but did not find any other abnormalities.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We got out of the tent to observe the lights more closely. It first appeared to be some sort of formation of ships. In between the lights that would flash occasionally there was a shimmer like glitter. The lights hovered above the highway right next to us on the side of a mountain. After watching it for awhile we could see that the lights were actually spinning and it was not a formation but a disk shaped object. The ship was very large in relation to the objects surrounding it like the mountain side or the semis driving below it. It slowly headed east in the direction where I believe the Goldendale Observatory is, in Goldendale, WA. I would recommend contacting the Goldendale Observatory to see if they witnessed anything similar to us. It was a very clear night and the stars were clearly visible. We were facing North where the ship was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Four orange balls formed a satellite around the white light then moved off in different directions moving through the clouds. The orange fireballs moved back to the brighter light and moved out farther yet again. This went on for about 22 minutes with the lights converging several times to the stationary bright white light. We have quite a few aircraft that fly close to our house, however these objects did not have the sound or jet trails that we would normally see or hear associated with aircraft. This was witnessed by 3 people as well as me. 2 of the observers are former military personnel and had no explanation for what the lights could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Recently, I have seen them almost every night! On this paticular night, we seen about 8-10 of them. They only lit up big, for a few minutes, but, remained in the sky until about 1:20AM. They looked like large stars moving back and forth, sometimes very fast, other times slow. They would change directions, speed up, stop, and change directions. Then, would go, at high speeds, to another part of the sky, then stop.We also seen 2 or 3, that were totally different. They looked like saucers, with lights around them, moving very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would have thought it was a falling star in the way it came across the sky but it was much much wider and more colorful and it took perhaps5 or 6 seconds before it exploded in a fire ball and then the sky was totally dark again. Because of the width of the trail and the size of the explosion I had the feeling it was rather close to earth.  I had no way to estimate height or distance.  I did need to look up through my vehicles front window to see it better. It may have been a large meteoroid but being that close it must have caused some damage.  Strange thing is that my cell phone screen was all scrambled when I went to call home and tell my husband about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it for around 15 seconds as it floated from the top star of the big dipper to the bottom star still believing it was a satellite. But as it reached the bottom, it completely changed direction. It started to go east, instead of north. This is when I was convinced that it wasn&#39;t a satellite, as a satellite doesn&#39;t change direction or remain as bright as this light had. I stood up and began to watch as it sped up and continued going east. Just then, my girlfriend came back outside and we watched as this bright light floated around the sky and faded into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was fairly big. If you were to hold out a regular M&amp;M at arms length to the sky...that would be about how big it was. And it was three times as bright as any other star in the sky.<n>

It was very high up; most likley out of the earths atnosphere. The object was pulsating to different magnitudes(brightness); and kept changing speeds. At one piont it atmitted a bright orange beam for about 3 seconds. About 2 minutes later, the object started to decrease altitude. As it was doing so, it started to get fainter and and started to pulsate brighter and then dissapeared. the object could not be seen with the naked eye or through the scopes 8x52 view finder. The lens i used to view the object was a plossl 1.25in 32mm with on the scope i was useing was about 50x. there was one more witness. My dad got a quick glimpse of the object. It had no visible shape. I know it wasnt a satellite or a meteor because satilites dont pulsate and the bject was goining to slow to be a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got a better look at the object in the sky it was a equalatiral triangle had lights on it, one red one at the front and a several white ones that flashed on and off around the outside (not of the red light but the triangle itself). it was traveling faster than what a usual plane would. I also saw a plane going south as the object was going out of view, and i know that the plane was a plane cause it was a leaner normal plane shape and had a red light at the front and 2 white lights that was always on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both shut off our radios and motors and could not hear any noise from an engine.  This orange light approached us and appeared to be only 500 ft away.  It then began to move east towards Metro airport.  Just after the light faded. It instantly re-apperared in the same spot it was first seen.  This happened three times and did the same flight pattern as the first.  This is the second time that I has witnessed such an occurence on the same lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It made sound as it passed and passed 40-50 mph. Just about 1 hour before I got to see a trianular shaped object which passed overhead then a mile or so away turned around and put yellow lights on.

7/21/08 22:00|Parsons|KS|Unknown|2|White "moving star" rapidly traversing the sky from south to north across Kansas on July 21, 2008.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64699.html|170|ndxe200807| White &#34;moving star&#34; rapidly traversing the sky from south to north across Kansas on July 21, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting began between 22:00-22:10 in Southeast Kansas on July 21, 2008 and lasted approximately 2 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what looked like a star slowly moving northward in the southern sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. The object was the intensity of a moderately bright star and appeared to gain speed as it traversed just west of overhead. When almost directly overhead it dimmed and then briefly lit up more brightly than before, to the point of being the brightest object in the sky. At this point I called for my wife to come out and look and as soon as she stepped out the object dimmed once more, and then briefly intensified before disappearing into the area of the Big Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A commercial jet passed from east to west (slightly north of my vantage point) shortly before the object passed and appeared to be much lower in altitude than the object. The object seemed to zigzag and change speed almost imperceptibly and the entire time gave the impression that it was as far away as a star. It was a white light with no blinking, flashing, or changing colors other than the brief dimming and intensifying described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I am a skeptic when it comes to UFO’s, there is no question in my mind that the object was not a “shooting star” or any kind of military or commercial aircraft and I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I just thought it was an aircraft due to the fact that there was a large blinking red light, which appeared to be in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it drew nearer I thought that there were an extremely large number of lights around the blinking red light which was larger than any light I’ve seen on aircraft that I’ve observed flying over. Then I thought, it’s most likely one of those sky crane helicopters that’s been used in our area lately battling the fires that has ravaged the surrounding mountains to the east. The next thing to go through my mind was do they have whisper mode, because there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these thoughts went through my mind at the same time as I tried to rationalize what I was seeing. Then I ran into my house grabbed my camera ran back outside to see the object make a graceful turn to the right at which time I pointed my camera up and took one picture. Thinking I hadn’t captured anything because it was dark I lowered my camera while watching the object head north, still hearing no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside and told my wife what I had just seen and then I looked at the photo I had taken. To my surprise I had captured a group of twelve lights surrounding the larger red light. Also, due to the fact that it was a longer exposure it had formed trails, with three of the trails making the exact same pattern in the sky, which I noticed after I put it up on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing that I noticed about the red light is, to me it appears to be closer to the left side as it makes its turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea as to what it was whether it was a group of lights in formation or lights fixed on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/21/08 03:18|Kernersville|NC|Changing|18 minutes|Cylinder object morphs to Sphere shape with Amber colored light over Kernersville, NC|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64713.html|175|ndxe200807| Cylinder object morphs to Sphere shape with Amber colored light over Kernersville, NC<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday July 21, 2008 at approx. 3:18am, we (my son Dustin, his friend Casey, and me Keith) were watching some late night movies. Our dog, Rusty, alerted me that he needed to be taken outside. It was a very clear night with no clouds and a very bright moon. We all were amazed at how bright the moon was and how far you could see and make out things that you normally cannot see at that time of morning. Upon opening the front door, I saw a bright Amber colored light in the Southwestern sky. Our house sits down in a small valley with a steep hill directly in front of the house. At the top of our road, which is approx. 150 yards away,lies the main road with a row of houses and then another very large valley around 1000 yards behind them. From our house looking up toward the main road, I noticed that the object was hovering about 200 or so feet above the valley. The valley consists of heavy woods, a large lake and several houses. A majority of the valley is wooded and is not heavily populated. Upon standing at the front door and watching the object, it continued to hover in the same area now for approx. 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued to hover, my son Dustin says he is going to go up to the top of our road for a close look. Once up there, he is overwhelmed by the size of the object and notices that it is Cylinder shaped and the color of gun metal(polished nickle). He notices that the object is much closer to the houses on the main road than we had thought. He also notices that the object is silent, no noise at all and the Amber light stretches the entire length of the object. He also notices that the Amber light is a solid light and though it is very bright, it does night emit a beam out in front of it like a flashlight would or headlights do. What happens next is what really scared him the most. The object, now hovering less that 200 yards from the top of our road changes its shape from Cylinder to Sphere right in front of him. He then takes off running back to the house and literally begs me to shut the door and lock it! While watching it from the front porch, his friend and I had also noticed that it changed shape, but, from our view point, I had thought that the object had just turned instead of changing its shape. Now, instead of us being able to see the light span the entire length of the object, we could only see a small part of the light which made me think that it had turned. But, my sons exact words to me was this: &#34;Dad, it made no noise and was hovering just behind the houses, it changed it&#39;s shape from the cylinder to a sphere and the light is now in the center of the sphere&#34;. &#34;Please dad, shut the door and lock it...Please!&#34;  At this time, I really started writing all of this down because not only had it scared my son, it really made me fear for our safety. His friend at this time had started to cry. I think it was due to just not knowing what it was or feeling threatened. Now, being about 13 minutes the Sphere started to move to the south. We noticed that as it moved to the south, the Amber light now covered the entire object. As it hovered, it slowly began to make a southwestern turn and very slowly began to move away from us. It moved very slowly and the farther it hovered away from us, the smaller the light got. It was completely out of our view/site at appox. 3:36am. We stood on the front porch for several minutes there after and never saw the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as our backgrounds, we are your typical family. I, the dad is a 37 year old male and my son is 14 years old and his friend is 14 years old. We have all been skeptics about the very thing that we witnessed Monday morning. While we do not know what it is that we all witnessed, we would like to know exactly what it was. After talking to my son and his friend, they both stated that they wish not to discuss it. I believe that it scared them as much as it upset me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, the object was about 80ft in length and about 40ft in thickness. It&#39;s color was that of polished nickle or at least that it what color it appeared to be under the brightness of the moon. The object had an Amber colored light that spanned the entire length of the object and was positioned in the center. Once it changed it&#39;s shape from Cylinder to Sphere, the Sphere was now around 60 to 80 ft in diameter and was completely silent. The Amber colored light was now positioned in the center of the Sphere and totally surrounded the Sphere as it hovered southwest and completely out of our view. It was not seen there after. The entire event lasted approx. 18 minutes. The temp. outside was in the upper 80&#39;s and very humid. The moon was very bright and the skies were very clear. A light northern breeze was blowing at the time of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting in the passenger seat and I saw a bright orange glowing light slowly traveling eastbound ahead of us and commented to everyone: &#34;Hey look at that, what is it?&#34;  Just then my friend made a left turn into the subdivision to go home.  I asked him to stop the car so we can all observe the glowing light.  The light was too bright to be an airplane spotlight.  It was also traveling too slowly to be an airplane.  Then I thought what if it&#39;s a helicopter, but I then ruled that out because it looked like it was only about 500-600 feet in the air and I did not hear any sounds that would resemble the sound of a helicopter.  I got out of the car just to see if I could hear anything, but the only thing I heard was an unusual very faint mechanical/electronic sound, but I could not confirm this sound was coming from the object.  It was also too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It slowly passed us and continued heading eastbound in the sky.  It was then out of our view because of the trees.  Again, it looked like a spherical, bright orange glowing light that looked a little hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All estimates of altitude, speed, and size are educated estimates and are believed to be very accurate.  It was completely dark at the time with little to no cloud coverage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large triangle shaped object was sighted above Midland Michigan. The craft appeared over the roof of a two story hotel North West of my position at an altitude of roughly 500 feet.  It was traveling west-to-east about one mile north of my position.  The craft was completely silent and moved very slowly (no more than 20 knots) it suddenly accelerated (easily mach1, probably more like mach 10) and disappeared behind a line of trees to the east.   It accelerated so fast there didn’t seem to be any acceleration period; one moment is was moving very slowly, and then in no more than a quarter-second, it was traveling very fast.  Even as it began to move away very fast, there was no sound or fuel burn at all, no sonic boom, no vapor trail, no exhaust, not even the sound of the displaced air moving about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that on its present course the craft would have violated the class D airspace around MBS Intl. Airport 15 miles to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was a dull black, almost the color of the night sky, but a few shades lighter, more like the black stealth coating on an SR-71 or B-2 military aircraft.  It was easily twice as big as a Boeing 747.  (twice as long and twice as wide)  It did not have any discernable wing structure or control surfaces; it was just a big solid triangle.   I could not identify any windows or a flight deck, but the only portion of the craft that I could see was the belly (which looked flat), and a small bit of the right side of the upper half.  There was no side portion, the top and bottom of the craft simply met each other at an angle.  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, strobe lights, or rotating beacon light on the craft, instead there were three whiteish-blueish lights on the belly of the craft, one at each point on the triangle.  They weren’t bright or dim, more like a glow.  All of the lights were very large, each about the size of the groups of lights at baseball stadiums.  There were much smaller white lights somewhere near the middle of the craft, in a circular pattern documented in the illustration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident only lasted about ten seconds, but is was instantly obvious that this craft was not a civilian aircraft, and it was not a known military aircraft.  It was not using any type of propulsion used in human aircraft since it was completely silent and there were no discernable air-intakes or exhausts.  The extreme acceleration mentioned above would have generated such high g-forces that a human would not only be killed, it would probably be squished against the seat like a bug on a windshield.  Not only was the propulsion system very advanced, the pilots, or their equipment, were able to handle very extreme g-forces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This light at first was just sitting there, then started moving towards the plane getting bigger and brighter as it moved. I thought for sure it was going to hit the plane, but once it got to it it disappeared. How fast it was going and how the light got much bigger and brighter as it moved closer couldn&#39;t have been anything other than a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend at the time looked at me and asked what was wrong because my face expression showed shock and excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It doesn&#39;t sound that intense, but it was amazing to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The main object was redish oringe with two lights on each end but would chang to a sold white line that was the same length.

IT MOVED UP AND THEN DOWN. THE LIGHTS WERE SOLID AND THE MOVEMENT WAS FAST. WE WATCHED WITH OUR NECKED EYES AT FIRST, THEN BOTH OF US WATCHED WITH OUR BINOCULARS.IT WAS COLD, SO WE WENT BACK INSIDE AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE HAD OBSERVED. SINCE MY HUSBAND WAS IN THE AIR FORCE IN THE 60&#39;s and trained to observe planes, as he was a fireman and in the security service.we were looking in the north western sky. The next day we looked at our texas map to see what was out there. It was between  Van Horn and Kent&#39; Texas.We are in the davis, mountains ,so the object had to be high in the sky for us to be able to observe it.<n>

I have recently submitted that sighting on here as well.  It was about 11pm and clear skies.  All the stars were out and our house is right on the Adriatic Sea with a south-west view toward Italy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not even 30 seconds after telling my cousins of a red-orange-white glowing ball my wife and maybe 30 others saw in 2005 in Cuernavaca, Mexico in a clear night sky, I looked up into the sky after hearing all their disbelief and saw the same exact thing.  I had just looked up over a pine tree in the front of our house and nothing was there.  I looked back 5 seconds later and was astonished to see the same thing I saw in Mexico and just had told the sighting details to my cousins.  We were all astounded as to the timing of this event.  It just simply appeared and then slowly faded away over about a 30-second period of time.  It was silent, quite high up in the sky, but couldn&#39;t say exactly how high.  It was over the Adriatic Sea and did not have a reflection on the calm waters.  It didn&#39;t seem to be a star, as it was much larger, brighter and was glowing and changing colors like a disco ball but flashing many many times faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

(We were all sober, no drugs, perfectly normal)  My whole family and I had always been skeptical of UFOs until that night in mid July of 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad saw an orange star hovering high above the army base 10 miles north west of us. He said it was Mars, but Mars was in the opposite side of the sky, and not nearly as orange. The bright orange light over the base started blinking on and off for a minute. Then it made a small circle around the area over the base and stopped where it started. Its movement was swift and seemingly impossible. The orange object glowed brighter and brighter orange and started flashing on and off. It then stopped flashing and shot across the sky at an impossible speed.  It looked like warp speed on star wars. The bright orange light zoomed into space in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I NEEDED TO CONFIRM WITH MY FRIENDS WHAT TIME IT WAS WHEN I CHECKED MY WATCH.  &#34;B&#34; CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS 03:27, NOT 02:27.  OTHERWISE, I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THE SIGHTING WITH HER.  SORRY FOR THE ERROR.  ~Sc&#39;Eric  [State College, PA -- approx. 2008.07.19+03:27]  A hot, muggy night.  I was with 3 friends:  A, B and B&#39;s 14 yr-old nephew E.  We had decided to visit the Penn State golf course to cool off in the sprinklers.  The sprinklers were not running, so we just laid in the grass and looked at the few stars we could see through the haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 02:27, near the zenith, I saw something move that made me do a double-take.  Something about the way it moved was incongruous.  About the same time I said, &#34;Whoa, what was that?&#34;, then B chimed in with something similar.  We lay watching as two white lights (which appeared to be connected) moved from approximatley West to East (left to right, across our field of vision).  We all saw it moving, but I&#39;m not sure how long it took A and E to lock onto it after we pointed it out.  We watched as it traveled eastward (perhaps northeastward) from the zenith toward the constellation of Cassiopaea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the first things we noticed was that there was a light on each end, one leading the other.  This contrasts what most would expect to see: 2 lights moving parallel to one another, as the lights on a winged aircraft.  I recall they were not much larger or different in intensity than the surrounding stars.  I also recall that as they passed over the background of stars, they seemed relatively close to Earth, perhaps within Earth orbit or closer, though I cannot qualify what gives me that impression.  They definitely seem closer than the communications satellites I&#39;ve seen pass over since I was a kid.  I did not think to observe whether any of the background stars were &#34;blotted out&#34; in the space between the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the lights began to change configuration.  B was the first to notice, exclaiming how they appeared to be moving closer together.  I remember commenting that the configuration shift seemed consistent with the notion that the lights were part of a larger craft and that craft was rotating (in an anti-clockwise fashion).  Additionally, the &#34;object&#34; appeared to be rotating in multiple planes--hence the lights moving closer together.  In about the width of 2 fists (held at arms length) the alleged object had rotated a full ninety-degrees and continued doing so as it traversed the sky toward Cassiopaea.  It was at this point that I began realising (out loud) what subconsciously made me focus on the object: the fact that the lights were moving in a way that was completely inconsistent with the likes of traditional aircraft.  (And, in retrospect, I would also like to point out that the haze and general cloud-cover would seem to preclude the notion that we were observing an orbiting satellite, as we could barely see the stars themselves.)  The two lights started out approximately one or two finger-widths apart (at arms-length)--their widest configuration.  I specifically kept looking for, but found no evidence of, a third light-source which may have formed a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object entered the Cassiopaea, I lost it.  B was able to track it about a minute longer before it disappeared into the haze.  In all the entire duration of the observation was about 1 to 1.5 minutes (for me) and about 2 minutes for B and A.  I never thought to ask E about his observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

IT WAS NOT the moon that night. the moon was facing east that night,not west. Afterwards, I waiting watching it,and it started to crack,like for example you were to take an egg and crack the shells,and that&#39;s how it would be disappearing. It then disappeared all together. I waited and waited, an hour later around 1 am (I was full awake) Not sleepy or tired. There was an orange object,that I thought was a planet,it looked closer then the moon is,because it was bigger,and was the same shape as the object before. this time,this object was setting,as if the sun were setting (but I know for sure it was 1 am,and this got me freaked out a bit.

As we passed the sign on the bridge saying &#34;Entering St. Charles County&#34; someone made the comment that the Missouri River looked weird. I looked up ahead and saw three white lights shining in the air just south of the highway up ahead. It appeared to be a large plane that was apparently travelling east on its way to Lambert airfield to land. It seemed to have one light on each end of its wing and one on the nose of the aircraft. Although I couldn&#39;t actually see the aircraft in the dark, the lights seemed unusually bright or powerful. For some reason I tried to get a rise out of the boys sitting in the backseat and I inexplicibly blurted out, &#34;If you think that&#39;s weird, look at those lights up ahead. It&#39;s a UFO!&#34; Immediately everyone yelled, &#34;Where?&#34; Then I told them I was only kidding, it was just a plane on its way to Lambert. As I said this I kept watching the object to see how big of a jet it really was because it seemed to be moving very slowly. The neighbor boy asked if those lights were on a lightstand because they weren&#39;t moving. I told him no, it was too high in the air for that but then I realized he was right: it wasn&#39;t moving.  The only reason the lights appeared to be moving was because we were approaching the object. As we came off the bridge, the object was absolutely motionless and appeared to be triangle shaped because the three lights were now marking the outline of a triangle. I would guess it was at the most about 500ft in the air. As we passed next to it (below it to the right of it), I kept glancing up at it and now! what I saw were a total of 6 white lights (the three marking the outline and three more at the midpoints) and one red light in the middle. The lights were not as powerful as we passed the object and none were blinking and somehow the object didn&#39;t look as big as it did when we were on the bridge. I started shouting, &#34;it IS a UFO!&#34; I wanted to pull over, but I was in the passing lane and couldn&#39;t get over to the exit. Amazingly all the cars were just driving by like everything was normal. Looking back though, it WAS very subtle and could have been easily missed. The object was absolutely still. No lights were blinking. It looked like headlights from a large plane and if I wouldn&#39;t have kept watching it after I made my UFO joke I would have missed it too. Everyone in the car saw the same thing, a black triangle outlined by three white lights and a red light in the middle. I was the only one who saw the three additional lights at the midpoints. The neighbor boy also saw only one of the &#34;midpoint&#34; lights. My youngest son thought there was a slight indentation in the rear of the craft. I didn&#39;t see this. It looked like a perfect equilateral triangle to me. That&#39;s the one thought that kept racing through my mind was how perfect a triangle it seemed to be. As we passed at the closest point, I could actually see some depth or height to the object too but it was essentially very flat. My oldest son tried to take a picture of it with his cellphone out of the rear window, but the headlights from the approaching cars behind us prevented him from finding it in his viewfinder.<n>

It was low in the sky and passed very close to us and we could not identify it as normal. The object moved moderately fast in a straight path into the night sky until it was out of sight. It made no noise. It appeared that the object had flames inside the orb and was glowing. The object was in our field of view for 10-12 minutes. My wife and I both felt that our eyes hurt after viewing this object. There was a full moon on this night. I reported the sighting the following day to the Cape May police department. They claimed that no one else had called in. We were unable to video.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A very bright and constant light, like a white-hot ball, slowly moved through the night skies.  It made its way north, from over lake Superior, and slowly arced northeast in direction.  At one point, it seemed to slow a bit and then gradually and effortlessly gained speed.  There was no sound and I made notice of the object to another person walking by.  The person thought it must be just a plane, but there were no normal signs of it being any kind of plane, helicopter, or ultra-light vehicle... such as; wing tip lights of green or red, no under belly light, no tail light and no sound.  This was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have known “man-made” aircraft/planes since I was a child.  My family was a member of EAA and we went to the EAA Fly-in in Oshkosh, WI every summer for 18years.  Also, my father built and owned an ultra-light aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was low enough that I would have heard a sound if it was a plane of any kind or a helicopter of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Low enough that I could tell if it had the red and green blinking light or any other color blinking lights like our aircrafts have. Not low enough for me to tell what kind of craft it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flowed smooth like, looking like it was coming down for landing then it went back up following the curve of the earth with the same speed, nice and smooth...then it just kept going up until the big bright bulb was a little red dot, then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low enough all so that I could make out if it was a satilite, I&#39;ve never heard of a satilite orbiting low like what this bulb of light did. No sound, smooth the way the flight pattern was...couldn&#39;t go running in to get my camera to take a picture, could have been gone by the time I came back out is what I was thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I just enjoyed what I was seeing, beeing around aircrafts...I knew that what I was looking at...or not what I was looking at.<n>

At the first sight I thought it&#39;s just a lighted kite but after a while I seen that one of the objects disappeared and the other one stopped in the skye in the altitiud under 2KMs. It was compeletly silent and had no identific sound, when it stopped I discovered that IT&#39;S NOT A KITE because there were no wind on that night and if it was a kite and it used the and there were wind on that altitude it should move a slowly and even it was to high to be a kite. After that I brought my telescope and digital camera to take a shot from this object and look at it in a closer view. First I looked on my telescope and I saw that it&#39;s a V-shaped objects with 9 colored lights which I can&#39;t see the body of this object becuase it&#39;s too bright. The color of lights was Blue, Orange, Green and Red and they was blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set up my digital camera with tripod and took some shots from this object with 15x optical zoom (5 MPxl of resoloution) and I also took an IR shot of it to check weather it use Jet engine or not but I saw nothing as a heat based engine in my IR photo! The sky was absoloutly clear and there were full-moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2nd object which I took a shot of it stoped for about 20 mins in the sky and started to move to north-east and it suddenly disapeared. It&#39;s movement was not too fast and wasn&#39;t too slow either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this object again on the next night on July 19 but just for the short time and it disappeared quickly and I lost to take any shots again on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After then I started to take a video from that object in a normal and IR mode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a plan to upload this fully-detailed video to Youtube for public view!  After that night I searched the internet for the same evidences and I found the same thing which have sighted in Tokyo in 2006:  http://www.ufodigest.com/news/1006/tokyoufo.html  I searched again and I found that in 1976, two Iranian Airforce pilots and the tower chief of Mehrabad Airport and many of the Tehran citizens experienced the thing which is partly similar to what I saw that night. Gen. Parviz Javari, was the direct witness and the 2nd pilot who tried to distroy that object but the weapon and control tools of his fighter jet (F4-E) was disabled after trying to target that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the Youtube video for Gen. Jafari&#39;s interview and documentary movie from History Channel:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYGhZ2X0I0  I am trying to find the contact details of Gen. Parviz Jafari even his email to contact him and share the evidences and photos with him to find out what is this thing. But I didn&#39;t find him yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please if you have any contact details of Gen. Parviz Jafari who is now living outside of Iran (I think in the US), contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can just share my evidences to Gen. Jafari because he is the only person who can belive me on this and help me to findout more.<n>

Seen through the binoculars I saw two lights but one object. I did not see a distinct shape. There was no sound, no flashing lights. My husband says it was sort of oval, but he saw it through the binoculars while it was closer than when I saw it. Just about 30 seconds after the object went over the town of Hancock there was a jet flying much much higher and in a south westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving in Southwest Waterloo. To be exact, I was heading North on Ansborough Avenue, in between West 4th street and Highway 63, and I looked to my right, where I saw the object hovering high in the sky.  It was somewhat orange and yellow, and it seemed to glow. I cannot discern a particular shape. It did not seem to be traveling in any direction at all; rather hovering. It seemed to be very high in the sky, but much lower than an airplane.  I was unable to gaze at the object for a continuous amount of time, as I was driving my car, but I viewed the object in several short gazes. I saw the object, and then returned my eyes to the road. I looked at the object again, and then returned my eyes to the road. I did this again. After the third time I returned my eyes to the road, I looked to the sky again, and the object was gone. I did not see any sort of trail left by the object. The entire experience lasted about ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The object stayed behind (about 1 mile) and to the right or south of the airliner.  The object was so bright, that after the airliner disappeared in the horizon, the object could still be seen.  I have seen this same object in 1960, 1984 and now in 2008.  The previous objects made a low humming sound as they passed overhead.  This object did not pass overhead, it was to the south of my position, and so I don&#39;t know if it made the same sound or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we watched it travel almost directly overhead toward the East-to-NorthEast direction, we both noticed very clearly that there were no navigation or strobe lights on it as are always on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky conditions: It is a very clear night tonight but with considerable light pollution in our area so very few stars are visible. The moon is only about 10-15 degrees above the horizon in the South-Southeast, and above and to the right of that is a bright star which may be Saturn (we&#39;re not astronomers, but a neighbor had been talking about viewing it with his telescope and it seems to be about in the right direction and time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would estimate the brightness of the light to be approximately 2-3 times greater than that of Saturn (or whatever that brightest star is in the S-SE) with a great deal of &#34;clarity&#34; and precision to the light, a very bright, pinpoint-like light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it very well could be a satellite or the ISS or something else, we felt it worth mentioning here because of two primary reasons:  1)  Complete lack of normal NAV lights or beacons per a standard aircraft configuration.  Only a very bright light, and we noted as it traveled away from us that they also couldn&#39;t be landing lights, since it was as bright going away from us as it was overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  Apparent speed:  Altitude is almost impossible to guess at here since there was nothing to give away the size...again, it could have been at a normal-high altitude (10K ft. or higher) or in low orbit like a satellite or the ISS.  The only clue to altitude was any sound, and there was none, which gave the impression of a very high altitude (20-30K minimum).  With that altitude, the speed just simply didn&#39;t seem right; it was traveling at least twice, if not three times, as fast as any comparable commercial jet that we normally see at that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since these two things made it very unusual, we watched it travel the complete distance almost to the low horizon in the distance before it was out of sight.  That took only about 2 to 3 minutes maximum - again, much quicker than the usual commercial or military jet.  It did not change course at any time, altitude did not seem to vary either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;re mentioning it here primarily for the interest of correlating it with any other sightings tat may coincide, or to see if possibly the ISS or a satellite is the reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background:  Wife and I don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t do any recreational drugs, not &#34;UFO-holics&#34;, married 18 wonderful years, in our late-40&#39;s / early 50&#39;s, wear corrective lenses (glasses for her, contact lenses for me), no regular medications and in good physical and mental health (knock on wood), she is a lab technician and I am an engineer with a lifelong interest in aviation and a few hours towards my private pilot&#39;s license, essentially a wanna-be pilot and &#34;airplane geek&#34;, so have a very fair degree of experience in observing and identifying a very large number of aircraft at different altitudes, positions, and sky/weather conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My girlfriend’s son (13 yrs. old) and I (44 yrs. old) were facing northeast, talking. Our friend (35 yrs. old) was in the pool, facing northeast, talking to my girlfriend who was facing the rest of us, southwest.  It was about 9:30pm or 10pm.  This was July 18th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriends son and I were facing my girlfriend and our other friend who were in the pool.  The pool is surrounded by condos and palm trees.  As we were all talking, I saw a neon glowing, oblong object &#34;fall&#34; from about 500 feet or less at a 45 degree angle, right over the building and palm trees, from right to left. The object was about 50 yards away from us. It disappeared behind the building.  Two of the others saw the same thing, except for them, it started out as a red object that turned green.  I thought I saw yellow inside the green and a black dot inside the yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing is, there wasn’t a trail behind this object and it didn’t make any noise coming down and didn’t seem to crash into anything.  The size was very hard to determine.  It could have been the size of a basketball or it could have been the size of a small car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing went up in the sky, like a flare. No sound was heard from it. No sparks.  Just a closed looped, oblong shaped, red, then green/yellow/black object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren’t drinking or anything else. No missile testing. Three of us saw it.  I’ve never seen a “u.f.o.” before, neither had the others.<n>

My husband could not see it but as I watched it and told him about it, it seemed to light up with fire just like a balloon and basket save there wasn&#39;t a basket and it would have been far too high for one. It was red then firey then red but it kept traveling at the same velocity.  I didn&#39;t watch it until I could no longer see it but later that evening, a few hours after, I saw it again and this time it criscrossed itself going from the south to the north..... very interesting!! Still as slow but sure making it&#39;s way somewhere. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. It wasn&#39;t a weather balloon because we both have seen one twice crossing our yard and it was quite low so that we were able to see exactly what that was! What do you think it was?

The plane was flying east along a common route. I noticed just above the craft, maybe a few thousand feet or so an orange oval object. The object did not change color or shape, and was flying slower than the airliner. I quickly looked around to see if it&#39;s a reflection. The sun had already set, and it was still too bright for satellites to be visible. I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotography, I often track satellites. I continued to watch the object till it was too far away to see. The brightness and color remained the same the entire time. The orange color was similar to maybe an afterburner flame from a fighter jet, or from a rocket engine. The size and shape when I first saw it was similar to an oval pill held at arms length. It was moving too slow to be a fireball, and with its consistent speed and shape there is no way it could have been something burning up. My other thought was it being a balloon or a blimp, but again, it was too steady and seemed to be moving faster than I&#39;ve seen any blimp go. The shape was very smooth, nothing coming off the sides or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The plane was leaving a trail of white exhaust behind it.  I kept my eyes on the point of the plume, hoping to get a good view of the plane, when I noticed a larger grey disc travelling in front of the jet. It looked as if it was slowing down and speeding up in front of the jet.  Then I noticed it began to pull away from the jet, then seemed to just disappear. Then all I saw was the jet and the trail of exhaust.  It was unbelievable...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both watched as this black thing just hovered across the sky at the same speed for at least 5 minutes before the object started rising very slowly.  We knew it wasn&#39;t a bird because nothing on it moved..no wings or anything.  We watched this thing for at least 15 minutes before it went so high in the sky that it just disappeared.  There were other airplanes flying around it so it could of just been some sort of illusion but my roommate, who is a former marine, was definitely kinda freaked out because it just seemed so odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

He said it looked like a plane with its landing lights on, but they seemed to be to close to be a plane. Also, as he rounded a corner the object was gone. He did stop and take a picture of it with his cell phone, this picture he sent to me. The light is a made up of two parallel lines going cross ways, the top line (in the photo) is about two times the size of the bottom one. He said that the lights were orbish until the photo when the orbs blurred into a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/18/08 03:15|Albuquerque|NM|Light|15 minutes|When first sighting the light it was moving unusually fast and changed course after a few minutes and then conducted erratic movements.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64628.html|228|ndxe200807| When first sighting the light it was moving unusually fast and changed course after a few minutes and then conducted erratic movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up a 02:19 and made myself a cup of coffee and sat outside on the front patio enjoying the peace and quiet.  From the patio which faces east I have a 180 degrees view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 03:15 I was looking to the north and noticed a dull yellow/orange light moving from west to east across the Rio Puerco valley.  I estimated that the aircraft/light was 6 to 8 miles away and moving much faster than the normal aircraft on  approach to Albuquerque International Airport which is nearly due east 19.5 miles to the control tower.  I am guessing that the altitude was 5000 AGL.  This is only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object with the naked eye until it entered a low thin cloud.  I was curious about the fast moving light so I got up out of my chair and search for the object.  After a minute or so the object appeared out of the top of the cloud.  At this point the light began to flash a very bright red and white strobe.  The object headed west again and seemed to trace it&#39;s path back.  I went into the house and got my 8x35 filed glasses and video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned outside and followed the light with the field glasses. Then the light began to jump around.  Up and down and left to right.  At first I thought I might be moving the field glasses.  There was a large star in the northeast that was in the field of view and it was not moving, so it was the object that was jumping around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the north patio to follow the light&#39;s westerly track. The light moved across the Rio Puerco valley at a rapid pace, but not beyond current F16 military aircraft capabilities which operate out of Kirkland Airbase (ABQ International).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I tried to video the light, but the battery was dead.  The valley is approximately 5 miles wide where the light made its westerly track and it took approximately 5 minutes to cross the valley.  As the object crossed over the Rio Puerco River it began to jump around again.  The erratic movements covered the entire field of view of my field glasses.  Again I tried to make sure I wasn&#39;t moving the field glasses, but there were no stars visible in the west, northwest because of a slight cloud cover and the brightness of the moon high in the south, southwest, but I did use the edge of the western horizon as a reference point when possible.  Same results the light was jumping around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the period of erratic movements the object was flashing a red and white strobe light similar to conventional aircraft.  I followed the light/object for several more minutes as it seemed to pass over the north lava fields of Mt Taylor.  At this point it was not moving oddly, but the red and white strobes continued and I returned into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature was approximately 70 degrees and there were clusters of thin clouds.  Visibility was very good.  Humidity was high for the Rio Puerco valley.  A near full moon was high in the Southwest.  Winds were from the north at 1 to 2 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former general aviation pilot and currently fly microlight aircraft (powered paramotors) and I trained pilots to fly powered paramotors for 9 years.  I retired from training in 2007.  I was an certified EAA instructor.<n>

It is very small in the night sky but I don&#39;t believe it to be a plane, satellite, or helicopter since it is so stationary If the movement is just an optical illusion, then it could be a planet, but it is emitting quite a lot of light because I can see it right next to the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the strictest definition, it is a UFO in that I cannot identify this flying object, so it is either an air or space craft, a planet, or a nova, but it does shift from yellow to red periodically and sometimes appears both.  No other stars are visible in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/17/08 23:15|Urbandale|IA|Unknown|30 seconds|Five Intense Beams of Light|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64670.html|230|ndxe200807| Five Intense Beams of Light<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some lightning still in the area following a storm two hours earlier. Shortly after 11:00 p.m., I heard a deep buzzing sound outside similar to the noise a faulty electrical transformer makes. I looked to the west which would have been the northwest corner of 156th and Meredith St. in the northwest corner of Urbandale, a western suburb of Des Moines, IA. Each time a heard a buzzing, the western sky lit up. Thinking it was a transformer, I wasn’t alarmed. I kept watching but was then startled to see five intensely bright blue-white beams of lights shooting up from the ground into the air to form a fan of about five degrees in span. The lights were fixed relative to each. The lights went out, then back on again. Then the whole light array fanned to the south and disappeared. When I looked to the south, I saw a faint orange glow as if a tree was on fire, but then that glow faded. There was no further sound. Inspection of the area from the car the next day revealed no transformers in the area. The farmer’s field showed no visible signs of disturbance from the road. The electricity went out the next day for about two hours. We were told there had been a &#34;public accident&#34; that had caused an electrical failure. A neighbor witnessed the bright lights through the trees, but did not see the beams from her vantage point.<n>

No visible solid object could be seen between them.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64634.html|231|ndxe200807| Two lights flashing back and forth, moving in unison across the sky. No visible solid object could be seen between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw two reddish-white lights about 30deg. above horizon moving together in the same direction, from south to north. The lights were flashing in an alternating pattern in rhythm back and forth, one in the front then one in the back, in the direction of movement. The distance between the lights, well over the length of a football field, suggest the aircraft was close by, but was unable to see the body of craft due to ground lights and there were no sounds of planes nearby. There were no other lights in the vicinity of the object besides the two flashing back and forth in unison. At first I thought the flashing lights were from extremely tall transmitter towers halfway across town, but since they were moving slowly from south to north in unison it couldn&#39;t have been those.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Please suggest explanations.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64621.html|233|ndxe200807| Possible UFO´s seen over Dresden, Germany, no unusual flight paths or speed. Please suggest explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention.  A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion.  I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me.  Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief.  We´re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them.  They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear.  The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another.  It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> [edit - i´m sorry it was just today in july, not june.]<n>

7/17/08 20:37|Shanghai, Pudong New District (PRC)||Triangle|29 minutes|"V" Shaped object with multi color lights over Shanghai PuDong sky.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64602.html|236|ndxe200807| &#34;V&#34; Shaped object with multi color lights over Shanghai PuDong sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 17, 2008 between 2052 and 2106, I captured 47 images on my digital.  These images were in what I believe is the east sky of Shanghai, Pudong New District, PRC.  The time stamps on the images are 2152 to 2206 hours because my camera had been set to a different time than where I was taking the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2035 hours on Thursday July 17, 2008, I was in the study of my apartment where I frequently go to view the beauty of the buildings in Shanghai Pudong.  Within a couple of minutes I noticed what appeared to be slow a reddish color light from my vantage point about 40 degrees up from my position.  My first reaction was do to nothing, but after a couple of minutes of city gazing, the light was in approximately in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to my desk to get my binoculars (power of 15 X  60 X 63) and see if I could get a better view.  To my surprise the view was very clear.  I saw an array of lights that formed a “V” shape.  The color of lights ranged between reds, blues, purples, greens, and at time some yellow.  They were flashing randomly and they were randomly changing colors.  In my estimate there were about six to ten lights on each side of the apex of the V.   This “object” for lack of a better term seemed to hover, and every once in a while made almost floating moves, certainly not “darting”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of watching in amazement, because I am not a particular believer of UFO’s, (but I had never seen anything like this) I considered getting out my camera.  However I thought that it may not get a good shot and/or the object may disappear.  When I finally decided to get my digital camera (Nikon D80)  it took about a minute or so to change to my telephoto lens (80 X 300).  I have not used the camera too often in the manual mode, but I knew that if I left in automatic mode, that the flash would be used and I did not want it because I was inside looking through a window.  So, I switched the camera to manual mode with auto focus enabled.  In the beginning I could not see the object, so I first focused on a building within my site then directed my lens back to the object in the air.  I actually took three shots (two which captured nothing and one of the spire from the building I focused on, before I auto focused to the spire).  On my fourth attempt I was able to capture the object.  I believe that I set the camera to manual focus before my fourth shot, but it may have been auto focus, because at some point in time, I changed the focus mode (on my 28th shot).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of 13 minutes I clicked every so often.  However, I was holding the camera in my hand, leaning on the window frame and doing whatever I could do to keep it steady.  I am not sure that the F stop setting was, but I can obtain that because I have not changed it.  At one point in time I actually changed the camera to a second manual setting which took a longer exposure.  I finally decided to get my monopod and set the camera on it so I could have a bit more stability, however by the time I set my monopod up (within a minute or so), the object started moving towards the south and then further east.  I continued to shoot until the object was no longer within my sight.  As of 2157 hours, at the point when I am writing this sentence, the object has not reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I state above, I am not a UFO believer, however I did see something, and I did capture some very interesting digital images.  As soon as the object had disappeared I opened my Web browser and searched for a web site to report this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Images available on request.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft at fist had a ring of lights that went around it in a counter-clockwise pattern, starting with a bright white light and getting dimmer behind it for about 5 lights. The ring was made up of approximately 12 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft had gone about a quarter mile past us, it had changed into a triangle shaped craft and went on in a strait line not curving over the horizon. The triangle consisted of 5 lights with a blinking red light in the center. It went behind a tree and we backed up to see and it was still continuing in a strait line. Then, it had disappeared for about 5 seconds; the lights flashed brightly and split up, flew in slightly different directions, but all commonly exited the atmosphere and went out of sight. It the entire time had never curved down with the earth over the horizon, just gone strait out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The friend who owned the cabin had gone to sleep earlier. so it was me and one other male. While having a conversation, exchanging stories, i had looked up into the sky and saw something unusual. at first i didn&#39;t want to look crazy to my friend so i didn&#39;t say anything for a bit until i new for sure it was something &#39;different.&#39; After finally deciding to point it out to my friend we whatched it then do the following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was three dots, the same dimensions as the stars that were out that night, which were plentiful and bright since caseville, is in a small town with low light pollution. the three star-like dots moved across the sky faster than anyother plane i had ever seen before. they were in the formation of a isoscelese triangle, so originally we had thought it to be one object. this triangle actually crossed over, and turned out to be of the same length as orions belt. the star-like dot that was not adjacent to any other then proceeded to take off into a curved arch, the path was in the shape of a quarter of a circle, it then vanished, completely. the two in lead that were adjacent to one another then began to start almost convulsing back and forth, getting closer and further to one another rapidly and then too vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing this we kept whatch on the sky and later saw an airplane, and a sattelite. neither of which had anything similar to which we saw.<n>

The object seemed to be saucer like. I told my girlfriend to come outside to see if I was imagining it. She saw it right away and then noticed two more below it and to the right. The lights on the saucers would randomly flash, the saucers don’t move much they just hover. We then went inside and looked outside our patio door and noticed one more.  The fourth saucer we noticed has more of a faint glow and the other three seem to have lights that move around the saucer.Around 2:45 the thrid saucer emitted a beam of light under it.Around the same time the lights on the first saucer started flashing multi-colored lights. I walked back to the window and two of the saucers were gone. We fell asleep at 4:00 and they were still there. Neither of us ever believed in UFO&#39;s up until tonight so this is pretty crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I saw was a bluegreen flash and then it rained down in a burst as if a firework had exploded and was dropping to the ground.  My first reaction was that it was a firework maybe someone shooting off a late 4th of july shot.  But then I said to myself look how high that debree is falling from.  There was no firework ever shot that high up.  It appeared to come down somewhere to the west of Caddo Mills north of IH-30.  I had just dropped off my car pool buddy 2 miles prior to the event.  The next day at work I waited to see if he saw anything.  Sure enough he spoke 1st stating exactly what I saw, so I know it was no just seeing things.  I remember just watching the burst rain down, it was like straight down with little angle at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We felt that it was unusual enough to report, and we also hoped to learn of anyone else who may have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granite Rock is a rock formation found on the shore of the Clearwater River.  The moon was full and very bright, but many stars were very visible being so far from city lights.  Hills surrounding the area created an echo effect.  We heard the usual sounds like crickets, bats, and fish splashing in the water, but it was otherwise very quiet.  We were leaning back in our chairs looking at the stars when we began to hear something that didn’t sound as if it belonged way out there.  It was a low pitched mechanical humming or buzzing that emitted different tones.  The sounds were faint but easily audible.  We wondered about it, but didn’t think it strange enough to dwell on, because it stopped a few minutes after it began.  Several minutes went by, when we were startled by what appeared to be stars in motion.  We were looking in different parts of the sky.  One of us saw two stars that aligned vertically and of similar brightness. The lower of the two stars slowly descended behind the horizon of the hills.  Flashing lights were just visible beyond the hill the object went behind.  They appeared to be distant, not just over the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, the other of us saw what appeared at first to be a very twinkly bright star, but it began to move in erratic patterns.  The twinkling seemed to be coming from a bar of alternately flashing red, green and white lights.  We both alerted the other to what we were seeing.  We resisted the impulse to cut and run, as our curiosity was stronger than our fear.  We looked all around then and saw a lot of other activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other “stars” that looked like and were behaving in the same way as the moving, flashing object.  They seemed to be spinning and tilting as they would go slowly to one direction, maybe suddenly freefall then move quickly in another direction.  They were moving in loops and straight lines, back and forth, hovering, moving up and down, but never straying outside of their immediate area.  They appeared to be different distances away as some appeared fainter and smaller or larger and brighter, easier to see and more visibly detailed.  One or two of the closer ones seemed to have moving shadows just behind the lights.  The shadows changed shape, as if when it moved in different angles it would appear to have different shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept an eye on the horizon over which the other “star” descended.   The object dipped behind the hill and glowed blue and white and then reappeared without the flashing lights and left a dimmer silhouette which glowed green.  It then glided very quickly away from us still glowing green.  We looked away to watch some of the other flashing objects,  and once when we looked back at it, it was flashing blue and white lights above the horizon, dipped behind again and reappeared in the distance with the green glow again.  It remained there, dim but visible floating back and forth just over the horizon.  It didn’t move like the other objects.  It just floated slowly and steadily back and forth and up and down just above the horizon in the glow.  We noticed at one point that it had risen back up almost to the level of the star that it was below initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted here that the moon and identifiable planets and constellations were also clearly visible.  They were stationary in contrast to the moving objects.  Over the 2 ½ hours that we watched, the moon and stars moved across the sky as they should, slowly and steadily, but the flashing objects never moved out of their initial territories and never stopped moving within them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tested each other to see if we were seeing the same things.  One of us would describe the different movements of the objects (for example: “It’s moving left, left, up, left, real quick to the right….”), and we would find that we were indeed seeing the same movements.  We also made it a point to stop often and rest our eyes and walk around to avoid eyestrain “hallucinations”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before all the action, we had opportunity to see an airplane fly over, so we had that image to compare to the flashing objects.  They did not look like airplanes.  They did not move like helicopters or like anything else we could know about.  We observed them for quite a long time, but left while they were still there, and that was at 1:30 am.<n>

From the second floor deck the previous night we had identified the Cape Lookout Light House which was just on the horizon at about the 9:30 position from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night of July 16 was brilliantly clear, full moon rising over the Ocean. There were 4 of us again relaxing on the deck when approx. 10:00 pm I observed a point of light, orange in color at about the 10:00 position up a few degrees up from the horizon. The light was slightly brighter than the lighthouse beacon. The light lasted only a few seconds and then diminished, then over the next minute or so there were three more lights in the same general location, again one at a time and short duration. I witnessed the first 3 and the others only caught the last one. The event certainly had our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were discussing what we had just seen the sequence started again, same general location and this time 5 or 6 lights, again one at a time over a few minutes duration. There was no visible motion to any of the lights just appearing and the quickly diminishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only plausible conclusion I can think of we were near the Marine Airbase off Cherry Point NC and what we saw was the afterburner glow from departing aircraft.<n>

This is when I noticed that there were 3 crafts which were jet black in colour with a green, red, yellow and blue flashing light on the underside of the craft. It was shaped like a semi circle with a flat bottom. after about 5 minuets the crafts shot of again into the distance at very high speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

7/16/08 20:45|Gulf Breeze|FL|Triangle|3 minutes|Triangular shape object with five white light in a triangular formation beneath object structure.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64614.html|250|ndxe200807| Triangular shape object with five white light in a triangular formation beneath object structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something odd was flying around in the Gulf Breeze area. On June 26, 2008, I noticed a somewhat bright, solid, reddish light stationary in the sky that was probably 500 yards off the ground. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes never moving or doing anything else. Earlier that evening, there was some helicopters flying around, and they never stopped and hover in one position. I suspected the solid red light might be a helicopter, but I never heard any noise coming from it. I estimate the distance the object was from me about half a mile and located North-East in direction. I had a camera in my car and I went to get it. That took about five minutes. When I tried to locate the object in the sky, I could find it. The event took place around 9:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, my friend and I went fishing again at Bob’s site bridge. I didn’t think to bring the camera with me. Again, I saw the red light around 9:00PM situated in the same area in the sky at the same height and direction. I hurried to my car again which took at least five minutes. Again I couldn’t locate the object which appeared to be stationary in the sky for at least two minutes before I left to get the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 16, 2008, my friend and I went fishing at Bob’s sites. This time I had my camera with me. We fished on the pier instead of the bridge.  There was lots of people fishing which is unusual for a Wednesday.  The sky was clear and the almost full moon was rising . I was facing North and it was about 8:45PM when I noticed an object coming from the North. I watched the object as it made a turn to the North-East.  It wasn’t a passenger jet.  As the object made the turn like a jet, I clearly saw for a brief moment the shape of the object. It was triangular in shape like a B-2 stealth bomber. I also saw five separate white lights in a triangular formation beneath the wing-like structure which also appeared to be part of the craft structure.  After that moment, I got my camera out. The object was now heading North-East. I could only see two separate light orange/red in color and fading slowly.  I put the camera in available light mode and zoomed in at max, but I couldn’t see the object in the viewer.  I took two pictures anyways hoping that maybe I get something. After downloading the pictures onto my computer, I was not able to see the object or lights.  It might had been a military jet, but that is the fist time I saw a triangular shape object flying around in the area of Gulf Breeze, and I lived near this area practically my whole life.  There was no strobe lights, red lights, or green lights on the object.  Nothing to indicate that it was a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/16/08 05:30|Phelan|CA|Circle|10 minutes|Red flashing lights and phantom dogs|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64619.html|252|ndxe200807| Red flashing lights and phantom dogs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do believe that strange phenomenon exists around us, but I have never experienced anything like this before, personally. I would like to think that this is just some crazy hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 6 cats, two dogs, and live in a rural area. Our property is 1-1/4 acre deep. We live in a desert area and have some natural growth (sage, yucca, Joshua trees, etc) along one back corner of our yard. We left it for privacy reasons. There is an electrical pole in that particular corner, as well, but situated in the lot behind us. The lot behind us has no home on it. It’s one of the few vacant lots in our neighborhood, and is full of natural growth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed up late the night before last. Yesterday morning I woke up at 5:15 am to my favorite bunk buddy (cat) digging at my face. He does this on occasion and it is usually an annoyance that lasts for a few seconds, until I get him to lie down, so that I can resume sleep. Yesterday morning he kept doing this nonstop until I finally just decided to get up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out to my kitchen, fixed a cup of coffee and lit a cigarette. It is on rare occasion that I get up this early, as I am not a morning person, I like to go outside and take in the morning sunrise. Something about sunrise is just so peaceful to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, yesterday morning was just kind of eerie, I felt a slight headache coming on, as I started to head out the front door, but then decided to go out into my courtyard instead. I have a table and chairs out there where I can sit.  The sky was kind of eerie, without any sunshine. It was more like an overcast morning, but without the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood, looking at the back of my yard I saw some bright red flashing lights in the back corner of my yard, lots of them covering about a six sq. foot area, through the overgrowth and underbrush. I thought perhaps it’s a fire truck or something, or an ambulance. But what would an ambulance or fire truck be doing in a vacant property. I started walking toward the back of the property to the lights. He lights were obviously on the outside of my fence, by an electrical pole. I started thinking maybe someone is getting ready to do some electrical work, but why 5:30 in the morning? The closer I got (My property runs deep.) the more I could hear rustling in the bushes. Then I saw my two dogs, one was running back and forth along the back fence sniffing, but not barking. The other dog was sniffing around outside the bushes. I yelled for both of them and neither of them acknowledged my call. They never even looked at me. This was very much out of character for both of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frantically started yelling for them, as they suddenly got interested in what was going on behind the bushes. I didn’t want them trailing in because I had no idea what or who was rustling in the bushes. Both dogs headed into the bushes right away. My two dogs running up behind me, from the front of the property, smiling, tails wagging as usual distracted my attention. I looked back in front of me and everything disappeared, as though nothing was there. No red lights, no dogs on my side of the fence, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if anyone else has had an experience like this before, but I would sure like to know about it. I know that I am a sane human being. I know that I was not dreaming. Incidentally my headache lasted almost all day long. I don’t drink, and do not do drugs. If anyone else has had anything like this happen, please list it because this is really bugging me. I was never afraid during the episode; except for thinking my dogs were about to get involved with something or someone in the bushes. Afterwards, I was a little confused, and reluctant to tell even my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was making absolutely no noise and looked like it was about the size of a medium sized aircraft.  The aircraft had white markings on it and was dark looking, or else it was clear and I was seeing through it....It had only two lights on the back of the aircraft, and when it sensed me looking at it, it flew upwards into the clouds and dissappeared.  I hesitated to file this report as I have filed one earlier in the year.....I have also noticed small &#34;V&#34; formations in the sky, at times,  up at around 500 feet,  that have lights on them (3 or 4). Sometimes they move but most of the times they stay still....When I do happen to see them, I always see two and have seen them on two or three occassions, all in the middle of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And they were hard to see because they blended into the cloudy night.They were making strange movements, like one came up close to the window, and when it came too close, it seemed to fade away or dissappear.One by one, the crafts flew up above the window and soon they were gone. But when I woke up the next morning, I saw 747s or jets out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever I saw remains a mystery.  Those crafts were very, very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was hunting for either moose or elk. I had decided to camp with my stepson who was nine years old at the time and expect to be up very early to start walking towards the salt lick in the morning. We were getiing ready to sleep in the truck and started covering up with a blanket, light up a candle and have a somewhat uneventful sleep. Thats when my stepson noticed some lights in the sky. I quickly shut off the candle and started to move around to get a clearer view. I did not hear any noise and just started to watch very closely at what the lights might do. the lights were about 5 to 800 yards away and were slightly obscured by some brush. Seeing the lights were as clear as ever. I watched as the lights alternated colors and at the same time were alternating the amount of lights that were on. No more than five lights were on at one time and they were arranged! in a perfect pentagonal shape on the egde of a circle. The amounts of lights that were on were randomly changing and so were the colors. The craft made no noise and kept moving from the left to right and down then up and to the left then repeated the movement at a steady pace the whole time while observing it. The event lasted for at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty. At the end the lights just simply shut off and there was no more sign of any thing in the sky any longer. I think back on the event and recall it just like it was yesterday. I can point to a location on a map and know that I was looking directly south. I can say that I was pretty scared and decided to strap my hunting knife back to my belt and load my gun. I was prepared to fight just in case something scary did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a UFO very high in the sky going very fast.  The UFO was going in a straight line across  Coeur d’ Alene,Idaho.  The direction the UFO was traveling was going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I saw was one very large bright light, the light was as strong as a  halogen light, no noise coming from the UFO.  The bright light was the shape of a perfect shape of a oval.  The size of the UFO was about the size of the moon in length.  I just turned on Kathleen Ave, off Atlas St. when I noticed the strange bright light in the sky, I said   [wow, 123456 very fast]  it was gone.  I called the Spokesman Review, nothing.  I called Kootenai Airport, they have no tracking device, it’s just a runway with a building on it. I called the nearest Federal Aviation  Center which is in Spokane, Wash.  I talked to a man named John Philips, he asked me what was going on and what time and I told him.  Mr. Philips said nothing was showing.  His reply was, he wish he had seen it.  So now I leave it up to you what you want to believe, I know what I saw.   I now look up to the sky to see what is out their.  I know my god made this world, why can&#39;t he make many more.  But the other question I have is, why so many UFO’s  goes south? ….<n>

They moved in a Northwest to Southeast direction. They made no sound and I saw no smoke and they kept in perfect formation. They did not blink but seemed to shimmer. Then one by one starting with the leftmost light they just went out in sequence from left to right. They kept in formation while going out. They kept the same altitude during the whole incident and never broke formation. They went out one by one in a very timely manner.

Some moving in some tipe of circular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very serious about this and hope to hear something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was looking at the ground when it sudenly lite up.It took about 2 seconds to find were the light was coming from. This thing looked like a hunk of twested mettle and had Peices comming from it that stuck out.  It came over my right sholder and headed towards Toronto.  It was large and very close.  It left a trail in the sky.  What I noticed about it was it was traveling realy slow and seemed to be slowing down.Well it took about 15 to 20 seconds to go out of sight.  I rememberd saying to my self, I wonder how big somthing has to be to wipe us out. It was that large.  It went over the horizon and out of sight. Now I waited to hear the inpact sound , and waited and waited .  Because I have never seen anything like this before maybe you cannot hear the inpact sound , so I started to walk again.  Then I herd it Thud ,,,,,Thud,,Thud The sound came from the ground so I know it hit the ground. It is my beleaf that it was a craft tha! t was shot down from space.It was trying to slow its decent.Thats why it took so long to hit the ground. My friend saw the ground light up in anouther location. There was no news about this so they covered it up. I swear that all I have said is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw this oval shaped object in the sky with two spotlight like lights coming out of the bottom.  One was yellow and the other was red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing about these lights was that they stopped in mid-air perfectly, probably around 20 feet from the UFO. When it was overhead from us, we all recall this very strange feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it vanished or accelerated extremely fast and speed off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I expected to hear a crash but I didn&#39;t. I also am expecting something on the news, but I&#39;ve seen nothing yet. This happened in the middle of the city, a very large city, so I am sure there will be a report(s) from others. I am not into UFO&#39;s, have never seen one. No idea what this was. I thought it may be a helicopter crashing or something or a meteor. I live on the fourth floor of a building downtown and saw several people on the ground also watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be just North of the Lake Pleasant area. At first I assumed it to be the contrails of an airliner descending South into the valley. After observing the light for several minutes , I noticed that the light wasn&#39;t moving, it was quite stationary in the sky. There was also no evidence of a willowy or feathered edge, nor a trail to this light that is so characteristic of contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light&#39;s shape was that of an elongated cigar whose ends seemed to be positioned N/S.  The color of this object was mainly illuminated white, with a mixture of yellow &amp; blue throughout its corona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant give accurate dimensions because I do not have anything to reference it to.  But as far as scale goes, it was 3 inches long by an 1/8 inch in height. It seemed to be over the NE edge of the range that holds Lake Pleasant, so maybe 25 miles away? There were other planes in the sky, local traffic for Deer Valley Airport, as well as the usual Sky Harbor traffic.  None of these planes, regardless of altitude, had contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire duration of the sighting was less than 10 minutes before it disappeared from a clear sky.<n>
7/15/08 19:30|North Haven|ME|Disk|1 hour|On the night of July 15th 2008 eight unidentified crafts were seen drifting through the sky above the Fox Island Thoroughfare.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64578.html|270|ndxe200807| On the night of July 15th 2008 eight unidentified crafts were seen drifting through the sky above the Fox Island Thoroughfare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a small island off the coast of Maine. My sister and I decided to take her 13 month old son fishing off of one of the docks on the thoroughfare seperating our island from another island. A friend of ours came with us and was helping us with the bait.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching the sunset I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, which I first dismissed as a plane because they are a very common sight. But the longer I looked at it I realized something about it was different; it was completely silent, going far more slower than a plane would go, and it was shaped like a pancake with no wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to both my sister and my friend and at first they had the same thoughts as I did about the plane theory, but then started became curious because the longer we looked at it drift thought the sky, the more it became clear that it was nothing we had ever seen before. It had no trail behind it like most planes and jets. It was just a shiny silver pancake shape object drifting along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes we spotted another one, and watched as the first one disappeared into seemingly thin air. In total we saw eight of these objects over the course of an hour. At one point my friend said he thought he saw lights coming off of it, and sure enough, at least 3 of the objects had lights. There were two to each craft, extending the whole length. They would become extremely bright, then slowly dim until it looked as though the lights would shut off, then complete the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The possibility of it being some sort of balloon is just not possible. This whole event started at 7:30 PM eastern standard time, and ended about an hour later. My friend, my sister and I are all 100% sure that the crafts we saw tonight were Unidentified Flying Objects. My sister and I are both in our twenties, and our friend is in his teens. We live simple lives on our island and have never witnessed anything like we did tonight.<n>

There were no clouds, and the object left no con-trail. When I looked at the road to pass another vehicle and looked back, the object was gone. I had my attention off the object for less than 30 seconds, and there was no way a conventional aircraft could have disappeared so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/08 15:00|Shamokin (Coal Township)|PA|Cigar|5 seconds|Saw a white flatish oval or cigar shaped white object for 5 seconds and then it disappeared. Clear blue sky with no clouds.|6/3/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75470.html|272|ndxe200807| Saw a white flatish oval or cigar shaped white object for 5 seconds and then it disappeared. Clear blue sky with no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened to me as nearly as I can recall back about two years ago, during the month of July of 2008. It may have been something like July 15th or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in my backyard cutting the grass and I sat down to rest a bit on a 3 foot high railroad tie fence at the back of my yard. My back yard has an elevation slope of about 4 degrees which is why I usually need to rest since half of the grass cutting is &#34;going up hill&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up to the north, I noticed a white object floating or stationary over the crest of the mountain ridge which, from my back yard is about 1 1/2 miles north of here. I know it&#39;s about 1 1/2 miles from here because of the time it takes for the sound to reach me from the annual fireworks displays each year. Although the fireworks originate from an area on the crest of that mountain about a mile west of here, so for the timing of the flash of fireworks to the &#34;boom&#34; is about 9 seconds, but since where I saw the &#34;UFO&#34; is a shorter distance, so I approximate it to be about 1 1/2 miles (7 to 8 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the shape of the object in your form as &#34;cigar shaped&#34; although that&#39;s not exactly it&#39;s correct shape. I&#39;m a former technical illustrator and since I smoke cigars I&#39;m well aware of the fact that cigar shape doesn&#39;t exactly describe it perfectly. The upper and lower sides weren&#39;t exactly parallel as in most cigars, but slightly convex - very slightly. And each end of the craft was round, not like in most cigars which are round on one end and the lighting end is flat or just cut straight off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But anyway, that&#39;s the best I can describe it verbally, but with drawing it I could draw it exactly as it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was just white, not shiny metallic like an aluminum aircraft.  Also the craft wasn&#39;t blindingly emitting a strong source of light, it was just white like a white object.  One thing that I noticed was that there didn&#39;t seem to be any shadow on the underside of the craft,  It was just all white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took about 1 second to adjust my eyeglasses and then when looking back at it, it just wasn&#39;t there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;m 74 years old and have been wearing eyeglasses for about 65 years so I&#39;m well aware of whether or not it was a white piece of fluff or object on my eyeglasses.  The craft I saw I clearly focused on. It wasn&#39;t an object on my eyeglasses.  I know the difference after 65 years.  I was a member of the USAF for 4 years and also have my Private Pilot&#39;s Certificate so am used to viewing object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So when I looked back to the object after first seeing it  for about 5 seconds it was just wasn&#39;t there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My theory as to why it wasn&#39;t there anymore is that either:   1 - It zoomed away in that time, or else,  2 - It just became invisible in that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, I know clouds can disappear in only a few seconds, like about  5 seconds at times, but this object disappeared in only one second.  I know that in film clips on TV that clouds seem to disappear in only maybe about 1 second, but that&#39;s only in time lapse filming.  This object disappeared in real time in only 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, there you have it. Every time I go out to cut the grass now, I always keep an eye on the sky here but haven&#39;t  seen that object anymore.  I keep looking but so far, no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I turn 90 degrees to see it hovering about 1000 or so feet above the ground, not rotating, just hovering there.  I take a step towards it after staring for three seconds and it instantly shoots up about 2000 more feet and hovered there for another couple seconds before jetting off over my head in a very sharp zigzagging pattern at extremely high speeds and disappearing out of sight in a matter of 5 seconds or so.  I felt uneasy afterwards and then headed back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory on this is hazy as I&#39;d somewhat repressed it in the back of my mind until two months ago when my psychiatrist helped me remember it.  This has recently inspired me to get into the field of ufology and find out what it was I saw that day, or possibly see something like it again.<n>

It was similar to what you might see when the sun catches a mirror but it was way off in the distance. When I looked for the cause I didn&#39;t see anything but clear skies in all directions. I  figured it was a plane way off in the distance that I couldn&#39;t see but 2-3 minutes later the same thing happened from almost the exact same spot suggesting that whatever had produced it was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object had a green hue and was flaming in the back and made no noise. Now I am not one of those who is going to say I just saw a space ship but I know it was some sort of craft and not a shooting star. The object was way to low and way to big to be a star or meteor. If this thing crashed into the earth there would have been big problems. Also my house is located under a commercial airline flight path with traffic from NY and Local Stratford Airport I lived here for 34 years and I have seen huge low flying jets but nothing like this. Also When I go to Vermont to visit family I like to watch the night sky for shooting stars and over the years I have seen hundreds but nothing this big or as close as it was. If anybody has seen anything like this or knows what I saw reply to this.

My brother and I were lying on our backs watching the stars and we noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving across the sky, but then the object stopped moving in a straight line and turned in an almost 180 degree turn. It turned and changed its course many times.  We noticed that there was not just one, but at least a dozen of these small lights high in the sky moving about randomly. We were not the only people to see them; there were probably dozens of people who saw these crafts in the sky. Whatever they were they were not conventional satellites and they appeared to be beyond the Earth’s atmosphere (about the same range as a standard satellite). I would like to point out that we were at an altitude of about 10,000 feet, and I have a feeling these things could be witnessed on any given night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

7/14/08 22:01|Escondido|CA|Light|10 minutes|Unusual, pulsating blue light near Cygnus|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64561.html|284|ndxe200807| Unusual, pulsating blue light near Cygnus<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just finished observing an extraordinary phenomena in the eastern sky, south east of Cygnus.  The local time was 10:01 PM (when I first started observing) and the event spanned until 10:10. The object was a pulsating, star-like object that stayed within about 5 degrees south east of epsilon-Cygnus or Gienah. What first struck me was the brightness, near that of Deneb at its peak, but falling to darkness within a few seconds. It repeated this behavior many times. The other aspect was the color, a brilliant blue.  This was observed from central Escondido, California - near 33 deg 7&#39; minutes north, -117 deg 3 min west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the obvious issue was the elimination of possibilities. First, the object did not travel in a straight line and did not appear to be moving at a velocity for orbital motion, so it certainly didn&#39;t seem to be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second it nearly hovered at some points, not characteristic of an aircraft.  Considering the time duration it was no meteor.  The color and therefore the color temperature, would match a very high temperature object, above 10,000 K.  Not a common object near the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did move in the sky, so it wasn&#39;t a distant astronomical object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t seem to progress like a balloon, but that is &#34;up in the air&#34;. It was no &#34;Chinese lantern&#34; with that intense blue color.  There was no sound. It was too long in duration for an Iridium flash, and was too blue.  So it could have been a high altitude UAV or other test aircraft with a bizarre blue light. It might have been a balloon with a similar light.  It was certainly a mystery and I wondered if it had been observed by others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineer and amateur astronomer and have been observing the sky for many years.  It was also observed by my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounds to us to be an exceptionally qualified, and capable, witness.  He remains confident that what he witnessed was quite unusual.  PD))<n>

A third followed behind.  They were oval in shape and definately not planes, helicopters or anything I have ever seen before.  I called my husband, who is extremely cynical, and we could not believe what we were seeing.  I race upstairs for my camera and tried to take a picture.  The crafts had not stopped so were further away and the pictures are really poor.  I also got my binoculars and we viewed one of the ojects which was incredibly bright orange, like a ball of fire, in the centre with a halo around it.  We watched until the objects were no longer in sight.  We contacted the BBC, Sky News, The Sun and the local Police who informed me there had been other reported sighting of the same which were seen in the local vicinity at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought at first that it must be a plane, but as it got closer, I noticed it wasn&#39;t blinking.This is when it gets scary.It got close; about 200 feet away vertically; I saw clearly double row of red/orange lights; they were spaced apart at regular intervals; three on one side, and three on the other, with a secondary set above that; craft was clearly visible! It moved very slowly, maybe 10 mph. It continued it&#39;s straight line motion continuing west. In terms of city blocks, it was just one block northward.These lights never blinked. I have been trying to get confirmation from Atlantic City International and Northeast Philadelphia Airport, but noone noticed anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was heading south and  went over my house at a height of about 30 Feet above the peak  of my two story  roof line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  ran inside my house and took my wife outside on the back deck of our house to see the object  which was going over our house.  The object continued on and went over the trees in our backyard .  I ran out in the backyard to get a better look.  As the object went over the trees it looked like it turned into a liquid state / form which  looked like an orange waterfall and disappeared.<n>

Saw 2 within 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phenomena or UFO? I saw three different lights within  a span of about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one was traveling west to east very high in the sky.  There were no blinking lights and it was well above the normal airline flight altitude so I assumed it was a satellite.  Then-it glowed very brightly and disappeared.  This was at approximately 9:20 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later I observed another very high altitude light traveling north to south.  It looked like it was the same brightness, speed and height as the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ended up just disappearing.  As I sat amazed not believing that I saw a second light, another light appeared same size, altitude and appearance traveling from west to east.  It also suddenly lit up very brightly then disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is in the Rancho Cucamonga area only about 8 miles northeast of Ontario International airport and these lights were nowhere near the normal flight pattern which was what first caught my attention.  The moon was over half full and blocked by a tree that was to the right of me so there was no moonlight interfering with what I saw.<n>

Unable to tell the height or size.  We thought it was a toy or balloon at first, but there were odd lights on the rim of top and bottom.  Both of us were completely puzzled by what we were seeing.  We watched it travel a great distance until it was out of sight.  It moved in too straight a line for wind or remote control to carry it,  though it appeared to wobble.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed an unusual looking craft going north to south on 7/14. It was interesting because it was darker than most aircraft; it didn’t have lights, and made no sound. It flew into a cloud and never came out. The cloud was positioned in such a way that I could not have missed an exit. It never did and the cloud dissipated and the craft was gone. If you have a logical explanation I’d love to hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Three lights in a triangluar shaped formation floating over horizon for a good two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to Prescot from Green Valley, on high way 8 with my family for familly dinner, when suddenly my 8 year old son said &#34;Daddy!, theres&#39; a ship in the sky!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my wife then looked up to see three green lights in a HUGE triangle, or V formation.  The object moved about every 5 minutes, from side to side, or up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, who was frightened said &#34;Call the police! Call the Police!&#34;.  Sadly, we had left our cellphones in the baby bag at home.  So i stopped the car to look up at the strange object.  The lights were flashing green and they didn&#39;t seem to be connected to each other.  But they stayed in a straight line and continued to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes into watching it it climbed a few 100 feet into the air and continued to hover.  It moved vigorously up and down from side to side.  As it climbed, thats lights became whiter and whiter, and soon became pure white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a moment, we couldn&#39;t see it because of the tree&#39;s.  But soon enough it hovered over our car.  It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then it started slowly moving west, turning counter clock wise [ which was odd, because it was a triange shaped air craft ].<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then sped off at almost the speed of light maybe 50-60 miles west.  It was just above the horizon when it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another 5 or ten minutes later, it sped off into the horizon disappearing completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked to the left (southeast)|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64539.html|294|ndxe200807| On July 14, 2008 at 10:30 am I was driving my company van south on HWY 99 coming into Aurora, Oregon. I looked to the left (southeast) above and between the trees and saw a very bright chrome looking object. It was in the shape of a square pillow. I could not tell how far away it was but I knew it wasn’t close by the way the trees were passing between it and I. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around to get a better look but the object was not there. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around again and when I came to the same location to look for the object again it was not there but there was another object farther away and at a higher elevation. I pulled over and looked through my binoculars and it appeared to be shaped similar to a dark cigar but with a distinct bulge towards one end. As I was trying to fine focus on the object it “disappeared” or faded out.  It did not move in any direction, or go behind clouds (there weren’t any), it just faded out. I immediately called my supervisor and he said I should call the FAA. I called and they said there was no one or dept. to report it to.  I called the Marion Co. Sheriff’s office and reported it and they gave me the number for the UFO Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The rear light was gaining on the other two and I followed them until I lost them in the northern hemisphere. They were traveling faster than anything we have flying today and all three were steady, bright lights, as bright as the stars in the background. I got nervous when I first seen them, not frightened but shocked. These were not of this Earth and were Aliens. This is the second time I&#39;ve seen U.F.O.&#39;s over Lake Superior. The last time was a single bright light and this time there were three. There was no sound in either case!<n>

I was looking up into the sky – as I often do – and noticed a small light moving at a steady rate overhead.  It seemed to be very high up and I thought it may have been a satellite – as I have seen these on many occasions.  I watched as it maintained a steady movement across the sky from the southeast to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared – in size – to be the same as the smallest surrounding stars and equally as faint/bright.  As it got most of the way across the sky, it suddenly got brighter and brighter and brighter until it was almost as bright as Venus – which was in the western sky some distance away.  It was almost as if it was a satellite that entered the atmosphere and burned-up.  It dimmed rather quickly from it&#39;s brightest point and there was a hazy blue-white glow in the sky where the sighting ended.  My eyes were temporarily affected by the brightness – I couldn&#39;t see as well in the dark for several seconds – this is how bright it glowed.  If I had to describe it, it reminded me of burning magnesium – something I witnessed several years ago in high school chemistry class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what this was but I am certain it was not an airplane.  It could have been an object which burned up in the atmosphere.  It was far far far to slow to have been a meteor.  Ironically I witnessed a different sighting a few years ago in the same general area of the sky a few miles from this location.  A neighbour told me that she had witnessed a triangular craft in the same general area some time ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 2 am earlier tonight on July 14th 2008, i went to close my window and i saw what appeared to be a red cloud in the sky hovering over Scottsdale.  Upon closer examination i saw what appeared to be a red inner glowing light and there reddish-orange cloud that surrounded it.  The shape of the cloud was a circle and it flickered with the inner light.  The feeling of seeing that is one that i will never forget.  My heart started to beat rapidly and my mind started racing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know whether to wake up my parents or call my friends to check it out. I tried to call a friend of mine, but he did not answer.  I decided not to wake up my parents, because they would have just said i was crazy and told me to go back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to lose sight of the object either.  Anyway this object just stayed in one spot the whole time, i did not see it fly vertically. The only movement that could have happened was for it to move south, The cloud was strongest in the sky for about 5 minutes and than progressively got less bright over the few minutes. The weird thing was the shape of the cloud didn&#39;t get smaller.  It was still huge and it just seemed to get less bright until it vanished. The size was huge, it looked almost as big as a full moon does. In conclusion i want to say that i saw something tonight that i have never seen before in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that the object in the sky that i saw was way too big and way too bright to be anything that our military has disclosed.<n>

It could be that the objects are able to change shapes. I saw apertures and long extensions rather like short arms / short wings . These appeared to be withdrawn and extended for a few moments. The angle of these arms / wings was similar to that of an Olympic swimmer on the podium at the start of a race . There were various flashing Orbs of light that appeared both integral to the Object and separate. These orbs seemed to morph / merge into and out of the main object.In each case the Main object appeared very very slow taking a long time to disappear, almost like shrinking . The objects were almost silent except for a barely discernible hum . They travelled from direct South to direct North . I was facing exactly directly West looking out of my window. I ran downstairs and outside into the garden to view the objects slowly shrink / disappear directly over the Ocean in a South East direction. There were unusually bright &#34; Stars &#34; That were in front of the clouds not behind as normal . It was quite a cloudy night and unusually silent. Please note I will use a pseudonym.And I will give a general address as I don&#39;t want any contact except via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Grants Pass, Oregon.  While relaxing in the spa and looking into the clear night sky, my friend and I witnessed in the night sky a bright flash of white light strait up in the sky, and then it flashed once again while the craft moved in an Eastward direction in the sky. The craft continued to flash and as it did it moved in a circular pattern first towards the North then towards the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing was not in a consistent pattern as conventional aircraft, and the flashes were not all the same in brilliance, some were brighter than others.  There were a total of at least 9 flashes of white light and it seemed that after each flash the craft would zip to another position before flashing again. It looked like the flashing had something to do with the crafts propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time we saw the craft until it just disappeared into the sky heading westward was about one minute. The object made no noise as it raced across the sky.<n>

It was heading in a straight direction when all of the sudden a bright flash of light appeared from where it light was moving in the sky.  All of the sudden it took off in another direction and as you watch it it became dimmer and dimmer as if it was flying higher until you could not see any longer.  My wife witnessed it as well and suprised by it as well.  I checked all of the online schedules for many of the different space agencies and did not see anything that was scheduled for taking off that night.  I also did the research to see if it was an iridium satellite flare as you suggested peter.  It definitely did not look like that at all.  This was definitely different than anything I have seen happen in the night sky.  I see objects in the sky that appear to be most likely satellites and the space station that move in a constant speed in the sky on the same path.  Never have seen something like this going one direction then moving in another after the flash.  Very strange.  My wife was speaking with her boss and she and her husband just so happen to see the same thing.  I have never reported anything before and this is my first time.  I definitely will continue looking up!<n>

The sky was clear with few clouds and the moon was almost full.  We were sitting in a half circle when I happened to look into the sky.  I saw a green light shaped almost like a teardrop with a green aura coming off of it moving at an incredibly fast speed. I pointed to it as it shot out from behind some trees. Everyone saw it. My first thought was that it might be a falling star but I’ve seen a couple of falling stars and this thing seemed different. First off, it was neon green. It didn’t just have a greenish tint; it was the color of a lime. As we were watching the green light, it split in two and flew off into the sky leaving behind a line of smoke from where it had came from. The trail stayed in the sky for just a couple of minutes before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She says that the 4 objects came from behind the clouds from beside the moon and two of them had white lights, two were orange in color and had 3 orange lights down the side.  She said that they flew very fast across the night sky.  She was not able to see what size they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my husband contacted the sheriff&#39;s department in our area, the officer answering the phone did not sound surprised.

They set in the sky at the same position for approximatly 30 mins.  They started to move in different directions.  They would be bright as they went across the sky and then would go dim and then a large flash of white and disappear.

Bare eyes, no scope obviously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Completely circular, traveling straight north. (I am on the west side of houston texas).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object seemed to be uniformly spherical, it seemed to have a glow to it, but not a bright one. But it was a consistently uniform light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not change brightness, did not have any sort of beacon or blinking as a plane or copter would. And It seemed to move from the southern most point of the horizon to the northern most pointin about 10-12 seconds. (this has to be an incredibly fast speed, as planes and jets take many minutes to pass the entire sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definitely not a satellite, as they are much slower. And definitely not a meteorite as I have seen many, and they seem to disappear half way across or down the skyline w/ a greenish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking to the sky&#39;s for many of years for something regardless, and I told my wife, that if i had ever seen a ufo in my life, that last night was it. She just thinks I&#39;m crazy.  Are you the one guy who takes reports from his home in washington or something like that, the guy I saw on tv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought I would contact you thinking I saw an anomaly like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a serious inquiry.

It seemed to all of a sudden disappear as I was watching it. When I walked back up the driveway, I looked up again and saw the same object moving in the same manner as I have described. I again walked down the driveway and watched the object and this time it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends are trying to tell me that perhaps I seeing a meteor or a comet these objects would have left a trail of some sort.

Protruding from this band the metal continued off the top for 10 ft tapering into a point. The texture, and appearance were incredible, as if it were brand new. ( If that makes sense)  My view became obstructed by a small low cloud , I kept my eyes on that point in the sky. However; when the cloud passed the object was no longer there. I estimate the distance to be less than 25 yards from the window I observed this from. At the time I was looking out from a building on the 6 th floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft had no lights, no visible ports just what I described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish others had seen this, I told my Daughter, she thinks it was something Military. I can&#39;t imagine we have these capabilities.<n>

There was plenty of daylight.  The object was east of us coming toward us on a diagonal from the north east and then turned south paralleling the coast over the Atlantic Ocean.  It had NO wings or tail and not markings.  It had a blunted point on the southern end and a circular back end.  There was no combustion of any kind, noise or condensation trail. It moved out of sight in less than 20 seconds heading due south towards Miami.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a craft at a high altitude moving in the area of the moon at a very fast rate of speed. I was facing south. It had no vapor trail and did not make any noticeable noise.  The object appeared to be at an altitude of 30-40 thousand feet.  My friend was outside with me and I pointed it out to him.  I ran inside and got my binoculars, which are 8X50.  My friend looked first and he described an object which appeared to have no fixed wings, and he said it was an all silver cigar shaped object.  I looked next, and what I saw was a silver bottom and sided saucer with a small top in the center of it, the top side appeared to be white.  The craft appeared to be banking at an angle when I looked at it. There were no wings, no tailfin, and no exhaust that I could see. I ran back inside to get my camcorder, which took me about 20 seconds and when I returned, it was gone.  The craft moved across the entire horizon in less than one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My 9 yr old daughter pointed out an object hovering over the city.  If we looked straight up it was just a little to the East about 10 degrees from high noon.  It looked like a reddish silver pearl. Twice it looked like it was flashing brown and silver.  It hovered in the same spot for about 20 minutes.  After looking away and then back again I noticed that it almost looked like a disk with a tail pointing east kinda like a stingray.  All of us agreed it was emanating disks of brownish exhaust.   The exhaust disks were puffing out of the center of it the entire time.  Several times during our sighting commercial airliners would fly past it but it never moved.  After our 20 minutes of rest our family resumed our kickball game.  Both my husband and I looked up to find it but it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/13/08 17:28|Lenox|MA|Oval|2 minutes|A small, oval, metallic object was seen rocking back and forth while flying in a straight trajectory over Lenox, MA.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64526.html|314|ndxe200807| A small, oval, metallic object was seen rocking back and forth while flying in a straight trajectory over Lenox, MA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside at a picnic table, facing due east, atop a hill overlooking Laurel Lake in the Berkshire Hills of western Mass., and sipping a cup of coffee while watching some birds flying in the clear blue sky. A metallic sheen caught my eye, and I looked to my right to see a relatively small object (maybe 2 feet to 5 feet in diameter?) flying toward me from the south.  I immediately knew it was something unusual, as it was moving in a strange way—“sliding” on its axis back and forth, back and forth, like a rocking chair—in very precise intervals.  And it did this even as it cruised silently from due south to due north with a straight, level, unwavering trajectory and pace.  My first thought was that it was a child’s Mylar balloon, but when it flew directly in front of me, perhaps only 200 feet in front of me and maybe just 100 feet above the ground, I got a very good look at it, and it seemed much more solid than a balloon.  Also, it moved very deliberately, consistently, and not entirely in alignment with the wind (which, I checked online afterward, was about 10mph from the south/southwest).  I can’t completely rule out the possibility that it actually was a balloon, but I don’t think that it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got a good look at its shape, it seemed like an oddly flattened, concave oval, with a slight depression in the center that was colored flat white, while the back side of the object was colored cerulean blue.  There was also some part of it, perhaps the sides, that were metallic silver and reflecting sunlight very brightly every time it rocked.  It was this bright, shining glint that initially caught my attention, and it’s also what enabled me to get up from the picnic table, walk around a building and some trees, and continue watching the object on its smooth, straight, northerly trajectory until it disappeared behind a distant tree-line about a mile away.  (The whole sighting lasted maybe 2 minutes.)  I’ve had an abiding interest in UFOs since the early 90s, and I think I may have seen one near Seattle in 1995.  But even though I regularly watch the skies whenever I’m outside, this is the first thing I’ve seen since 1995 that I simply couldn’t figure out.  It was simply bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Clouds were becoming very dark.  Approximately 40 miles away, I saw an object that was silver or white darting in and out of dark cloud traveling in circles or figure eights. At first suspected Flying Angels from MacDill AFB  but I do not think military would have any craft doing tricks in and out of a very dark storm cloud. I can honestly say this is the first time I have ever seen anything that warrants making this type of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I looked and said,,,HmmI don&#39;t know&#34;.It is a photo of my campfire and with a solid wall of woods as my background,a perfect round white,bright light was in one them.After looking at a few more pics in the same area,one of them then what appeared to be a shadow image of a full moon or something,but there was no full moon at this time.Then,in a 3rd photo is what appears to be a blurry light as in very fast motion or something.So,I took these photos to Walgreens where they were originally developed and they reviewed the negatives they told me there was no photo glimpse or any error to cause this.I really believe I have something here because I do have very good instincts and there is just something strange here that I just cannot explain. I hope to hear some input on this situation because it has really caught the attention of a few other people nas well,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Nocturnal Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 13 July, 4:18 am, I spotted a satellite in the WSW that was being perfectly accompanied in speed and a constant distance by two bright white lights.  I observed the satellite and the lights for about 25 seconds until all disappeared behind a tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using data from the Heaven’s Above website, and comparing to my own recorded observations, I discovered that the satellite I sighted was USA 129 which was at a magnitude of 3.8 and an elevation of 66 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two bright white lights each appeared to be twice the size of the satellite and at least twice as bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm’s length, using my thumb as a guide (2.5 inches in length) the satellite was 2.5 inches above the lower white light.  The upper white light was 3/8ths to ½ inch above the lower white light.  The satellite and the two lights were nearly in perfect vertical alignment with the lights leading the satellite by a degree or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOT TO SCALE, but representing the relative size and positions as viewed.

This ‘illusion’, real or not, could be due to the close proximity of the bright white lights masking dimmer stars which should have been visible between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observation lasted for 25 seconds, doing the count in my head during the sighting. I used my cell phone to check the time of day the moment I spotted the satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing a few hundred feet east of Hickory Ridge Road between Bone Road and Sackner Road at the time and generally looking to the southwest.  The only light in the area at the time was a single bulb exterior garage light, 100 feet away in a northeasterly direction from my position which did not enter my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first i thought they were just stars but then i noticed they were moving across the sky in perfect Triangular formation. Not your ordinary perfect triangle, more like a both sides were like 70 degree angles. It was to large to be a plane in my opinion. I would estimate it was about the size of 10 football fields. This thing was way up in the sky. Just kept going across the sky until i could not see it anymore. The lights did not come out of formation for a second. They stayed aligned the whole time. The top of the triangle was tailing the bottom 2 lights of the triangle in the northeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I&#39;m sitting facing the west and there was this bright light that was stationary but to me it was flashing. There is alot of air traffic out here, so I thought it might be a plane coming in my direction.  But it never moved. I called my wife out to observe it and she said that flashing was actually changing colors(I&#39;m color blind)from red to blue to white, we watched for about an hour and it just got smaller and smaller and then disappeared.  From where we are I&#39;d say it was just a little bit north of west and maybe 15-20 degrees above horizon.  I 1st observed it about 12:30, it disappeared about 1:30am.  We did get out an old pair of binoculars, my wife said the red light was circling around whatever it is.

They seemed to be chasing each other and at times criss crossed and a few times would back up. They could only be observed when there was a cloud in front of them.

There was a thin layer of cirrostratus clouds in some areas of the dark sky. Well, I noticed a bright stationary white light (star or distant planet type light, but more intensely bright) in the sky, about 60 degrees from the horizontal, ahead of me. I thought, that sure is one bright planet, but in that area of the sky over this city, puzzled me. All of a sudden, the extremely bright white light, which was shining through a bit of a haze (possibly from the high clouds), got even brighter before lowering in intensity and disappearing totally. The duration of this whole episode only took about 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my next trip through the same rail line, about 2 hours later, I looked in the same vicinity of the sky, to see if I could see the bright light that I saw prior, but I did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it quite stunning, as the light was very bright and very noticeable in the dark sky. The light did not move from the location. Was this a possible UFO sighting?<n>

I went out onto my 2nd floor terrace for a cigarette and noticed it was a starry  night.  While looking at the stars I noticed a strange shaped object in  the sky.  Under the impression it was a satellite I turned off all the lights in my house fast (there were only two on on the 2nd floor so it didn’t take long) now in total darkness the object was still visible.  I live in the country so it is very quiet and dark.  The object was moving across the sky in a north-westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was emitting a yellow-orange pulsating glow and was the size of the moon.  It was at around 20000  feet  off the ground.   Having seen many satellites before I realised this was of foreign origin.  It was at too low an altitude to be a commercial plane and the wrong colour lights were there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about one minuet the object passed my house and was no longer visible.  I questioned a member of my family who holds a position in Air Traffic Control at the airport (Cork international airport) and no flight was bearing that direction at that altitude that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of yet I cannot find a satisfying conclusion to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, former sceptic,   Mr. X<n>

There appeared to be other smaller crafts darting toward it and then they would turn sharply and go in the opposite direction. And the large triangular craft would sort of chase after them. Either the smaller crafts were shooting at the larger one or vise a versa. But you could see smoke trails  all around it from what looked like missiles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in the house and told my step-dad and he came outside too with his binoculars. We counted at least six of the larger crafts all around the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see what looked like laser lights shooting all around it, then it looked almost like fireworks. Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and had to take a double look. Above the trees and the house next door was a ball of fire falling slowly to the ground but it almost looked like a big balloon drifting down real slow. I yelled at my step-dad to look, we stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was. It was real close and it looked like it was landing in the back yard across the street. I tried to follow it but lost it. I know it must be in the close area.<n>

Worth, Texas, a fellow 11:11 &#34;promptee,&#34; sent me an update at 4:55 a.m. Eastern (3:55 Central [Ft. Worth]) on what she and her stepfather have been witnessing in the skies above their house tonight, Saturday July 12- Sunday, July 13, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is her latest email followed by my response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this is not a hoax people. I am a writer, metaphysician, and former professional journalist with the Hearst Newspaper Corp, CBS and NBC TV-news affiliates and would not joke about something like this. This is history being made!  ************************************************************  (my nickname),  Okay, I was just out there again. The sky was real clouded up, but not like normal clouds! More like how chemtrails are, a trail that swells up and gets fatter as it spreads out.I could see two of them, and yes, definatly what a dogfight would look like!  What I (we) saw earlier looked like a very large triangular shaped craft with several white lights around it and one red light. But they were blinking or rotating. The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am so glad my step-dad was there to see it too, I would of thought I was seeing things and not ever told anyone else. But I know what we saw!  (friend&#39;s name)  *************************************************************  (friend&#39;s name):  Okay, so are you telling me that it looked like a dogfight between a very large triangular U.F.O. and a bunch of smaller disc-shaped U.F.O.s?  If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I&#39;ve never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You, (friend&#39;s name), may have witnessed the opening salvos of the open Battle for Planet Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this real or what?  Wow! You have witnessed history, Jeanne, and I have been able to tell the world about it. This really is something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What else can I say? Thanks for this update, keep watching the sky, and please try to keep track of all details regarding colors, shapes, time of events, etc. Do you have a camcorder? If so, use it!  Let me know more asap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks, and may God and the Angels be with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will forward your update to everyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, please keep me posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (my nickname)  Important Note:  I sent a follow-up email to my friend in Ft.

When we first sighted the object it was heading in a Northwesterly direction crossing in front of the Big Dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we watched the object, it intensified in brightness continuing in its path for about the distance from the bottom of the dipper ladle to the middle top of the ladle. About an inch in the night sky past the ladle of the dipper the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn and shot out of the Earths orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 second later an airplane “this one we new by the flashing beacon lights” flew across the night sky at about 35,000 feet but it continued on its path like it was going to Seattle Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t tell you if the plane was following it but I don’t know how he could have not seen it because it was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost exactly 10:00 PM CDT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although they were in the same proximity, they were not real close to one another.  They were very high in the sky I would guess 15-20 thousand feet and made no noise.  They did not move but seemed to hover for five minutes when I went to get my wife.  We watched them for roughly two more minutes until the lights faded due to cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a period of seven minutes, these objects did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was severe weather in the area.<n>

My friends and I were sitting on the roof of my apartment building in Charleston, playing guitar and chatting for about an hour when I leaned back against the roof and saw what I thought at the time were two shooting stars.  I said out loud to my friends, &#34;Oh my god guys, shooting stars..&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the time I got the words out of my mouth the lights stopped directly over us for what seemed like minutes, but was probably more like 30 seconds.  They lights had no sound and they just hovered above us. Soon after they stopped, both crafts shot off in different directions extremely fast in a zig zag way, before they disappeared from sight.  All of us just sat there in silence, kinda in disbelief.  Then, once we realized what we had just witnessed, we collected our stuff and went back inside.  I would think I was crazy if I didn&#39;t have so many other witnesses.  I kinda would like to know if a! nyone else in the area has reported this....<n>

I watched it long enough to realize it was odd and pointed it out to my husband.  We pulled the car over after watching it a bit longer but by the time we got out the car to get a better look (within less than 10 seconds) it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked in a ne direction from where we were in Milton, WA. A few of us saw a reguar jet heading into seatac airport, My hephew said no no t that and repointed us to the correct location. We saw about 15-25 white shapes in the sky. They were moving in a western direction from our standpoint, ne to nw to our perceptin. I would say starting about the direction Issaquah, WA to end well over the Wa peninsula in just 3 or 4 minutes. I stated they looked like the you tube video over mexico city. After losing sight of them we went into the house looked up the event on the computer and everyone stated YES! that is what we saw. Some of the people were in amazement of the same thing that they just saw being recorder in that you tube video.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was taking pictures of the bay and saw a strange item flying out in the distance. It was Grey in color, had a &#34;S&#34; type shape, and it was heading west to east around the peninsula at a constant rate of speed and altitude. I followed it until it went behind some trees, and I saw it a couple of minutes later. At that point it had changed orientation, but was still flying west-&gt;east. It did not seem to make any noise, nor did it have any discernable lights or method of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/12/08 09:00|Texhoma|OK|Unknown|10 min|The green light zoomed across the lake leaving a splitting wake that parted the water.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73541.html|339|ndxe200807| The green light zoomed across the lake leaving a splitting wake that parted the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 12, 2008,me and two of my friends  from norman, Oklahoma were at lake Texhoma. We were on a deck boat driving to go to a club that was located on the other side of my friends dock. As we started getting closer to the club I realized I didn’t have my ID and we figured they wouldn’t let me in without identification, so we decided we would just drive around and look at the nice house boats that were close to the club. After we were done looking at the boats we decided to go back to my friend’s lake house.  To get to his lake house we had to go underneath a train bridge that went the width of the of the lake. There is a shore that is approximately 200 yards straight in front of us that has a hill that is about 30 feet high. On top of the hill on the shore we saw a white light that kind of looked like a spotlight or a lighthouse light. Our first thought was that the light was coming from the boat patrol, but as we continued to watch the light, the object somehow went from the top of the hill to the water. At this time we know that it wasn’t a spotlight or a lighthouse light, because not only did the object move from the hill to the water but it began to move on the water like it was a boat except it was moving too smoothly for a boat, and the object was making no sound. We couldn’t tell exactly what the light was connected to because the lake was completely dark. As we drifted across the lake in neutral, the object met us at an angle about 50 feet from the no wake zone. That’s when we realized that the object was to big to be a yacht or a boat house. The object was so large that we actually had to look up and down, left and right to see the full length and width of the object.  We started to getting closer to the object when we noticed that we going to wreck into the object if we didn’t turn, so we turned to our right where there was a smaller object approximately 15 feet next to us. The object emitted a green light and sat! stationary as we watched it trying to figure out if it was an! other de ck boat but we couldn’t see anything except the green light and silhouette of what the light was connected to. In the middle of us arguing about what the object was, the green light took off without any noise across the lake going along the train bridge within less than 0:01.5 second leaving a trail from the wake it created when it took off. After we saw the green light disappear we noticed that the larger object had disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event changed my belief in UFOs and other paranormal wonders of the world.  I believe that whatever me and my friends saw was not manmade, and if it was manmade then there is some kind of military weapon or vehicles that unknown to the rest of the world.<n>
7/12/08 08:00|Ontonagon|MI|Triangle|80 minutes|((HOAX??))  first an orb and then a triangle 20 minutes apart.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69639.html|340|ndxe200807| first an orb and then a triangle 20 minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well my mother and I were looking out my side window, when my mother saw the first object it was an orb and it was flashing lots of colors.  We watched it for a good while, and it started moving up, down, left, right and then it made snake like movements.  After probable about 45 min. of watching my mom wanted to go lay down in the living room.  We watched T.V. for a little while, but I wanted to go see if it was still there, so I went back in to the bedroom and looked out the window, and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a little while longer and it slowly made its way behind the trees across the highway.  For some reason my eyes moved to the big dipper in the sky you could see it perfectly out that side window.   As I was watching I noticed a very dull star at the very end of the big dippers handle.  I thought to myself what is that?  That shouldn’t be there and then all the sudden it shot from where I saw it.  It was so fast and bright.  When I first seen it come out of the sky it was so bright and then it dimmed down and I could really see it was a triangle . The whole thing was glowing. It came so fast from that spot it left two trails behind it.  To me it looked like something straight out of Star Trek and it scared me.  I almost thought it was an asteroid.   It came to a complete stop turned to the north and slowly moved away. I was in complete shock.  I tried hollering for my mom while this was going on but no sound would come out of my mouth.  I couldn’t stop looking at it.  It was the most alien light I had ever seen in my life, and I will probably never see it again.  I don’t know what I saw but I’ve never seen anything like it ever .  I don’t think anyone has.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was not aware of the existence of NUFORC until just now, otherwise I would have submitted it here as well. I have edited it in a few areas where I might not have been as clear as I would have liked (I was understandably in a kind of fervor at the time), but my original report is still on MUFON.com if you’d like to view that as well. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time observing satellites, stars, planets, meteors and aircraft, and nothing has baffled me like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside my house smoking a cigarette, and I decided to move a lawn chair out into the yard so I could look at the sky. It was the perfect summer night. All I could hear were crickets, and the skies were clear. I was looking about 40 degrees up to the east, and that&#39;s when I saw it appear. It was such a shock to me that I can&#39;t tell if it rapidly decelerated to a speed at which it was visible (Who knows?) or if it just &#34;turned on its lights&#34;. I literally jumped in my seat!  We&#39;ve all seen meteors, they reach a point at which the friction and pressure of the atmosphere builds up heat which produces incandescent light that we see for usually no more than a fraction of a second. If this was a meteor, then I&#39;m Santa Claus. It was already moving when it appeared (like a meteor), but its brightness didn&#39;t fade (the lights did pulsate, however), there was no rapid descent, and I was able to follow it to the horizon. Fireballs have been visible over several states before they either impact the ground (or someone&#39;s unfortunate car), but this object wasn&#39;t as bright as Jupiter, it left no trail, and nothing was seen breaking off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could be one of the lucky few who have witnessed an earth-grazing fireball, but I doubt it. Here&#39;s why: the object had red and white lights, but not lights as you&#39;d expect to see on an aircraft. They weren&#39;t points of light; rather there was a center that was brighter than the periphery around it. That&#39;s the best I can explain it. The center part wasn&#39;t even that bright, but the smooth glow of the light around it really set it apart from anything I&#39;d ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object definitely had some size to it. Let&#39;s assume this was something entering the atmosphere. From my point of view, the apparent size of the object was no smaller than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude, possibly larger. I&#39;m no expert on which altitudes objects start to glow at as they enter the atmosphere, but it’s definitely more than 40,000 feet, making this thing at least as big as an aircraft, if indeed it is something entering the atmosphere. There are lots of variables involved, but that seems logical to me. As meteors have not developed stealth technology since they are essentially rocks, I would have to imagine that this object would appear on radar if it was nothing more than a very large meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving northward, possibly to the NNW. It made no sound whatsoever. If this was an aircraft, it would have to AT LEAST be going mach 1 at roughly 10,000 feet. That&#39;s as slow and as low as this thing could have been going. The higher up this thing actually was, the faster it was actually going. Common sense, right? I should have been able to hear something if this was an aircraft. B-2&#39;s and F-117&#39;s are pretty quiet, but they&#39;re also subsonic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know for sure is that I saw something extremely unusual travel from 40 degrees above the horizon in the eastern sky to the northern horizon in about five seconds or less. The time at which the event took place eliminates a satellite in low orbit being illuminated by the sun, so either this thing made its own light or was glowing from the heat of entering the atmosphere, possibly both.  Please call or email me if you have any questions, or if I&#39;m flat-out wrong about something. Thank you for looking into it for me.<n>

It had now descernable shape, though it seemed circular, and seemed to be spinning. The event lasted aproximately 12 minutes. The object hovered in the sky for about 7 minutes, staying in one spot. After about seven minutes, it began to shift left and right. I recorded two videos, one about 1 minute long, the other just under 3 minutes long, on my phone. the event ended at about 12:50, when the U.F.O. vanished when i looked away. It was far away, yet, since i could not see any specific features about the object and it had nothing except sky behind it, i could not estimate a distance from where i was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stranger than the actual U.F.O were the things that happened during the event. First of all, i live just off of a major avenue, which is always being used all hours of the day. During the time i saw the U.F.O., i didn&#39;t see a SINGLE car pass bye. Second, i didn&#39;t alert either my sister or mother, whom i live with, because (and i am realizing this as i write) during the event, i felt separated from the world, like it was me, the thing in the sky, and the road below my window. it took me several minutes to gain my sences after the thing dissapeared. It might have been shock and even fear of seeing something i couldn&#39;t explain in the sky over my home, or something else. Either way, it was indeed freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object looked like a fireball coming down from the sky. The longer I looked at it I noticed it was brighter than others I had seen.

I seen a bright blue led colored light darting around. It was not moving in a particular way. I shouted to the family to look and everyone stood up and screamed, &#34;what the - is that?&#34;. We watched it dart around for a few seconds until it was no longer visible. But then my sister seen it again and we all ran to where she was standing and sure enough it was almost like it had come back towards us and then disappeared. It was a partly cloudy night and a little after midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were five objects that were stationary in the sky in somewhat of a hexagonal pattern that possessed flashing lights that were not of the same frequency as regular planes. I had grabbed my binoculars to take a better look, considering they were at a distance, and discovered they were in rotation around the objects. After observing these objects and noticing other aircraft circling them (airplanes-not airliners) for approximately an hour, five to seven disc shaped objects flew directly overhead and disappeared to the north. The way these objects were maneuvering I had never seen before and they moved so fast as compared to the planes that it was entirely obvious they weren’t the norm. If nothing else I am hoping that someone else had witnessed the same thing considering I am in somewhat of a populated area and it was a Friday night. I know what I saw-an answer or a corresponding account would be great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect 10:30 p.m. on July 11.

When we were near Marysville I noticed a bright white object the shape of a boomerang behind the trees on the right side of the road (east side).  At first we thought it was a firework, however it was moving up and down, like on a rollercoaster.  It had a tail, and it looked like it was emitting sparks.  We could see it move up and down for about a minute, then it disappeared.  It reappeared a few seconds later and again stayed for a few minutes.  After watching it for about 5 mintues total, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we continued to drive and follow the object we noticed an array of triangle shaped lights off in the distance...almost to where the meteor like object was heading.  As the meteor objects faded into the distance, toward the horizon, the triangle formation of lights scattered very quickly in random like directions.  As I turned onto a street heading toward the direction of the lights in the sky they were gone and the whole thing was over.  We later, after the softball game, were listening to a local Chicago radio station, 96.3 FM, and heard people call into the station and tell the DJ (on air) that they had seen the lights or UFO&#39;s as well.  This occurred between 8:45-9PM on Friday July 11th, 2008 near the town of Lansing, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So it turned from looking like a very bright star in the distance  to  not  far from straight above my position ( maybe 2% forward of me) at an altitude of im guessing  a planes flight path into Manchester airport from Salford. As it got closer i saw it was cylinder shaped  with lights running down the sides. Then  the lights faded, the outline first then the lights running down the sides but it did not fade like a shooting star, there was no tail ( it was definatly a cylinder shape, not an object with a tail), as it faded I saw a plane heading in to Manchester  about 5 seconds from its position. From first sighting to it disappearing was 3 to 6 seconds but I saw what I saw. I had to report this to someone, thanks<n>

Due to the clarity of the skies, witnesses had difficulty in determining scale and altitude.

The witnesses were quite certain that the object remained motionless for several minutes, as if hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the event, they saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner flying near the object at a much higher altitiude. The object was a third smaller than the aircraft as it transited the area. The object displayed no movement, appeared to be light colored, with a haze around it. The object reportedly changed from round to a tubular or cigar shape.  No noise could be associated with the object.  Witnesses appeared to be credible, lucid and sober.

Then, coz I was still waiting and wanted to fill in my time with something, I turned on the video camera. When I did this, I saw a black dot on the viewing screen; it was moving around a bit like it was floating, similar to the way a balloon would float if it had found an area of sky of equal pressures. But when I looked at the sky where this black dot was on the viewing screen, I couldn&#39;t see it. It was obviously there, I could see it on the viewing screen. But I couldn&#39;t see it with my eyes. I triple checked between the viewing screen and the sky! I could only see it through the viewing screen. Also, I could see it rotating spherically along every axis as if it were an inflatable beach ball hovering above an air vent; the type you see in Techniquest, and its shape was changing from spherical (round) to slightly oblong (squeezed round) and back again, as it rotated (the image while recording was much clearer than the recorded image which has been pixelated). I zoomed in next which was the obvious next step, and I wondered if it would do anything a bit strange. It moved from one point to another in such a way that cancelled out the possibility of it being a balloon. You can see from the slow motion video that the object arcs to the left and down, creating a circular motion before moving up and right, coming to rest in another place. Then after it bobs around for a bit, it creates exactly the same arcing circular motion as before but in the opposite direction, zooming away from that place to another off screen. Can you see it coming back onto the screen as I&#39;m getting out of the van? I didn&#39;t even see it zooming away the first time as my mate was distracting me asking me something, and I was looking away from the screen. I&#39;m just so glad I got that shot!  This was in Gladstone Road, Barry, South Wales, UK, at 2:10pm, on Friday the 11th of July 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

Its heat turned the tin wall of my cattle shed red,” Mr Chhetri, said. According to the Kurseong BDO, the object has changed colour after cooling down. “The object is not more than 15 kg, is blackish in colour and has several concentric rings,” Mr Verma said. “What is curious is that the object did not create a major crater although it fell from the sky,” he added. Curiosity prevails in the area about the identity of the object.

7/11/08 00:45|Southlake|TX|Unknown|1-2 seconds|Witnessed two bright white flashes of light that illuminated the inside of my house|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64462.html|365|ndxe200807| Witnessed two bright white flashes of light that illuminated the inside of my house<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing an object in the sky at 11:00pm and determining that it was unidentified I decided to file a report with you which a did right after I witnessed the incident. However later I witnessed something else that might possibly be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I finished with the report I returned to the living room to watch some TV before going to sleep. While I was sitting there a extremely bright white flash of light (1-2 secs in duration) illuminated my entire living room. This happened at about 12:40am. At night I always keep the blinds on my windows open, and this flash of light was evenly distributed and completely lit the room during the flash, so much so that I remember squinting because it was so bright. The light did not sweep across the room in beams as a car&#39;s headlights might, but it EVENLY light the room in an intense white light. It was like night became day, literally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately following the flash my two dogs became very agitated, pacing around and whining loudly. So I get up and quickly go out onto my back porch, where I had observed the incident earlier, wondering what the hell that was. However, I could observe nothing either in the sky or any traffic such as cars or other people up that might explain the flash. My dogs seemed to quickly spot something down by the fence, though it was too dark for me to see anything, because they went tearing off downstairs and outside after something barking like crazy. After a few seconds they stopped and came back upstairs and settled down. I also went back inside unable to explain where the flash of light came from, what caused it, or why it was so intense or perfectly dispersed evenly through the room. I went to bed a short time later and at about 1:45 am 7/11/08 as I lay in bed with my eyes lightly closed trying to fall asleep, another bright flash of white light, identical to the first, illuminated my entire bedroom (again I sleep with my blinds open). It was so bright I saw it even with my eyes closed and openned them in time to confirm the flash of light for a second time. Again my dogs, who were sleeping too, became extremely agitated again (more so than I have ever seen them, and more so than the first time) and began pacing around the bedroom whining and I could tell they were nervous/scared. This time they didn&#39;t run downstairs barking after anything. It was almost like they were trying to stay close to me. Their behaviour was really strange and both times coincided with the two flashes. So I get out of bed a little spooked, because I just saw this flash again and my dogs were really agitated again. I looked out through the blinds and again could not see anything that might have caused the light. No cars, no low flying airplanes, no neighbors up, just calm darkness. After the second flash startled me out of bed i wasn&#39;t taking any chances, I made sure my guns were ready to go and I had a very difficult time going bac! k to bed last night to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really don&#39;t know if this incident is related to the one I had earlier or not, but I thought it was still important to inform you just in case. I can&#39;t explain it, but just tell you what I expeirienced. It was really weird, and it didn&#39;t give me a good feeling at all. I mean the room in both occassions went from being totally dark to COMPLETELY and perfectly illuminated, like the brightest day ever, and then went away and darkness returned. Just two quick bright flashs of white light(1-2 secs) about an hour apart from each other. I have no idea, completely stumped and a little shaken. Never seen anything like it. I just can&#39;t get over how intense and evenly distributed it was, and how it completely bathed the inside of my house in bright white light. It went from being total darkness to intense illumination that let me see the two rooms I was in completely clearly for 1-2 secs and then back to total darkness!<n>

I realized also that the craft was flying way too low for faa regs. Then I noticed that the craft was shaped in a triangle or arrowhead. It was flying very fast and very smooth motion, straight line. i ran inside and alerted the other 3 who ran outside just in time to see that it was a triangle craft, that it made no sound, that it was flying very fast and very low, and that it was flying away from our home towards Ft.

7/10/08 23:00|Southlake|TX|Light|25-30 seconds|Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed!|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64453.html|368|ndxe200807| Witnessed UFO stationairy, begin to slowly move, went near vertical and literally climbed out of the atmosphere at incredable speed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had stepped outside onto my back 2nd story porch for a cigarette and stood and admired the sky and stars as I do everynight. A particularly bright object that appeared to be a star or planet caught my attention and I proceeded to stare at it. The object was stationairy and appeared no different looking than a bright star so I quickly dimissed it. The object was stationairy from the time I came out onto the porch and first noticed it (10-15 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was directly East of my location and situated high in the sky, about 25-30 degrees off of being directly vertical over me and at a 70-75 degree angle in the sky off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to look away and stare at another patch of sky when I noticed that the object started moving to the North. It moved slowly and at a constant speed in a straight line at a constant altitude, which made me think that maybe it was an airplane coming to or from DFW airport which is very close. But the object appeared to be at very high altitude, higher than I&#39;ve ever seen a plane fly, and as I scrutinized it I could not see any blinking lights that distinguish aircraft and are usually visible at any altitude. The object was a solid and constant sphere shaped light that again looked similar to a bright star. It quickly became obvious it was NOT an airplane but I still didn&#39;t think UFO. So then I start thinking I&#39;m seeing a satellite or something go overhead in orbit. I continue observing the object move East to North across the sky expecting to watch it (thinking its a satellite) arch across the sky. But after 8-10 seconds of slow moving predictable flight the object began to move erraticly and looked to be gaining altitude because the object was getting dimmer and dimmer the higher and further away it got from me. The object also began to accellerate, slowly at first while it zigzagged but then it really started picking up speed! I mean at the high altitude the object was at, for it to move that fast across the sky it must&#39;ve been doing incredible speed. I have never seen something accellerate so fast! As the object accellerated it climbed near vertical and, well, &#34;ascended into space&#34; is the best way I could describe it. It did NOT continue travelling across the sky, it accellerated to unbelievable speed and went near vertical and appeared to rapidly climb out of the atmosphere. IT DID NOT just disappear behind some trees or over the horizon, it went near straight UP and disappeared overhead as it accellerated away! When I saw the object start to move like gravity didn&#39;t effect it, and move as unbeilveably fast as it did, an icy ball materialized in my stomach, and I felt genuine fear rush over ! me like a wave, when it became obvious that this could not possibly be a plane or satellite. I saw it, it&#39;s real! Total event time 25-30 seconds from the time I came onto the porch and witnessed the object stationairy (10-15 secs) start to move slowly (8-10 secs) and then zigzag, climb, and accelerate upward near vertical until out of sight overhead (3-5 secs).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: I live within 10 miles of DFW airport and I see dozens of planes fly overhead everyday. I was born and raised here 24 years and have always seen and been used to aircraft going overhead every couple minutes 24/7, 365. The only day in my entire life that I have not seen an airplane in the sky is 9/11/2001.  My father is a 30 year veteran 777 captain for American Airlines, so I&#39;ve been raised on planes, and can identify almost any aircraft (military or civilian) if shown a picture of it. I am personally a Baylor University Student studying International Relations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After playing with the dog for about five minutes I asked my daughter to help with the groceries I had brought home.  She took 3 bags into the house and went off to do something else.  I stayed outside as my mother pointed my attention to the ¾ moon rising in the on this gorgeous evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I acknowledged the moon, which was rising between two trees and was 40 degrees above the horizon, but then I noticed a very bright object almost directly overhead.  It was very bright, as bright as the moon, and was approximately 80 degrees above the horizon.  As I looked at it, I noticed it did not seem to be moving at all.  Also, it did not seem round-it looked rectangular in shape though it was very small and distant.  I’ve seen the space shuttle in the sky and, to me it looked like that kind of object-something definitely in our orbit, however, it wasn’t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my mother who acknowledged seeing it and asked her to keep an eye out for it as I went inside, dropped off grocery bags and rounded up my binoculars.  This took about 3 minutes.  When I came back out it was still there and still very bright.  I gazed at it some more with the binoculars and also gazed at the moon.  I also gave the glass to my mother who also took a look.  This went on for about 5 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were talking about it I got distracted and looked down at the dog who was running around the yard.  I turned around and looked up again, and it had completely disappeared.  Within a span of about 7 to 10 seconds, it was nowhere to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t believe my eyes.  This object which was so bright (against a bright evening sky) and not circular in nature, which I observed just sitting there for approximately fifteen minutes just disappears within seven to ten seconds.  I truly believe I have seen something extraterrestrial.<n>

I turned my head and a bit above the horizon i saw a dot, it was a black dot just staying there barely moving.  I turned and told my family, when i looked it had moved closer towards the coast of fuerteventura, which was in view in the distance, moments later my dad spotted the tiny dot in the sky, so i knew it was not an illusion, i kept staring at it, i got my camera but when i looked through the camera, it was not visible, so i knew a photo was useless then in an blink eye it vanished, and i know it was not falling behind the horizon as it was to far above the horizon.<n>

The obvious explanation is that there was some water/ice crystals between myself and the sun. I went in to get my camera to see if I could take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took five pictures from 18 mm to 55 mm at slightly different angles, using automatic and A/DEP modes on my Canon EOS Rebel XT Digital camera. I saved the three most interesting images, taken about a minute apart starting at 13:46.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the images I noticed a really unusual part to the first image only. It looks like an old Mercury Space Capsule on reentry, only upside down from my point of view. I printed the pictures including two versions of the first one with zoom. Unfortunately I only used the 3 meg resolution of the Canon’s 8 meg possible so the zoomed images are pretty fuzzy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was looking up at the stars and was looking for meteors. I scanned the whole sky. I looked to the east at about 22 degrees to the east and about 12 degrees to the south from where I was standing from an over head view I suddenly saw four yellowish lights in formation of two even followed by two even. The third was between the first two and the fourth was equidistant as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation looked like this:  xxxxxxxUxxxxxxxU   xxxUxxxxxxxU  The U&#39;s represent the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and they had to be at least 6 miles up or more. Since it was night it is difficult to tell, but planes at less than that give sound. They were moving at 1/2 meteor speed across the sky. Nothing moves that fast. Aurora is mach 7 from what is documented to the public(replacement for blackbird). I just called the airport and talked with some personal as I was writing this. They say you can hear planes at 40,000 feet. There was no sound. The covered the sky 12 degrees from the overhead to 55 degrees or more in about 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airport called me back and said they put it in the log.  I will also be contacting the FAA, not for an admission from them but to let them know of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We either we have something that moves at mach 25 plus or it was not of our earth.  This was not a natural formation of any kind.  I have seen hundreds of meteors of all kinds and some people might classify them as something but I knew they were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reporting I went back outside and looked up.  I saw a plane very clearly cover the same space.  I could see the wings and it was not coming in for a landing but was moving across the same area but much lower.  There was no sound so this passenger jet had to be 35,000 to 40,000 feet or more.  It took over 40 seconds to transverse the same space at a lower altitude.  Say the passenger jet moves at the standard speed of 500MPH.  1/2 of 40 is 20 for 1000MPH, 1/2 of 20 is 10 for 2000MPH, 1/2 of 10 is 5 for 4000MPH, 1/2 of 5 is 2.5 for 8000MPH, 1/2 of 2.5 is 1.25 for 16,000MPH.  This was the distance covered but the altitude must was much higher.  There is indeed only two options here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like science.  I aced the geometry regents exam in high school.  I have been doing the work of systems analysis for 20 plus years in computer systems and logic is what I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She had starred at it for about 10 minutes noticing occasional white and blue flashes from all sides of the original light, along with the light darting up, down, left, and right, and then back to it&#39;s original position leaving a bright blue tail when it moved. Then it stopped and seemed to have a bright beam of white light shining beneath it for about three seconds but did not shine to the ground. She didn&#39;t say anything right away, but asked me to just look at it thinking it was just a star and her eyes may be playing tricks. I starred for a good 10 to 15 minutes also and when we started telling each other what we saw our stories started to match in a very weird way. So we both kept watching it for about another five minutes, both of us getting a very strange feeling and both getting goose bumps all over our bodies. Then it darted and flashed one more time and it was gone. It just disappeared. We tried to find in again but it was no where in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were 5 or 6 of them in a cluster and then one trailing. They were moving rapidly to the north. I had only about a 30 degree window of sky from the edge of my roof to the tree line. I live just southeast of the San Antonio airport and they were moving at 10 degrees north just west of the north star Polaris. At arms length they covered an area about the size of my thumb. Before they reached the treeline it seemed the one in the rear had caught up with the main group. There was no sound. My wife and I witnessed something of the same sort back sometime late April or early May in the evening right after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw the Moon was in a very strange location and which seemed to be interacting with a cloud face. I alos noticed a bright light a large distance to the r ight of the moon which I thought might be a star. I stood there for a few sconds and out of nowhere another bright light appeared to the right of that light. I went to get my camera because I had seen this same event several months before but on a very clear night and at 03:30. When I got outside with my camera, there now was a total of four lights forming a &#34;V&#34; with the tip pointing up to the ski, and lacking one light to make a perfect shaped &#34;V&#34;. As I attempted to focus my camera on the sighting, the lights were gone. I served time in the USAF as a jet engine mechanic, grewup an airforce brat in the same branch. I have been around and interested in aircraft my whole life and I know of no aircraft that acts or reacts in the manner I have discribed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sure enough a long V shape-like how geese fly in the shy when flying away for the season-but there was no sounds coming for it. It was also see though with a pitch white color and very dim lights.

Tonight I saw an amber colored light over the eastern mountains.  It hovered briefly then became brighter.  It moved very fast at a 45 degree angle and rushed toward the ground.  It was moving so fast I thought it was a meteor.  As it traveled down, behind it appeared 5 other amber lights.  These lights did not move, but remained stationary in the path of the light.  The moving amber light stopped briefly then shot up very quickly in a semi circular path leaving more lights.  At the top it stopped again and dove straight down with no additional lights.  The lights that were on went off in succession.  During my drive thru the desert I have seen meteorites, and shooting stars.  I have seen flares over the base in 29 Palms.  This was unlike anything I have ever witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very close to the ground to be a plane and was moving at speeds that were unthinkable.  It was brighter than a full moon and about half the size.  It flew over me then stopped in mid-air.  It waited for 15 seconds, then abruptly moved very fast to the left.  It floated for another 10 seconds and then miraculously the light when dark.  It vanished just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Another thing i found odd was i was in a back parking lot with only two cars in it and when the object disappeared both of the car alarms went off without any outside interference.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was headed northbound. In the northwestern sky (a bit to my left out my car window), I noticed some new lights (it&#39;s a regular commute) over the top of some trees. I know you know where this is going, ha ha. Too big to be a radio tower, and stationary, so not an airplane. I, of course, used these two anchors of logic to dissuade me from what I thought I was actually seeing, but it was when I made out a chassis that my foot hit the brake and I slowed to a crawl.... it was wobbling... I started screeching all kinds of disbelieving profanities and I KNOW someone else saw it because as I was swerving off the road I saw another car wandering off to the side of the road as well, and they quickly passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was triangular, dark and metallic, very sleek and smooth, with three white lights at each vertex and a concave red light, and it seemed blurry because the darn thing was wobbling a bit. I forced myself to look at the road and was surprised to find an unnatural glow around myself and the car, and as it grew brighter, I brought my eyes upward and caught it above my windshield and I craned my neck and promptly began to panic because the craft was now above my car, silent, higher up in the air but still too close for comfort, 500 feet perhaps.... I&#39;m a horrid judge of distance....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this moment I smelled, yes I know.... sulfur.... something like sulfur, so strong I held my hand over my face. I was fixated on the craft, but I had to look at the road.... kept swerving once again, thank goodness the road was now empty, and, yes, of course, when I looked back up it was gone. Nowhere in the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Anyways, this happened when I was out in the desert of Kuwait near FOB Yankee.  It was around 2100 and I was getting ready for bed.  I layed down in the cab of my 7ton truck on my back and looked up to the sky.  I&#39;ve always had a fascination with astrology and I looked to find the big dipper which was really big tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, as I was looking at the constellation I noticed a bright, white light in the sky that was moving.  It didn&#39;t have any blinking lights and it was bright than the stars around it.  I figured it was a satellite or something so I just watched it move.  All of a sudden, the object slowed down which I thought was odd.  After about a minute the object sped up again.  Then for no reason it slowed down for a second time.  Another minte or so passed and the object sped up again.  The object then slowed down a third time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, for no reason at all the object started to disappear from where it was, getting smaller and smaller and leaving what looked like an after-burn trail.  This was all going on for about seven minutes.  Coincidently as the object was disappearing, two jets (which looked like military jets) came into the area that the object was in and circled the area for about five minutes or so and then just left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was odd that the object I was looking at disappeared as soon as the two jets came into the area.  This occured around 21:07.  After that I was talking with one of my buddies about it and alal of a sudden I got really tired.  I then went back to my cab and layed down.  And for no reason it felt like I could lift any of my limbs.  It was like I was a dead weight and it was the strangest feeling I&#39;ve ever felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up about an hour later with a jump, kind of like when somebody sneaks up from behind you and scares you.  It was the weirdest feeling because I don&#39;t remember falling asleep at all and I was wide awake when I did wake up.  I don&#39;t remember a thing from when I layed down for a two minutes to waking up.  I know it&#39;s a stretch but that&#39;s what I felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Did not float away like a typical helium balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a hallucination or anything close. However, it first appeared like just a basic (foil) balloon that was shaped like a sun...round with a bunch of pointed things.  Like a disk-star shape. After watching it, it didn&#39;t float up any higher, or come down any lower. It just hovered and drifted. My daughter, coincidentally, saw the same object...reported to me later. She saw it about 1/2 mile from where I was . Thought it was very unusual...as it seemed to be controlled in the way it was hovering...it was very peculiar. Looked like it was being remotely controlled and it was not too high up (maybe 500 feet- maximum).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured take Jennings because it seems to be a little bit quicker then route 62. I spotted a couple deer on the side of the road so I figured drive a little slower and be a little more observant because all I need to do is hit a deer and total my car on what always seems like no traffic road. Way before the 45mph area I noticed three orange lights in the sky in a horizontal line with the center light being larger and brighter then the other two. At first I thought whoa that’s a bright airplane and just ruled it off as just that a bright airplane. I drove for a couple more seconds then looked again out of curiosity and noticed it was moving towards Springville and not the Buffalo airport and that the lights were constant and not flashing. This observation caused me to slow down to almost a stop, now my curiosity was peaked, what could this be I thought. So I figured after another couple seconds of driving to just stop and watch it. I pulled over and put on the emergency flashers and got out of my car and climbed on to the roof to get a better view. This craft seemed to moved very slowly for about 5 minutes and then suddenly it stopped moving over what seemed liked woods from my point of view. By this time I was looking more towards Hamburg rather then Buffalo and was getting rather excited. After what seemed like another 5 minutes I got a little too excited and had to take a puff on my inhaler. About another 10 minutes passed and then suddenly all the lights on this craft simultaneously turned bright metallic blue color and then it suddenly vanished, this whole process took at max a minute and well scared me half to death so I got back in my car called my friend told him I would be a little late and left in a hurry. To clarify things it stayed stationary in the sky for 15 minutes then its lights turned metallic blue and it vanished and by vanished I mean it just basical! ly was t here one second and then gone the next leaving no trail no flash no nothing just gone. Now I&#39;ve seen planes before at night being as they fly over my friends house and that definitely wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I watched for twenty minutes.  During that time there was no movement, other than a slight shimmering.  I then went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is no joke.

I noticed what looked like an extremely bright star, but then realized it couldn&#39;t have been a star as I had never, ever seen one this bright. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look - it was hard to see cuz it was night time but I could see the object was like 2 white orbs on top of each other, and it was hovering stationary over the lake! There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, a red orb appears directly below the white orb and starts flying around at incredible speed. I watched for several seconds in disbelief and then ran upstairs to grab my camera, which has a crappy video mode also. I was able to capture about 15 seconds (the limit on my camera) of the red orb (the white one wasn&#39;t easily visible against the backdrop of the stars).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell the two objects were miles away, but the red orb moved across the lake in a split second - it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. Soon afterwards the red orb appeared to go above the white, stationary orb and then disappeared from view. I was shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video attached is very low quality and only the red orb is visible moving around. I have no idea whether this was a camera defect but it was NOT a firefly - that was what I thought originally until it was obviously acting under intelligent control and interacting with the white orb. I am willing to send the video I have to anyone interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/7/08 23:08|Huddersfield (UK/England)||Triangle|3 minutes|Multi lighted saucer shape doing zigzag flights over English deserted moor|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64399.html|398|ndxe200807| Multi lighted saucer shape doing zigzag flights over English deserted moor<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving with friend in a westerly direction (from Huddersfield to Manchester) direction when I got to grid reference 53 34&#39;09.47N    1 50&#39;33.28w , my passenger pointed out 2 or 3 orange lights in the sky from the south near the horizon among the white stars but looked totally different to them. It was shining a search light down at the gound like a police helicopter. Despite the fact that this high point (nearly 2000 ft above sea level) never getting any air traffic, we assumed that this was a plane, until we saw how quickly the object was approaching. (horizon to 5 miles away in 10 seconds. I stopped the car on the road got out and noticed the object go straight up thousands of feet then went about 1 mile to the right and up a few thousand feet again all in 2 seconds. It stayed still for 30 seconds and did the same manouvre again, just higher in the sky, and then vanished like an extinguised light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was easy to see as it was in the countryside with no visual pollution from nearby houses or street lighting as it is in the middle of desolate wasteland moors. The object seemed to be triangular or saucer shaped, with one big yellow light and a small smaller light either side. The base had many small lights which were moving and gave the impression that the object was spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very nervous about describing the object because it appeared to change it&#39;s form a few times as it drew closer. Maybe because the eye sees what it wants to see to compare with items it already knows and imagination fills in the spaces ?. I have no idea what it was but I do know that it is impossible that anything from this planet to travel at this speed or change direction so easily. Estimated speed 5000 mph ?  My friend lives near there and noticed it come back after 15 minutes to repeat the actions previously listed. It was hovering around for about 30 minutes this time presumably because there were no car headlights around ?<n>

It also seemed to move slowly up and down and left to right in a series of right angle patterns. The object was surrounded by stationary helicopters in a rectangular formation (they were easy to see with their red blinking lights and were not airliners heading to Dulles or National airports which we&#39;ve seen before). A few times at least one or two helicopters moved closer to the object at which time it would decrease its glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camcorder and recorded between 10 to 15 minutes of footage, first by hand from the bedroom window, then using a steady tripod outside in our cul-de-sac. When I zoomed in the object was distinctly diamond shaped with pulsating light moving across the object in a circular motion (white, red, yellow, and greenish). The light was not sequential as if a series of lights were being lit but more like a morphing prism of blended light colors rolling into each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in the six or more years I&#39;ve lived at this address (or anywhere else for that matter) and we routinely see jets, helicopters, and even the occasional blimp overhead as we live about 5 miles north of the Quantico Marine Base and 10 miles south of Fort Belvoir. We also live along the flight paths of Reagan National and Dulles International airports. So, we have a pretty good idea of what normally appears in the sky around our home which is why this just stood out as something very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the weather conditions, other than being a bit humid, the sky was crystal clear and the moon was clearly visible behind me to the southeast as I filmed the object which was northeast of our house. Other stars and aircraft (including the previously mentioned helicopters) were also clearly visible and easy to distinguish from the glowing diamond-shaped object in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my background, I work for a major university in Washington, DC with a long career in media and public affairs. My wife and I have a fairly decent knowledge of the night sky and the various aircraft in the area and frequently observe meteor showers, shooting stars when they are forecast for our area (not too mention extended viewings of the Hale-Bopp Comet when we lived in North Carolina) which really made this object all that more unusual to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Downs at Super Walmart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out of WALMART, and I saw a bubble... or so I thought. At first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50&#39; ahead of me. I kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as I stared at the bubble I wondered &#34;how would a bubble survive out here too long? I walked expecting to see it burst any second. It didn&#39;t. As I watched it... I then saw it wasn&#39;t a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. I stood next to my car. The attached photo is my Photoshop rendering of what I saw, and its pretty accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had been cloudy and drizzy, and there was a low canopy of clouds. I noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third in front. No lights blinking. The lights were very clear, and not like you&#39;d expect headlights on a plane. I listened for sound and heard nothing. Then I suspected I was seeing something unusual. I then checked and nothing blinking, no stobe, no red beacon. The lights were not REAL bright but were very pronounced resolution-wise... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. The blueish round lights seem to be directional, like laser light travels, defined. The seemed about 2.5 or 3 feet in diameter. Then as it started to get over top and past Walmart I knew it was not a plane or chopper. I suspected it was a Black Triangle and I watched to see SOMETHING that would reveal it. Then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to STOP... it ascended straight up. I appeared to travel UP faster than it did since I spotted it traveling a horizotal flight path. As it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn&#39;t turn nose up to ascend. The bottom stayed facing the earth. It went up what looked like around 700-1000&#39; until it pierced the cloud cover and disappeared.  It made no noise. I detected no outline/SHAPE to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. A plane climbing like that would have made noise!!! This thing moved silent;y and very SMOOTHLY. It matched the Triangle video taped at Wesley Chapel a couple months ago... VERY close... minus the blinking read light and the bottom lights were a wider diameter.<n>

Noticed white and red light alternating til it got withing a better eyesight and then notice blue and green lights alternating.

Since it was night, it just looked like lights in the shape of a triangle. It stayed above a gas station, not moving. It looked like it was a small &#34;craft&#34;. Only 15 feet long maybe. It was about 50 yards high in the air. After about 30 seconds of just floating above the gas station it started moving North-Northwest. It wasn&#39;t going very fast, maybe 30 mph. It then went out of sight above the tops of houses. No sound like a helicopter, but floated and moved slowly so it couldn&#39;t have been a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We only saw one object. At first we saw it out of the corner of our eyes, so we decided to watch to see if it did it again, and it did. We were hoping there were other people at the lake that saw it, but we&#39;re not sure if there was. The object hovered above the mountains and lit up blue, green, and yellow. The lights were extremely bright. Once in a while, it would only light up one of the three colors. The Object kept going up and down in a vertical movement. We go night fishing there a lot and all the times we went in the past, we never saw anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was observed from the area of 3180 south 600 west, New Palestine and appeared about 35 degrees above the horizon straight west of our location towards Indianapolis.  This thing according to our best guess was many thousands of feet in the air and didn’t move or make a sound for over forty-five minutes.  The two attached pictures were taken with a digital camera with a 12X zoom lens an about fifteen minutes apart and yet it didn’t change its orientation the entire time.  About 9:15 it abruptly started moving away from us and dropped below the horizon.  At first we thought it had to be some type of helicopter but as you can see from the pictures, it wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still light out (sea blue sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking the initial photo I checked it in the review screen (digital camera)and saw that there was an object in the picture that did not appear to have been in the sky at the time I took the picture, or afterwards, when I checked the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 4 more photos and the craft is present in 3 of the shots. In the remaining 2 there is a cloud that seems to have &#34;absorbed&#34; the craft. Upon enlarging the photos and examining the details, I found that this almost perfectly circular cloud was present to the lower right of the craft in all of the photos that had the craft in them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon examining the photos in the order they were taken, in the first three, the craft seems to have moved in a v pattern in the sky. Then in the fourth the cloud becomes prominent and the craft is gone. This is more evident in the fifth shot, where the cloud is seen very prominently at the top of the photo as if it was rising upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night I took more photographs of the same area and although I did in fact capture this cloud once again, the same craft does not appear to have been present at that time. Although two smaller objects, that were present in the 7/7/08 shots, were in fact visible and were photographed on this day as well. I did visibly see in the sky, which did not move in conjunction with regular star patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon enlargement of the 7/7/08 photos, what may be the most clear view of an unknown craft can be seen. It appears to have changed its alignment in all three photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one it appears to be two diamond shaped objects that are connected at some center point. There is a light on each side (almost as if a flame exhaust) that obscures detail of the craft and it is a brilliant white in the center with a almost electric blue peaking at the top and at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the second photograph, the vessel is more prominent and appears to be more like two Isosceles triangles on the sides connected by a tube or cone like center. The lighting on the craft is more of a greenish white on both sides at what would be the base of the triangles, which escalates into a definite electric blue at the tips. the center seems to be reflecting the light from the sides. the final photo (which is actually the second) gives the clearest view of all. It would appear to be two side propulsion elements attached to a main structure in the center. The sides appear to be shaped like the front of a clothes iron with the exact detail of the center is definitely rounded in some way, but is obscured somewhat by the light emanating from the sides. The entire craft has a green glow to it, that seems to come from two dome like elements atop the side structures. They glow the color of a green GE &#34;party bulb&#34;and have an electric blue &#34;aura&#34; above them. i would like to include a website where the pictures have been posted as well as a video I am in the process of making with closeup shots of the craft, however to keep anonymity, I obviously can not. I will check this site more closely to see if there is some way I can link the site to this site or have the link posted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have over 1000 photographs of the same area and am diligently examining all them ( I have already found additional images that may contain a similar, or the same object and/or its lighting track.) This is absolutely not lens glare a reflective surface or any other such camera &#34;tricks&#34; that are frequently attributed to such photos. The photos were all taken at 100 ISO which would have required the objects to be remaining relatively still (or moving very slow) due to the shutter speed. Photographs of airplanes moving through the air taken at this setting, will appear as a streak of light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have your e-mail and will submit some photos to add to this report after they have been properly processed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/7/08 16:30|New Palestine|IN|Other|aboout 45 mins|I couldn't believe what we were seeing in daylight. It was a large metallic object that just hovered for over 30 minutes|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64447.html|408|ndxe200807| I couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing in daylight. It was a large metallic object that just hovered for over 30 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, July 7th, I was moving into my dad&#39;s house, as I was putting stuff into my room my dad yelled for me and my brother to come outside and look at something.  As we came outside to see what he was talking about he pointed.  We all just stared, trying to figure out what it was.  My first thought, by the weird shape it was, is that it was a kite. It was just hovering, then I realized there was very little wind (pretty much none), so I ran inside to grab the camera so we could get a better look.  After trying to get a good look at it, we realized it was too far away for a good picture of it, so my brother ran inside to grab the binoculars. When he was grabbing the binoculars we went into the back to have a better view, without the house in the view. My brother came outside with them and all of us were looking through them in disbelief. We noticed one of our neighbors that lived on the other side of the pond was out fishing, which is a teacher from our community, and asked him if he had noticed it. He responded by saying &#34;yes, but what is it?&#34; He observed for a few minutes then went inside. I suggested calling a news station to report it but they would probably think we are nuts, so we called the local police station to ask if anyone has reported a strange aircraft in the sky. They had told us no and to call the F.F.A., we didn&#39;t want to go that far but proceeded to call the local airport, but there was no answer. My dad ended up taking a couple of picture of it to see what we could get out of it. As it started to get dark we had noticed it had changed directions a little and started to shift. When it started to disappear my brother and dad went to go chase after it down one road running east and west and I went to another road a mile away running the same direction so we could try to keep it in eyes sight but it was gone. The funny thing is, is that this was during the daylight, plains were flying lower than it was hovering, and there was nothing in the paper or the news about it. I wou! ldn&#39;t sa y i wasn&#39;t a believer, but I was a skeptic on things such as U.F.O.s and now seeing what I had saw,and then seeing pictures that had been taken and downloaded on the computer it was obvious the shape it was, was like nothing I had ever seen before, it was extremely quiet, there was no motors or propellers. The best two ways I can describe it, is that one way it looked like a fighter jet nose, then behind where the cockpit would be, it was twisted, then the wings, of whatever it was, was almost in a v shape but not quite, it looked like a piece of metal was crunched up and it came out to be in a crumpled but smooth v shape. It is so hard to explain. The other way I can describe it, it looked like a goose flying, but 10,000 times larger and it definitely appeared to be metallic and had straight lines. I will be keeping my eye on the sky but not to become obsessed about it.<n>

The weather was warm and the sky was clear blue with a few white clouds. The air was calm with little if any wind.A friend and I were sitting in a parking lot located on Lakeshore Blvd in Toronto – directly in front of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my memory recalls there were not a lot of people around as it was a workday at 2:30 p.m. As my friend and I were talking I noticed something up in the sky. It was high up in the clouds way above the local birds flying around. The shape was a diamond, with black and red checkers. There was only one of these objects present. At first I assumed it was a kite, but it was up in the same location moving slowly from side to side for about 30 minutes. After taking the first picture on my camera and zooming in, I realized there was no string attached to this object or ties like a kite would have. There was also no one in our radius that could be flying a kite at this time. The object swayed around for about 30 minutes and than disappeared. I did not directly see it disappear but after watching it for a while I got bored and would occasionally glance up at it. Eventually it was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought maybe it landed/fell to the ground. But when we searched there was nothing in sight that resembled that object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have emailed the four pictures I have to the email provided below.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The second time I heard it, I got out of bed and walked outside.  I looked up and saw a triangular craft with lights on each corner that looked like it was at least 400 - 500 feet up and flying at a very slow speed which looked to me to be around 60 - 70 mph.  The sound it was making was so weird I can&#39;t really describe it like I heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying in a circle with a circumference of about 3 miles and did this for at least 20 minutes.  It would fly directly over my house.  I even got my video camera out and shot some video, but I don&#39;t think it will turn out since it was very dark and my camera couldn&#39;t focus on anything.  At one point, there was even a different small 2 or 4 seater airplane that flew under this object at a normal speed and about 300 or so feet below the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then flew in a few oblong circles until it then started to fly in a straight line away from my house at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It got louder, but then it did not pass as jet sounds usually do.  Then it stayed in the area, likely within a mile of my house near Bradford college.  It seemed to stay mostly in the same spot, but occasionally sound got louder or quieter, and sound direction changed about 10 to 20 degrees (on a compass).   It was so loud my wife heard it with all the windows closed and Air conditioner on.  I don&#39;t know why more people did not wake up.   I couldn&#39;t see anything, although it was a little cloudy on the horizon.  When I went outside I thought I could feel the turbulence in the air.  Sometimes the turbine sound was joined by a high pitched whirr.  But the turbine sound was a much lower frequency than that of large passenger jets, which made me think it had to be a very very large turbine.  The sounds lasted for about 30 minutes, then went away, then came back just as loud around 1am for another 10 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/6/08 23:00|New Albany|IN|Fireball|2 Mins|Fire in the sky over Indiana|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64494.html|415|ndxe200807| Fire in the sky over Indiana<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:00pm July 6th 2008 in New Albany Indiana me and my kids along with my nephew and GF saw the similar thing. It all started in the same kind of fashion.  I as well was being entertained with the neighbors fireworks, when all of the sudden what appeared to be a plane on fire was in the sky in front of me.  the reason I say on fire was because of the unusual orange lights.  Since I&#39;ve never seen anything like it I immediately thought of fire. It appeared that the front right engine was on fire because of the concentration of light on that area. The lights were very bright but thats when things got strange. One why would lights on a plane if not fire be pointing upword more than down.  Two at that point it was moving so slowly just a straight path no funny movements but I&#39;m still thinking plane on fire . Then I realized NO NOISE which would mean the plane should be coming down (no sound = no engine). But in fact it stayed at the same highth the whole time. I told my nephew to go get everybody else they had to see this.  The &#34;plane&#34; was directly above us at this time. still no noise. But maintained an altitude of what I assumed even using a single engine plane for reference of about 10-15,000ft. My GF was amaized at what she saw, normally being the skeptical one, so much so that she didn&#39;t want it to scare the children so she took them inside. once the &#34;plane&#34; was past it just all of the sudden disappeared...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know it was nothing that I have or will ever see again knowing that it wasn&#39;t identifiable by me.  After it disappeared I actually hopped on my Motorcycle and went to the Clark County Airport expecting to see some type of search plane which is normally done in a single engine plane crash but they acted like they saw nothing.  At this point my mind even though I&#39;m open to anything still didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t wrap around seeing a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However I noticed a lot of what appeared to be satellites (white dots, star like) zipping across the sky in all directions it seemed every few minutes another one would cross the viewfinder path moved to quickly to see through telescope so I grabbed my binoculars some would disappear or fade out before 15* to horizon other would make it all the way assuming they continued I can only follow to about 5 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still curious I grabbed my night vision Single Scope made in Russia night Owl optics Give a pretty big view plus 10 x 35 mag. I haven’t found away to take pics through it but will come up with something what I saw was pretty amazing, I aimed into the sky ( above my head) then flipped on infrared within a minute I began seeing moving white dots (all stars look like white dots through the night vision some lager then others, lots of them) I was telling myself this must be normal a lot of debris up there.  NORAD claims to be track like 9000 pieces perhaps it was the suns reflection hitting this debris? I don’t know, will invest in a night vision camera<n>

Immediately I noticed a bright round &#34;star&#34; looking object flying above and behind the jet and catching up in speed. The object speed up to the jet and started to turn right, and the same time the round object began to slow down and speed up very quickly.  The object appeared to be &#34;playing&#34; with the jet.  The jet must have been cruising at mach speeds and flying above 60,00 feet. The object itself was much higher and traveling much faster.  This was  an amazing sighting to see in miami , FL.  Both objects were very high and small, however it was very obvious to me that the first craft was indeed a military jet as for commercial airliners DO NOT fly this high. The 2nd object was indeed quite amazing. This easily could have been a ufo breaking into U.S airspace, and jets being scrambled to intercept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This light would blink about every other second, but what I experienced  was the speed of this light. The distance between each blink of light was incredible.  I saw this light coming from the south moving north in a straight line and lasted four to five seconds before disappearing in the distance.

When almost to Chillicothe, my friend with me in the back seat mentioned that he had been watching a strange light in the sky for a couple of minutes. Out of curiosity, we all looked. It was a bright, yellowish light, far brighter than any star in the sky. It seemed to be at high altitude, but I can&#39;t be positive as we could easily see it move back and forth ahead of us. During the first 10 minutes of observing, it would be bright and then dim itself until you could not see it anymore. It would then light itself back up in a different area of the sky than it was before. After the &#39;cycles&#39; it stayed brightly lit and hovered around. We seemed to get fairly close to it at times while driving, but not close enough to identify a shape. My friends claimed to see a seperate light protude from it at one point, but I did not witness this as I was sitting on the other side of the backseat during that time.

After I saw it I immediately got up and looked everywhere for the light. I couldn&#39;t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very dark outside, no lights, and only a couple of stars (or planets) were out that night. I was shocked. I&#39;ve been debating over the past two years if it really was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when I saw a show on the history channel of &#34;glowing lights&#34; flying across the sky at night. I knew it had to be.

Several times he has told me that he sees a “UFO” in the sky. Well, last night he dragged me outside to look. I have to admit I was intrigued. As we looked to the south sky you can plainly see a very bright light, this light has rays from it (you can see blue rays if you look closely). This light will stay in one place and then move to any side or up and down quickly. There is no sound heard. It does not move at a constant pace as an aircraft would- instead it just sits and then moves randomly. My son also witnessed it move rapidly one night at a diagonal angle straight toward the lake near where we live and disappear. This appears many nights near our home. We live in the Bixby/Leonard area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

7/5/08 22:35|Park  Ridge|IL|Sphere|22 minutes|((HOAX??))  It looked like lightening in a huge circular sphere.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64334.html|433|ndxe200807| Someone out there…help me out on this one.  I saw my first UFO as reported on June 17th, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that night, I spend about 1 hour per night watching the skies…hoping to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since June 17th…I swear I have seen white orbs between 9:25 pm and 10:35 pm Chicago time…every single night except one night.  In fact, I stopped reporting them as they became regular…and I am speaking to someone in a few days from MUFON.  Now…people have told me to get a photo or a video of it…and I have, and will download some of them as soon as I get access to a DVD drive…or have one installed.  But…tonight…I filmed a orange/white orb heading due north…pretty high altitude…and as reported…before…it stopped…and hovered.  But this time…it turned off the lights on the craft and it hovered somewhere.  I tried to re-acquire the orb for about 20 minutes with my video camera…but I lost it up there in the night sky soon after it stopped.  I kept looking.  Suddenly…just north of where I thought it stopped….The orb lit up the entire sky around it.  It was by far the biggest and brightest light that I have ever SEEN in my entire life.  It looked like lightening in a huge circular sphere.  It was lower than when I first filmed it too.  I swear I pulled up my camera…and it immediately shut off on me!!  It took off slowly for one second…and the 2nd second…it took off faster than anything I have ever seen fly before!!  It streaked away…with a huge white trailer. It is so frustrating…because even if I was totally ready…and the camera stayed on…I would have missed it…it was simply too fast…It was gone in a blink of an eye.  It makes me almost skeptical of other videos.  Who the hell can catch these things on film so easily?  I mean…who has a video camera on their shoulder all night long, like I just did for the last 4 days?  Now..I have said before…and now I am reporting again….watch the skies between 9:25 pm…and 10:35 pm…Chicago time…just east…and just south of the big dipper…and get on this site…and report it.  I have seen them start up from a dead stop…three times now…and it is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  It is not a shooting star or meteor for sure.  It is a craft…it hovered…shut the lights off…and s! tarted u p again…and took off.  Something is controlling it…and I just don’t think it is the TR3-B…unless it lights up like a lightening bolt.  I will take a polygraph and provide my video evidence soon.  2 or 3 fly by without stopping per night…sometimes they are real high…and sometimes…they are lower…and someone out there will see them for sure.  Report what you see to this site…no one believes me…and it is so frustrating…people think I am nuts….but it is the truth.  I DID catch the orb on film before the light went off…We will see how it looks later…I had the camera zoomed all the way in too. You can see it moving for sure.  Even if a skeptic was here tonight…and saw what I saw…he/she would believe from tonight on. Now…I finally know how other people who have witnessed these UFO’s feel…you cannot sleep…you sit up wondering what the hell it was.  I just don’t think it was human. Now…I am NOT a trained observer…but growing up five minutes from O’Hare Airport…I know what a plane looks like.  I lived in Arizona for 8 years, and I know full well what a meteor looks like.  This was neither…it was the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.  I would say that at the speed it was traveling…it go from Park Ridge, IL to Milwaukee in only a few minutes. If you are in the midwest...check the skies…for one hour...and you will see something for sure.  This could be something different than anything else before because it is CONSISTENTLY happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from the same source.

I had been star gazing and taking it all in and noticed 2 stars brighter then the brightest star on the clear night just above the trees.  We were facing West.    Hmmmm they were not there before ???    If you take a &#34;/&#34; one star at each tip perhaps one &#34;inch&#34; apart if you had a ruler at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed to them and my wife acknowledged them with ooo&#39;s and ahh&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the band and perhaps a minute later looked back at them.  They were still in the same area but only 3/4s as bright.  I thought this odd and again pointed to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we were both looking at them we commented &#34;There moving and fading&#34;  The movement seemed UP but again - using a ruler they probably moved 4 inches until the &#34;stars&#34; grew slammer and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was ISS with the Shuttle near by????   It was as bright as a month ago with ISS/Shuttle attached flew over.  I was sure it must be that.  We both have lived around airports all of our lives, we both agree there is no way they were aircraft.    The gap remained constant between the &#34;stars&#34; has they faded and shrank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet - upon investigation there were no satellites in the sky that night near us.  There were no tell tale colored lights from aircraft.  Perhaps F18 or F16 from Truax?  But we both do not think so.  Not afterburners as the color was white!  Not landing lights because the objects were coming towards us (west to east) and did not &#34;blink&#34; off.  Faded and dwindled in size while gap between remained exactly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dark night and you could see the shadow of the bank flag down the street through the night sky.  Looked up at the Big Dipper and watched as one star disappeared , then the other, and then they reappeared..  At that moment I saw a huge flying wing shape with spaced circles on the bottom of the wings.  It made no sound and I watched it for a while before it disappeared over the neighbors trees from sight..  There was a lot of ground light that may have helped illumination, but the absence of sound was weird.  A city airport is nearby and you hear the drone of small planes all the time, day and night.  Two nights later watched a small plane fly in and you could definitely hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

He said he had seen the ufo for the last 4 nights. I was skeptical, but followed him out to the parking lot. In the sky to the southwest was a hazy ember-colored light moving slowly to the east. The light pulsed evey two seconds and was about the size of a pea held at arm&#39;s length. Two other restaurant workers joined us. We remained mostly silent in order to try to hear the object- at no point did we hear any sound. I tried to sight it on my camera phone but could not pick it up. After about a minute, the object turned white for about two seconds and then resumed its initial color. The light did not illuminate any structure such as wings or a gondola and never blinked. There was a fairly uniform overcast at about 2-3000 feet and at no point was the light obscured by the clouds. After moving east for a few minutes the object decelerated and hovered. At this point I called my wife and told her to look south. The light moved slightly to the north and then turned white again. A soon as it had turned white, a smaller orange/red evenly pulsing light dropped from the white light and descended at an even rate until it disappeared from view behind the treeline. About half a second after the small light disengaged from the larger one, the larger one vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 10:00pm my cousin yelled out, What is that? I turned around to see a bright coma shaped white smudge in the sky about 40 degrees above the southeast horizon. It fell slowly downward and faded out. About 5 seconds later same exact light appeared again in the same spot. It faded out also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both turned to each other trying to figure out what it was. I looked back in the direction the lights were observed and saw 2 dirty orange lights. They were just below Jupiter. I grabbed my telescope to see what they were and looked thru the finder scope. Once I got top light in sight I looked thru my telescope and seen the object. It had five white lights in a diamond/bell formation with a large red light on the top. Observed for 5 seconds before it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look back to find it with my eyes and both were gone. Then one reappeared hover about 40 degrees above the horizon and moved left slowly and stopped. Then moved right very fast It began to pulsate white then turned bright red and disappeared to the south. Five minutes later another orange light appeared in the east sky. It would move a little to the south and stop. It did this for about 10 seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very disturbing and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I observe the night sky 3-5 times a week. I know what planes, jets, and helicopters look like. It looked like two object entering the atmosphere at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it was even with us, it turned to the north moving away from us and disappeared within a minute into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was iridescent changing from pink to red to orange and either had a beam that swept horizontally or a light source that moved around the belt of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound.

We were just outside of Blue, OK. We saw a red orb approximately 3-4 ft in diameter hovering right above power-lines beside the highway. I thought it was a firework at first, but as it continued to hover we stopped beside it.  As we stopped, I noticed it had a faint white glow around it. It slowly &#34;flew&#34; away. The entire encounter lasted around 2 minutes. I managed to get a photograph after several attempts. I took four pictures in total, but only one is clear enough to see. I have never seen anything like it. There were no flashing lights and no audible sound. If you have any idea what this was please let me know!! I hope that you can zoom in on my photo more than I was able to do. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Having dinner outside, my wife and I spot something floating in the sky - thought it was a balloon based on the &#34;orange flame&#34; we could see.  Got binoculars and there is no doubt in our mind that this was NOT a balloon and not man made.  It was rotating horizontally and looked like a jagged brown boulder.

It was very high in the sky but looked larger than an airplane and had no wings, etc.  We watched it for about 20 seconds until it suddenly vanished.  Looked cigar or oval shaped. THere was a circular ring auro or haze around the object. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All of a sudden this object moved leaving a tail behind it.  This object seem to know that I saw it.  It didn&#39;t move till I looked.<n>

We noticed a plane like craft that looked Silver in color, and it appeared to be at a high altitude like corporate jets usually travel at, maybe 50000 feet. There was no exhaust trail. We were walking along and talking, and looked up a few times. Then it was gone. It appeared to be traveling across our path at maybe a 45 degree angle from ground level. We continued looking for it for at least 5 minutes in a clear blue sky with no clouds. We were surprized it disappeared so quickly, and we were surprized there was no exhaust trail, although we have seen this before with some planes we thought they were probably corporate jets or military jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had one previous UFO sighting in November of 1971 near East Berne and Knox New York, and that report is also on file here at NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occurred at approx 7:30pm on July 5, 2008 in Guilderland New York.  I was visiting two of my sons.  My two sons, one of their wives, and I were all sitting in chairs in the back yard when one of my sons pointed up to the sky and said &#34;what is that?!&#34;  It looked like a bright round object, similar in size to the planet Venus or Mars when they&#39;re visible in the sky.  Except we first saw the object just above the tree line and it started to move upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that the object was about 10,000 feet up.  We watched a regular passenger jet fly right by it (but it looked as though the plane was at a different altitude).  So we continued to watch this object.  It moved higher very slowly.  It would sometimes stop and hover, then start moving up again.  No noise at all.  Then we witnessed a second UFO pass directly under the first object.  It was in the shape of a rod, cigar, or a surf board.  It was reddish-brown in color.  It streaked right below the first object to the east at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One son managed to find a pair of binoculars and looked at the first object in detail.  All he could see was that one side was brighter than the other.  One side looked speckled or blotched.  I don&#39;t know perhaps this could have been from the sun reflecting off of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one of my sons thought he saw what he described to be a puff of smoke coming from the bottom of the first glowing round object.  It started to move up again.  We observed it for a total of approx 15 minutes before it was so high up that we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I, along with my two sons would be more than willing to speak with you about this sighting.<n>
7/5/08 15:37|Canton|MI|Changing|2 minutes|silvery twinkle and slowly turned into a silvery doughnut shaped liquidly fluid like structure|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69471.html|450|ndxe200807| I am posting this ufo report now because I felt that I would not be believed at the time I witnessed it and for the simple fact that I wanted to research it furthermore before posting. In addition, I had posted a previous ufo report on 7-21-07; this was under the same circumstances and was titled on this web site “THE OBSERVANT SPHERE”.  This sighting, however, was no sphere and I will try to describe it to the best of my ability and maybe throw in my own judgment to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was 7-05-08 and I was, again, at my apartment pool in Canton Michigan; I was in the pool itself floating looking up towards the sky.  At first I was just looking at this hawk circling over head, watching it closely then something reflective caught my eye.  At that instant I stood up in the pool and rubbed my eyes to make sure that water was not causing me to see things then I peered up again and noticed that the object had become more visible.  I turned to this really attractive young woman and asked her if she could see what I saw.  At first she said “yea I see that bird”, and then I said “no… look higher” and she gasps saying “oh yea….what is that?”  At this point I realized I was not delusional from drinking heavily the day before.  Also at this point I noticed everyone at the pool starting to look up as well and I looked back up to view the object and noticed this: it started out stationary over I-275 and Ford road, as a silvery twinkle and slowly turned into a silvery doughnut shaped liquidly fluid like structure that seemed to reflect light very well.  At about a minute and thirty seconds past the first observance, the object started to rotate sideways until it became a twinkle again and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported ufo’s before but this was by far the strangest and most impressive.  After the sighting I ran back to my apartment and told my fiancé of what I had just witnessed and she believed me but my gut instinct was to research this a little more and wait for others to report it before making my own report.  I thought it was possible that it was unique weather phenomenon but after searching the web and Utube for doughnut ufo’s, I came to the conclusion that it was genuine.  I believe that what I observed was just the tip of the iceberg and that what ever I saw was somehow distorted by either its means of propulsion ”gravity?” or by its cloaking device.  I also believe that this is a repeated pattern and that there will be something in the skies above Ford road and I-275 sometime in July of 2009 probably around the time of 15:00-16:00 hrs, hopefully or I’m going to look bad. Maybe this year I will take my video camera to the pool, but that might look creepy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time<n>

I have never seen anything like it, I am 71 years old, it was not a balloon or fireworks,I can not explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Holly Road towards Holly Michigan. This event lasted 9-10 seconds. This incident occurred when I was under a mile away from Grange Hall Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming back from dropping off a volunteer that I work with at an art center in Davison. I didn&#39;t drink anything and wasn&#39;t on any medication or illegal drugs. I was drinking soda and I didn&#39;t feel that tired even though it was late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My speed was slower than the posted limit, about 45 on mph, and my brights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do this so I can be prepared when a deer decides to cross my path. No other vehicles were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving, I slowed down because there appeared to be a very large creature digging in someone&#39;s trash next to the right sight of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was located 20-25 feet away from my car. I began to slow down to get a better look. This thing was really tall and too huge to be any &#39;average&#39; animal that I normally see in roadside trash bins at night. My first thought that came to mind was, &#34;What is it??&#34; I remember calling out words of animals in my head to determine what this thing could be. I thought, &#34;rat no to big..kangaroo? Its grey! Red eyes..rabbit..no.not a cat..it jumps and leaps kind of like a rabbit...I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking at..can&#39;t be a Chupacabra??..Could it..In Michigan??&#34;  This creature was holding a piece of trash..didn&#39;t appear to have paws..<n> <n><n> <n><n> more slender hand-like. It had huge, round and red glowing eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reacted and looked kind of surprised to see me as if it thought no one will ever find out that it existed. That was my impression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its eyes just stared at my vehicle while holding onto a piece of trash for nearly 4 seconds. Its triangular like grey face reminded me of a dog but it was more pointer and triangular towards the end of the nose and mouth. Its presence didn&#39;t seem ordinary and those gigantic glowing red eyes made me feel something was out of place here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its ears were large and rounded sort of like a mouse. Its arms were bendable and closer to its body then its long flexible legs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The body was heavier in the bottom and kind of reminded me of a kangaroo body but he was completely grey. Maybe, grey short haired fur I am not sure, but the body was definitely grey in color. It had a skinny tail that was similar in appearance to a rat&#39;s tail but it was much longer and slightly wider. I barely noticed the creature&#39;s tail until it maneuvered out of the way from the garbage can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In summary, this is the way the creature reacted when I came upon it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the creature digging in the garbage and it was holding a piece of trash. It stared at me for 3-4 seconds then dropped the trash forcefully like a human would with both hands. It was standing upright and appeared to be over 3 feet tall in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creature bent down to the ground and jumped forward on all fours then got up a bit and turn to the left to aim for the woods. It reached for the ground again with its front arms and jumped forward with its back legs swinging in front of it like a rabbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The creature didn&#39;t make any sounds that I could hear even with my windows open and it didn&#39;t try to attack me or hiss at me. When the event was over I wanted to turn around and find out what that thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew that would not be a good idea. My gut tells me that this thing had to be a Chupacabra. I looked up a Chupacabra on the internet the next day discovered a photo that was taken by a rancher in 2004 that shot and killed one. The creature in that photo looked very similar to the one I witnessed, except, the dead animal had less flesh on its bones and I couldn&#39;t see slender hands but it was hard to tell from the photo. I was planning on getting some land so I could let my pet cat out at night but now there is a change of plans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite sincere in reporting the sighting.  NUFORC reported this sighting to the Holly, MI, Police Department, and they seemed to us to be totally uninterested in the report.  PD))<n>

It remained in the same spot continuing to turn at a steady pace. I continued to watch in shock as an odd whooshing (it was not wind like sound) sound. I became afraid and stood up and the sphere stopped rotating to where the lit part was in full view to me. Suddenly I could see my own breath, as if the air was freezing, but it was 70 degrees outside.  After that I ran into the house, told my brother, got sick and then looked back out to where I had seen it, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was logged at 1:34 a.m. Central US time in my notebook.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I forgot to note was that when the light was completely out of my view I could see the full outline of the object from the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had been in the pool all day and after eating dinner we decided to go back outside and enjoy yhe weather. It was about 1 am and we were watching the clouds roll in from the south west over the white tank mountains. It was partly cloudy over our house as well. My sister and I enjoy watching the lightning beacuse being from Arizona it is very rare we get a good rain storm. The lighning we had been wayching was several miles away froms us and there had been no lightning above us at all. We both saw the sky above us light up, at first we thought it was the lightning. My sister and I looked up at the same time and in a small cloud we saw what appeared to be a bright blue light. It was still in the cloud for about 3-4 seconds. Then the light shot acroos the sky to the right and was gone. we looked at each other in disbelief. And asked both of our husbands if they saw it. neither of them had seen the actual light but they did see the brightness from the light that lasted longer than a bolt of lightning. There was no lightning above us at all that night so I am not sure what it was we saw exactlly but it definatly was not a plane or a jet because it made no noise. It was there in one spot and within an instant it was gone.  The development we live in is new and is right behind the White tank mountains.We used to ride out there frequently, until they developed these homes, on our ATV&#39;s. This is not the first time we saw something like this and I am sure it won&#39;t be the last.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were watching the objects.two more appeared from the west.The objects were a bright orange in color. They would move from side to side and up and down. After observing the objects thur binocolus it appeared that the objects were crescent shaped. All together we saw 12 objects all being of the same color and same crescent shaped. When the objects left they went straight up and the majority went toward the west and at least two of them went toward the south. The only way that I know how to describe the objects were like they were dancing in the sky. But when they left they left in a hurry... We were unable to get any pictures of them for some reason they would not show up in the camera. I know that this sounds strange but this is what me my family and my neighbors saw.

A perfectly round emerald green ball about golf ball  diameter flew up the river about 5 feet off the water. It then stopped, changed direction and zig zagged back and forth then hovered and flew off at a 45 degree angle. I asked her if she saw it and she said yes, it looked like it was Tinkerbelle. I then looked around to see if there were any lasers around but then thought to myself that a laser travels until it hits something. This ball of bright light looked like something out of a movie like MIB or something. It kind of flew like a firefly. It was very bright green. It was silent. I never saw it again that evening. I don’t believe in UFO’s. Just wanted to report it for some answers maybe.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound of an airplane or medical helicopter.   We watched as it floated across the sky almost 180 degrees in a arch. IT was NOT a firework- it was slower then that!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this until it disappeared into the city lights.  A few moments later, a second object identical or very close to it, appeared at the same place we saw the first one appear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same sequence of events took place, same route, same speed, same wierd glow of color.  Again, this object disappeared into the lights above the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear- the smoke from the fireworks had cleared.  We also noticed with both objects they seemed to almost...wiggle back and forth while glided/floating through the sky.<n>

I was passing through the area on my way to Camano Island and saw an object float south to north across the highway.  It was roughly circular in shape and pulsating with an orange-ish light.  I immediately turned on a northerly cross street to pursue the object which appeared to be a a very low elevation (40 to 50 feet). and climbing steadily.  As I was able to pull under the object I recognized it as a very cool, 3 foot tall, miniature hot air balloon (the type that I used to make myself as a kid).  After I turned around and wnet back to the highway I saw another.....just as it was launched form the church parking lot on the corner. Heading home I saw the original ballon still glowing in the sky, quite some distance away and at about 500 feet elevation.  When I told my daughter and nephew about what I&#39;d seen the previous night their response was, &#34;Oh, yeah, we saw a sign for Flying Chinese Lanterns at the Reservation Fireworks stand last night&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though my personal belief is that there &#39;are&#39; many sightings that are &#39;not&#39; explainable by conventional means, this one &#39;is&#39;.......<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very much apprecaite your site!<n>

PD))|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66438.html|472|ndxe200807| Two Formations of Fireball Like Objects Witnessed and One Filmed in 10 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, daughter and I were returning from the fireworks display held at Kensington Metropark on July 4, 2008. Traffic was snarled so it was about 11pm by the time we got back. About a quarter mile away from our subdivision we noticed a collection of 5 (maybe 7) orange flickering objects that some people might describe as a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious, we pulled over to watch these objects. We were facing south and these objects were traveling from east to west. Their motion and appearance were uniform although one object appeared to weave left and right slightly relative to the formation and subsequently sped up slightly as if to return to the correct spot in the formation. There was no sound. I would not describe the formation as uniform or tight, just motion in the same general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these objects passed overhead and slightly to our south their flickering began to fade and then disappear entirely well before they would have been out of our line of sight. It is as if the front of the object gives off the flickering orange light but not the rear. We could not see anything much more significant that a faint star once the flickering stopped. At this stage it was difficult to reacquire visual contact with one object if one focused on another in the group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We agreed these were not aircraft. There were enough aircraft flying overhead at the fireworks so we had a good frame of reference for that conclusion. Since neither of us could explain what it was that we saw, we decided that we saw unidentified flying objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove home; I carried our sleeping 4-year-old up to bed and began to unload the car. I noticed a group of 3 more objects traveling in the same manner and direction as before. This was about 5 to 10 minutes later. This time I was easily able to retrieve the camera from the back of the car and subsequently filmed this group of objects in a 30 second .avi clip (the camera’s limit). The video is thoroughly boring and by itself seems to do nothing to further identify the phenomena that we witnessed.<n>

It then shot back in the direction it had come from and then came back and made another sweep. before it came back the second time we managed to grab binnoculars and digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never believed in this sort of thing before this night ! but what I saw changed my mind. It was very large and travelled so fast with little noise.  The only noise came slightly after it passed and was not a mechanical noise. There was very distinctive white lights and also coloured lights underneath as it passed.  We managed to get two photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Not a right angle, but a very tight turn. Bright, almost throbbing orange-reddish glimmering light. I was watching TV and noticed the odd light out the window, I went to look, at first thought it was an airplane on fire, my wife and I went outside and watched it for about five minutes as it made it&#39;s way from the northeast, turn south then go west. It wasn&#39;t moving very fast at all, but steadily progressing. When it made its turn, it was near enough that we would have heard if it was a plane, but there was no sound. Do to the high cloud ceiling, we could also then see the shape against the clouds, looked somewhat like an upright &#34;V&#34;, the ends pointing upward and the glimmering light at the bottom. And by glimmering, it was kind of throbbing, but with no certain pattern, that&#39;s why I first thought it was a plane on fire. The airport is to the west, but it wasn&#39;t following the line the planes normally do and passed by to the south of Indianapolis International Airport. I host an internet message board pertaining to automobile racing and I asked if anyone else in the Indy area had seen it. Many people were still outside at the time veiwing fireworks. I had 2 responses on the message board from people in the Indy area that had witnessed the same object and both had the same reaction I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the insurance industry and my wife is a registered nurse.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In seconds it was gone. After five minutes it was back again. This time the light and shape got more vivid but still vauge. We called my mother out and she saw it too. It was like a triangle with one orange light in the front. In seconds it hovered upward and disappeared. My mother said it might be back so I grab my camera. Only this time there were three! One in each section of the valley we live in. In seconds they hovered up and were gone. I caught a glipse of it on my camera but it was too late. Later my mother thought since it&#39;s Fourth of july and eveyone was blowing firworks off and there were lights in the sky, maybe the &#34;aliens&#34; thought we were having a war and were trying to help. That calmed me down a bit, but I&#39;m still skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Then all 3 hovered in one spot and at virtually the same time all disbursed in different directions at a velocity that could only be described as something you would see in star wars...we were all speechless as we saw this unfold.  The orange balls jetted so fast that they literally vanished.  Our neighbors also witnessed the occurrence and said it was the second set of lights to move through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On the Fourth of July (2008) my town was having it&#39;s usual festivities as we always do when out of no where three bright red lights appeared in the sky. They appeared to be in a triangle formation and moved together in a very slow, very creepy &#34;floating&#34; motion. At my house more than thirty of my family members, anywhere from age 5 to 83, all saw exactly what I saw. There was a concert in town and the city was probably host to around ten-thousand people or more, most of which saw the lights. I have attached three photos that my aunt took from a different point in town, and I have two poor quality videos on my cell phone that I can send once I figure out how to upload them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the lights it was approximately 10:50pm. I filmed two quick videos and took off in the direction of the lights. I eventually lost sight of them but I have friends who were in different parts of the town who claim two of the lights moved in very close as if they were being sucked up into the sky, and the third followed. I originally thought there was only one craft due to the steady formation but now that I have seen many photos and talked to a lot of different eye-witnesses I believe we saw three seperate crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No newspapers or stations have reported anything on these lights, and I as well as many others are frustrated by this silence. We would love to be able to shed light on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seems like it effected the whole block as the street lights went out too and it took a while before they flickered back on. The whole block was dark for a few seconds. I didn&#39;t think too much of it till the next morning when I went out and got in my car. All of my car settings had been reset to factory defaults. I own two later model BMWs. I got curious and went to the other one to see if something effected that one too, found out to be the same exact issue in the other one also!! Everything in it was also reset to default factory settings, like stereo, gps and other settings. Even the seat memories had been lost, in both cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost want to think that it had to do with the power surge that had occured the night of July 4th 2008. It was too much of a coincidence to ignore. Not sure what caused the surge and what did it have to do with the cars as they are not part of the grid. So something other than the grid may have caused all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Objects had four white lights on each corner which gave the appearance that they were square shaped.  Objects seemed to be very high in altitude, perhaps in Earths orbit.  Some were in pairs or groups of 3 and 4 and would rapidly change position in their formation.  Objects disappeared when they got directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altogether, there were approximately 10 to 12 objects total.  This event happened at 2235 local time and lasted about 5 minutes.  This was after the July 4 fireworks show on the lake.  There were thousands of people out there.  We were on a boat and there were many witnesses.  The fact that the objects were changing positions in their formation proves to me that they were not satellites.  And they were not aircraft as I know them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an airline pilot and amateur astronomer and feel that I know what is not normal in the sky.

It was very bright and different from any color of the fireworks. I asked my husband, who is an airplane mechanic, if he knew what it could be .He could not identify the object. It was red in color and approached quickly. As it passed overhead, it started to disappear behind some low clouds, but we could see that it had no blinking lights and it pulsed slightly.It retained it&#39;s round shape. It moved to the west, over the trees and out of our vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back tword the east and saw another identical object following the same path. We watched it go overhead and disappear in the clouds. There was no sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking East again, we could see 3 more red orbs in the distance. One was closer than the other two. They traveled over our heads again,to the west. I captured some pictures of the last two orbs that moved together. They too, moved silently into the clouds in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime later, A jet flew from a south easterly direction to the west tword the direction of Whidbey Island. The jet was very distinctive with it&#39;s flashing lights and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband  and I are a little skeptical as to what we saw. I just know it was something that him, nor I could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were observing a very clear night sky.  We saw a few aircraft flying over as evident by the flashing lights on them.  Just above the tree line we both noticed a pulsing light.  We both yelled at the same time, “You see that!”  The light pulsed a brilliant white as it.for lack of a better word….zipped, raced, moved EXTREMELY fast across the sky.  The object was moving so fast it left a light trail behind it each time it pulsed this brilliant white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to explain that it could not have been a satellite as they move relatively slow across the sky, and one just happened over that I pointed out to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the 180 degrees from horizon to horizon I extrapolated that the object covered approx. 110 degrees, in our sight line, in 4 seconds.  Each pulse of light seemed to be about a second apart as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have NEVER seen anything we could not explain away.  This dumfounded us both!  Needless to say, we had a very difficult time sleeping that night after what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a photograph of the tree line and the area of visibility between the clear area of observation.  I will try to include the photo with some drawn lines on it to show a representation of what we saw.  The object was not directly over the trees.  I tried to recall my days of being a meteorologist for the Navy in judging distance and altitude. Not really certain about distance from us.  but to wager a guess..heck, I don’t know.  It was distant…could have been 5 mi, could have been 8??  The altitude…again, not certain,  perhaps 1000-1500ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, we were in Oak Grove, NC on vacation, just 10 or so miles N of Franklin, NC.<n>

The object was moving rapidly and at approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet altitude.  The object appeared either to be on fire or have orange glow emanating from rear.  At first, we thought it may have been part of the fireworks display, but the object was much too high and moving purposefully, with clear direction and even speed. There were no erratic movements, simply a straight line in the direction indicated previously. One of the witnesses is an avionics technician, and was completely certain that the object could not have been an airplane.<n>

The fireworks started approximately 2130 MDT.  My family and I were located at the south side of the field just north of the first paved roadway.  Thousands of people were in attendance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks display was at the north end of the park about a quarter mile away from us.  We had an unobstructed view of the sky.  It was a clear sky with very little breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 to 20 minutes into the fireworks show, I saw a spherical object about 2/3rd’s the size of a full moon.  It traversed the sky at about 60 degrees above the horizon and 10 degrees too the right of the fireworks display from my perspective.

The fire works had ended and we started to gather our belongings, when someone said look and they were pointing to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the sky you could see objects that where flying south to north with four lights on each object.  The lights appeared to be moving on the object in a circular motion.  The color of lights would vary from Red, Blue, Green and White, but on each object the color of the light would always stay the same. If it was Red it would remain red.  I believe there were about 30 objects that went past us. They just kept coming and coming.  The objects would fly close together and in groups then just disappear.  I can’t believe planes can fly that close together and that many flying at a time.  It was the strangest sighting I have ever seen.  I grabbed my sister-in-law.  It freaked us out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a group of 14 people on the beach with us, but there where a lot of people around us, remember the fire works had just ended.  Our group contained people from 45 to 2 years old, and even my 5 year old talks about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I truly wish someone had a video camera to video this.   I tried to take a picture but it turned out black.<n>

We were on bicycles. After the fireworks had completed we then rode approximately 200 yards or so to the beach, my wife and friend was in conversation and I was just looking up at the stars. Then I noticed something that really caught my attention. I saw a star wobble back and forth; I then pointed this out to my wife and friend. My wife noticed that there were two stars moving the same way. One was dimmer than the other. I kept me eyes on the brightest one. It was easier to see. It was really strange. They both looked like stars in the sky. There was no strange shape to them at all, they just looked like stars. They both zigged zagged back and forth a few times and then I didn’t see them anymore. We witnessed this for about 2 to 3 minutes it seems. Have there been any other reports of this event at all? I have always heard of things like this happening, but this is the first time that I have ever witnessed anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/4/08 22:15|Port Jefferson|NY|Sphere|15 minutes or so total|Glowing orange objects, which you could see were round disk/sphere in shape when glow dimmed completely.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64284.html|490|ndxe200807| Glowing orange objects, which you could see were round disk/sphere in shape when glow dimmed completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened on the East End of Long Island New York, in the Village of Port Jefferson on 07/04/08.  I was with two other friends and we were just talking, while watching cars and motorcycles drive by.  It’s a popular hangout spot in town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sighting at 10:15 pm, two bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation maybe around 3-5 thousand feet heading from the South.  A few people at this point noticed and we all thought it could have been helicopters flying over. Though, I thought it was rather strange for a helicopter to glow bright orange in color.  The crafts hovered over for a short period of time, then flew a little farther and in the blink of an eye disappeared straight up into the sky.  A gentleman stood by saying “those were definitely not helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next sighting at approximately 10:35 pm, this time three bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation from the South.  They started to hover at about the same height as the first sighting.  No doubt watching what was going on below.  These crafts moved up and down in a very speedy fashion, the light would fade as they moved up and would glow brighter as they came down.  These were very fast moving objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, a plane was flying in from the West toward the crafts and at this point at least 50-60 people were pointing up at the sky wondering what in the world the objects were.  Moments later at the same time, all three crafts dimmed their lights completely (no light at all).  But this time, the objects didn’t disappear into the sky.  As they flew by, you could tell without a question of a doubt what the objects were once the glow was gone.  They were light gray in color round disks (sphere like), not small from what I could tell (maybe around half the size of a football field).  At this point they were moving at a relatively fast cruising speed; one craft flew up ahead while the other two trailed close together but all three in formation.  If it matters, they flew over the water and if they continued to fly straight would have ended up somewhere in or near CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without a doubt, the single most surreal experience I’ve ever had (my friends included). These were not planes, helicopters, blimps, weather balloons, fireworks, or any other known object that I could think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My one friend took some camera phone photos, but they’re worthless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About myself, I have an Accounting background (MBA) and work in the lab plastics business.  My other friend/witness is a Speech Therapist in a School District and the other works for Allstate Insurance.<n>

At first glance I quickly wrote it off as one of the many firework debris that was still ablaze [ember burning] and floating only to inevitably burn out into the knights sky. But what I was viewing was not burning out and in fact proceeded moving on its South West coarse. As it got closer to my residence I still did not say anything to my wife and children who were near me. But surprisingly my wife stood up and pointed out the very same object I was viewing which now closer and looked like a glowing fire/flame in a circular cloudy ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time my children, seconds after their mom, noticed this object and asked me what it was. So, now having my whole family point out what I was quietly viewing gave me enough cause to run inside and get my digital camera and attempt a picture of the object. As I got the camera which I used just 20 minutes prior, I tried to turn it on to no avail. Trying to move quickly I opened my TV remotes to swap out working batteries, put those in my camera, and the camera still did not turn on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Disappointed about the camera trouble, I proceeded outside to see where and if the object was still coming in my homes direction. After searching a few seconds where I’d guessed the object should be I surprisingly saw it over my neighbor’s house south of my front street facing door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I could describe what I saw from this vantage point which was low flying about 100 yards away, was this circular object with no sound, and a glowing light  [whitish fire color] surrounded by a jellyfish like sack hazy to transparent to the eye, Flying off at a constant slow speed into the South West sky till it was out of sight.<n>

He lives in a high rise apartment building over 40 stories tall near Lake Michigan. We went to the roof to have a panoramic view of the fireworks around the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a great number of fireworks particularly in the out-lying areas of the city. Even with the city lights the fireworks were phenonmenal. At one point I noticed an area of intense firework activity. I only focused on it for a few seconds then scanned other areas. When I returned my gaze to this spot I noticed some of the lights seemed to be hanging in one spot for an unusually long period. &#34;How do they make them do that,&#34; I asked myself. Then I pointed it out to my son.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I was distracted. When I glanced back the lights were still hanging there. They seemed to form a &#34;hat-shape&#34; with red and green lights which shimmered around the form. UFO popped into my mind but I discounted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was once more distracted. When I looked back again at this &#34;hat-shaped&#34; object six very bright golden orbs seemed to emanate from it and hang momentarily around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind seemed to be affected by what I saw. I certainly felt spaced out. (I don&#39;t drink or do mind-altering substances stronger than coffee.) When I looked again for the object, it had disappeared along with the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until the next day that I realized that I&#39;d seen a UFO. I&#39;m over 60 years old and this is the first one I&#39;ve ever seen one though I do believe we are visited, if not influenced, by aliens. I broached the subject of the sighting with my son &amp; daughter-in-law. He&#39;s an engineer and she&#39;s an accountant. He brushed off the UFO hypothesis. She said nothing except she hadn&#39;t noticed anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel the need to communicate this with someone, hence this letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peace to all...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a few go off and the I noticed a orange looking light in the sky. It was not very high in the sky just a little above the line of fire for the fireworks. At first I thought it was part of the fireworks show but then it started moving in my direction. It moved right over to my neighbors driveway hovered there for about 3 minutes and then started floating upwards int he sky until it disappeared. I got the feeling that it moved towards me because I was watching it I was a little scared for a few minutes.<n>

The show ended and they were just hanging out in the friends’ backyard. It was my two daughters, the friend and the friends’ mom that were in the backyard. My oldest daughter was sitting on the grass and noticed something in the sky, she first thought it was maybe a firework but it was moving. No later that she saw it her friend said, “is that a UFO or what?” They all were freaking out, looking at this object in the sky. My oldest described it as orange in color, a white light in front of it and green lights around the object. My oldest described it as a circular, balloon shaped object, orange in color. She could see inside the object and she described the inside was the colors, green and red, she described it like it was like when a disco ball is on, the different colors. My youngest had her digital camera that she just received on her birthday on July 2. She took it to take pictures of the fireworks but took more than fireworks that night! They both said the object was traveling from North to South. It was a 4th of July they will never forget, much better than just seeing fireworks!<n>

At first I thought it was an ember from the mortar shells but its trajectory was as straight as an arrow and was unaffected by the winds aloft. It continued from my first notice for at least 10 to 15 seconds into the high atmosphere and then the light went out. I know this could be dismissed as an ember but it didn&#39;t behave like any ember I have witnessed in the past. Being the 4th it could easily be dismissed as a firework related event but after thinking about it for 2 days I thought it worthy of reporting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Not sure on the direction, but if I went back to the site I could for sure use a compass to identify) At first we all thought it may have been helicopters or some other kind of aircraft, but as in the Indiana description as they went across the sky, they dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we noticed that the objects kept coming across the skyline, it started to draw our attention more and more. I would say about 4 objects had passed when I started to actually count as they kept coming. By the time the last one past, my father and I had counted 18 crafts, but there could have been up to 25 or so as we did not immediately start counting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Others were joking that it was Aliens, and one man kept suggesting that it was just helicopters. Im having a hard time believing it was helicopters, especially that many in flight, in no distinct patters, flying across the sky at almost 10PM at night. There was no sound, just the orange globes traveling high enough and far enough to where it could not possibly be fireworks. And I also have a hard time believing that helicopters could fly as high as these crafts were. No way they were airplanes either, I know and have seen so many airplanes in the sky at night, and these were not. I dont care what anyone tries to tell me, this was something odd, dont know what it was, but they surely were not an airplanes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They sky was clear and visibility was perfect.  At first it looked like the three objects may have been flying due west in a straight line, but then got into what looked like a triangle shape and begin to almost rotate position while they dropped in altitude  (the top point of the triangle would drop down and one on the bottom would take its place).  The rotation seemed to be fairly slow as all three only made one full rotation.  We observed this pattern until one of the objects on the bottom of the triangle dropped out of our view and the others followed.  The objects were bright white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also to the east of our location is DIA (Denver International Airport).  At first, we thought it may be planes, but the object’s flight pattern would be almost impossible for a plane to follow, especially for a commercial plane that would be at DIA.  We also do not think it was helicopters either because the angles at which the objects rotated and then dropped would be too sharp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fireworks were happening about two miles west of our location and you had to turn completely around to see these objects.  They were definitely not fireworks, due to their location and that they were visible for much longer than fireworks would ever be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about one half to a mile in the sky and was moving at a good pace.  The object was approximately 20 X 20 (feet) and appeared to be circular.  We didn’t think much of the object until it started getting closer and we began to eliminate the possible answers as to what this object could be.  The object didn’t give off any engine noise and didn’t have any flashing lights on it.  The object flew very straight.  It made a sharp right turn and headed west at the same rate of speed and altitude.  That’s when I ran in the house to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to the backyard, the third object has appeared from the north, almost coming from the exact same place as the first one.  This one flew in the exact same path as the first one, and according to my other family members, as the second one as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started video taping the object and was able to get a close up of it with my Sony video camera as it moved towards us and to the west.  This is when I could see the object was disc shaped.  Just as the third object was moving out of sight – the forth object appeared.  I was able to get some good video of the forth one as well.  All four objects followed the exact same flight pattern, speed, and altitude - traveling from north to west and traveling until we couldn’t see them any longer.  There were seven adults and my two children that witnessed this event, including an off duty police officer.  We still can’t come up with a logical explanation as to what occurred that night.  One other person in my family was able to get video of one of the objects with his camera as well.  A number of my neighbors saw the objects as well.<n>

During a game of cards, we were summoned to the porch by a relative who saw a red fiery object in the Southern sky.  As we all observed the object - which appeared to be red and eminating flames from the right and left, a bright red glow filled the center.  It appeared to be ascending towards our location and after about 2 minutes of observation, the fiery glow dissipated and the bright red glow seemed to then be travelling away from the house.  The glow continued to travel away until it eventually just went out.  It was completely unexplained.  After re-entering the house after the light had completely went out - cell phone service was unavailable for approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ruled out the idea that it could have been something in &#34;space&#34; as the night sky was overcast with heavy cloud cover.

It was about 20 degrees above the horizon when I noticed it. The object did not appear to be moving relative to my position.  It was circular and appeared to be a dull orange color.  The object appeared to be glowing from within.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter I saw a second object ascending from behind the tree line in the same direction as the first. This object was somewhat closer than the first one and I was able to determine that it was a balloon with a light inside.

It was already dark to the east but it was still dusk to the west.  We noticed  a bright, orange, round, light coming from the east going across the horizon in a westward direction. (For the last 15 years we have seen these same bright orange lights, but only one at a time, and it may go months or years in between sightings.)   It appeared to be around 1000-1500 ft off the ground, and moving at a moderate speed.  We jumped up and ran to the front yard to get a better view.  As it passed by us and was traveling towards the west away from us, we could see the shape of this flying object silhouetted against the western horizon, and it appeared to be not quite round, but a some what, horizontal oval shape and dark gray in color. I am a former, licensed aviation maintenance technician, and understand what it takes to make an airplane or helicopter fly. There were no w! ings, no propellers, no form of propulsion, no sound and no additional lights, there was nothing I could see to show cause for this object to be flying. We had barely gotten over the shock of seeing this bright orange object, and sat down in our chairs again, when we looked and here came another one from the exact same direction traveling what appeared to be the exact same path. Once again we jumped from our chairs and ran to the front yard to see the same type of object silhouetted against the  western sky. After it disappeared out of sight, another one appeared within 5-7 minutes.  By now it was too dark to see the shape, only the bright light. This repeated 3 more times until I finally ran to get the video camera. I managed to video numbers 6-7-8. All 8 of these travelled the same direction, and pretty much the same path. This happened from between 9:00 and 10:30 on July 4th 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> report received by Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

I recall objects very similiar to these at that time.  I was at the very northern tip of North Center Lake in Lindstrom, MN, watching a 2+ hr fireworks display.  There were approx. 200-300 people that observed the very same thing as there were 100+ people with me on the beach and 60+ large boats in the bay.  These objects were peculiar at first when we all saw them rising from the treeline straight south of us and I recall people calling them UFOs and a few even got a little nervous until them floated a couple hundred yards off to the west of us. You could visibly see outlines of the objects. They were Chinese paper lanterns... a lot of them, 10-12 sounds about right.  They were following the same line of flight and were spaced out about a minute apart (that was the time in between sightings as they rose out of the treeline.)  This sighting was out of Excelsior, which is 60 miles straight southwest of Lindstrom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EXCELSIOR, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, JULY 04, 2008, at 22:35 hrs. (CDT)  A gentleman telephoned NUFORC on July 05th, 2008, to apprise us of a sighting that occurred near Minneapolis, MN, shortly after the local fireworks display.  He reported that many people witnessed the event, and that it was quite dramatic in appearance.  The witness is an airline pilot, with considerable experience, and he is a skilled amateur astronomer.  If anyone else witnessed this display of lights, we would welcome additional reports.  Full Report<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  The report above may have merit, but we would be a bit surprised if the airline pilot, who first reported the phenomenon, could not distinguish pyrotechnic lanterns from something more dramatic.  Moreover, the sighting in Lindstrom probably was not related to Chinese lanterns over Lake Minnetonka, given the 60 mile distance between the two locations.  We are grateful to the individual who submitted this report. PD))<n>

Eratic motion and behavior suggest none-human aircraft...<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I’m going to say that I have always believed in life on other planets. It’s really egotistical to believe that the earth is the only planet in the whole universe that supports intelligent life. But at the same time I have always been skeptical of UFO’s visiting earth. Honestly, I thought that earth wasn’t interesting enough. We’re destroying our planet; we are loosing all of our natural resources, and over all, were not a very friendly species. Why would an alien species be interested in us? Well, my skepticism was tested one night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day was July 4th, 2008. It was after dark, and we were all sitting in our lawns on our lawn chairs watching the fireworks that people set off over the lake. (I live on a lake) We did this every year, gathered with our friends to party and watch the fireworks. Anyway… Someone had just set off one of those giant fireworks, you know, the ones that shoot up and explode into a flower of colorful embers. It was an orange/red one, if I can recall. As the embers faded and burnt out, I noticed that three embers remained. I wasn’t the only one who notices, considering all of our attention was too the sky from the fireworks, its not surprising that we all saw it. I thought it was really strange; these three lights were in a triangular formation. And just when I thought I was seeing things, the lights began to move across the sky. I thought, maybe military aircraft; considering the formation they were in. But they were far too high up. They were so far away that they looked more like stars than aircraft; beads of light moving across the sky. At some point in time, a fourth light, moving much faster than the triangular formation, raced to join the other lights. They stopped for a bit, then started moving again. They were also moving relatively slowly at the time, giving us plenty of time to gossip about the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, however, one of the lights veered off in a different direction at angles far too dramatic for a human aircraft to maneuver; the light literally took off 90 degrees in the other direction. I watched this light speed off, going extremely fast, until it eventually disappeared; maybe going invisible, or maybe just leaving the earth’s atmosphere. I was stunned. After this, of course, I turned my attention to the other two stars. Eventually, the second of these strange lights did the same thing, but went forward rather than changed directions. It shot off very fast, and then vanished. The third light would just vanish without moving. It stopped, and then vanished. The fourth light, oddly enough, came to a halt, and stayed there most of the night; disguising itself as a orange star. I recall looking back on it sometime later that night; it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really was stunned. I had no explanation for this. Some would say weather balloons, but they were far too high up, and the erratic change in position and speed could not be explained by this. And unless the government has secretly developed some sort of spherical aircraft, noticed only by one light, that can move at 90 degree or less angles then vanish, I highly doubt it was anything man-made. It baffled me, it baffled everyone else. I really have no explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had a camera on me at the time; it would have validated this a bit more; or maybe even a video camera. But with the fireworks, and considering how high up they were, I wonder if I would have even been able to record them. All I have is my sight, and my memory. I’m sure others at the party dismissed it, but I can’t help but feel that there was more to those lights than they all think.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was an empty for-sale house on my street and the sun was above it, behind some trees, so I thought it would make a good picture. I snapped a few photos and moved down and then went back inside. I downloaded my pics onto my laptop. I noticed as I was looking at one that it looked like a UFO in the top right corner. ( I will email the picture). The other photos I took didn’t contain the object. I think it looked like a flying saucer…there was no one outside that day and the house was empty at the time, and there is nothing but miles of woods behind the houses, so it wasn’t a Frisbee. I don’t think it was a spec or dust particle because I think I wiped my camera lense off before taking pictures. And if it was, the spec wouldn’t appear like that on the photo. The object is blurred, so obviously, it was moving fast. Although I don’t believe it is a bird, it very well could be. I really want some second opinions on my photo. It was taken with a Nikon CoolPix L14 7 megapixel digital camera. I don’t remember the exact time but it was on July 7th. I didn’t see the object in the sky when or before I took the picture and I never saw any birds flying by. What do you think? Please take a look at the photo in the email!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  Object in photo is a tiny, blurry, indistinct object, located in the upper right part of the photo.  The shape of the object suggests to us that it is a bird in flight.  PD))<n>

I had just brought a new camera  and wanted to try it out. I had taken about 15 or 20 shots. when I saw a guy to my right with his back to the parade and pointing his camera up to south west. So I look to see what he was doing. It was partly cloudy all white clouds but one was Rainbow colored it looked brilliant on the blue sky. So I pointed my camera at the cloud and took pictures till it dissipated . Then i took more pictures of the parade .  About 120 shots in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the parade had end I went into my apartment and downloaded all the images to my computer. I did not use the zoom on my camera I figured if there were any shots that i liked I could crop and zoom on the computer. just to the bottom right of the cloud I saw a gray and black sphere. This shoot was the best of the cloud pics so i started to look at the Parade pics and found two objects above the houses across the street. they look like the photo you have from Indiana on the same day but my shoot is is a day light  photo. To me they look like crows.  So  I cropped and zoomed in on the object They are small and look like triangles with three blue lights on the back side, the body is black.  After zooming on  in on these objects I do not think they are birds at all. in some of my shoots you can see passenger jets from O&#39;Hare airport to the west of Elmwood Park. All the pictures that I took were of the parade and the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These images look very good on the computer  But I wanted to see them on photo paper so I took them to Wallgrens  to blow them up to 8 by 10 glossy  And they look even better.  I have 4 shoots one not zoomed and  three zoomed.  A  friend saw a photo of a cloud that was similar  to my shoot in the paper and said they were ice crystals in the sky. I have yet to see that photo.  I have never saw a cloud like this in my 48 years.  Its beautiful and wired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving slowly like a plane, but it was much brighter.  It was during 4th of July so we thought it may have been a firework, but it moved in a northerly direction without falling or fizzling out.  It dropped two white orbs out of the bottom that we thought were fireworks at first, but they dropped without fizzling out and much slower than a firework would fall.  The orbs continued toward the ground and then the red light kept moving for another 20-30 seconds before it disappeared.  The sky was dark but clear.  We did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was in the very early hours of Independence Day of 2008.  I pointed it out to my stepfather, and his friend.  My stepfather believed it to be a fast-paced military chopper, or something. It was too fast for a chopper, for I live in a place where helicopters are common.  Plus there is no military base in the quaint town of Milan.  After going about 20 miles past the racetrack, the craft hovered and dimmed out. If I could guess the speed, I would say that it was clocking at 100, maybe 110 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard nothing, due to the roar of the car engines that night. I’ll never forget it, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since then, and then I found this site. I hope this report does some good.<n>

The object then began moving south at the same speed and went out of view due to the roof of my home.  I immediately left my deck of my home to my driveway to get a better look and could not find it.  It was bright orange, not a falling star or commercial aircraft/satelite that I have ever witnessed before in my experience.  It moved like an aircraft much higher in the sky then a normal airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it turned direction it was not a normal turn.  Very very odd.  No sound, no trail, no green or other colors just bright orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed, but we cannot be certain.  PD))<n>

Object was moving slowly over Orchard Lake heading north west.  We followed object in car and stopped in neighborhood to get a better view.  As I viewed the object outside my car it had NO sound.  It was basically floating over the area but making distinct turns in its flight path and it seemed to get brighter and dimmer.  Again, this object made no sound...At one point during my observation a plane was heading in another direction at a much higher altitude and I started to hear the sound of the plane as it passed.  After it passed I still saw this glowing object heading north west making no sound.  Altitude was maybe 1000 ft.  After viewing for several minutes, it started to get further away from us and just vanished. Very bizarre!<n>

Clear blue sky above. I saw a white or maybe somewhat reflective object in the sky above. At first it looked like an airplane but I noticed how fast it seemed to move. Almost a strange movement, not quite linear. As l looked, time passed and perspective changed it seemed almost as if it were falling. I couldn&#39;t exactly say it was falling, but it gave the appearance of a falling object because of the speed it was moving at or the path it was traveling, however the perspective distance that my eye could report told me that it was in fact moving away from the ground at least in an overall direction. There were two dogs that were wandering over towards me and their owner was calling for them. I was distracted for a couple of seconds. When I tried to spot the object again I had lost it. I kept looking and sighted it again in a few seconds. The object was further away, heading NE. It almost seemed to float. While I was questioning what it was I thought of a bird, a seagull hovering in the convective wind high above. That is the first thing I could relate it to because of the nature of it&#39;s movement. After gauging it&#39;s path through the sky I realized that did not make sense. I was tracking it and it was too far away to be a bird or a floating cotton seed. My eyes focused more on the object and still could not make out an exact shape. I would say it might have been oblong. I don&#39;t want to describe it more than that because I just can&#39;t say for sure. My eyes are good with contacts in. I can see far with them. I kept tracking this object until it fades away. I know for sure my eyes were focused on this object. I can tell it gained in distance from the ground or my point on the earth. I knew this by watching it&#39;s visible light reflection dim by the volumetric blue atmosphere. That is what tells me how high this was. Volumetric atmosphere. Like judging distance in the fog. I am not saying what this was with any certainty. What I will say with absolute certain! ty, sani ty, focus and highly preceptive judgement is that this was moving fast and seemed to leave the atmosphere.  It&#39;s that simple. I was at work walking through the parking lot to go back inside. It was only about 2 minutes of observation. A co worker asked what I was looking at (after I was distracted by the loose dogs). I pointed but he could not spot it. It would have been hard to spot because of it&#39;s distance and color. For whatever it&#39;s worth I am sure it wasn&#39;t a balloon, bird, cotton seed, or anything ordinary like that. I am confident in my mind and perception. Weather ballon? Who knows, it always seems probable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I have always loved spotting planes and trying to identify them and have read many books on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 11am in bright clear sunshine I was driving roughly westward on the Raleigh Inner beltline when I saw directly in front of me what obviously was an airliner flying at low speed. It was at very low altitude and seemed about 2 or 3 miles away flying above the trees and straight across my path. I stared at it for maybe 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/4 of the length of the craft. I saw no wings, tail section or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby Raleigh/Durham International Airport, I had instantly dismissed it as an airliner and looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within that one second it had vanished. I blinked my eyes repeatedly like people do in the movies... but due to the craft&#39;s low speed and relatively wide sighting area I had in front of me I would have had to look away for at least 5 or 6 seconds to miss it going behind trees and buildings in the distance. This event did not conform to any rational explanation I can think of other than that it was an extremely advanced technology and either departed or became invisible instantaneously.<n>

It hovered in place as it went through cycles of turning its lights on and off. Smaller crafts were seen around the large one. This lasted about an hour and a half, the light got brighter than any star in the sky and dimmed out to totally black many times. I showed my brother, sister, and my sisters friend. Today, July 2nd, I noticed the same whitish blue object in a slightly more east position. I showed my mom, she said she had no idea what it was. I showed my sister again and she spotted a smaller red flashing object in the south western sky. It is still in the sky right now at 11:50 pm, it is totally apart from any stars there are none near it whatsoever. The southern needle of my compass points at the craft and not south. If it returns again I will photograph it with a camera I don&#39;t have one handy right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lying on our hammock, looking up, we noticed a light that appeared to be a bright satellite, but not moving in an orbit like direction.  Instead, the light, the brightest in the sky, was moving in different patterns, linear and in a zigzag motion.  A couple of times it moved in a clock, and counter-clockwise circular motion. The light appeared to change color from time to time.  Fixing our eyes on nearby stars, the distance of the object was vividly increasing and decreasing its distance to those stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were white lights continually moving in a circular motion around the body of the craft with flashing red lights.

7/2/08 22:30|Ashland|MO|Diamond|4 min|I witnessed a diamond shaped craft with 4 white lights and one red light in the center hovering above Ashland Missouri twice.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64265.html|554|ndxe200807| I witnessed a diamond shaped craft with 4 white lights and one red light in the center hovering above Ashland Missouri twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two nights ago my girlfriend and I were on our way back from Columbia, Missouri and traveling south on Hwy. 63. As we were approaching Ashland, Missouri we noticed four bright yellowish white lights spaced evenly with a red light in the middle that were very low in the sky. The lights were constant brightness except for the red light which appeared to dim at random times. At first we thought it was a plane because there was an airport near by and we thought it was so low (about 150 to 200 yards above us) because it was about to land. But then we realized that we had already past the airport about 3 miles ago. As we got closer we realized the craft appeared to hover and was moving to slowly for it to stay in the air. There was also no sound like that of a helicopter and was also to big to be a helicopter. If I had to guess its size I would have to say it was about 70 yards wide and was symmetrical in a diamond shape. We turned around and put the pedal to the floor to get a better look at it but by the time we got to where it was it had disappeared. We went on the outer road to see if it had landed somewhere but didn’t find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then tonight July 2, 2008 I was driving home and from the road by my house you can see across the river to the area where Ashland is. I noticed the same lights and couldn’t believe my eyes! I put the car in reverse and watched the craft float back and forth for about 4 minutes like it was searching for something (hopefully not me). It was also thunder storming so every time the lightning hit u could see the out line of it. Then all of a sudden the lights almost looked like they disintegrated and lightning hit two more times and there was no outline. The craft had just disappeared. And I’m not making this up I never really believed in ufos until now and if you knew me you would no I wouldn’t waste my time to make up a bogus story. It really freaked me out cause I’ve seen it twice in the last 3 nights and the way it disappeared was what really shocked me… Hopefully some one else will report something so I won’t feel like I’m completely crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I looked up and saw this orange light/orb floating across the sky. And I was like Oh my God! A UFO! She was like no it cant be. i was like look.

7/2/08 22:00|Beijing (China)||Formation|3 Hours|Large fireball lights and formation seen over Beijing, China that lasted for at least three hours.|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69515.html|556|ndxe200807| Large fireball lights and formation seen over Beijing, China that lasted for at least three hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eleven American students, an American teacher, a Chinese guide, and myself (one of the American students traveling in Beijing, China) witnessed strange colorful lights in the sky during a bus ride around 10:00 PM on July 2, 2008, as well as from our hotel rooms up until 1:00 AM when we went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the bus window and saw two large flare shaped lights hovering over the city (one green and one blue).  I asked the Chinese guide what they were, and neither she nor anyone else could explain them.  They were not fireworks.  A few seconds later, a red one appeared in a different location for a brief moment when it quickly vanished as several white lights flashed around it.  We arrived at our hotel and my roommate and I looked out our 8th story window to see a pentagonal formation of five lights as well as two green lights with long flickering tails slowly moving over the horizon towards the formation.  The formation spanned a distance several miles wide and several miles high in the night sky.  The light on the far left of the formation was rapidly changing color from blue to green to purple to red to yellow and so on.  The other four lights were yellow or white in color and were slowly moving along the perimeter of the pentagon.  My roommate and I watched the lights for nearly two hours.  A couple of times during the event a red light shot out from the colorful light and eventually returned to the colorful light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the green lights rise toward the formation we noticed that once they reached a certain height in the sky, they lost their shimmering tails and green color and joined the formation of yellow and white lights. The most shocking moment came when three of the green lights with tails were traveling toward the formation. At the same time as if connected by an unseen force, they all swayed quickly to the left, and back to the right. We continued to watch the lights and even tried to take some photos and video, but lights of the buildings in Beijing were too bright to get a ! clear sh ot, and the images and videos barely show the lights. We thought of every possible explanation for the source of the lights, but nothing could explain their unique movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I took several digital images of the storm clouds before being forced inside by the heavy rain and wind gusts from the storm. My only intensions were to capture digital images of the storm and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the storm left the area, I took the CompactFlash card from my camera and inserted the card into my card reader in my computer. I downloaded the digital image files into Adobe Photoshop CS3 Bridge. I took the CompactFlash card out of the card reader and put the card back into my Canon EOS 40D camera and reformatted the CompactFlash card for storage of new digital images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the afternoon of July 5, 2008, I started to review the digital images from the storm from the afternoon of July 2, 2008. As I started to enlarge each digital image file, I noticed an odd object that appeared on the right side of the trees across from the condos near my apartment. I enlarge the object trying to see if I could make out what the object was. I sat at my computer and stared at my LCD display in total disbelief. Then I started to check other digital images taken about the same time and I found another object near the storm clouds in another image file. I enlarged that one and found an object that appears to be coming out or going into one of the storm clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no intentions of trying to capture digital images of strange objects as my intent was only to try to capture interesting cloud formations to send into one of our local television stations in our area. These photos are 100% original and I did not altered these actual digital images in any way except for cropping and enlarging the images as I tried to determine what they actually were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this object is not a conventional aircraft as anyone around this area has observed before. I have my own impressions as what this object(s) appears to be but as of now, I will not divulge my thoughts to anyone until further study has been completed.<n>

This disc was close to highway #97 near Liberty, WA. at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.  The horizontal distance was several miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it off and on for about 1-2 minutes while driving.  It began to move south toward the highway and climb.  I pointed it out to my wife, but she was unable to identify it before it disappeared.  This disc was not far from a mining claim that we owned in that region where we had numerous big foot encounters over a 15 year period.  Interesting.  Shortly thereafter, I became obsessed with preparing for disaster by stockpiling food.  This disc has not been the subject of a specific regression.<n>

7/2/08 03:00|San Antonio/Cambleton|TX|Other|1 hour|The object came after me after I tried to take a picture and I think the camera flash caused it all.|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64270.html|564|ndxe200807| The object came after me after I tried to take a picture and I think the camera flash caused it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just a few miles outside of San Antonio putting gas in my car and after I left, while at the four way stop I noticed an object in the sky above a field. At first I thought it was a U.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Border Patrol Helicopter tracking illegals. But then it moves rapidly across the sky. The only way to describe how fast it moved and ca,e to a complete stop, is just like the pointer on the computer when you slide the mouse across the screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This gained my interest so i tried to use my cell phone video but I couldn&#39;t get anything on the screen. So I just drove towards it and when I got close enough to see what it was, it climbed higher in to the sky where i couldn&#39;t make it out. I parked my car and went and got my camera out of the trunk. When I focused on the object I still could see exactly what it was but I could see it flashing it&#39;s lights. they went from red to green to blue to yellow then all the colors at the same time. I snapped the picture and as soon as the flash on my camera went off the object started coming closer to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I thought the safer place to be was in my car. As the boject got closer it began flashing just like a camera flash. I drove away as fast as I could and then the object passed over my car and disappeared. It was only about a minute later that I saw the object slong side of my car. I only noticed it when it began to flash again. I text my friend and let her know what was going on. By the way, she is the one that gave me this number. Anyway, I took an exit an headed towards Cambleton. I figured I would try and drive to the only store there and just kinda let whatever it was go away. There was nothing open in Cambleton and then I saw the object again just over me and it flashed again. Then I figured the only thing safer to do was to get back on Interstate Highway 37. As I was driving down the road headed back to IH-37, the object was there. This time I saw it. It was at car level and just to my side. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like a helicopter and the texture of it was just like looking at the pavement on the road but it had a white glow all around it. The object passe me up on the drivers side of my car and went up about 100 yards in front of me. I stopped my car as fast as I could and the object came closer towards me .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just sat there for a few seconds trying to think of what I was going to do next. I tried to call my friend to tell her what I was facing but my phone would not work at this point. I reversed but the object quickly gained distance between us. So I just put the car in park and said enough is enough. I am a police officer and I always carry my side arm with me so I grabbed it and got out of my car. As I raised my weapon and pointed towards the object, it let out multiple stobes of flash blinding me and I must say the heat was quite intense. So I lowered my weapon since I couldn&#39;t see then the flashing stopped. I yelled at the thing while gaining my vision back but all I could hear was my car and nothing else. After a few moments of nothing happening just looking at the thing in front of me not moving just floating idle . I raised my weapon again and the flashing began again and just the same stopped when I lowered it. After gaining my vision back I got back into my car and tried to reverse again. It came towards me and flew over my car then I put my car in drive and drove towards IH-37. The object was nowhere to be seen .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After making it back onto IH-37, I drove for a while and then here was the object again a few minutes later. I stayed with me for about thirty more minutes flashing at me and then going away momentarily back and forth. At this point I made the call to your office and left a message.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I came up to a thunder storm and the object just gained altitude and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So after getting home and not really sleeping to much when I did wake up in the morning I noticed I was sun burned. That&#39;s my weird story . This isn&#39;t in any way a hoax or a joke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact I wish it never would have happened. However I do want to get some sort of answer or expalnation as to what it could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please take this serious and if you can not get me some sort of answer then could you please put me in contact with someone who may have some answers for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

For 3 years have passed since the formation of this consciousness, all events in a corner of my mind, always felt uncomfortable with, I believe that a serious information I &#39;ve salt in soup is probably no longer think that reproduces as you share information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CONCLUSION:  Without evidence to believe that science is already against the spirit of scientific events, unconditional, and if such invention would perform a lot of humanity, technology and science could not come to this level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, I can not believe I live event sounds like the only logical explanation for the unidentified flying object, of course, hear the evidence without such a thing from someone like you would not believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed one of those, 46 years old, college graduate, computer programmer I have my own job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other people who have witnessed the 55 year-old uncle, who live in the village primary school education, farming is one constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Will make a serious scientific research about this event I would like to refer to an institution Have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Welcome everyone interested to write a guestbook of this opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://users.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&amp;i=g16-05804-15#write Have Do not have a single goal of this event, the emergence of a scientific explanation, what we experienced in the future or even close to what the human face, or a technology in a world where we do not know here? What can be done to me I write, respectively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things to do to people: 1) Observation of two people who cross the query, the lie machine, a sworn statement, both of us separately, the discovery of the crime scene.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) be done through hypnosis to sleep for this event, perhaps a subconscious interrogation Have any other information that is currently overlooked, removable, or other scientific methods at the moment I had not thought 3) above us that the process imposed on us radyosyon damage left by magnetic fields, etc., or any other helpful was harmful radiation?  Things to do on-site Event: 1) much closer at the ground observations (5 Senses we have made using the buds, but not enough), it&#39;s involvement there is another technique using the method of the magnetic field, radiation measurement, comparison of the values in that region in different locations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) Here we do not know, but that would work for their great energy, a mineral that may be converted to fuel type to something like a detector or is there something more powerful search tools to use mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) examination of the area of biological diversity in the presence of a different species I think a lot of time to pass through the trials of this event is a challenge, but still I think that tips can be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ready for cooperation with all kinds of scientific research is actually coming to my mind these are my first<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After the fireworks were over and most people had gone home, my wife and I were sitting on a blanket and I noticed a bright red and orange glowing ball about 1000 feet in front of us.  It moved  extremely slowly in a North Easterly direction.  I was close enough to see whatever was inside of this glowing ball was similiar to fire.  It also made a buzzing and hissing sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I watched this object move across the sky until it faded out of sight.  I am not sure if others had seen it however there were still a lot of cars leaving the ballfield so I believe someone must have noticed it?   The next day on my way to work, I heard on the radio (95.7 fm) some kids had seen a similiar object in the night sky in the there area after watchimng fireworks( about 100kms) away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt think anymore on this subjct until I tread a report on your website on a similar incident.<n>

He fell asleep after about 10 minutes, so I layed staring at the stars.  A black chevron shaped ufo came from the right of us.  It was tree top level and completely silent.  It appeared the size of our city block. It had 5 lights, all perfectly circular, dim and orange colored.  As it flew over I reached for my phone, pushing my friend to wake up.  By the time I got his attention and looked left in the direction it was flying, it disappeared over the police station.  I did see a very bright light on the left side of the police station, I did not know if it flew off quickly or kept cruising along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I only got a glimpse before trees blocked my view, but it was no plane, no balloon, no blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Around the middle part of the airplane contrail I notice this silver, metallic/chrome/shiny looking object flying around the trail. I couldn’t really see it up close, but I did notice that the sun was reflecting off its surface and its movement was sporadic and really quick. It went back and forth. It was further back from the airplane and it looked nothing like the airplane so I definitely dismissed it as -- an airplane. It went through the trail and then flew fast upward and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I know what airplanes look like and this wasn&#39;t an airplane! It was round -- at least it looked round maybe more like an oval is more like it. It&#39;s movement really freaked me out. I told my friend who I was talking to at the time that I had just seen something really strange (remember I was on my cell at the time). I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it did its thing as I described above. It went right through the airplane contrail and then darted right up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/1/08 04:10|Twisp|WA|Oval|25-30 seconds|2 lights heading north suddenly shifted direction due east, traveling 20 miles in as many seconds revealing a massive, visible oval UFO|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64285.html|574|ndxe200807| 2 lights heading north suddenly shifted direction due east, traveling 20 miles in as many seconds revealing a massive, visible oval UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 04:10 hour, on July 1, 2008, I was traveling west by automobile, on Washington State Highway 20.  I was about one and a half miles east of the 4,020 ft. elevation summit of Loup Loup Pass.  I was approaching milepost 216 when I noticed a fiery object and two distinct, very bright lights leaving a gaseous trail in the pre-dawn sky through the dark, top of the forest canopy and then into the open, pale blue, dawn  sky.  The 2 distinct lights and the bright, fiery, gaseous trail that followed were headed due north over the Methow Valley as I watched while taking my foot from the accelerator peddle to begin slowing down as I approached a curve in the highway.  I initially thought it must be a meteor or shooting star but I realized it was on an upward arc from Earth and going against gravitational pull. This fact immediately aroused my curiosity and suspicion as to what I was witnessing in the sky above myself.  While trying to maintain visual contact with the lights in the sky, I began applying the brakes to my vehicle and quickly pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and came to a stop.  I shut off the engine before I had come to a full stop and proceeded to exit the vehicle on to the highway while still keeping my attention fixed on the 2 lights to the west.  As I stepped out of my vehicle, the 2 lights I was watching became very bright and shifted their course due east, towards myself.  The bright, gaseous trail disappeared with the sudden, smooth change in direction from due north to due east, but the two lights became much brighter as the direction of travel shifted.  The two lights also went from trailing one another while traveling northward to changing positions with one light being on top of the other while they began tracking to the east.  As the lights began coming eastward, towards myself, I noticed they were contained inside a visible oval shape that revealed itself against the pale blue dawn sky.  The shape was a definitive oval, with the previously mentioned lights wit! hin the circumference of said oval shape.  The area within the oval shape was transparent, yet it appeared liquid like or &#34;aura&#34; like, compared to the actual sky.   This translucent oval shape was approximately one half mile in length and several hundreds of feet in overall height.  The original two lights I mentioned earlier were the brightest part of what I saw. The light that was in the vertical position over the other respective light was at the &#34;bow&#34; of the oval UFO while the second light remained in the &#34;stern&#34; position. There were numerous smaller lights attached to or contained within the large, oval, translucent form that silently passed before and above myself and the tree tops in front of myself.  The UFO passed east bound over the  Loup Loup Ski Area, above myself and the tree tops and then kept traveling towards the towns of Omak and Okanogan, as I watched while standing outside of my vehicle in the center of Highway 20 at milepost 216. I was able to maintain a visual fix on the UFO for a total of 25-30 seconds before it passed out of my sight above the Okanogan forest in the pre-dawn skies on Tuesday, July 1, 2008.  There were no audible sounds coming from the UFO.  There was heavy thunder and lightning activity in the area before the sighting.  The skies were clear at the actual time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent.

7/1/08 00:25|Guelph (Canada)|ON|Chevron|40 minutes|two craft dropping from the sky maybe chasing a meteor? and then rejoining as one and disappearing|7/5/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64233.html|576|ndxe200807| two craft dropping from the sky maybe chasing a meteor? and then rejoining as one and disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> ...This event took place, Tuesday,  July 1, 00.25, over the city of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, We thought we were seeing a bolide, or a very large meteor, which appeared directly overhead, very near the star Vega, in the constellation of Lyre.  As it proceeded directly northward, it increased, then decreased in brightness, and once more  increased magnitudinally,  and subsequently exploded into at least two parts, each diverging from the other, with the contrail appearing white, and the point of fracture an electric blue.  The time of the transit from zenith, or first appearance overhead, to obscurity, due to local roof tops, ( approx. 15 degrees above N) was estimated to be between 8 to 10 seconds. Now this would normally be considered a natural celestial event, were it not for the events that followed 15 minutes later.  While discussing what we had just seen, and looking straight upward, again, in the region of Vega, and through a thin ridge of Cirrus,  Two objects,  the brightness a bit less of Arcturus, suddenly dropped into the sky, and proceeded on a track Nothward and slightly West of the track of the &#34;meteor&#34; we had seen earlier.  These two objects were what i would describe as being a delta form wing,  almost bird-like, yet, gave not notion of being avian in intent or motion.  In fact, they reminded me of old Korean War era jet fighters with everything removed from the cockpit and wing on down...they had no tail assembly.  I thought perhaps they may be geese or something, yet, their light was constant and almost seemed internal, and not reflective at all.  The light from these objects did not change at all due to the ambient city lighting.  There was no sense of fluttering or wing motion.  They simply &#39;floated&#39;, did zig zags, heading Northward, and one always seemed to go off course, then return, as if seeking something.  The two would diverge, converge, and fly in unison.  At one point, within a second, one returned to the other in the snap of a finger, travelling si! deways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lateraly, at speed.  These were no geese!!  There was no noise, no contrails, just the off white, egg shell glow, and they did travel quickly.  The time elapsed from dropping from the sky overhead to disappearance would be roughly estimated as 40 seconds.   I have no idea of size or speed, other than the were below the cirrus cloud from which they appeared, (20 K?) and travelled 70 degrees of sky withinin 40 seconds.  And  they were in clear sky all the way northward after the cirrus bank.   As my friend and i had discussed at the time, they seemed to be Searching.  Perhaps it was coincidental with the meteor.  OK... AND then, as if it could not get stranger, again overhead,  an object , not 20 minutes after the sighting of the two &#39;floaters&#39;, comes, from the south , a Tube or a Cylinder, again with the same glow, heading perhaps towards Toronto. And the reason i say towards Toronto is because a comercial jet flew its normal track 3 minutes earlier and this tubey thing seemed to fly in that direction.  I do not have friends in,  or access to ATC..but 5 will get ya 10 that either RADAR or one of the pilots saw something tonight.   There are things we see and things we miss, but having seeing this, i cannot dismiss the things that are in my gut.   Something fell from the Sky tonight.  Two things went and looked for it.  Later, a device, either conjoined or unique to itself, flew over my head.  Same colour, yet, as we thought, together.<n>
