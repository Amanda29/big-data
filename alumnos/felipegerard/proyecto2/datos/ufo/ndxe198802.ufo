We were arguing and she was sitting in the front passenger seat yelling at me.  I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100&#39; ahead of me and 100&#39; high I saw what appeared to be &#39;3&#39; rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn&#39;t look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, &#34;What is that!?&#34;.  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn&#39;t say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn&#39;t even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me &#34;what?&#34;, &#34;What was it?&#34;, &#34;Talk to me you&#39;re scaring me.&#34;. I didn&#39;t talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the &#34;SITE AREA&#34; and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, &#34;Did it look like that!?&#34;.  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn&#39;t speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, &#34;I saw it.&#34; &#34;I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.&#34;........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.  This is the first time I have gone public with this.  I am extremely credible and didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s until that night. I was a Tampa Police Officer for 2 years and  Tampa Police Dispatcher for 4 years.  In fact I was a Police Dispatcher at the time of my sighting.  My girlfriend and I are no longer together,  but she was a Deputy Sheriff and is currently a detective for a local security company.  Has anyone else ever heard of this type of UFO?  Can anyone ease my conscience?<n>
2/15/88 21:00|Huntsville|AL|Other|45 minutes|Bell or thimble shaped object rises out of Guntersville Lake and follows pair into Huntsville.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55860.html|2|ndxe198802| Bell or thimble shaped object rises out of Guntersville Lake and follows pair into Huntsville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late one evening (between 9 and 10 PM) in the winter of 1988 (possibly February), I (a high school student) was sitting on a boat dock at Guntersville Lake with one other person (a high school student) when a large bell or thimble shaped object rose from the water about  a quarter of a mile from us.  It rose straight up (higher than the tree line) and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too close for comfort, we got into our car and drove rapidly from the lake taking Hwy 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville (a trip lasting approximately 35 minutes).  The object followed us just above the tree line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other.  The object was bright enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and followed us on a twisting path through town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at my house near Redstone Arsenal and gathered up a pair of binoculars and a rifle scope to look more closely at the object that was now hovering over the neighborâ€™s house.  We were joined by my father (a restaurant manager) and a neighbor (profession unknown), and we all watched the object for approximately ten minutes.  It was bell or thimble shaped with varying colored lights around the outside of the object in a diagonal line from the bottom to the top.  It rotated counter clockwise and was light in color.  After ten minutes or so, the object rose rapidly and sped off to the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw several strange luminous objects in the skies over Redstone Arsenal in the spring and summer that followed- often the same objects in the same general area several nights in a row--but none came close enough for me to distinguish their shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was sixteen years old and this single event is the reason I am a MUFON supporter and interested in the UFO phenomenon.  I have never seen anything since that one experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched a huge craft hover over an area near my home.  I could see it well and it was very slow, fading out of view behind a house.  I cannot emphasize enough how large it was.  It was oval-shaped and had many, many light on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next afernoon at work, I told some people who thought I was crazy, at least until it was reported on our local news that many people saw this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, in 1998, I was watching a UFO documentary on television and saw a picture of the exact craft I saw.  You don&#39;t forget things like that...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the picture was taken in 1988 (same year I saw it) in Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just love to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the alleged sighting is approximate.

2/8/88 00:10|Brooklyn Park|MN|Cylinder|3 min|In Brookyln Park MN, late at night, a silver matalic cylindrical object, floated past our window.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48977.html|4|ndxe198802| In Brookyln Park MN, late at night, a silver matalic cylindrical object, floated past our window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize if you are not interested in past sighting. It is just that it has never left my mind, but I had never reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not exact on the date and time ( I lived there from Jan-March of &#39;88, and I just remember it being late at night.)  One of my roommates and I were in the living room, and we had no lights on in that area. We lived on the top floor of an apt. complex..  I believe 3rd or 4th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen something out the window in the sky.  I called my roommate over and we watched as a cylindrical/silver metallic object floated by for few minutes.  I wish I could give exact depth/measurements.. but that was difficult then and even more, since so much time has pasted.  My impression is that it was low, yet somewhat above the building, it didn&#39;t seem far off either, maybe 50 feet straight out yet we were looking up towards it. It was dark that night but clear, with street/city type lights present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me, it only appeared about 3 feet tall and if I got a hold of it, as if I could just get my arms wrap around it.  I don&#39;t remember any lights, ignition source,exhaust emanating, sound, or distinguishing marks.  It FLOATED up right, like we walk.  No jerking or fast movements, just a steady float in a forward direction.  That is what was most bizarre, what made it float?  I remember trying to rationalize it..see if it was connected to something, like electrical wires, etc..asking my roommate the whole time if she sees what I do, and what does she think.  She said yes, but was speechless beyond that (even, was so freaked out after, that she never would make claim to it again.)  What kept coming to mind, was a probe of sorts, not a space ship with aliens, but who knows.  As it continued on that steady floating forward path, it cleared the corner of our building, making it so we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  I ran down stairs in only a tee shirt, out the nearest door to our last sighting, into the winter cold, to find no trace of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
