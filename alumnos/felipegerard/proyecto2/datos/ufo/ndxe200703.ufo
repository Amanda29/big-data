My friend asked me if I saw what she did.  I asked my friend if it was like a flash/circular thing in the sky. My Friend said yes.  We sat there watching the figure and finally there was 2 then 3, 4, 5 and then 5th one followed the fourth and they circled and came closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got scared and ran into the house.  My friend&#39;s sister did not believe us until we got her to come outside to see for herself... she was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She called her father and he had said not to worry.  We went back in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I went back outside and sat there for a while watching the objects in the sky.  This time... about 5 again lined up in a line and darted forward.  We didn&#39;t want to stay out any longer so we went and sat on her porch... finally we got tired and just went inside.<n>

Once I got it in a clear focus, it appered to be a cross shape with the main horizontal piece  a bright green while the vertical piece was a steady red strip.  Me and 3 of my friends identified it to be what we all agreed on!  At around 9:45 pm it started to get dimmer and fade out of the telescopes range, by 9:56 it was completey out of our view.......<n>

It was bright orange and red , flickering like a camp fire . Through binoclures it looked like It was shapped like a large piece of pipe maybe the size of a large aircraft and was silent.It flew with the body upright , not laying down.  IT moved around very smoothly and at a very low speed. In the end the object traveled Slowly away to the south east over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers included my self, i am almost a ten year employee of a local propane company and was a volunteer fire fighter for almost 7 years, my neighbor who is a high school student and her brother and friend who was there at the time, my parents who are retired including my sister who is a teacher and my two brothers .<n>

3/31/07 19:45|Beaverton|OR|Unknown|10 seconds|Large object with hot pink glowing light in front and turquoise blue light in back descending with no trail and disappeared at dusk.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56105.html|7|ndxe200703| Large object with hot pink glowing light in front and turquoise blue light in back descending with no trail and disappeared at dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my 2nd story deck, which is about 3 stories high, and it was not quite dark when I looked to the North East and saw an object that appeared to be falling out of the sky.  What was odd, was that it seemed to be a long enough object that it had quite a space between it&#39;s lights. A very bright hot pink burning light at the front of it, and a bright turquoise blue light burning at the back of it with a decent sized space in between the lights which gave it the appearance of being a long object.  I thought for sure it was a plane going down, but there was no smoke and no trail like a meteor.  It was low on the horizon and didn&#39;t travel a great distance, but I had no idea how far away it was.  It seemed large in proportion to the normal air traffic I see in my horizon.  I yelled to my guest...&#34;____, Come here quick!&#34; and it was still visible while I said that after I spotted it, so I know it had to be visible for at least 6-8 seconds before it just disappeared.  I&#39;ve seen lots of meteors in the daylight, and the colors of this object and the distance between the bright colors made me think for sure it was an aircraft going down. However, it just disappeared with no smoke and no sound.  About a half an hour later, a large helicopter hovered in the sky for over 30 minutes in the general direction I had seen the object, and then the helicopter just took off to the West, almost over me.  By then it was dark.  There was no sound that I heard from the object, and it did not leave a trail at all even as it flew through the sky and appeared to be going down right before it disappeared in a clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be relatively high as DFW Airport had a take-off pattern to the east of the stadium and the planes were lower then the object.  It drifted toward the northeast (possibly upword), did not appear to have flashing or constant lights, and faded toward the northeast.  I took a few pictures, but the object was very blurry (can submit if requested).  We were just wondering if anyone else saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Trailing behind it was a long golden light tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. one hour later- after telling a friend of this- again we were looking at the sky in a similar position, this time it was compelely dark- the exact thing happened again!   It reminded me of a shooting star, however this was much more intense and closer to earth then I had ever witnessed before.  And since the first episode happened before any other star was visible in the night sky- it has really confused me.<n>

I first saw a vertical wavy smoke trail above the mountains to the Southeast of Tucson, and at the top of the trail, I saw a cigar shaped object flying upwards. The smoke dissipated, and the object leveled off and flew a straight horizontal path parallel to the mountains, and probably somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. I was stopped at a red light in my car when I saw this and I was able to follow the tiny distant object for about a minute before I had to concentrate more on the road in front of me. Once I looked away, I wasn&#39;t able to locate the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said that it was big as a airplane and made no noise. He took a picture of it with his camera phone, but it came out as a white light with a dark circle in the middle. He says that it was about 3 houses from ours (which is VERY CLOSE) and drew a picture of what he actually saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I lost sight of them when they went behind some thicker clouds and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On that route, I noticed something in the sky heading north, moving I would estimate at about 40mph. I’m also estimating the altitude of this craft was 1,000 ft. The craft was a triangular shape, coming to form a right angle for pretty much the entire length of the craft. I’m estimating the length to be 200-300 yards, and the width to be around 100 yards. There were absolutely no lights on the craft, nor were there any discernable markings. It appeared to be black in color, but it was dark outside so it was hard to distinguish any color. There was no noise associated with it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and got out, watching this craft as it continued north and out of sight range. Myself, being the founder of our local paranormal investigating team, I went through the proper channels to make sure this was a genuine sighting. I checked with dispatch to which there weren’t any calls coming in to report it, and I also checked with NWS to see if it might have been a low level cloud, to which there were not any low clouds in the area. If needed, I will submit a sketch of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn’t think much of it for a moment…I looked back at the camp fire said a few things to my friend next to me, looked back up and both lights were gone.  I told my friend of what I had just seen she watched the sky, as I went in to find out how I could report it to you.  Neither she nor I have seen the lights since.

I would have initially dismissed them as stars, except their proximity, extreme brightness, and lack of flicker were notably out of place for what I am accustomed to see in that direction of the sky - which caught my attention enough to notice that they were slowly moving N / NNE.  Having seen the international space station traverse the night sky at an astronomy event once, I would suggest these were as bright and similar in style, except there were two of them and much slower moving.  I went inside to get my fiance to invite her to share in this unusual event, and was gone for about 10 seconds.  When I returned, they were gone.  I do not necessarily think it was a UFO - could have possibly been a satellite or something like that.  Hoping to corroborate other reports?<n>

The weather was clear, visibility unlimited. A friend was with me. A balloon had floated by us going north. Something caught my eye slightly to my south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was cigar shaped, very dark color, silent, &amp; no vapor trail. The size was about ½ inch between my fingers at arms length. I have no way to estimate actual size and altitude. There were two civilian jets in the sky at high altitude in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled on a straight trajectory and covered maybe 10 degrees of arc in 10 or 15 seconds, heading due east.

After sitting there a few minutes I noticed it was a little smaller than a normal moon and had no dark areas so focused on it and was then I realized it was moving off to the west-northwest. I mean this thing must have been huge. If I had to guess I would say it was maybe a thousand feet high but am really not sure. From it&#39;s path it must have passed very close to my home so I wish I had gotten up a little earlier. I watched it for a good 5 minutes slowly disappear toward poplarville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two or 3 years ago I was coming home from work after midnight when I had a similar experience while driving down the road. This was very short in duration, lasting maybe 10 seconds, but was an identical luminous white sphere shaped object and about a quarter mile away traveling in the same direction as myself. This UFO was trailing a tail of white fire behind it, which was maybe 3 times its length and the same width as the sphere. It had clear crisp edges and was well defined in the dark sky. I would judge its size to be slightly larger than a quarter from my prospective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The only difference is that it is moving from place to place. The light was still there when i came in to send this message.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I continued driving and|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56008.html|29|ndxe200703| I was driving home from my parent’s house and I notice as I arrived closer to my home a bright star to my left. I continued driving and notice on my right a very bright star. I pulled my car over and took my cell phone and opened and closed it as though to send a signal. In return the star expanded like a big ball of white light and I got excited and phoned a relative as I was talking on the phone it had moved to the left traveling and can see a red light at the side of it. I then parked my car in the garage and walk out of the garage and facing me was that bright star as I was walking towards my apartment the star expanded as though it was getting closer and I was talking to my sister about the situation, then I panicked and it went back to normal and it started to travel south. I decided to look out my door and saw the bright star again and said that is enough for tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. We live in Canton, Michigan, which is located approximately 12 to 15 miles north, northwest of the Detroit Metropolitan airport.  It was a very clear, starry night with a great deal of air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking to the south, above the houses, at the stars.  We thought we were looking at a constellation, but upon closer observation, these two stars were moving in unison from east to west, approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the horizon. They did not appear to be moving fast.  They appeared to be moving about the same as the other air traffic in the sky.  It took them 2 to 3 minutes to move across the sky, east to west.  They also appeared to be moving in the air corridor for take offs and landings from metro airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two points of light were approximately 2 inches apart in the sky from our point-of-view and were arranged one above the other, with the top point of light lagging slightly behind the other.  They were points of light that both pulsed from white to red to purple to white again (the colors were not distinct and the light was not strong from our distance). There were no other lights or flashes associated with them like on a plane.  We watched these two points travel across the sky without their formation ever varying in the slightest.  Either the two lights were on opposite ends of an enormous craft or they were intelligently linked and working together in some fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 45 years old and have been interested in the UFO phenomenon most of my life, but this was the first time I have ever seen anything in the sky that I could not explain.  These two  points of light were unusual and did not appear to aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I commented to my fiance, who was visiting me on my break, about the object. I thought it was Mars, by the redish-orange color of it. However, I didn&#39;t remember seeing Mars in the sky near Venus recently. Then the object which had seemed to be setting still in the sky for a minute or so (about two blocks worth of uphill walking)starting moving quickly east. After it had passed about halfway through the sky, we noticed a small line of two or three fading, not blinking, whitish blue lights behind it. Picture a basketball dragging a couple of Christmas lights. These lights made the entire trip across the sky. Maybe not related, but spookyily enough, a helicopter seemed to follow the object just as it was leaving visibility. This helicopter was not the often observed &#34;Healthnet&#34; medivac.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

FOR REAL!!!! We noticed the first two at about 10:30 pm when I took my dog out for a walk and then stayed up observing the rest of them most of the night.  One was sitting in the field across the street from us (about 600 feet away).  Later, I got within about 200 feet another one that was smaller than the rest and it shined a light on me before flying off.  It hovered above Highway 101 for about fifteen minutes casting a light on the passing cars.  That one was only about four feet in diameter and a foot tall and the others were over 10 feet in diameter.  They all had similar lighting.  They left the area separately and they all flew in a northwest direction.  It looked like there was a mother ship hovering above that was much larger with different lighting. Took some pictures.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind these were UFO&#39;s<n>

Just a second later it blinked again, but was farther south. This went on for about 30 seconds, always going south, just veering east or west a small percentage, until it went out of sight behind the trees, about five miles south of me. This light made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The background was dark gray, since we had rain earlier. There was no wind, no stars, the clouds were still out. This object was below the clouds.

The lights looked like airplane landing lights that were 2-3 miles away. there were approx. 15-25 lights and they did not get any closer or farther away when they went from a cluster to a line. i then went inside to wake up my girlfriend. i was inside about 2-3 minutes and came back outside and no longer saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The UFO was a triangle shape and a light would flash on one point, then the next, then the third. Two of the lights were normal colored and the other was red.

Monmouth County NJ, I observed a brilliant white flash in the northern sky approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon. The flash was in a circular fashion and encompassed the area occupied by a basketball held at arms length, (for reference). Immediately following this observation, I an orange comet like object exit the flash and accelerate at a phenomenal speed directly upward into the sky. This distance that the object traveled would be estimated at the size of a one foot ruler held at arms length. The sky was overcast, however some stars were visible. My initial thought was that I observed a comet; however the object traveled upward out of the atmosphere.  As a side note, I had reported a similar daylight observation years ago, although that was a daylight sighting in clear conditions. This event was in the same region / quadrant of the sky and I was positioned 30 feet from the last event.  No other witnesses at this writing. No photos or video. The entire event lasted 1-1.5 seconds<n>

This morning I saw a small plane flying low in the sky toward the North. About 2 fingers distance to the West I saw a bright light that was moving  upward and curving slightly at a rapid speed a leaving a trail. It almost looked like a rocket burning in the sky (there were flashes of yellow and red almost like a burst) but it came out of nowhere and as quickly as it came it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a shooting star but it went upward and it was too large and too close to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As the object got closer, we noticed 2 sets of these lights, one right on top of the other (kind of like the chaser lights you would use at Christmas time, only larger).  It probably sat in the sky for about 15 seconds, and then started to descend straight down.  There seemed to be an aura coming from underneath the object, but it wasn’t very bright.  There were no sounds coming from the craft at all.  Shortly after it disappeared behind the trees, (maybe 10 minutes or so later) we both noticed a small airplane flying through the same area and then seconds after that, 2-3 helicopters, possibly from the National Coast Guard (they were red &amp; white), were flying around the same area. We also noticed that no commercial flights flew into Tampa International Airport for at least 45 minutes to an hour after we saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62381.html|50|ndxe200703| Spotted over Phoenix AZ<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, 26 Mar 2008, I spotted something that I think you would be interested in. I live in the west valley of Phoenix Arizona and at 9:05 PM my dog wanted to go outside in the back yard to relieve himself.  Since nights are nice this time of year I went out with him. I was looking to the west checking out Orion with my naked eyes (no telescope) when I noticed what I thought was a star to the south/southeast of Orion that shouldn’t be there. I like looking at the stars because it relaxes me, so I know which stars should be where even if I don’t know there names.  That star started out to be dull but you could still see it. Then I noticed it moving.  I could tell it was high up in what I thought was the atmosphere. It was moving down towards Earth at about an (if you figure a 180 degree angle is straight up and down) the thing was moving from a westerly position to an slight easterly position at about an angle of 150 degrees. Picture it moving almost straight down but with a slight angle as you look up at it. I seen the thing actually hit the Earths atmosphere and it became a bright white object for about a second, still moving in the exact same direction and angle. Then there was a big really bright burst of white light.  Picture being in a dark room and someone using there flash on a camera and that’s how bright the light was. This flash lasted for around two seconds. It was like this thing exploded. Instantly I thought it was a meteor and that was that. But, I saw an object come out of the light in that two seconds and I saw this object make a very sharp turn and headed off to the north. This thing wasn’t loosing in height. That’s a right angle turn from where it was originally heading.  The object I saw had to be a hugh object for me to be able to see it so far up in the atmosphere. This thing had no lights and no means of propulsion that I could see. But I could see it because it was glowing red hot. If you turn on an electric stove burner to high, wait until it gets real hot and! then tu rn off the lights, then turn off the burner, that’s how it was glowing. And just like the burner you could see it cooling down. There wasn’t any fire, or fire trail like a meteor, just the glow.  It wasn’t burning.  I was able to watch this thing for about five seconds after it made that turn. I could see it passing in front of stars and blacking them out.  It was moving really fast. After about five seconds it cooled down so much that I lost it.  This thing wasn’t falling like a meteor should be doing.  It was flying due north like it was under some sort of power. From observing the glow I could tell the thing was (and I hesitate to use this term) cigar shaped except the rear end was more pronounced then the front end so I suspect it was larger in the back then the front.  I haven’t heard of anyone else seeing this thing and I haven’t even told my family about it yet but I have no reason to make this up.  Something came into earths atmosphere list night that I believe wasn’t from Earth and it wasn’t a meteor. What do you think?  Has anyone else brought this to your attention?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We spotted the UFO hovering above a plane that was in the process of descending.  It was in the shape of a beer can, but it was made of fire.  The plane left our eyesight, but the object remained.  It casually floated off and we could still see it for about six minutes before it escaped our range of eyesight.  I recorded the sighting with my cellphone camera, but when we moved further down the road I checked the file I saved and it had erased on its own.  I never had a problem with my cell phone before when using the camera function.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Further, I had inadvertently photographed an object that looks identical last August in this same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects are so close in color and brightness to the background sky that they would go unnoticed. I noticed them because I used the Clarify option on PaintShop Pro which increases the contrast on low contrast large areas like sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s nice to bring out the features of clouds but it also makes these objects more noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was to the north of Richmond Beach and the that I had photographed last August was to the north of Edmonds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Either the object is intentionally matching the sky color and brightness to be stealthy or it&#39;s semi-transparent or translucent.  It&#39;s not merely reflective or it would reflect the dark water underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have these photos online in my blog but since I&#39;m not allowed to give identifying information I guess you&#39;ll have to use your imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An interesting aspect is that they appear unfocused even though objects occupying fewer pixels in the same photograph are focused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most recent object did appear that it may have left a faint trail.  It is so close to the limits of resolution though it is hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can contact me if you&#39;d like to see the images. I would like to make them available for others to see as well as how I discovered them because I think it&#39;s possible these things may be more common than we know but go unnoticed because they are so close to sky color and brightness.<n>
3/26/07 12:30|Modesto|CA|Sphere|2 minutes|Multiple Spheres dancing in the sky over Modesto, California|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55939.html|53|ndxe200703| Multiple Spheres dancing in the sky over Modesto, California<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a UFO skeptic, yet, at the same time,all of my life I have always wanted to see something for myself in order to beleive.  Today, I finally realized that what I have always wanted to beleive is actually true.  My experience is plain and simple.  I was visiting my sister in Modesto, California.  My neices kept bugging me to take them out to the back yard where they have a swing set.  As I walked out, I saw to jets going by to the Northwest skies above the city.  I normally dont stop and stare at passing planes or jets, but this time I did.  As I saw these to jets criss cross each other at different altitudes of course, I stared at the contrails they left behind, when suddenly, to my amazement and out of nowhere, in the vicinity of approximately where these jets were going by, I focused my vision as best i could to this area of the sky because I noticed something strange.  At first, I thought it may have been some high flying birds but to my incredible amazement, I stared and focused my eyes as much as I could and clearly what my eyes saw was without mistake 5 spherical objects doing some kind of what I will call a dance in the sky.  These objects seemed grey in color and at times seemed to have a metalic shine to them.  They moved in a strange pattern, one in which I don have the words to explain. As I stared at the objects, without removing my eyes off of them, I yelled at my neice to call my sister, at the time, my sister had a call and was not able to get to where I was on time.  By the time she did step out to see what I was yelling about, just as suddenly as these spheres(for lack of better terms) appeared, they dissappeared from the sky.  I dont know what else to say or to write, but now, finally, I can relate to the thousands of people who see strange things in the sky, yet feel so alone with their experience, that they rather just keep it to themselves and go on with life as if nothing happened.  I stand before my God, who is my only witness of what I experience! d today, that what i have written here is the truth.  I dont know whats going on, or why, but something is going on in the skies above us.  We need to pay more attention to the sky, thats a lesson I learned today.  This is what I experienced today, and its funny, but its really all I have to say and share with all of you.  Thanks for providing me the opportunity to share my sighting with the rest of the world.  God Bless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was still dark, with a full compliment of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the stars I saw were the same ones I see every morning, but then I noticed one that had an odd tint to it...kind of a muted orange or coral color, not as bright as a star, with more of a glow. And it was moving slowly, heading from NW to SE. It was about the size of the head of a straight pin, held  overhead at about a 65-70 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it stopped, and stayed still for about 10 seconds or so, and seemed to pulsate slightly, but noticeably. The color changed to a very, very light grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it started moving again, it was once again the muted orange color, and its course had changed to almost a Due East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a total of about 30-40 seconds.<n>

Right away I saw a triangle shaped object with a bright light at each point. It moved silently and fairly quickly across the sky from SE to NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.I checked with civil aviation in the morning and was told no aircraft was reported to be flying at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object had no features of a plane and looked like nothing I have seen before. The object had a bright orange light in the front of it and two medium lit red lights on the back. The object seemed to take a triangle shape on the dark sky. The object seemed to be coming closer and then disappeared within about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects did not change shape or color, neither distance appart or speed.  There was no sound, no flashing lights and lasted in the sky for a time of around 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing the bedroom window that faces the east.  The blind was up.  I saw a green fireball streak the window moving east but slightly northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;fireball&#34; was in a slight oval shape with the front point a light green, the middle section darker &#34;Kelly&#34; green, and the back tail, orange yellow.  It moved across the window within 1-2 seconds and disappeared behind trees while never losing altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeling was that it was both very large and high up, out of the earth’s atmosphere, or about the size of a small plane and flying at a higher altitude a small plane would fly at.  It was really hard to say how high it was because it was dark and it moved so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately wondered if it was &#34;northern lights&#34; or a meteor.<n>

This object was very bright upon initial sighting about 9:05 pm  and it moved towards the north slightly, by 925pm it had droppped closer to the horizon but had lost half of it&#39;s brillance, it appeared to be moving away. It passed over a streetlight at the 12 o&#39;clock position and moved down to a 5 o&#39;clock position from the streetlight when it moved back up to almost a 3 o&#39;clock position from the streetlight. By 940pm it dropped down until it appeared to go below the horizon. During this entire event, the object seemed to be changing colors from a red to an orange to yellow and even light green and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be  white lights. It was a very clear night and I was outside in my hot-tub with my wife.I looked up into the eastern sky above my garage roof and at first thought that it was a meteor till I realized that there was two that were side by side . I imeadiately informed my wife as I jumped out of the hot-tub to run through the snow to my fence on the west side of my property (about 30 feet )because of pine branches that were in the way of the sky , but it was too late,as it was past the horizon . I always see many jets and planes that come in to my view in my back-yard and it takes a considerable time to cross from where I can see them from east to west ,4-6 minutes approximatly ,but these two objects stayed next to each other and traveled as fast as a meteor and within 3-4 seconds it went from the east to the west and out of sight .<n> <n><n> <n><n> my wife did not see it ,as it happened so fast.<n>

I was in my front yard talking to my best friend. At around 7:10 pm, I looked up to the sky and saw a strange triangular object in the sky. We looked at it for a while to see if it would move, but it appeared to stay still; almost floating; in the sky for at least 5 minutes. We thought it was strange because it was really close to the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my mom to come see the object because I thought she would know what it was. My mom didn’t know what it was, so she got the binoculars so we could see it up close. Then, it appeared to move. But not like an airplane, it was slower; but yet even slower than a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time my dad came outside to see it, it was moving, at about the speed of a helicopter, towards us. Then an airplane passed by it, but from my point of view, it looked as if it went right under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it through the binoculars; I saw a triangular shape with rounded corners. The triangular part was black but not shiny. It almost looked like black plastic. It also had a translucent stripe through the middle. When it got closer you could see some tentacle-looking claws from the left and right sides. They were silver but shiny, as if made from metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed it moving southeast towards the mountains. But then I started speeding up and going up towards the sky. Soon we couldn’t see it as well because it sped up and was going in random directions. Then we just saw it disappear into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes. That night I got on the internet to look for triangular UFOs but I only found one that has lights in the corners and a beam in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it wasn’t a UFO I saw but I definitely don’t think it was an airplane or helicopter because of the shape. But I really think that if anyone sees a UFO that they think looks like mine should take a picture an report it as another type of UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a C130 between 5000 - 7500&#39; altitude heading West on climb out having departed from Andrews Air Force Base just across the Potomac River in Maryland.  Nothing unusual, but then I noticed above the C130, at a higher altitude, around 30,000&#39; two translucent white &#34;round&#34; objects on a North East heading.  I would never noticed these objects had I not looked up at the C130.  They actually intersected the path of the C130 at the moment I was looking, with the objects being higher up than the plane.  As the plane continued on its western heading the two objects continued North East over D.C. and out of sight.  The first object seemed to move steadily on its course.  The second object seemed to be several hundred feet behind and moved in a manner as that of a child lagging behind a parent and not moving directly straight ahead, still keeping pace with the first object.  The two objects appeared to be as large or larger than a commercial airliner and left no contrails.  While I was watching this, a military jet at a much higher altitude 50,000&#39;+ was heading in the opposite direction of South West.  I used the military jet as a comparison in determining the size of the two circular objects.  All craft just continued on their way without interuption.  The sky was clear as a bell with visibility near unlimited. Winds were about 10 mph out of the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was really strange. The light stayed solid for about 3 or 4 minutes, then began to dim. Once it had almost disappeared, there was a bright white light, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Like any other time I smoke outside I gaze upon the night sky. This night would reveal something to me, and not the first time I have seen objects of unidentified origin moving in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at this one start in the western part of the sky when I seen a star shaped obect moving away from the star. At first I thought plane, but no blinking lights. What would further tell me it was not a plane is when 2 more lights kicked on and made a perfect equilateral triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To ensure I was not seeing things I glaced elsewhere for about 10 seconds and returned to the object in question. To my amazement it was still there growing the distance between the star it originated from. After what seemed to be a minute the distance had grown extremly and the all 3 lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were all white and in each corner of the equilateral triangle.I couls not make out anything else but the lights since it was so late but I could only guess the ship color had to be dark only because I felt like I was watching 3 stars move, but the fact they moved perfectly together with no change in distance from the other lights told me they were connected to a much bigger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not Fearful simply because if life does exist beyond ours i doubt with such amazing technology they would be coming to do harm to us. Truely an amazing sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have been there all night and we were getting ready to leave and we left to go home to my mom and dads just 50 yards from where we were. we pulled up walked on the porch My girlfriend said would you go back and get something out of the truck and then I said why w/e alright and when I turned around there was a light come out of the sky it looked like a doughnut cause the center was black but everything was so bright  and man it blinded me it was like somebody shined a spotlight in your face so I was like what is that I thought my buddy was sitting out in the road with his cop car shining that light on me then I look back I couldn’t stair at the thing I looked at the ground it was so bright the green grass look grey the light was like looking at the sun then it just went away and I said baby did you see that she was like see what and I said great that sucks I no I’m not going crazy so started telling her what I seen we both was freak out and I don’t ever do that then my buddy called that’s the cop he just lives right up the road he said man don’t think I’m crazy or nothing and I stopped him and said you seen it to he said yes from where I was on my porch I thought it went over my uncles tree line which is about 200yards or a little more from my parents house my buddy said it was probably 8 or 9 hundred yards in front of him he said to him it looked kind of white with a green tint to it. But he said man that was pretty big what ever it was he said it just went on around over the tree line and that’s all he seen. Man I don’t no what it was but I would like to no cause I never in my life seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was astonished and could hardly breath. I noticed then they were &#34;cross-shapped&#34; with not too bright lights on each extremity and beams of light connecting the cross extremities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They performed a change in direction towards southeast while one of them crossed aparently bellow the other. At this moment they entered a very small cloud (or passed over it) but I could still see them trough the cloud. I shouted for my husband to look from the bedroom window but he came to the varanda instead, trying to understand what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this change in direction, they flew straight paralel positioned (without that random movement component I noticed at first) vanishing at the distance. There was no way my husband could spot them, although I could still see them very faint!<n>

We were looking up at the sky as it was a perfectly clear night with a crescent moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a blinking white light zipping along from north, north east to south, south west.  I pointed it out to my wife “look a satellite, watch it blink as it tumbles” we watched it until just past 90 degrees directly over us.  Then my wife noticed a second object, “Look there’s another one!” only this one wasn’t flashing.  I thought “that’s odd that two would be orbiting so close together.  We’re lucky to see this.”  As the second light passed 90 degrees above us I could make out a flashing collision light that seemed to be mounted to the tail of an aircraft, and we immediately heard the sound of a jet that struck me as quite loud (the first object made no sound at all which had me convinced that we were looking at a satellite).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the two was maintained until they both disappeared from our view. I would estimate that the objects were around three to five miles apart as they were the distance of a 12” ruler held at arms length.  Both objects were moving quite rapidly and were only visible to us for around 45 seconds.  We could hear the jet well after it was out of sight.  We live near the approach corridor for Charlotte Douglas Int&#39;l, so we are familiar with the behavior, look, and sound of civilian jet aircraft.  We heard this jet for nearly a minute after it was out of sight.  My wife even commented on how long we could still hear it, “is that the jet we still hear?”.  This leads me to believe that this was a military aircraft chasing something with the afterburners lit.  This would explain our still hearing it even after it was long of sight, and both aircraft appeared to be at extremely high altitude.

A total of five people witnessed this strange fireball which also had a long tail.  The fireball circled the northern sky about two times.  My family and I thought that the strange fireball was possibly an airliner that was on fire.  The fireball then disappeared into the northern sky heading east.  The fireball could be seen for about five minutes.<n>

Orion was well to the west and setting and Gemini was in the southwest and Saturn was SSW to the right of the constellation Leo.  The condition was clear for a change and I was noting the light pollution due to an article I recently read in Sky &amp; Telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was gazing near Castor and Pollux a pair of red lights set evenly apart was moving at a very fast rate from those star locations towards the east.  There was no noise.  The width these light were apart was just about the width of a finger held at arms length away from the body.  The lights remained evenly apart the whole duration.  I could not determine any kind of shape between or around the lights or if it was one or two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only aircraft that was near was a plane coming from the NNE and headed south towards Buffalo and that made a definite noise.  About 12:15 or so I went inside to consult the NASA http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/ website to verify where the ISS was located, which was New Zealand at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can conclude it was too fast to be a normal passenger aircraft and not quite a communication, ISS or other satellite and I have witnessed the ISS before.<n>

It was my (Jeff Challender) 54th birthday.  My wife came running into the room suddenly in a high state of excitement, and told me to come outside right NOW!  Our son Max had spotted something in the sky that he was certain was a UFO!!  I put on my bathrobe, and stepped out onto the front lawn.  There, in the sky, low over the houses across the street at 10 to 15° above the horizon, was a UFO all right!  There can be NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!  It’s position varied from due west, to northwest during the time we had it in sight.  This thing, which seemed to be at least a half-kilometer distant, was literally dancing about in the air.  It was soundless, and bright blue-white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife rushed to get the camcorder, and once I got it started, continued to video tape this thing for almost 20 MINUTES!!  I can barely describe the excitement.  We watched this thing perform the most impossible maneuvers.  It moved behind trees, returned and went behind the trees again.  I hobbled up the street to follow it at one point, and it returned to its previous position, as if toying with me.  So I went back to my chair on our lawn, and sat down.  I “told” it I could not, and would not, chase it again, and that it had better stay in sight for me or I wouldn&#39;t continue to film it.  I said these things half tongue in cheek, but THE THING SEEMED TO RESPOND!  It DID come out from behind the trees, and stay there!  It continued to bob up and down, and flit from side to side.  Right after I told it to DO SOMETHING, it brightened considerably and performed something like a “fish hook” maneuver!  It&#39;s all so unbelievable even now!  Finally, after nearly 20 minutes in sight, it dipped &#34;behind&#34; the neighbor&#39;s garage across the street.  My wife said, &#34;Oh, don&#39;t go away!&#34;.   After a moment or two, IT CAME BACK UP!  It stunted some more, finally going back DOWN behind the same garage for the final time, which was due west of our location.  It didn&#39;t return.  It looked to us like it may have LANDED somewhere in the agricultural lands about a kilometer to our west!  We waited an additional 20 minutes or so, hoping it would come back again.  Unfortunately, it did not.  So I went into the house and played the tape back on our TV.  The tape came out sensationally!  I did not zoom on the object but a couple brief times.  I held the camera quite steadily by propping my elbow on the armrest of the lawn chair, and kept the houses across the street in the field of view almost the entire time.  The film is incredible.  We couldn&#39;t sleep until well after midnight.  Must have watched the tape a half-dozen times last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can&#39;t wait to get into the full analysis, with enlargements and speed manipulation.  In the end, I&#39;ll have a 30 to 45 minute production detailing the entire event on DVD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Max saw the object first.  He says it was here Wednesday night, after Janet and I had gone to bed.  He tells us it was dancing around out there for at least an hour.  AND that it hovered directly over our house for a time.  We have no reason to disbelieve Max.  He told me about this sighting on Thursday morning before he went to school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this thing was here twice in three days.  Who knows, it may have been out there Thursday night as well.  We didn&#39;t look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our local MUFON field investigator came Sunday 25 March 2007, to take down my formal report.  He also viewed the video tape and was blown out of his socks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Jeff Challender, noted investigator of the UFO phenomenon, for sharing the information with our Center, and for having forwarded the video footage of the object he captured.  We do not know what the object was, but we would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD))<n>

Anyway, I got a call at 20:18 on this particular day by a very good friend of mine.  He said, &#34;Watch out with the UFO&#39;s!&#34;  he said this to me in  Spanish.  He described to me that he saw two red glowing orbs stuck together, making semi circles in the air.  Yesterday I spoke to him more about it and to give me the details so I could report it here.  He said that about 20:00 he was outside his house and he saw something catch his eye.  He was facing east at this point.  He decided to use the binoculars to see if he could spot what it was that he saw.  The light that caught his eye seemed to have moved behind a passing cloud, so he directed his view to the end of the cloud.  After looking for it to come out the other end, there was nothing.  For a while he just decided to stay and keep watching the sky when he looked up and saw what appeared to be a red circle doing semi circles in the air.  It was big or low enough to see with the naked eye.  When using the binoculars, he could see that it was actually two orbs stuck together.  He said that it wasn&#39;t light, like a flashlight, but more like internal, luminescent light, sort of &#34;glowy&#34;.  One other thing he said was that after while of observing this, he started to panic for some reason, he said he actually panicked and did not know what to do, or who to tell.  He lost the object after a while when he was trying to refocus the binoculars.  Al i can say about this is that i can&#39;t believe I missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have a large kitchen window facing southwest. I looked up and was surprised to  see a round ball  resembling a flash bulb on a camera. Seconds later it exploded with a bright white light. The round ball appeared to be tree top level at a distance. The glowing light flooded our kitchen,however, in a second it was gone. No sound at all. I am a geologist and have never witnessed anything like this before. It was not ball lighting. We are an hour south of Evansville, Ind. and an hour and a-half north of Nashville, Tn.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cold night and the sky was perfectly clear, with the Moon setting low on the western horizon. I was outside looking at the sky in the area of the Big Dipper’s cup when a round, white light suddenly &#34;turned on&#34; just to the left (west) of Dubhe in a horizontal line with the star. (I was facing North.) The light was visible for about one-half second and had a distinct halo around it. Other stars in the sky exhibited no halo effect, including the setting Moon. The light remained in the exact same position during the entire time it was visible. For comparison, the light was roughly the size of a nickel held at arm’s length. When viewed with the naked eye, the light appeared to be about twice as large as the star Dubhe and roughly twice as bright. Its duration was brief, but the light was steady in appearance while it lasted. It did not flash or fade in and out--it simply turned on, showed a halo effect, and turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the light disappeared, I held my hand against the sky to estimate its distance from the star Dubhe. It was about three fingers distance from Dubhe in a horizontal line to the left of the star. I couldn’t estimate the altitude of the light with any accuracy. It seemed to be at a great distance from me and gave me the impression that it might be beyond the earth’s atmosphere in space, but it was clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I retrieved my binoculars from inside and swept the whole sky in every direction to see if I could detect another light like it, but I saw nothing unusual for over an hour. I served in the military and am familiar with all sorts of military and commercial aircraft and their navigational lights and I recognize satellites when I see them. The light I saw was not like those objects. Most commercial aircraft uses a flight pattern well to the East of my town and we do not see military aircraft here on a regular basis. Our night sky is very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was standing by my car when I saw the light about 2 miles away. Then within a matter of seconds it was over my head moving towards the east. It was a bright amber sphere and was moving extremely fast without sound or without leaving a contrail. I tried to drive to keep it in my sight. By the time I had driven three blocks the object had moved about 15 miles eastward. I decided that it would be pointless to pursue any further since it had traveled so fast. After that I headed towards the northwest side of town where my friend lived. Just before arriving at his home, I saw the same object fly over me again at an incredible speed, this time toward the west. I called my friend since the object would soon fly over his home. My friend didn’t believe me thinking I was making a joke. There were three of us at my friend’s house, when about 21:30 I decided to make a food run. As I was driving I saw the same object again, but this time there were two objects one just above the other. I stopped my car to make sure that it wasn’t a perception problem. I called my friend and immediately drove toward his home again. The three of us saw the objects slowly move, stop, hover, and move again. The movements of the objects were very erratic and they moved independently from one another. One friend, that was watching these objects with me, was in the navy and worked as an aircraft identifier on a carrier ship. He said that there was nothing to his knowledge that would exhibit that kind of movement and fly that close together. We watched these objects as they slowly moved across the sky. After about five minutes, they started blinking and then just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I also took several more photographs of this same scene, none of which show anything in the sky.

We witnessed about 7-8 what I thought were white birds flying around each other at one of the ends of the rainbow.  They were flying pretty low, it is very cloudy here. I looked closer and thought, wow they are flying around each other fast, and moving very strange to me.  Then 2 of them just shot to the other side of the sky.  Didn’t see where the others went, it happened so fast. They appeared to be cigar shaped and metallic.  No sound whatsoever was heard.  I watch planes fly every single night out here, and have never seen anything fly this fast. We were so dumbfounded.   I don’t know if it’s related, but 10 minutes later a very loud jet flow over.  We were inside when we heard it.  I went out to see if it was a military jet but it was too cloudy to see.<n>

I was in my kitchen but had not turned on any lights yet. I was looking out the window and admiring a dark but clear morning with many stars and Jupiter plainly visible. My view was of the southern sky over San Francisco and the penninsula. I noticed a couple of jet airlines passing overhead and heard them faintly.  Still looking I noticed five or six smaller lights moving quickly from east to west in the same area of sky.  They moved in somewhat of a formation, that is they all seemed to be moving at the same speed but some of them changed position as they went and at such a speed that it almost looked like &#34;dancing lights&#34;.  I know of no aircraft that could so easily change position at such a high rate of speed.  I heard no noise from them and after they passed my positon I ran to the front of my house to see if I could continue to watch them but the bright street lights blotted out anything I might have been able to see.  The whole episode took approx 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had never in my life seen anything that big floating stationary with that many lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my binoculars and could not believe it,these were high dollar specs!  This was a giant disc slanted at an angle just floating with no noise!  It was approximately a couple of miles away,but my view was not obstructed in any way.  As i watched through my binoculars i noticed a red light coming in from the west flying east and just thought it was a small plane headed to Show Low airport since that was the direction it was heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement when this object was directly above me (approx 500 ft) there was no noise!  As it went by it took a direct turn towards this giant disc i had first seen.  I watched in amazement as it flew directly underneath this giant disc and dropped down into the canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then jumped in my truck and followed. I would guess it probably took 4 or 5 different roads to spot anything again but when i did the unbeleivable happened!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the next (discs) that i saw were alot smaller and there was 7 of them that seemed to be searching in a canyon ahead of me. My binoculars were right on these objects and i know what i saw truthfully!  I also flashed my lights at these objects and later noticed i lost 4 hrs that i could not remember what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing i remember is that the sun was rising and the discs were in formation rising above the canyon in a perfect formation!  This is something i witnessed with great binoculars, clear as day.  I still wonder if someone else had witnessed this object.<n>

Last night, a sonic boom woke all four of us. The boom repeated about 8 times. We ran to the edge of the forest to see what was happening, and from somewhere in the middle, a large round disk, about 300 yards away rose up and sped off in the opposite direction (south). The bottom of it was mezmerizing, like a light show. A large blue light in the center of it moved around in a spiral toward the outer edges; and the object was outlined in a flashing changing color light. The next day, we followed one of our trails to where the object had been. What we founfd was unbelivable. A 40ft by 40ft area of the forest, in the shape of a circle, had no leaves at all. None were on the ground, and there were no plants. And all around the area lush greens leaves were everywhere. The trees were untouched, no branch was out of place. The end. P.S. As I was typing this, I heard the same sonic booms nosies, only much further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Looked like it was in orbit..UFO?|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55869.html|96|ndxe200703| Bright oval shaped craft/object white with red pulses from behind it 10 to 20 sec, apart. Very close. Looked like it was in orbit..UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working in my back yard right at dusk about 7:45 pm when I noticed distinctly noticed 2 objects in the sky. The first was the moon and the 2nd was a BRIGHT white light below it located in the NW sky. The object caught my eye because of the size and location; it was much closer to the earth’s surface than any other stars I have ever seen. It wasn’t the North Star that’s for sure. Also the brightness of this object was amazing. As I looked at this bright white light I notice every 10 to 15 seconds that it would put of a reddish pulse around the stationary white light kind of a glow. This object resembled a star. It was not moving in any direction .It looked like it was in orbit kind of but slowly descending from below the moon. I know this wasn’t a star or airplane or satellite or anything I had ever seen before it was to close and to bright and the red pulse made it even stranger. At this point I was looking at it with my naked eye. I went in the house to grab my video camera the object didn’t appear to be going anywhere. I set my camera up on a tripod what I would see next as I zoomed in on the object was truly amazing and unreal. At this point my wife and two next door neighbors were looking at this thing with binoculars. As I zoomed in and focused on the light the object took shape and color it was oval looking and would kind of tear drop on the top and bottom. The light it was putting off was bright white and energetic looking and you could see small black circles around the entire object almost like heat vapors and then it would pulse a reddish glow. It looked like jet burst from behind the object. The bursts were not consistent and would last about 2 seconds, but the object didn’t appear to move. I now this sounds crazy but I got 45 minutes of this on video. I am trying to get it on my computer so I can send it in as well. The object would disappear into the fog layer that moved in. I cant explain any better. Did anyonelse see this?<n>

We turned onto Wyatt Road, and from considerable distance we observed two large white lights, right next to eachother combined in one craft. As we approached, the bright lights shut off and we could easily see the craft. It was a large triangle, maybe 200 feet long and 100 feet wide. It had 3 white lights in each of its corners, and smaller white lights in an indescribable patern on the bottom of it. The triangle was about 300 feet from the ground. It flew away from our car slowly until we lost view. After about a minute it reappeared out of nowhere. We arrived home and got out of the car to look at it. It slowly flew away in a NW direction.We were all shocked by the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous; provides e-mail address only.

I stepped out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and saw several stars and noticed one that was particularly bright. As I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in very distinct and changing patterns. Thinking that I must be moving, I steadied myself against the railing and the object was still moving. Thinking I must still be moving, I backed up against the building and placed my back and head against the wall...still moving. I looked at the surrounding celestial objects (stars etc) and they were all standing still. As I watched, the object moved back and forth at breakneck speeds. It wouldn&#39;t curve when it changed course but, instead it would reverse direction in a straight line. Occasionally the object would stop and just hover in place, then it started moving in patterns, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in a figure eight, sometimes in a triangle pattern, always stopping and hovering before changing patterns. This went on and on, after twenty minutes, I went and got the two ladies working in the laundry and they confirmed that they saw the same thing. They also noticed that the object was changing colors, always white but sometimes bluish whate and other times a greenish/yellowish white. During the incident, a helicopter flew over, I could hear the helicopter but the object made no noise whatsoever. Still trying to disprove what I was seeing, I thought perhaps that a thermal was rising in front of the object making it appear to move but, just before dawn a heavy fog rolled in and eveything in the sky disappeared except for this object which was still faintly visible. Around 7am, two other female employees came in and I showed them and they saw the exact same thing. It was the weirdest thing I ever saw, I am going to try to take a video camera to work in case the object returns.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have been there all night and we were getting ready to leave and we left to go home to my mom and dads just 50 yards from where we were.  we pulled up walked on the porch My girlfriend said would you go back and get something out of the truck and then I said why w/e alright and when I turned around there was a light come out of the sky it looked like a doughnut cause the center was black but everything was so bright  and man it blinded me it was like somebody shined a spotlight in your face so I was like wtf is that I thought my buddy was sitting out in the road with his cop car shining that light on me then I look back I couldn’t stair at the thing I looked at the ground it was so bright the green grass look grey the light was like looking at the sun then it just went away and I said baby did you see that she was like see what and I said great that sucks I no I’m not going crazy so started telling her what I seen we both was freak out and I don’t ever do that then my buddy called that’s the cop he just lives right up the road he said man don’t think I’m crazy or nothing and I stopped him and said you seen it to he said ya from where I was on my porch I thought it went over my uncles tree line which is about 200yards or a little more from my parents house my buddy said it was prolly 8 or 9 hundred yards in front of him he said to him it looked kind of white with a green tint to it. But he said man that was pretty big wut ever it was he said it just went on around over the tree line and that’s all he seen. Man I don’t no wut it was but I would like to no cause I never in my life seen anything like this.<n>

I was gazing in the sky as I normally do. I noticed what looked like a green fireball northwest of my position. I would say, approximately 290 degrees. I haven’t used my compass in some time, so the direction could be off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a fire ball of green in color with slight color change in shades of green. It looked like orange and red embers came from the object as it fell from the sky. The object fell very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure the distance, but I would think it was pretty close. Maybe a range from 5 to 20 miles, depending on the size of the object. If it did indeed fall on the island of Oahu, it would have landed somewhere on the Wai’anae mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t believe it was an aircraft. I’m not sure about flying saucers. I would more believe it to be a meteor. Either way, I’m open to suggestions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used “Google Earth” to show the direction of the fire ball I witnessed.

A crystal clear evening I could see the big dipper and Venus in full view.  All of a sudden I saw a slow moving sphere moving in direct alignment of Venus gliding North across the sky.  I thought it was a small plane because there is a small airplane strip here in Novato.  This was somehow slower moving and larger than a private plane or jet.  The color was different as well.  At first it looked white then as it moved closer across the sky toward where I was viewing,it became reddish or like an amber color.  It got bigger and brighter and just as I started to think &#34;that&#39;s not a plane&#34;.....it started to fade and I mean fade in a hurry.  IWithin 3 seconds it just faded and vanished into thin air. I started yelling at my husband that I saw something and didn&#39;t know what happened to the moving light/object.  Did my eyes distort or was I imagining it?  That was my skeptical self talking.  I wanted to make something real out of what I just saw.  No, I witnessed an unidentified flying object that glided across the sky, silently and disappeared before my eyes.  I left an email with my local news station asking if anyone else had witnessed what I did. It happened so fast and it&#39;s seared in my memory.  I&#39;ll never forget it.<n>

I looked into the sky and there was a spherical object moving at an extraordinarily fast speed (faster than anything I have seen with my naked eye) on a diagonal down towards earth. I would say it was about 100 feet off of the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a light pulsing from the object that was somewhat like a strobe light although the lights did not move like a strobe light. The light was pulsing and was very bright, almost incandescent. I only saw the object for approximately 4-5 seconds and then it disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off. The object was seemingly gone and I did not see it again although I waited for a few minutes. My dig did not notice and there was no one else around on this semi dark cul de sac.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was shining much brighter and then dim as if it were coming closer and then ascending back.  I tried to get my brother to look at it but it was simply gone.  The night tonight is perfectly clear.  I plan to go back out and keep looking...<n>
3/20/07 20:00|Livermore|CA|Circle||Bright circular object of rusty orange color crossing sky, then quickly fading|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55853.html|105|ndxe200703| Bright circular object of rusty orange color crossing sky, then quickly fading<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 20, 2007, my youngest daughter and I were walking toward the local HS parking lot from the gymnasium, returning home after a school event.  The night was remarkably clear and I could see all the stars pretty clearly.  There were a number of airplanes flying on the normal approach paths.  Sirius and Orion were prominent in the Southern sky.  The planes approaching SFO and other Bay Area airports routinely stack up in both a southeast and easterly approach corridor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eye caught a very bright orange colored light that was roughly aligned to the southeast approach, but definitely the wrong color for airplane landing lights (of which I see many).  The light of this object was very bright, a bright rust red/orange, at least 2 to 3 time the brightness of Sirius but the color of Mars through a telescope (I am a life-long amateur astronomer).  I’d watched it for 10 seconds or so and was wondering why it didn’t have any navigation lights because up this point, I was assuming it was a commercial aircraft.  I’m quite familiar with aviation.  I finally mentioned it to my youngest daughter, that I think that object is a UFO, but really half jokingly, expecting any second to see the red/green navigation lights, a strobe or some indication of normal aircraft appearance.  It was certainly Unidentified and Flying (or Orbiting) and it was definitely an Object of some kind.  The speed across the sky suggested an aircraft or satellite and it moved silently as far as I could surmise above the noise of the other people.  I’m not sure any else noticed and I admit I was too shy to point, and say, &#34;Hey, look a UFO!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My youngest daughter had dashed off in a different direction to seek my other daughter (about 15 seconds into the observation) because there was still nothing unusual other than the bright steady color.  I continued to watch for another 20-30 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time I looked down to unbuckle my digital camera to try for a picture, although with the glare of the parking lot and lack of any tripod, I didn’t really hope for much, even at full zoom.  However, by this time it faded suddenly as it crossed Orion’s belt over the span of 3-5 seconds.  Strangely, satellites usually brighten as they head out of the shadow of the Earth and go into sunlight.  This object had the opposite behavior, approaching from deep shadow brightly becoming dim as it moved toward the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter rejoined me and I told her that our object just vanished before my eyes.  I came home and wrote up and drew what I had just seen.  The most remarkable part of the event was that Sirius, the brightest stellar object in the sky, was clearly much more point-like and dimmer than the object, which passed within a few degrees of the star on its way toward Orion, and therefore provided an excellent comparison object.  The object seemed initially to have almost a planetary disk appearance, which was not twinkling or point like but more like a circular smudge.  As it faded, it became much more point like and finally vanished.  I’ve seen satellites &#34;flares,&#34; and the color tends to be very white.  This object was clearly a different color than any satellites I’ve seen.  If I was to speculate it could have been a spacecraft or very slow moving orbital object skipping off the atmosphere.  At no time did it move in a way that suggested intelligent control so I can’t say for certain it was anything but &#34;a highly unusual sighting.&#34;<n>

It was very cloudy but not raining and I’m not sure if it was windy or not.  We were on hwy 62 getting ready to turn onto hwy 234 when I saw a shiny dot in the clouds just above the mountains.  I tried to zoom in on it then and was not able to find it in the viewfinder.  My husband couldn’t see it. I couldn’t find it or see it from hwy 234 but I kept scanning the sky.  When we were on Modoc rd.  I saw it again. It was going from shiny to dark to shiny to dark and I was having a hard time finding it in the viewfinder.  My husband couldn’t find a good spot to pull over with the load we were hauling and he still couldn’t see it.  When I was able to find it and start recording it I was leaned over from the passenger side of the truck towards my husband looking between his face and the wind wing, the window was up.  It was more of an oval or a cigar shape when I was zoomed in on it and I thought that when we got home and viewed it we would be able to see wings and be able to identify it as a plane.  I thought it was moving south while I was watching it but when we viewed it on the tv it seemed to be staying in the same place. I stopped recording when some trees came in view and I couldn’t find it again.  I don’t think it disappeared, I think it just went dark and I couldn’t see it again.<n>

I am a retired USAF officer, pilot, with over 60 years of flying.  I have seen weather balloons, space shots and most everything else that you see in the air but these two objects remain a mystery to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were cigar shaped, pure white and made no sound, size is relative to how far away they were.  If the objects were about the size of a general aviation aircraft then they were approximately 1 mile from me and at an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet and moving at a speed of about 150 mph..  Both objects were moving south at the same speed and direction with one behind, slightly further away and slightly higher than the other, what I would describe as a Navy formation rather lose.  The color of both was the same, pure white with no markings or variation in color that would be caused by shadows.  There were no wings to be seen and no protrusions above or below them.  The shape was the same for the top as the bottom and the edges were well defined.  I observed them for about 30 seconds until they went behind a near by tree.  Once I walked past the tree they were no longer to be seen.  The three things that I can’t explain are the lack of any sound, the lack of protrusions above or below and the uniformity of the color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions at the time of about 9:00 AM were clear with an overcast at around 5000 feet and visibility of better than 10 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eye sight and hearing are very good, I passed an FAA flight physical just two weeks ago and still fly on a weekly basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked at some of the reports for the same time period and two seem very close, one reported 3-17-2007 posted 4-27-2007 from Hayward CA. And the other reported 3-27-2007 posted 4-27-2007 from Stanford CT.<n>

It’s was going southeast to northwest and then changed to west.  The object appeared as a very bright white light (almost like an electrical flash).  During its flight path it dropped a small object that was also bright in color.  I would say that it was a meteor or something to that affect but the dropped object did not stay in an angle path with the first.  It completely stopped when ejected and then drifted toward the ground.  The big light was moving at an incredible speed and was at best 4 miles from me.  The sighting ended when both objects vanished (they did not dim out they were there and then they weren’t).  I have seen a fireball when I was younger and have also seen several recordings of dissipating / breaking meteors but none of them behaved in the manner that this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

PD))|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55821.html|109|ndxe200703| Pulse Plasma light / craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking my dog just a few minutes ago I was looking up at the stars and saw, what I thought was a satellite.  It was about the same magnitude of an ordinary star, and sometimes you’ll see a satellite in the morning or at night when the sun from over the horizon hits them just right.  For reference it was moving slightly faster than the satellites I’ve seen in the past. That would mean it was either moving faster than a satellite, or at a similar speed, but lower altitude.  It was moving on an almost perfect easterly heading, if anything a little east to northeast. It did not appear to maneuver or change directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it arc across the sky all of a sudden it was surrounded by a brilliant flash.  That’s when I knew it wasn’t an ordinary satellite I was seeing it was something else.  The flash was not like a strobe light of an airplane, but more like a cloud of plasma that enveloped the light.  Relative to the size of the light I saw moving, the flash appeared to be about 10 times its size.  Then it flashed again about every 5 to 7 seconds.  I watched it until it was out of sight, but then I saw another flash even though I couldn’t see the light itself.  Whatever it was, it just kept on going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While technically a UFO, I’m beginning to think I might have seen a high altitude spy aircraft, or black aircraft.  The flash could have been a pulse detonation type of propulsion system, or atmospheric skip vehicle.  If it was emitting a pulse, or skipping the atmosphere at the altitude I think it was, its exhaust, or the interaction with the atmosphere might have created the flash / plasma effect I was seeing.  The color of the light / vehicle, and the flash were identical, both appearing a brilliant white, similar to a white LED light in color temperature.  There were no other colors or lights that one might normally associate with an aircraft.  Other than the light / flash I could not distinguish the planform of an aircraft or any structure. Again, it was dark, moving fairly fast and at high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here comes the strange part.  As I watched the light arc across the sky, all of a sudden I see a shooting star or something cross its path immediately behind it.  Whatever that was, it was a very very quick streak of light, but in an amber color.  The streak was moving on a line I would estimate to be north to northwest in direction. So I’m thinking did something just shoot at this thing? Or was this a total coincidence.  Very odd, hopefully someone else saw this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I was a trained aircraft observer for the Western Michigan University flight team in the early 1990’s.  During the flight competitions we had an aircraft recognition tests so I was trained to visually identify a wide variety of commercial and military aircraft.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a flare from an Iridium satellite.

Then I noticed that there was an object that had come out of nowwhere by the dull looking star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought that it was a plane.  Then it moved in quick zig-zag and stopped and continued to go East across the sky, it had red and white flashy lights on it and moved much to fast to be a plane!!  And there were more of whatever that was flying through the sky and coming out of the dull looking star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object got lower and lower and then looped around and went straight down infront of me, it was probably 40 feet away.  The object was straight up and down with red lights on it and white flashy lights on the bottom of the object.  It seemed to be stopped in the air about 10 feet from the ground.  The red lights on it reminded me of the towers you see for planes to land at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so scared I could hardly move, I managed to back up and get in the door, I ran down the stairs to get my mother up to see these things.  When we got back outside, the object that was infront of me was back up in the sky and there were 9 or 10 of them flying all over.  They almost looked like planes but then they would stop, or zig-zag, or if one was going East it would suddenly stop and start going West and then stop and continue East again.  They seemed to mainly all be flying towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was trying to rationalize what see was seeing, she would say maybe the government is testing something new, but the UFO&#39;s were all flying from something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke my sister up next to see the UFO&#39;s and she decided to get the binoculars out, but we couldn&#39;t catch any of the moving objects.  Then I looked at the star they were coming from.  My sister looked after I did and we both saw tiny green dots where the star looked like it was.  The dots seemed to be lighting up whatever it was, a ship, a run away for the UFO&#39;s? I bought a video camera so if this happens again we can record it!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As it got closer I could see green, red and purple sparks coming out of the rear of the vessel, (I still noticed the bright white light on the bottom but it wasn&#39;t a spotlight like on aircraft, just a very bright light that you couldn&#39;t tell if it was mounted or part of the sparking it was in the middle of the sparking) at an altitude of only around 500-1000 feet to my west as I was driving Northbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and pulled over to the shoulder as I watched it slowly glide by without ANY sound at all I watched as it went over Fort Collins and out of sight.  It was on the news for only a brief time then no more was heard of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called my boss in Cheyenne and asked if he had seen anything .. He explained exactly what I had seen myself, so I know I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  Other vehicles had pulled over in both my lane and the oncoming lanes, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know of nothing both civilian or military that emits sparks like that, (beautiful colors and very bright as well) that can make zero noise and had no semblance of any cockpit that one could see, it was that close to the ground..  I approximate it&#39;s airspeed at around 100 knots because I could easily watch it as it came into close view and then went by and then watched as it went out of sight again..  It was said, I think, on the news that it was some type of military aircraft that went down.  Might have crashed somewhere South of Loveland, Colorado or Longmont...  Not sure exactly.  I was wondering if anyone else had reported it..  I don&#39;t know any one who did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am actually a little freaked out that I am even in a position where I reporting something like this.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55879.html|112|ndxe200703| I am actually a little freaked out that I am even in a position where I reporting something like this,  but I have nowhere to turn.  I have had an encounter with something not of this world.  I am a 21 year-old college student studying to become a teacher.  One night, about 1 a.m.,  I was returning home from studying late at the library.  I was suddenly forced off the road by a blowout.  I stopped the car and began to change the tire when suddenly my car radio started changing channels rapidly and the car lights began to flicker and dim.  All of a sudden everything just stopped, even my cell phone was off.  I could barley see anything as my eyes didn&#39;t have time to adjust to the darkness.  Across the road right at the tip of the tree line I saw a small orb-like object hovering and slowly changing color red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.  It hovered for about 15 seconds and then started moving rapidly in a square pattern around me, about 50 feet up for another 15 seconds. At this point, I remember feeling a warm paralyzing sensation through out my body. The next thing I remember is opening my eyes, and finding myself directly in front of the car tire with the tire iron in my hand.  The only difference was the time, it was 5:30 a.m. and starting to get light.  The spare was changed and leaning up against the car, I don&#39;t remember getting that far with the tire change.  I drove home in a state of shock and when I arrived in the house I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  My right eye had a red mark on the outside corner; I had red marks in the back of my throat and soreness ((deleted)).  For the next 3 days, none of my body functions were operational, meaning I did not defecate or urinate for that period of time.  Usually, I am very regular.  Since that time I have not slept and my appetite has all but vanished.  My desire to study or do anything productive is gone. I am really scared that something has been done to me physically, or there is some underlying trauma that my mind is blocking out.  Please help me, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, and I feel I am going crazy.  ((deleted/obscene))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This would keep continuing. There also were several little blinking lights all over the sky surrounding it. The orange craft would keep appearing and disappearing in different places in the sky fairly low to the ground. Then the last time we saw the fireball appear it had several orangish-red lights around the bottom of an oval shaped craft. Then it disappeared. Also as all of this was going on there were about 4 or 5 lights that would fly along with the craft which were just a bit smaller than the craft. Those and the several all over the sky were white colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  Possibly 2006 sighting, or a sighting on March 19, 2007.

It was a light that was moving very fast, I could tell that it wasn&#39;t on the ground because of how fast it was moving.  At first it was a bright white light but after about five seconds it dipped off the rimrock and turned a pale green color. As it hovered off of the rimrock I could tell that it was a sphere shape.  After that it was gone in an instant. It made no noise and I was alone, I was quite afraid of what I&#39;d seen.<n>
3/19/07 11:22|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|1 day|Air Force fired projectiles of some sort at alien craft and hit them directly, causing all of the craft fired upon to hit the ground.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55818.html|116|ndxe200703| Air Force fired projectiles of some sort at alien craft and hit them directly, causing all of the craft fired upon to hit the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn&#39;t believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I&#39;m convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we&#39;ve had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren&#39;t able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it&#39;s not reported in the media and I haven&#39;t heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it&#39;s being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I&#39;ve had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn&#39;t seem to be afraid of showing themselves off. This event was in Lakewood, CO at the time probably 2 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/19/07 09:45|Dublin|CA|Other|Approx 1 hr|2 stationary white objects at high altitude - then disappeared after 1 minute. 3 more objects seen moving slowly across the sky.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55813.html|117|ndxe200703| 2 stationary white objects at high altitude - then disappeared after 1 minute. 3 more objects seen moving slowly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working at a construction site I happened to look up (towards the north) and observed what appeared to be 2 white roundish objects at an extreme altitude. At first I thought they might be a pair of sea gulls but they didn&#39;t move - they stayed in the exact same spot. We had some high altitude cloud whisps  in the general area but they were not clouds - they were too white and very distinctly formed. I watched the objects for approx 30 seconds and then moved to a different position to get a better look and when I returned to that part of the sky they were gone. While the objects were visible I mentioned to another construction worker but he didn&#39;t bother to look. Approximately 5 to 10 minutes later I happend to look up again out of curiosity and spotted a single white round object moving slowly from west to east. I first spotted the object to the west - what I would estimate to be over the hills that seperate Castro Valley (in the west) and Dublin - this object appeared to be in a high altitude as well, but not as high as the first 2 objects. This time I was able to get the construction worker to look up and he thought it was a balloon - which was my thought as well as it was moving very slowly but in a staight line. As it passed over head I moved to adjust my view again and when I looked back up it was gone. This happened 2 more times over the next approx half hour. The third object was almost in the same exact spot when I spotted the second and it moved just as slow and in a straight line from west to east only this time it was red. Again as it passed over head I adjusted my view and again it was gone.  The third and last time this happened the object was again white, it moved in the exact same path that the previous white and red object had moved, at approx the same speed, but this time I kept my eyes on it (thinking that it maybe a balloon again) but after it passed overhead, it proceeded a ways - to what I would estimate to be the Altamont Pass hills area east of Livermore - and! then it stopped!  I continued looking and I used my hardhat brim to try to see if it was still moving, I kept my head absolutely motionless and used the Satilite Antenna on a distant hill as a reference point to make sure I wasn&#39;t moving my hardhat at all. The object was still in the same spot that it had stopped in but it was becoming dimmer and that&#39;s when it came to me that it must be moving up. This is when I realized that it was also becoming smaller - I watched this object for about 3 to 4 minutes total till it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By this time i was scared. I continued to stay outside even after i got home waiting for my roommate to come home and see it. i sat on the ground to make sure that i wan&#39;t me moving and it was that and it worked.. then i hid my fave behind a tree so i could no longer see it to see if it would move to be in my site and it did. The brightness was a yellow auburn color on the bottem brightness there was a hint of a green glow.I saw planes that were in the background so i knew it was semi close.

I had just completed a 3-11 shift in Chatham and headed due west on the backroads back to my home in Dennis. As I left work at 11;15, I spotted an unusual object upon turning westward and kept my eye on it all the way back to Dennis and never lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped to pick up my son at his girlfriends house at about 11:30 and drove to a nearby parking lot with him to show him the oddity in the sky. It was the new moon and the sky was very clear with bright stars everywhere. I pointed to the object I had been witnessing for about twenty minutes. My son looked up and his mouth feel open! He said &#34;Holy **** mom, what IS that?&#34; I told him his guess was as good as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to drive to a local historic tourist attraction located on one of the geographically highest topographies in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As luck would have it, the vantage point at this tower is due west and many locals and tourists alike enjoy watching the sunset from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There, right in front of us, was the object we had seen. Within minutes we saw two similar objects were present as well. They formed a triangle. The one closest to us,which I estimated to be between ten and twelve miles away but may have been closer, was also in the closest proximity to the Earths surface. The one to the right, about twice that distance away as it was also further from the Earths surface, seemed to be more &#39;orb&#39; shaped and frequently glowed in a fiery white to gold to orange. The furthest away was located at the apex of the triangle and appeared to be lit brightly on the top, but there were no clouds in the sky to reflect this off of, this object appeared to be about two to four miles in the air, but that was difficult for me to gage. All three of them just hovered although sometimes the lower two seemed to move up and down slightly and all three of them maintained their basic vicinity, they also did small concentric circles perpendicular to the surface of the Earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of the objects flashed lights along their perimeters. Sometimes they flashed synchronicitously, sometimes seperately, with colors flashing white, yellow, red and green. At this point, I called a friend of mine in Arizona to deatil tthe phenomena I was witnessing and we spoke through approximately forty five minutes of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point my son and I noted the closest object with its changing colored lights move closer to us and we held our breath not knowing what would occur next! My son called a friend of his who showed up with some friends. They also witnessed what we were watching. I called my ex spouse to see if he would come up with his video camera but he couldn&#39;t. He attempted to see it from his house but could not. He said the stars were very bright but that his vision was hampered by a wooded area to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Small flashes seemed to emit from the lower two sporadically. The flashes shot from the bottoms of the objects, but not directly from the center. They were lit trails that disappeared from view after a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two hours, the objects departed, one by one. The first to leave was the closest to us. it headed westward silently with its lights changing colors and all remaining lit. It moved quickly and i watched it disappear over the horizon. The object to the right glowed and moved westward also. The object at the apex seemed to drop a long way then move staight up and then westward as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove home and emailed seeral friends about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it started to get dark I looked up to see a strange Blue/Green fireball in the sky with an orange tail behind.  The fireball traveled from North to South across the sky and seemed to be pretty low.  I started to scream &#34;LOOK&#34;, to get the attention of others around me.  We stood in amazement not knowing what we just witnessed.  After about 10-15 seconds it disappeared.  Since then I&#39;ve tried to research to see what it was that we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Othello has many agricultural farmland.  There were many planes in this area dispensing something in the form of chem trails.  One such chem trail cloud was very thick and long.  There was a small, silver, spherical looking probe that continously entered and exited the formation.  After about 30 seconds, it went in the cloud again and never came back out.  It was silver, reflecting sunlight, and was about the size of a car tire.  It resembled sputnik, minus the spikelike antenna.  I believe it was monitoring the contents of the chemtrail in the air for extended periods of time throughout the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One aircraft was behind and to the left of the other aircraft; however both were flying in the same westerly direction (290 degree heading, I estimate). Since they were both in the same general area, they caught our eye on this bright clear day. They were not directly overhead, but maybe at 70 degrees above horizon, if you consider 90 degrees is directly over head. We were looking at them in a southwesterly direction. Both I, my wife, and 12 year old daughter observed a faint black trail extending a great distance from the front of the lead aircraft. It was in perfect trajectory with the heading of this aircraft. Observed this strange trail for only about five seconds and then the trail was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot tell you if they were military type of aircraft or not, since they were so high up.<n>

Suddenly we were looking at an object that appeared out of nowhere it looked like a satellite moving in the sky.  satellite look like slow moving stars so thats what we thought it was at first. we commented on how cool it was to see such things like satellite in the sky, as our eyes followed the bluish looking star object drifting slowly to the right of us it suddenly darted to the left of the sky then the right then left again then hovered slowly and stopped. my mom pointed it out to our friend was a student pilot,  she said wow thats really strange planes do not fly that high or move that fast and satellite do not dart quickly across the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the area after the object stopped moving and just looked like another star in the sky.

They seemed too far. I think they were 3 objects but maybe there were more since sometimes they were blocked from my view by buildings.  The first two were black. First I thought they were some birds but I quickly realised they were something else.  From my flat they looked horizontal but not much else I can tell.  The third one was different because there was some kind of orange in it but it&#39;s diificult to say.  All I know is that it was cloudy and windy and that the object was there in the sky. It was stationary.  It was no plane, helicopter or birds.  No light or sound.  I doubt it was a kite since it was quite high and sometimes I would lose visiual contact with it as the clouds would hide it.  Like I said, it was windy but it would not budge.  I tried to take a picture but I got nothing as it may have been too far.<n>

The sky was 2 octas covered with cumulus clouds. The object flew from the open sky and passed under the clouds and disappeared and appeared again, and finally disappeared into the clouds. Even though the end of the clouds were in sight, the object did no more appear. The size of the object was around 30 feets in diameter. (cumulus, altitude approx. 2500 feets) The speed of the object was approx. 500km/h, much more fast then the clouds. That’s why I cannot think of a weatherballoon. There was no sound and Saturday was quiet in our place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But 12 ours later I went out of the house (3.30 am)because my dogs were barking to go out. So I opened the door and it was silent. But I heard like a plane was circling at the sky for more then 2 hours. The sky was open, no clouds, the stars were visible. Now I thougth for a moment of a unmanned spyplane…?? The location of the sound came from the same direction were the object disappeared into the clouds 12 hours before.<n>

I was able to get a better look and saw a triangular object, it was metallic in color and each corner of the object was dark. I heard no noise coming from it, yet I could here the engines of passenger jets as they passed overhead shortly thereafter. I could not determine the altitude because it was overhead with nothing to reference it against. I watched the object for a couple of minutes and then went into the house to get a more powerful set of binoculars, I was gone for less than a minute and the object was gone. I scanned the skies and could not relocate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not going that fast and it did not make any type of sound. I thought maybe it’s a plane and I just have not seen its wings yet or something was hiding its wings because it might be to high, but then I looked toward the southern sky and there was a commercial airplane flying at about the same altitude as this object and I noticed everything about that Airplane. So if these two things were flying away from each other at the same altitude then I knew this was no airplane. So I looked back at the Cigar like object and figured it must not have wings. So I kept looking at the object until it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a star because it remained in the same position for over 8 minutes. But it was too low on the horizon to be a star--and far too bright.  After about 8 minutes, it began to move to the left, and kept approaching until it was nearly overhead.  Looking directly up at it, it flew by--very quietly--and had a chevron/boomerang shape.  It seemed to be going east of where a plane would be going (to either SFO or OAK airports).  As it passed, I could make out smaller lights--I can&#39;t remember whether they were colored.  It was a clear, warm night with many stars visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Blinking, solid, and then strobing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking around at a resort in the Phoenix area.  It was night time.  I was looking up in the sky as I was walking, and noticed a red light blinking in the same fashion as an airplane.  A minute or so later, I realized that it wasn&#39;t really moving, so I stopped walking to see if maybe it was an illusion because I was walking or if was truly not moving.  When I stopped, I noticed that it was moving at a very slow rate of speed, much too slow to be an airplane.  I then thought that it was perhaps a blimp.  It  started moving in an a zig-zag fashion at that same slow rate of speed.  I told my wife that that is rather odd... we kept watching it for a minute or so and the light then came on solid, and started to pick up speed in a straight line fashion.  It hit what appeared to be airplane speed in a straight direction.  Then, it proceeded to start blinking in a strobe fashion and appeared to plummet towards the Earth.  We watched as it streaked down towards the horizon at a shooting star type of speed, all the while it was strobing in a very rapid fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching t.v. in my living room and something caught my eye from the window. It was a bright blue light, spherical in shape, that traveled westward across the sky in about 10 seconds or less. I was (and still am) extremely puzzled on its nature, for it came with no sound. Looking up into the sky from my standpoint, it was about the size of the top of my thumb.  It moved too slowly and was too large to be a shooting star, and the same for any other form of air travel that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student majoring in biology, and am very science oriented. So I am trying to view the situation with all possible explanations.<n>

I watched as the bright lights on the craft flashed around. The lights on the craft were all white and it rose up out of the valley, at about a 15 degree angle, almost straight up, at too fast a rate for it to be anything that man&#39;s made. Then it hovered way up in the sky for about 10 seconds and then zigged for 2 seconds &amp; zagged for another 2, and then took off straight up and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful clear day, no clouds and around 78 Fahrenheit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: One large white object, oval and moving very slowly towards the mountains.  Around the large oval object were about 19 smaller, objects looming around the larger object.  There was a very big difference in size between the larger object and the other smaller ones. The large one was very easy to see.  The smaller ones were very small and spread out.  With much difficulty we were able to count 19 of the smaller ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their shape:  The large one had the shape of a jellyfish oval on top and flatter on the bottom with shaded area on bottom.  The small objects were bright white specks such as a star might look in the daytime.  However, these were not stars.  They were spread out around the white object and stayed around it for 5-10 minutes.  After that, we were only able to see the bigger object and no longer saw the bright specks anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was air traffic in the area, bith civil and air force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background:  First observer = wife; educator in school district.

It was cloudy and raining as I was driving towards the most westerly exit of Ironton, I noticed this bright yellowish orange football shaped light in a horizontal position, low over the most westerly part of Ironton, to the south of the McDonalds’ arch I pulled off the second exit, turned left toward the Ironton Hills mall and proceeded to the nearest portion of the mall that would allow me an unobstructed view of the town below me. I thought about getting the attention of the nearest person to me who was a man smoking a cigarette alone. I let him be due to the nature of this situation as he might think I was mentally ill. I kept my mind on the task at hand: to get a good photo. I took two photos, one on the horizontal axis and the second on the vertical. I viewed the object through the viewfinder when I took the pictures as I sat in my truck facing the south. Nothing showed up in the photos after they were developed but I saw it with mine own eyes. I went back to the same exact area at the Ironton Hills mall (about 11:30am), after my appointment, and I could not find what I had seen before. I scanned the pics into my pc and opened up the file with Microsft Picture Library and to my surprise there is an acorn shaped craft slightly about and to the left of the McDonalds&#39; arch. It was not like the what I had seen with mine own eyes but it was in the same spot where I had seen the football shaped light. I called the sheriff dispatch and she was interested and commented that a sargent who &#34;Eats this kind of stuff up&#34; (her words)and he would call me back. The dispatcher commented that that particular McDonalds&#39; in located on state road 93 in western Ironton,Ohio.<n>

Noticed that the &#39;satellite&#39; was really moving fast compared to the normal amount of time for satellites.  Object then changed course in a tight curve (at that speed, current tech, gotta be about a 5 - 9G turn at what sure looked like 3,000+ mph) and proceeded straight again for about 10 seconds where it met up with another &#39;satellite&#39;.  At this point the two objects started doing a criss-cross of flight paths, while making another high speed tight turn (tight being defined as hold out hand at arms length, spread thumb and forefinger, the turn occured within that space at arms length...tight turn.).  Both objects continued criss-crossing each others flight path while making two more turns &#39;together&#39; before I lost them in the light pollution of the city.  Objects were dimmer than the airliner I initially spotted, no visible running/collsion light on either of them, no visible plume like the airliner.  Airliner was at an estimated 25,000 - 30,000 feet in altitude (assuming that would be normal over Calgary, AB when not stopping) and the first object was noted to pass behind the plume from the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that it could be modern fighter craft, but it would have to be one tough model of aircraft to execute that kind of turning.  If so, very impressive...and very impressive G-Suits too considering...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was like none I have ever seen in my entire whole life.  I was camping with the family since it is winter there are no leaves so the sky is wholly visible.  I was tending the campfire, thinking about this and that, when all of a sudden blam!  Two white spheroids appeared before my very eyes.  They were about a quarter mile away, just seeming to float.  They merged together into one unit, though it maintened separate parts.  It was making strange noises as well, though it mixed with the sounds of the woods to make it indistinct.  When the two spheroids came together, I don&#39;t mean to be crude, but it resembled a human &#34;buttocks&#34;.  It kind of shook around and made me angry.  I didn&#39;t like it one bit, but can&#39;t really say why.  The two-in-one was the only one I observed, and the only one I ever care to.  After a while, five minutes at the most, it went dark, and its luminescence faded from the bottom up to the top, till it was completely gone.  I didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to wake up my wife and kids, but I assure you I have seen such an object.  Please let me know if this correlates with others&#39; experiences.

I am entering it here, as well as a more recent sighting, after doing a bit of research for my own personal interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the early Spring of 2007, I was taking a country drive with my then-girlfriend at night (about 11 o&#39;clock pm).  We were headed west on a road about a mile south of feedlot just north of Pratt, KS.  As I was driving, I saw a bright green light streaking overhead in roughly the same direction as I was headed.  It moved quickly and seemed to burn out.  Its altitude was probably around 500 to 1000 feet above ground level.  At the time, I&#39;d simply assumed that it was a meteor burning green as it passed through methane gas emitting from the feedlot below.  I suppose that is what it could&#39;ve been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason for me bringing it to NUFORC&#39;s attention is that I happened to be perusing the report database and came across a report fitting roughly the same description of the event I witnessed in &#39;07.  Having always assumed that what I saw was just an easily explained event (meteor cooking off methane gas as it plummeted earthward?), I did a quick internet search of green meteors.  What I stumbled across was the supposed phenomenon of &#34;green fireballs&#34; and an Air Force research project from the early &#39;50s called &#34;Project Twinkle&#34;.  After reading the declassified conclusion of the project, I believe that my sighting does indeed fall into the category of an &#34;Unidentified Flying Object&#34;, though I doubt that it had much to do with any &#34;intelligent&#34; origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I appreciate the NUFORC resource and I&#39;m glad to see that it is still going strong after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought it was a meteor, by the way it was moving. I watched fly at a high rate of speed toward the East. There were no lights, yet some kind of soft glow and it looked oval in shape and exactly like what I just saw on the AOL clip. It was hard to tell how large it was, as I could not tell how far up in the air it was. I watched it flow steadily across the sky and out of sight. There was no sound of any kind.<n>

My brother and I were camping in San Clemente.  We looked southwest towards the San Onofre reactor when we both noticed two orange lights. I could not make out a shape but they looked round from where we were.  I estimate the lights were 15-20 miles from my position and probably out over the Pacific Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed two lights moving up and down in alternating times.  When one was up, the other went down, and when one went down the other went up.  I am an airplane and bird fan and I can say for sure this was no plane.  Could it have been a light source from Camp Pendleton? Maybe.  But, how would the light reflect so far and off of what would the light be reflecting off of?  I think the light source originating from Camp Pendleton is not reasonably probable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The motion of the lights appeared coordinated and under intelligent control.  I think these were two separate objects.<n>

3/15/07 19:00|Delta|CO|Cone|20 minutes|Spotting two UFO's at night, one landing the other taking off, plus one other on the ground the very next day.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56074.html|170|ndxe200703| Spotting two UFO&#39;s at night, one landing the other taking off, plus one other on the ground the very next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about March 15, 2007, my husband decided he wanted to go for a drive.  I went, my two daughter&#39;s and my sister.  We had our three dog&#39;s as well with us.  We all entered our Suburban and left.  This was around eight p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We like to go out into the desert, so we drove out to the Gunnison Gorge, because it is peaceful, very desolate, secluded, and quiet.  We took our time, and finally reached our destination.  We like to stop and watch the sky for unusual things, so we did this for almost an hour.  Nothing was seen by anyone, so all five us climbed back into our vehicle, my husband driving, and started heading towards town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving, I looked out of my window.  I shouted to everyone to look out and we saw an amazing sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was out the window was some kind of bell shaped craft landing.  It was glowing, and on the bottom were all kinds of colored lights.  I yelled at my husband to stop the Suburban, and we all scrambled out to see this awesome sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very large, and took about 10 minutes to land.  My daughter screamed out, &#34;look over there!&#34;, and to our surprise, a second craft was taking off from the same area the first one was landing.  My heart was pounding.  I had waited my whole life to witness this phenomena, my lifelong dream coming true.  I was elated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was all over, we went on home.  The conversation in the truck was one of excitement all the way home, not stopping until we all went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, my husband wanted to go for another drive to the same place.  This time it was my husband, myself, our two daughter&#39;s, and three dog&#39;s.  I believe my sister was a little scared to go again, so she opted to stay at home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived in the same area, and could not believe our eyes.  This time I brought a camera.  On the ground was a large, circular, UFO.  This craft was big and white, and very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was the first to spot it.  Slamming on the brakes he yelled out &#34;look over there!&#34;  My eyes were popping out of my head.  Another one, and this one on the ground.  It was completely different from the two of the previous night, but got my attention just the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband pulled over, we all jumped out, and I took several pictures of this &#34;UFO&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera was digital, so I went and had pictures made as soon as we got back home.  The next day, we decided to go again, and the UFO was still there, but had changed places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The drive on the next day also revealed something disturbing.  We had discovered three dead cows.  One in the desert, and two in a field.  These cows had been cut open with precision, all organs missing.  No blood could be found around them, either.  The birds and all other scavengers steered clear of these animals.  I also discovered a skunk in the same condition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I photographed all of these animals, but had my film camera that day, and still need to develop the film.  Someday I will, and will show these pictures as well as the landed UFO to those who are interested<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Sure enough as I tried to keep my eye on it and pull over, it had just disappeared with no trace of it in sight.  Again, the sky was extremely clear blue that day and it was sunny so I’m guessing that’s how it hid itself so good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of its distance (approx. 1 km away and fairly high in the sky) all I can say is that it was in the shape of a disk and it appeared to be silver due to the colour of the sky (no clouds) and the brightness of the sun that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

3/15/07 14:00|Tucson|AZ|Circle|15 minutes|typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79589.html|173|ndxe200703| typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t give the exact date, but can give you an approximate date because it was during spring training baseball in Tucson.  There also was an airshow going on at nearby  Davis- Monthan Air Force Base.  The year was 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, son and I were watching the game, but were distracted by the air show when I noticed idle in the sky between the parks we were at and the airshow was a disk.  I got my son and husband’s attention to see what I was seeing.  Both watched with me for several minutes.  I then turned to a neighbor to the left of me to take a look.  When I turned back to see the UFO it was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to go back a second to tell you that I was thinking to myself, &#34;I see you.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not visible to me the rest of the game and so my attention was drawn back to the game.  A couple of hours later we walked back to our car out in the lot and began our drive back home.   We went on with the rest of our day and there was really no other conversation about what we’d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, I was awakened by a lime green light in my face.  I was aware that I had been sound asleep and now I was seeing something that made no sense to me.  It had writing along the edge of it.  It seemed to be suspended at head level with me.  I could not make out the symbols.  The light seemed to have formed the size and shape of a VCR.  I sat looked to the right of me where my husband was sleeping soundly to see where I was just to get my bearings.  The clock was where it was supposed to be, and then I looked to the foot of my bed toward the right where the t.v. sat with its light in the lower corner.  Both the clock and t.v. were red yet what I was seeing was lime fluorescent green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that there were 3 small people standing there and one more standing a bit further to the right of the rest.  I have an executive height dresser which sat behind them so I could gauge the height of these little people.  Not one was a full head higher than my dresser.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a bit unnerved by this time and turned back toward my husband and wrapped my arms around him and went to sleep.   I didn’t know if they stayed or left and really wanted to feel safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning very early my son and I went out to the car, the morning dew was still on the window where I saw an unusual hand print of what I only can guess was a thumbprint of some sort and 3 fingers imprinted on the window behind the driver’s seat.  My son and I both looked at it and then looked toward the west where we were met with a very, very bright white light.  So bright it frightened me.  I put my arm around my son and led him back into the house.  He had seen it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that time, we have had occasion to feel some very subtle sensations in our bodies.   I was unaware that my son had a visit from these little people, but he claimed to have had something that woke him too.  I never asked him what all he had experienced that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough I called my daughter in the bay area to tell her what had happened.  She was in disbelief of course until I told her about the fluorescent green light when she said to me, “mom you aren’t going to believe this, but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that I should say something as time will inevitably fade my memory of events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose it sounds a bit corny to add that I feel we are looked in on from time to time as I believe this area to be somewhat of a hotbed of activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still very new to this area and I always wondered if they were curious or keeping track of the amount of new population growth in this area, but I speculate.  I really have no idea why they were here, but I do know that they were able to keep watch of me at the game, follow me to my car, follow us home and know exactly where I sat in the car and furthermore knew I knew they were aware of me as much as I was aware of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t have anything else to add, but am unafraid of any repercussions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not drink or take drugs and I’m not crazy.  The story you’ve read is my account of the events that occurred to the best of my recollection.<n>

I was alone but it is probable that other people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near a corridor often taken by commercial planes to land at Montreal Trudeau international airport; in the axis of the landing runway if you prefer. The object was taking the same corridor as if preparing to land on the runway to… But it was obvious than it was NOT an air craft – nether commercial, military, or a hot air balloon (or a children helium inflated balloon) – it was not affected by the wind like it would had normally done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objet was perfectly spherical and divided in two vertically. The left – or front part- looked like well shined stainless steel.  The “rear part was light brown – or dark beige – a bit remembering leather. It size could be compared as a dime held at arm length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew a about the same speed and altitude than commercial plane, in total silence and was not affected by the wind – as a balloon would have probably done as I did said. Its direction was about east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for around 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ps. I will soon send a photo and a description of a sort of crop circle that appeared behind my father 25 years ago (and still there)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Truly yours, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was crossing the sky at a speed which appeared to be twice that of a normal airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be triangular in shape against the bright starlit sky, however, the object appeared to be distorted.  The only comparison I can provide is the distortion appeared like a ship coming out of cloak and remained constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was quiet and there were no other airlines visible within my view.

I am an air traffic controller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crew of an Express Jet Embrair Jet asked if I showed any traffic at their 2 o’clock position and about 40 miles.  I did not and told them so.  I then asked for a description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They reported the object to have reddish light with some white.  At about the same time the crew of another Express Jet confirmed the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first aircraft was about 50 miles east of Corpus Christi, TX, southbound at 36,000feet.

It was an unseasonably warm eveing. Temperature was around 70 degrees F. There was little to no wind. The sky was clear. Humidity was low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a small town in northern North Carolina. There are lights from a shopping mall about a mile away and street lamps here and there in our neighborhood BUT on a clear night one can still see many familiar constellations, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happened to look up at the sky when I observed the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the ligts were yellowish in color and NOT blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving in a general S to N line at an EXTREMELY high rate of speed. When I first saw them they were about 12 o’clock position and only took about 2-3 sec. to go out of sight to the N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One has to remember that tthis happened VERY fast. As best as I can remember there were 5 or 6 lights in the shape of a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its hard to say whether this was a single object with several lights or several distinct objects. The lights all moved in tandem and at the same rate of speed. What struck me as much as anything was the RATE of speed and the absolute silence before, during, and after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 years old and this was my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a veteran and my son is a pilot. I have been around aircraft all my life and I have NEVER seen any aircraft move at that rate of speed. To cover half of the night sky in 2-3 seconds is MOVING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now a big problem here is to try and judge the SIZE of the object or objects. I am not able to do that  as it happened so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course the larger the object(s) was....how far away it was....is all very important in determing its speed. I was not able to do that !  As I stood there contemplating what I just saw ( 5-10 min) I could see a couple of aircraft lights coming into view coming from the ENE heading on a WSW trajectory as we live on a corridor for traffic into the Greensboro PTI airport which is about 35 miles away to our WSW so at night there are aircraft almost constantly in the sky on this line of flight. The sightings were on the opposite side of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately thought that &#34;some of these pilots in these commercial aircraft MUST have seen what I saw. There was just no way they could have missed it.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no mention of anything related to this on the local 11  0’Clock TV news !<n>

Around 9:15 pm PST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hail&#39;s Passage (Between Gig Harbor Mainland and Fox Island)  The area is a frequent aircraft inbound route to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. We see bright lights all the time, but they move and it is clear to see the blinking lights of the aircraft and the descent and direction of the planes towards Sea-Tac.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a hot tub with my friend, and he was looking at what was believed by him to be a bright star. He brought it to my attention and I moved to see what it was. It was no star at all. The object seemed to be around 1,000 ft, about a half mile away. It was extremely bright, almost like an incondensant light. It was so bright the deck was lit up outside. I got out and grabbed their high power binoculars and steadied my grip to get a clear view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed five(5) distinct square lights on the side facing me. Underneath those five lights, there were four(4) more of the same style lights in the gaps beneath the upper lights. It was extremely bright all around the object, but I could make out where the object curved around from the shadow and where the lights ends on one side to the other. I then lost my grip and could not see another clear up-close view of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt the feeling I was being watched, so I slowly put the binoculars back inside and returned to see the object finally drifting very slow behind the trees to the right of us. Not more than one minute later a very large military jet flew overhead towards the object, followed closely by a smaller fighter jet headed in the same direction. These two jets could easily have been scrambled by McChord Airforce Base, not fifteen miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This further strengthened my belief this was a UFO of some sort. There have been more and more reports around the Puget Sound lately. I have heard other reports of this same object on the same night from Fox Island too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They saw it move about quickly then hover...they called me out to see it. They said it appeared to be shooting off lights.  My younges daughter and I also witnessed this brillant light dart`to the right then sit still. We could see several aircraft pass directly above and below the light. It continued to move about in the same approximate place but slowly seemed to fade and became difficult to see due to trees--it seemed to be moving toward Sisters, OR.  An hour later we couldn&#39;t see it anymore nor the top of the butte we live on that had seemed to be illuminated by it.  I did call the local police and reported it....they said they will check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At the time of the sighting, I was at a stop light when I saw an odd reflection in the windshield of the car. When I looked up, I saw the leading edge of a spacecraft which appeared to be heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 25 feet in diameter, hovering slowly. I do not recollect seeing any color but remember that the portion I did see looked darker than the rest. There was a shimmery effect over most of the craft. It looked similar to the creature in the movie Predator. Could that have been an effect of &#34;cloaking&#34;?  I remember thinking the craft was round even though I could not see all of it. I did not see any lights, hear any noise from it, nor did it disappear. Unfortunately, the light changed to green and I was forced to move on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching the planes go over head and since I since I live near an airport there are at least 7 planes flying in the sky at night. I looked over the trees and saw a very strange cluster of bright lights moving very slowly. I told my grandmother that I think I see a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were flashing all the way around the center of the craft as it slowly headed over the trees. My grandmother kept insisting that is was a plane but it was too close to the trees to be a plane and it would’ve made some kind of noise. You can hear the planes when they are only tiny dots in the sky. The UFO made no sound whatsoever and it was moving way too slow to be plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen chunks of cosmic debris burning up as they pass in to our atmosphere in a variety of colors, shooting stars, satellites, and all sorts of aircraft, YET I&#39;ve NEVER seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the phone with my friend and decided to go outside for a bit.  I was looking up in to the clear night sky when all of the sudden, my eyes caught unfamiliar movement.  I focused in on the movement.  My eyes revealed to me two triangular shaped crafts.  They were dark in color and had white spots all over the bottom.  I assumed the white spots on the bottom were for lights.  They looked like lights that weren&#39;t turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were flying due North.  They seemed to be at the height of a low-flying plane.  A few odd things I noticed:  -They flew like birds gliding through the sky.  No noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -As the went off in to the horizon, they were flying towards eachother, but didn&#39;t seem to be impacting one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -While they were shaped like triangles, they were not equilateral.  Not only that, but they were not flying aerodynamically.  What would visually appear as the head of the triangle, was NOT the front of the northern moving ships.  It was like they were flying sideways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting lasted about 15 seconds.  It all happened so quick that I was not able to even think about getting my camera inside.  Way too dark, way to short of a sighting.  However, I am a skeptic at heart.  I have NEVER seen anything like this, and know what I saw was valid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mystery to me is: were these man-made craft that are just being kept secret, or are these extraterrestrial craft?  Either way, they were most certainly UFO&#39;s to my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So we really started to watch the sky and about five minutes later a group of seven lights came over head doing the same weaving and flying,   Another ten minutes went by and we saw another group of three that did circles and stopped before taking off again.  The next group had about fifteen in it and it did circles in the sky and changed direction about three times all while weaving around each other then took off going North.  In all last night we saw 57 of the smaller lights including a group of twenty or more ( we couldn&#39;t count them all because there were so many in that group).  We also saw two larger red lights that resembled a tear drop shape but glowing red and much bigger than the 57 other lights we saw.......Needless to say we will be out there again tonight cameras ready hoping for a repeat performance! The smaller objects were round and white, The two larger objects were tear drop shaped and red ( we thought they almost resembled birds).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I’m hoping someone else in the area has witnessed the same, for it was so very conspicuous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late at night when he was on his balcony (facing south) and off to the west, in the distance, approached what looked like a helicopter with a searchlight.  As it drew closer, he realized this was nothing man-made.  It drifted in a straight line ever so casually over the trees across the parking lot in front of him heading toward Oshawa. It was somewhat larger than a bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described it as triangular with a small white light on each point.  In the middle was a massive white light but with no beam coming off it.  The ship was darker than the sky behind it and the lights on it reflected faintly on the underside of the ship.  It made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if this is significant, but the next day he found a burn mark on his left shoulder the size of his thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve never seen something like it, It somewhat amazes me to see something like that but when I see it with my own two eyes, I can&#39;t believe it! It seems normal to him because he&#39;d seen it many times. He said he just want to show it to me so to believe him. and tell himself that his not going crazy. He&#39;s been seeing this objcts since he was 12 years old. He try to tell his family and friends but nobody believed him. when I saw it with my own two eyes I believe him, and I can&#39;t explain what I saw. He said  he had this kind of feelings when it happens. and this night is just one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object/light hovered in one spot for about 2-3 minutes, then disappeared when camera auto-focus beam went off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This just happened last night.  I was at the computer...my wife was doing the dishes...we both kept hearing an unusually loud, low pitched, rumbling sound, going overhead...We could not tell, from inside if the sounds were jet engines, or the wind.  I had gotten up and looked outside on three earlier occasions to see what it was, or if I could see something flying overhead.  There was, in fact, a constant howling wind all evening.  But, there also was a steady stream of jets, aircraft, or something overhead.  I couldn&#39;t see them because of the cloud cover, but I could hear them, that is, apart from the wind.  And, I could hear the Doppler pitch change in the engine sound as they passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Except for the chemtrail planes (I have 100’s of photos) there are no regular flight paths over my place. There also are no major airports nearby.  We have two community airports, Potsdam &amp; Massena, each about 12 miles from my location; one due west, one due north.  Fort Drum is approx 80 miles southwest of my location.  There were no stars or moon visible, there was a low cloud cover, and it was quite windy...I could not tell from inside if the sound I was hearing was the wind or a jet engine...which is why I kept going outside and checking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I went outside for a fourth time (and this is where it gets a little weird), I said to my wife: &#34;I keep getting a sensation like I am being watched, or stared at;&#34; like when someone is standing behind you and is staring at you, and you can almost &#34;feel&#34; it.  The thing is, she was off to my left, in my field of vision, doing the dishes; and we live alone?  I went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbor&#39;s barn, who happens to be a Detective, BCI, with the NYS Troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light/object...we live approximately 150 yds apart.  The light wasn&#39;t reflecting like the moon...it was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, I could only see light, I could not see an object, just a light.  I was looking slightly North of West, up at an angle of approx 35° from the earth...the object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...there were no other lights in the sky...I live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution.  The object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering/ceiling last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife to get my camera, a Canon Power Shot S2-IS (it gets a little weirder here).  As I pulled the camera up to my eye, I was thinking I was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all.  I was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...I zoomed in some on the object and was I thinking; “I&#39;ll take this picture, and then I&#39;ll take another with the flash up/on and see if the object responds to it.”  I had the auto-focus on, and when I squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam.  Then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (I have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1/8 of a second…. just after I zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, I saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue, violet, and green sphere with white light shining through the colors with a blotchy sort look...it kind of looked like a picture of the surface of sun, except this was blue/violet/green...that&#39;s when the shutter went off...and that is what the picture shows. I can’t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the “zooming” that caused me to see it differently throught the viewfinder?  My wife didn’t see what I saw, the change in the objects appearance/color from bright a bright white light, to a blue/violet/green sphere…she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; “where did it go?”  I could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...it seemed to just disappear….I didn’t even think I got anything on the exposure.  I pulled the camera away from my eye to see if I could re-find the object without the camera.  There was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been.  I could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; “Did you see that?”…Everyone sounded quite excited, so was my wife and I.  It looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above.  Although, I could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object/light had been.  The illumination was growing fainter quite fast...so, I pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...it doesn&#39;t show much...just looks like there’s some slightly illuminated fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t talked to my neighbor yet.  I&#39;ve known him since he was born, and I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll even admit to me, let alone anyone else, that he was outside looking up too?  I can&#39;t imagine he&#39;s going to go on record, considering his position...he&#39;s a detective with the NYS Police, BCI, 25 years.  I hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend, I&#39;ll see what happens.  Also, after I took the pictures…I remembered that I hadn’t yet changed my clock on the camera, which is why the time stamp is an hour off from my reported times.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This UFO appeared to be in space..it was very dim but very visible to the naked eye, it  appeared to be the mother ship for what was to come. The shape of the craft resembled that of a wing. It just lookied like a huge wing. judging by the distance it was at, i beileve this ufo was miles long. A 747 flys a 32,000 feet. This object was in space and completely dwarved what planes look like in the sky. It crossed the sky in about 15 seconds. Within an hour this ufo was seen twice. Also, with and without the &#34;mothership&#34; there were massive formations. They were in Formations resembeling the &#34;mothership&#34;. there were about 8 different goose like formations each consisting of 8 to 9 craft. to creat one massive formation. The awesome part was. When it was directly above us in the clearest part of the sky, you can actually see individual craft drifting in and out of formation. these formations crossed the entire sky south to north within 15 seconds.

I looked at the object, which had two lights, one following the other, I don’t remember the color of the lights, but I remember the motion of the lights going across the sky. We also observed a bunch of planes in the sky, but these had the distinctive tell sign of blinking red lights. The object we saw didn’t have blinking lights and from what we could tell didn’t make any noise--as it seemed to be relatively close to the horizon. We were looking west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood for a few minutes wondering what we had seen, because it was so unusually--the speed and the lights.<n>

It was brighter than any star I’ve ever seen.  It was also lower in the sky than any of the other stars in the night sky.  I ran some errands and it was still in the sky, not moving.  I thought it was strange that it was so low in the sky, telephone poles and trees covered it up, which I’ve never had happen to any star I’ve seen.  I ran into my grandparent’s house to pick up some blankets I left there.  I was in their house for about an hour and a half.  When I came outside the light was gone.  My sister was with me during this time period, and I had mentioned it to her.  She is younger so she didn&#39;t really think anything of it, except it was weird when it wasn&#39;t there when we left our grandparent&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night probably around the same time as last night that same light was there again.  I noticed that the light seemed a yellowish color, as opposed to the other stars in the sky which were white.  It was in the sky for an hour or so longer than before, but it disappeared sometime within that night while I was sleeping.  I haven’t seen the light since then, and I find myself looking for it.  I went and tried figuring out if it was maybe a planet or something that people from Earth can see sometimes.  However, I found nothing that looked like what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked as if there were two vehicles flying side by side at extremely high speeds, one slightly above the other. As the vehicle approached, and was in front of us, there appeared to be only one, not two. The vehicle flew very low, low enough for us to make out certain details, but not low enough to skim roof tops or anything of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I can find to describe this vehicle sounds rather silly. It looked like a snowboard. It was rectangular with slightly rounded corners. There was a blue light on each end and the bottom was illuminated white, although no white lights were actually visible. It was bigger than a plane that seats two but smaller than a large passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle itself was platinum colored, very shiny. There were no windows visible. It looked very thin in reference to &#34;cockpit&#34; height. I don’t know where someone would have been sitting? Maybe reclined a bit?  My 10 year old daughter was frightened and asked me &#34;Mommy, what is that?&#34;  I simply responded, &#34;I have no idea honey,&#34; as I could think of nothing to relate this vehicle to. It had no wings and made no sound. It flew like nothing I’d seen before. I am not aware of any vehicle that our military possesses that could possibly fly as fast as this was flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I were evidently not the only people in awe of this sight as there were people driving in the same direction down the same side street that I was, 3 other vehicles, and we all stopped! I never even looked in my rear view mirror. There were people out walking; the weather was beautiful and very warm that evening, as well as watering lawns and they were all stopped and pointing up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was approximately 3 blocks from my home, short neighborhood blocks, not city blocks. I looked away for a second when I realized that I was literally stopped in the middle of the street. Every other car was stopped as well, including a black vehicle that was stopped dead center in a crossing of two streets. It was surreal, like something you’d picture in a movie and as I sat there, I kept trying to make sense of what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got my bearings, I realized that I had been holding my cell because a few seconds before I saw the lights, I heard it ring the voicemail tone. I hit the speed dial for my husband. I kept saying, “go outside, go outside and look up!” He was totally confused and was asking in which direction? I told him to “look east toward Santa Susana Pass because there is something flying in that direction that is unbelievable!” He wasn’t fast enough; he only saw the two lights far, far in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I had been driving North on the side street and had to make a right turn on our street, going east toward my home. As I reached the intersection of my home street and the street I’d been traveling on, I could still see the vehicle in the distance. Again, it looked as though it were two and not one, with one light slightly above the other, side by side. I looked away to the left before making the right hand turn and when I looked back up, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the vehicle was in front of us you could clearly see that it was traveling end to end, but when it was coming toward us and passing us, it appeared as though it was flying side to side. My daughter still insists that it was two, they came together (she uses her hands to describe this), and when they passed, they split apart. I tend to think that it has something to do with the angle it was flying at that makes it appear as though it was two, an optical illusion I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had assumed that there would be many reports of this as I was on a tiny side street and there had to be at least 12 probably more like 15 people on that street alone! It was flying the length of the Valley; I can’t imagine how many other people saw it, but it had to be a large number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t 100% dark, it was clear and there was no way you could miss this thing as low as it was flying, unless you happened to be looking down. Unfortunately my older daughter and her friend were out on the drive way of our next door neighbor’s house, drawing on the ground with chalk, and missed the whole thing! My older daughter kept saying “But we didn’t hear anything!”  I don’t know what it was, but it was ridiculously fast, silent and wingless. It flew in a straight line and the lights on the bottom were constant, no blinking etc. It doesn’t appear that anyone reported it, or if they did, I haven’t read anything about it. They probably feel much the same as I do. You don’t want people to think you’re crazy and you don’t want to be audited every year for the rest of your life for asking the government what it was! lol  I’m posting this to try and get a reasonable explanation to help my little one sleep better at night. Like I said, she was frightened, I on the other hand thought it was amazing but was not in fear at all; more in awe.<n>

It was a clear night with access to a dark part of the sky, even with the brightness of the city.  For about 20 seconds traveling in a completely straight line from south to north was a triangular formation of 5 or 6 dull, white, circles.  I noticed them directly overhead and watched until they disappeared in the distance, going out of view.  They didn’t blink, fluctuate in light intendity or have any noise whatsoever.  I constantly see jets fly over heading to Phila. International Airport in one direction, and jets at a higher altitude heading in the opposite direction (going to Lehigh International Airport?).  These spots seemed to be much higher and moving much faster.  There were actually two jets moving within eyesight at the same time, leading me to believe these spots were higher and faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 6:19:19 AM a floating softball sized glowing white and green orb with a wispy aura set off my front door camera.  It slowly moved out of the field of view at the top by 6:19:52.  At 6:20:36 it came back down and went back out the bottom at 6:20:42.  It repeated again, the same way, at 6:21:28 and disappearing at 6:23:54.  At 6:28:00 it reappeared at the lower left hand corner of the camera image then disappears only to reappear at 6:29:29 in the same spot, then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told our neighbor about it she had to come and see it.  Neither of us could explain it!  I thought it might be a reflection of the sun coming up, but sunrise was not until an hour later and a reflection of the sun or moon would not reverse itself, repeat, or be three dimensional!  Does anyone know who I should report this to before my DVR writes over it in a few days?  To add more mystery to this, the anniversary of my mother-in-law&#39;s death was the previous day and my wife dreamt about her mother that night.  Do..do..do...do.........do...do..do...do.<n>

While in the bathroom, through the skylight, he saw 2 beams of light circling around each other shining down thru the skylight onto the bathroom floor.  Then the lights went away for about half a minute and then they came back again.  He made sure he was awake ... he walked around, he looked up and saw nothing above the skylight, the moon could not have done the light show, and he heard no noise.  Then the lights disappeared.  He went back to bed.  No noise was heard, he saw no one standing on the roof, but for the lights to do what they did, if it was a person on the roof, he would have seen them with the lights.  This is a large skylight and the lights came from above not from the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were talking and just looking at the stars when I noticed this odd formation of lights moving across the sky. There were three clusters moving together- the main cluster was a V shape and the two other clusters were slanted lines coming from the sides of the V’s. They seemed to kind of float like a sting-ray would underwater. I pointed the lights out to my two friends. I pointed out that it was coming from where “Area 51” is supposed to be and one friend also pointed out that it was moving towards Nellis Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after, an airplane left McCarran airport and we compared the two. The UFO was completely silent and seemed to float and flutter while the airplane made a lot of noise and the body was completely visible. Both objects seemed to fly at the same pace and altitude. About a minute after the airplane went by, I noticed another UFO flying a very similar route as the first, except this UFO had no lights and was seemingly transparent. At times it was a dark brown/green color, but mostly the same shade as the night sky. When it flew over stars, it was more visible and the stars seemed to change a little bit. This UFO was going a bit faster than the first and was also completely silent. Unfortunately, only one friend noticed it when I pointed it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friend A, who saw both crafts, believed the first UFO was one object. I, however, believe the two smaller clusters (both made up of about 3 to 4 lights) were just flying extremely close to the main cluster- as if protecting. The cluster to the right seemed to be a little behind when I first noticed, then sped up a little- as if to catch up with the other two crafts. He hadn&#39;t seen it before that moment, but has researched UFOs for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: At my location, the routes of the crafts and of the airplane that left McCarran airport would intersect, making an X. Hence, they flew from and towards different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When it moved closer I saw three lights in a triangular pattern, 2 red and 1 white blinking randomly. I couldn&#39;t tell what side of the aircraft I was looking at because it was very dark, but the lights seemed to be in the center of whatever side I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was completely dark. Save for 1 VERY bright light. It was flashing red and blue, so I got my brother and a friend to check it out. They confirmed. It was NOT a plane. Excited, I went to get a pair of binoculars from my truck. I stood up on my wall and focused in on the object. I saw a round shape with a curved bottom. But on top there was a bright green light just shooting off. On the sides, there were red and blue lights flashing. For about 10 minutes, it slowly dipped toward the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, to my amazement, it split! There were now 2 small white lights about a finger width apart (from the distance away). They sank lower still. Suddenly, they shook violently for a second, then shot back together, again to form the previous object. I was shaking, almost unable to hold on to the binoculars. I gathered myself and watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was close to going over the mountain now. But, before it went behind the mountain, it suddenly just shut off. As if a light switch had disconnected the circuit leading to it. I focused more, and faintly saw the outline against the stars in the back. It descended into the dark mountain. I though it was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the most shocking part. As I continued watching, I saw a black circle shoot down from the sky at a very high speed, with a thin white tail-Right where the UFO had gone down. I almost dropped the binoculars again, but managed to get them to my eyes to see ONE MORE black circle shoot towards the area. The area behind the mountain lit up dramatically and then quickly died down. We checked out the are from a hill. There were flashing red and blue lights, surrounded by little lights all around. Slowly, over the course of an hour. They all died out. Save one. It descended further down the mountain, until we could no longer see it in the darkness of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These spheres were inline with each other,like touching each other but in a straight line,and were all spinning in different directions.

I was driving on I-40 west bound on my way to flagstaff when I noticed a bright circle at my  10 o’clock position.  At first I thought it was a bright star but then I started looked around and noticed it really wasn’t dark enough for stars to be out. The sun  was still a good 45 minutes from setting completely and the moon couldent be seen yet. After about 10 minutes I asked my mother in law if she noticed anything strange in the sky. She replied “yes” and pointed to the bright circle object in the sky. By this time my wife had joined the conversation and was aware of this object also. The more west I drove it seemed the bright object appeared larger and brighter. I must have driven another 20 minutes  asking myself what on earth this object could be and re-affering with my family I was actually seeing what I was seeing. They  where  just  as in wonder as I was. When we got to the same place that the bright circular object was we could see it to the left of our truck. It wasn’t one but 2 disks hovering in the sky about ¼ mile from our truck. They were slanted at a 45 degree angle facing eachother. Then out of knowhere a third one appeared. At this moment one of the 2 had moved in a blink of the eye to the lower position while the third object was considerably further away compared to the other two. We couldent believe what we were seeing . After 2 minutes they just dissapeared. I should of stopped my truck and took pictures but I was pulling a trailer and didn’t want to stop on the highway with my kids in the truck. I went through every single option of what it could have been in my mind. I tried to make sense of it with logical reasoning but all I can say is what we saw was definatly not of this world. I spent 5 years in the Marines as a harrier mechanic and have seen every kind of military aircraft you can see come through our base. The base I worked at is the largest air base on the east coast. You name it I have seen it.  Up close and personal. I kno! w how th ey look when they fly . I worked on the only hovering aircraft in the world. I can say with 100% confidence this was not a military or commercial aircraft(s). I hadnt said too much about this but I feel  maybe this can help if even a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then immediately pointed out that  there was one &#34; ODD &#34; smoke coloured trail that ended abruptly which looked like something got shot out of the sky.  As we approached Highway 10 or so we saw a blue white strobe lighted line going from south to north...however, nothing was visual except the lights.  I immediately suggested that this is a remote drone of some sort.   it hovered in the northwest over the Halton hills for about 5 minutes.   As we approached Erin Mills parkway we encountered a very bright flash in the vicinity of the delta Hotel, many other motorists saw this flash....which was only about 500 feet up.  cars breaked to get the visual, which lasted about 4 seconds. It was way too low for a meteoroid, meteorite.  As we passed highway 25 things got very interesting....I noticed a very unusual light signature in the sky which wasn&#39;t a plane....it was a looong streak of bright spot light.  I told my wife immediately that this wasn&#39;t &#34; A PLANE &#34;....well it WASN&#39;T.....we pulled over on highway 401 near cambellville...and watched the spectacle while others obliviously drove on by !   IT WAS A LARGE AIRLINER BEING FOLLOWED BY A SMALLER aircraft flying at subsonic speed.  never have I seen this formation before, both planes were separated by approx. 1,000 feet or so.  In a clearly lit path.    My assumption was a Command plane and a fighter escort, but no supersonic jet boom.   I am assuming my observations were correct...a military , spy or drone exercise was carried out over southern ontario at dusk on march 11, 2007.  the telltale signs were the odd vapour trails which were clearly visilble when we were over toronto.   The drone observation and bright flash took place over  Mississauga, with the last of the! vapour flash right over Erin mills parkway and the 401.  whoever else saw this please post...this wasn&#39;t a normal occurance as i am well educated with the night skies.  I was initially pointing out Venus to my wife when this all unravelled.    Our friends saw this bright flash from all the way down in detroit.  something was going on.  At 8:24 Pm, this double plane escort was headed southeast direction, under the cover of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It looked to be about as high as a jumbo jet airliner would fly but much larger, perhaps 6 jumbo jets put together in size.  The light was more of a light fluorescent green.  I have witnessed many shooting stars and this was unlike anything I have ever seen.

It was this awesome Shamrock green color and it seemed to have sparklies all around it, it was also very bright. The entire thing was green and different hues of green. It also seemed to have a tail to it too. It was great!<n>

I was on the east side of the complex, and instantly notice two bright white/red lights due east of my position.  The lights were low in the sky, maybe 5-10 degrees above the “horizon”.  Positioned horizontally level with each other, the lights were separated by about the distance between my hands when my arms were extended straight out from my body.  They lights themselves appeared much larger than any other stars or lights in the sky.  My guess, due to the size of the lights, would be within 1/2 mile of my position.  Neither light appeared to be in motion of any direction, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from either light source.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes, a third light exactly similar to the other two appeared due south of the original pair, maybe a mile or two away.  From my perspective, it too was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that caught my attention most was the brightness and the clarity of the lights.  The light was not being “beamed” down or away from the source, nor was it “blinding” in any fashion.  It is best described as “clear and pure” white light, very warm without any pulsation visible.  All three sources emitted the same intensity of white light, which created a “4-point” star effect with two points up/down, and two points each left/right of the source.  What appeared to be emitting from behind each white light source was an equally bright and intense red light, whose points appeared to be along the axis of NW/NE/SW/SE when compared to the white points of light.  I describe the red lights as behind the white lights only from the stand point that the red light spheres appeared to be slightly larger than the white light, and the points of red only shown in between the points of white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three lights were much larger than any visible stars.  Also they were larger to any “aircraft” lights as they would normally be viewed.  All three lights remained constantly stationary.  Suddenly the light that appeared after the first two, emitted only a visible red light for about 2 seconds then was “gone” or out of sight.  No noticeable movement or sound was detected.  Then the southern lights of the two original lights appeared to dissipate in the same way: Only the red light visible for a brief moment, then instantly gone.  I viewed the remaining light for another 30 seconds or so, then had to return inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am not good at estimating distances, however it was a very clear and hot day and the object seemed to be higher up than even the 747&#39;s that where landing and taking off from LAX. I watched the object dart around once in a while and go left to right faster than the planes flying into the airport. As the object was at a rest and hovering still another object came from what seemed like nowhere and started circling the other. The two objects were the same size and began to fly what looked like over the two planes only the objects were a lot higher up. This lasted a while and one object would disappear and come back. At this time I called my boyfriend out and after a few minutes of trying to show him where to look he finally saw the object. I told him to keep watching because I just knew the other object would come back out again and start doing what looked like playing with the other object. And it did! It came up right next to the first object and then dropped way down and they both stayed at a hover for a few minutes. My boyfriend had never seen anything like this before that he couldn&#39;t explain, and this has been the 5th sighting for me. It felt good to have him see these things because you start to wonder if you are imagining it after a while. He tracked one and I would track the other as they would appear and disappear until minutes later we lost sight on them both. What a feeling came over me! I felt so calm and relaxed yet really excited to be able to see those objects for such a long period of time!<n>

I thought you might be interested in seeing this. Any idea what this could be?  http://s109.photobucket.com/albums/n57/jagman619/?action=view&amp;current=SS1.flv  As stated by the witness, &#34;I live in Los Angeles. This happened at about 11:00AM give or take a few minutes... Today Sunday, March 11, 2007  I was looking out my apartment window and I saw at first what looked to be a stationary object... I quickly grabbed my camera...As I zoomed up on it I realized it was moving slowly. Then it seems to speed up a bit. When It started changing shapes I was amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light or reflection also seems very strange to me. Also I noticed somewhat of a reflective or metallic surface of the object. Very strange stuff. Not my first UFO sighting. Certainly one of the strangest things I&#39;ve seen in a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen similar videos of worm like objects like this but not of this color and not with the strange light.&#34;<n>

Imagine a picture of clear night sky in Photoshop.  Take a small rectangular section and move it across the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I had the impression it was an aircraft without the usual lights a plane has when flying at night.  The only lights on this object, or these objects, since I could only see one after I turned and lost sight momentarily halfway through the sighting, resembled a faint group of stars, similar to the Pleiades, but fainter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was obvious this was no ordinary aircraft I removed my headphones to listen and I heard nothing.  I followed it for a total of about 30 or 40 seconds before I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is how something would look if you wanted to camouflage an object to move through the night sky without being noticed.  I suspect some sort of military aircraft, but the lack of sound baffles me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anything with a normal propulsion system would have to be very high to be silent and if so, based on the area of the object(s) and the angular speed, it would have to be incredibly large and fast.<n>

It was an extremely clear evening and I immediately noticed a very bright object that resembled a star but much brighter than any other star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the rear of my yard to get an unobstructed view as there were 4 large pines in the way. I stood at the fence lining the yard and just stared at it.  It was so bright that when I closed my eyes there was a sun-spot in my vision(like when you stare at the sun). It was rather difficult to focus on for too long and I started to think this may not be a star or planet.  I went into the house and asked my wife to come and look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She agreed that it was weird and that it was extremely bright and both of us had a hard time telling if it was moving.  I went inside to my computer and searched for any planets which may be in view that night and the only thing that I found was Mercury (I think) but that was only going to be visible by telescope and only in the SouthWest and Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and it was still there but seemed to have moved away towards the NW. I marked it in the sky using some ground landmarks. After standing and watching for about 10 minutes more I decided to go in. I checked a couple more times and it seemed to move farther and farther away each time but clearly still very brilliant. There was never any sound, no blinking lights, and did not appear the next evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was looking for satellites. After about 20 minutes of walking (we left at 8 PM) walking in a westerly direction I spotted a triangular shaped object in the South and it traveled in a Northerly direction. The sky was perfectly clear but the object looked as though it was in a haze or even blurred like the atmosphere does to star’s. It was traveling with purpose and flew straight and true with no deviations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was almost as if it was not afraid to be seen, or it thought it could not be seen!

It was about 4:40pm so it was still light out and I was in the passenger seat. I said look what is that! We both saw it; I watched it the whole time while my girlfriend was driving. It looked like it turned from going west to south it looked very bright and saucer like. I looked like it turned vertical or changed shape and disappeared. I don’t know if this is related or what it was but last night same day I got off work late about 12pm I had been working all day. When I got home we played a few games then wound down to eat a late snack and we both heard a knocking on our living room window freaked us out I went out side with a tire iron and flash light and looked around the house nothing.  The yard light was flashing off and on which I’ve never seen it do (Its one of those motion sensors with two flood lights). It felt like a strong presence was there I got a bad headache and felt very uneasy like something was going to happen, What happened last night was even stranger and way scarier than the saucer like light we saw. I hope you don’t think were crazy, I would take a lie detector test on this if I had to.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my best friend Steve were sitting in his car waiting to go on|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55953.html|239|ndxe200703| It was the night of March 10th 2007 at around 2:10 in the morning. Me and my best friend Steve were sitting in his car waiting to go on a school-organized trip to Quebec. The bus left at 5:00 am so Steve and I decided to stay up and wait to drive to the bus and sleep the whole drive up. We decided to wait on a new road that connected two different subdivisions (Voyager Run and Kingswood). The road was off of a lake and had no streetlights because it was just built. We parked the car near the only source of light, which I believe was a little watershed or hut with one light bulb at the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting in the car my friend pointed out a bright white light in what we assumed was a far distance in comparison the trees on the lake. At first my friend thought it was a planet because of the random blinking of the light. After looking at this light for 5 minutes the passenger window become streaky and slightly fogged. After the streaks were formed we both realized this light was moving by keeping our heads completely still and by comparing the close streaks on the window to the light in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we made this realization after about 10 minutes of the movement of the light we noticed a drastic increase in the speed it was moving and could notice that it wasn’t moving sideways anymore but towards us and was getting bigger. After watching this light move closer for 2 minutes, 3 more lights other than the original white flashing light were becoming visible. The other lights were, a very light blue on the left side, a bright red on the opposite side, and an even brighter white/yellow light on the top which would make it a triangle if it weren’t for the other original flashing white light which was flashing slower and in different places making the shape unrecognizable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the shape was still to far to recognize a flying pattern which was the last thing leaving my friend and I to believe it still might be an airplane or something explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After only another minute or so trying to interpret what this was the distance this thing seemed to travel in a short period of time seemed unbelievable. Once the object seemed to be close enough to be able to hear an engine I rolled my window down. As soon as my window went down I can’t explain the feeling I got instantly; it was a feeling of panic. My friend panicked as well because the object was hovering with a very slight humming sound over the lake infront of us. As the object was getting close it moved in a very slight up and down movement but continued to move in a forward direction. The object wasn’t very high in the sky, maybe about a 10-story building. The way it moved made it hard to tell a shape. I only got about a 5 - 10 second detailed look at it. I am positive that I saw a curve to the shape on one side. The curve seemed to progressively light up with three different colors one at a time then fade them backwards in the same manor. It was identical to the way the equalizers show the bass hits in a song but only horizontal and on one side of the object. The colors that lit up along the side were red, green, and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend instantly started the car in fear when the object was flying in a direction that would pass behind the car. As my friend started the car and put the car in gear the object had just passed behind the car and it instantly changed directions towards the car. The feeling of fear and curiosity that this thing had spotted us was a feeling I could not describe. My heart was beating incredibly fast; I have never felt anything like this. At first the feeling was fear and the feeling of a much greater power or energy in the sky that was capable of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my friend and I drove out towards the other end of the road that connected the two subdivisions the object would appear out my window one second and then my friends window as we went around every slight turn. Eventually when we reached the main road the object was no longer in sight anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw was something of the unexplainable because of the feeling I got. I described the whole 20-minute encounter as best as I could with as much detail. If anyone has a similar story around the same area or different PLEASEEE let me know. I will never forget this experience that I witnessed just the other week. I am only 18, but my friend and I know that whatever we saw was not explainable. I decided to keep the story to myself the whole time in Quebec because when I tell it its impossible to share the feeling of the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact me at ((e-address deleted)) with any similar or explainable info.<n>

Lasted about 40min.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55838.html|240|ndxe200703| A triangle with bright white lights at each point and red flickering light in the middle. Lasted about 40min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my window about 1:00am or so to the west of the city and saw an unusual white light with a red flickering light that was really low, to low to be a star. I thought it was a plane or helicopter, except it wasen&#39;t moving toward me or away from me. It did looked like it was slightly moving side to side a little but still staying in the same place. I thought maybe it was a meteror falling and waited for it to burn out as it came closer to the atmosphere. About 20 to 30 minutes went by and it still was not moving. I then went and got my binoculars to get a better look. As I focused on the light it was pretty wild, it was a triangle with a bright white light at each point and red was flickering in the middle. I watched this for about 10 minutes and still never moved. I went to put the binoculars up and as I came back it was gone. I was only gone for about 45 to 50 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is funny, I just went out to measure the time that I was gone and I looked out the window just now and there it is again. This time it&#39;s further away. I got my binoculars and could see it very clearly but it&#39;s now further away. I assume this is a star. It has white lights and the red light flickering in the middle. It&#39;s almost in the same spot as the other night. Just north of this light is another but to far to really tell. I hope I&#39;m not crazy and sorry to waste your time if it is just a star. I&#39;m not sure if I really believe in UFO&#39;s anyway, but it was and is pretty interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck,<n>

The lead circle was slightly ahead of the two behind that were next to each other, which were followed by three in a row forming a triangle shaped group. The circles were dark in the middle with a greenish halo around the perimeter that defined them as round.  There seemed to be a slight occilation, or jiggling effect of the light circle.  It wasn&#39;t very bright, there was no audible indication, no red flashing lights, no trail.The sky was clear except for a few puffy clouds. There was no wind, and it was probably around 80 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed by myself, male aged 51, and by my 12 year old son.  We were at an outdoor concert (America) surrounded by approximately 5000 people. They were all looking at the stage,we were laying back looking at the sky.  We were tired having been at the Bonniville Salt Flats at the motorcycle speed trials from 5 am to 4 pm earlier in the day.  I have seen a few other unexplained things in the sky over the course of my life.  Nothing, however, as impressive in such a short period of time as this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m glad I pointed up as soon as I saw it, and that my son saw it too.  If it had been moving slower, I would have thrown a fit and had 5000 witnesses.  As it was, it was moving so fast I didn&#39;t even have time to tap my wife on the shoulder to show her.  Overall it was a very short,very memorable experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  We assume the date of the sighting was March 09, 2007, and not September 03, but we cannot be certain.  We do not know when &#34;America&#34; played in Utah.  PD))<n>

I watched a large orange-red oval shaped object traveling very slowly from west to east.  It was bright and very noticeable.  It did not have any strobe lights did not blink at all and had no noise.  After watching it for approximately 10 minutes, it went straight up into the sky and disappeared.  I contacted the local sheriff&#39;s department, and spoke with a deputy.  He said he would step outside and look, however he stated we do not make reports to the FAA or anywhere else.  I then contacted the Ontario International Airport which is within 20 minutes of my home, east of my home town.  After seeing this object I noticed a jet taking off from Ontario, as some jets travel over my City on there way to the Burbank Airport or elsewhere.  I spoke with a gentleman, an air traffic controller in the Ontario Tower.  He said the pilot had not reported anything to him, however the pilot may have reported it down the line. I have two pilots in my family, I have flown in both small planes and jets.  This is not something I could identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I&#39;m always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was &#34;Damn that thing has lots of lights&#34; but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn&#39;t see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said &#34;What IS that thing?&#34; I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time it had flown further to our left. I said &#34;screw the reservation!&#34; and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen. We were both very baffled, because it should&#39;ve been visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying in a northwest direction as it flew past my house in Holland, New York.  It appeared to have a circular shape as the main lights, 4 of them, were in a circular pattern.   These were visible in dark night sky.  The lights had different colors and I think there was 1 curved line of light going between 2 of the main lights.   As I recall I think the main lights were blinking.  It’s not likely to have been a plane  as it was quite low in the sky and at 1 point it was not visible as it passed behind my tall Norway Spruce trees.  I don’t know too much about satellites but I think they would be higher in sky too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/9/07 18:45|Mattoon|IL|Light|5-10 minutes|Three extremely bright, blinking, white-orange lights sighted East of I-57 near Mattoon.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59483.html|247|ndxe200703| Three extremely bright, blinking, white-orange lights sighted East of I-57 near Mattoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred while traveling in a car southbound on I-57 some ten or fifteen miles north of Mattoon.  My speed was maintained at or near 75 mph throughout the incident.  Skies were clear.  Over the span of about five minutes, I gradually became aware of an unusually-bright whitish light visible intermittently through the trees at about my 9 o’clock position.  It must have been blinking in and out, since the roadside woods do not obscure the eastern horizon continuously along this stretch of road.  Eventually, this phenomenon began to strike me as something extraordinary, and I focused my full attention on it.  Soon I came into a long stretch of road where the horizon was clearly visible.  The light had nearly the hue of a sodium lamp, but was much brighter—more so than Venus, and comparable in magnitude to that of the incandescent landing light of a large aircraft viewed from a mile away, but having a much different quality.  It blinked intermittently, sometimes flashing with a period from 1-5 seconds, sometimes remaining visible for 20 or more seconds at a time.  The appearances and reappearances did not occur instantaneously; rather, the brightness grew continuously over a short period of time, say one third of a second.  Shortly after coming into the clear area, this light was joined by two more showing identical behavior with regard to blinking in and out of view, etc.  Each light was associated definitely with a certain area of space—that is to say, after disappearing, a new light would appear very near to the original location, so that the impression given was of three separate objects translating through space and periodically flashing in and out of visibility.  During this entire incident, the lights (when there were three) showed what would be interpreted, had they been connected, as a slow counter-clockwise rotation, the motion of each light relative to the stars not exceeding about 3-5 degrees per second.  This seems to indicate that they were either near and transla! ting wit h my vehicle at about the same speed (which seems unlikely, as they were extremely bright, but did not at all illuminate the fields and tree lines past which I was driving) or that they were far away and moving at some unknown speed.  The formation of lights occupied about a thirty degree sweep of sky, extending from 20 to 50 degrees above the horizon.  After about two to three minutes with three lights visible, all abruptly blinked out of existence and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had been pointing them out to my mother throughout the day.  My mother was with me, visiting from out of town.  I noticed a white sphere next to a chemtrail and became very excited because I am involved in the UFO phenomenon and I hadn’t had a sighting in a while, much less with so many potential witnesses, especially Mom.  So I announced to the teachers and parents on the schoolyard that I was seeing a UFO and they all saw it as well.  There was one other parent, a male, who later told me he had had a major sighting in Oregon before.  Two other teachers saw it and another parent.  I don’t remember if my mom could see it.  She doesn’t have great vision.  It was five minutes after noon.  The UFO was very high, about 75 degrees in the sky.  I was looking north and the object was just west of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  It was initially between two chemtrails, but then got lost in the one on the left.  It reappeared again.  Eventually it was clearly seen again below the chemtrail.  I now wonder if the object was stationary and the chemtrail was drifting.  I wish I had sited the object relative to a non-moving object like a telephone pole.  I took a picture of  it with my mom’s disposable camera, but I haven’t developed the picture yet and I doubt it will show up as it was very small and high up.  The two parents and I moved out into the parking lot and continued to observe the object for another five minutes, perhaps.  I used my cell phone to call George Parks of MUFON (I’m a member) to tell him about it.  He didn’t see it as I had trouble telling him where to look relative to his location.  After I hung up with him the parents and I drove off in our separate cars.  The whole event lasted maybe under ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/9/07 09:54|Margate|FL|Circle|5 minutes|Margate Fl. - Large Circle in clouds with light on bottom side - pulling a cloud (twisting) into it|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55658.html|251|ndxe200703| Margate Fl. - Large Circle in clouds with light on bottom side - pulling a cloud (twisting) into it<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 9, 2007 at 09:52 hrs.- 09:54 am in Broward County Florida, in the town of Margate (zip code 33063) I witnessed the following shape/object in the clouds looking southeast from my location, while I was in the back yard of a customer&#39;s home. The object was a large circular shape that first appeared as a hole in the clouds with a stream of lower clouds being pulled up into it, in a twisting motion. This twisting motion is what first caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the object for about 30 seconds thinking that it was just a strange cloud formation in a perfect circle. I have seen ice crystal circles in clouds that form around the sun during the cold winter months in northern states. However this is South Florida and it was in the 70&#39;s. At that point I decided to take a picture of it with my camera phone. The sun was shining brightly in my eyes just to the left of the object so it was difficult to see how the camera was positioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking the first picture I noticed that the shape/object was quickly being covered by clouds. I took a second picture less than 1 minute later to try and capture what I was seeing. After taking the second picture I walked around to the front of the house and took the third and final picture from that location due to a wider view from which to take the picture. By this point the object was gone and the clouds were returning to a normal drifting motion 	While I was standing in the front yard the customer approached me to mention something pertaining to the work I was doing and I asked her if she had noticed the shape/object in the sky. She looked up and saw what was left of the circular formation in the clouds and asked &amp;#8220;what do you think that is&amp;#8221;. I said &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8221;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the pictures later on that day I realized that the first picture actually captured much more than I could see with my eyes since the sun was to the left of the object making it difficult to stare at it for very long. There is a light beam from the sun that is deflecting off of the top of the object as well as what looks like a small light on the bottom right side of the object. Also the twisting motion of the lower cloud being pulled up into, or following the circular shape is clearly visible in all 3 pictures. Even after the object was gone, the twisted cloud slowly drifted away as though it had simply been sucked momentarily but was not affected in any other fashion. I would liken the motion to dust following a car on a dirt road, which pulls up into a twisting motion off of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending all three pictures as evidence to what I saw. They may not be copied, reproduced, exchanged, or sold in any form or fashion without my permission.<n>

Central Scotland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My teenage daughter woke up the other night (3 am) to extremely bright lights in her window. She sat up in bed and watched them for about 15 minutes as she said she knew it wasn&#39;t anything she&#39;d seen before (not lightening, headlights, etc.) She then woke up my other daughter and they watched the lights together. At 3:30 am they woke me up to see the lights. Both were visibly scared. The light was very bright, white and sometimes had a green tint. It came in flashed occuring every 3 to 4 minutes or so. We live in the country but do have a few houses near us. I wanted to call our neighbours to see if they could see the lights too but as it was 3:30 am I didn&#39;t feel I should. Now I wish I had. We saw no object and heard no noise, just this extreme bright light that completely blocked out the windows, lasted all of 1 or 2 seconds each time and went away (a flash). Again, I have seen numerous lightening storms in my life and have never come across anything like this. I am so curious as to what could have caused this. If I hadn&#39;t been so tired and if we didn&#39;t have to get up for work and school the next morning I would have stayed up as late as possible to investigate more. The only explanation we could come up with are the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis. However, everyone I have spoken to have said they don&#39;t usually flash in this way and come &#34;into&#34; or up to windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides e-address only.

I was inside but I don&#39;t remember anything obout it, later I remember I got off from the ship and the dream was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday the dream was like I was on the same place, Puerto Rico, but I was inside my car looking for something when I heard a sound, so deep that was calling my attention, then I got off from my car and saw this huge triangle flying object above my car but at a distance of 20 to 30 feet high, the object was like stainless steel and the top ovoid, the points were inward and the sound was strange, like when sombody is in traffic touching a horn but with deeper sound.  I don&#39;t know why I am having this dreams.  But my experience started after I met some wako guy that was always talking about ufos.  This guy did something strange to me and this was not a dream, this was something I lived and I don&#39;t have any single explanation to what he did.  The story goes like this, I met this guy and he was my customer, one time we get together for dinner, he lit a cigarett and he asked me to put my hands in fists in front of him and I did, he puts the ashes on the top of my right hand and cover both hands with his, he then asked me to open my fists and the ashes had formed rings one inside the other on the palm of my left hand and those rings were in different shades like if the differents shades had aggrupated in the same circle, they were like three circles of different shades and forms.  I don&#39;t know anything about this but this guy told me not to speak with anyone of what he did, I don&#39;t recall that this guy has ever talked about Jesus or God.

Since that time I have viewed other reports on your logs, to look for sightings within my area of Southern California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same description of the craft I saw in March, has also been reported over Rancho Cucamonga,CA on April 7, and May 19, and again in June according to your log.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also one month after my reporting, the same description of the craft over a Riverside County City in California.  Do you look at your logs from month to month to compare data?  Just wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> San Dimas is only 15 minutes west of Rancho Cucamonga, CA and 30 minutes west of Riverside.  Another sighting of same description on your log for Covina, CA, on 5/10 which is 10 minutes west of my home.  In all reports the craft was orange, no blinking lights, no sound, and traveled slowly then just disappeard.  The gentleman&#39;s report from Rancho Cucamonga in June, describes the very same, and near the Ontario International Airport. I reported my sighting to the Air Traffic Controller at Ontario when I reported my sighting which was on 3/9/07 on that same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that you are based in the Northwest, and probably not aware that these sightings are in a close proximity in miles. Is there anyway of knowing if this is some kind of AirForce craft or other government craft that has now made at least three to four appearances in this general area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman from Rancho Cucamonga has reported seeing it twice on two separate occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can the UFO Reporting Center look into this?  I would appreciate it if you could give me some further information if you have it.  Thanks<n>

The air felt electric and when I reached for my cell phone it shocked me!  The object first appeared in a circular form and hovered for several moments. We pulled over to get a better view, but it left almost as if our headlights had startled it.  As the object left it appeared to change from a circular to a long comet-like form shooting up and away into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was around 11:00 PM. I repositioned my body to face the window. I was having trouble sleeping so I got out of bed to close the window because the coyotes were outside howling. As I closed the window I looked outside and saw a solid red orb shaped object coming from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very fast. I am pretty sure that the object I saw was the one that was seen in Port Orchard, Washington. It came from the west and kept going east. It was not blinking or leaving a trail. It made no sound that I heard. It was much lower in elevation than the picture that was taken in port orchard. It stayed in my sight for about 5-8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Why I didn&#39;t take a picture I don&#39;t know (with my cell phone) my digital camera battery had died earlier that night. I thought it could have been a rocket launch, but I hadn&#39;t heard anything on the news about a launch and I checked the NASA site for scheduled launches and nothing was reported.

I noticed an intensely bright object about 45 degrees high that was so luminous it actually threw six light spikes from it. Their was a plane moving underneath opposite direction. Navigation lights noted. I watched this incredibly bright object for about 5 minutes and it was absolutely still. I finally blew it off as Venus or some star. But when I went to look again ten minutes later it was gone, poof. Not sure of what I saw but it was incredibly bright. From visual comparison to plane I would estimate object was nearly orbital and about the size of a pea at arms length. Just a sidenote. That afternoon the skies were absolutely covered in jet trails and military aircraft were seen in area. The trails were even on local tv news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My search rapidly digressed and I found myself reading UFO reports for Indiana filed over the last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found the reports for Kokomo, March 2006 most interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As some of them describe what I&#39;ve seen near there previously this time of year, but with a few more twists.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Funny thing is....if I hadn&#39;t seen what I&#39;ve seen for the past two years and this sighting tonight I&#39;d probably remark.&#39;What a bunch of Looney Toons.&#39;  Based on the past. I expect the Plymouth,IN to Grissom AFB sightings to occur now through April when we have...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear Air with Visibility Unlimited and little to no moon illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flight appears to be less than 2000 AGL and within 5 miles of US 31 out to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of my own sightings have occured between Argos and Mexico after sunset and prior to 22:00 local.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO reference in this case does not imply craft from another world, dimension or whatever. More likely our own military on night training maneuvers in the MOA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do I think these are Top Secret craft capable of flight previously not realized? Hmm......It&#39;s highly unlikely they would adhere to a schedule so predictable over a populated area such as this. I am a 30+ year licensed pilot, so I have some familarity with aircraft....... I have witnessed some pretty remarkable moving light arrays out there that I find myself wondering what the hell I just saw. Know what I mean?  The thing is many have seen exactly what I have seen, it&#39;s been briefly covered in the local media. It occurs with regularity, so why does not somebody associated with this occurance come forth and set the public mind of these communities at ease?<n>

It was somewhat oblong; white with a warm yellow center and it all glowed/ somewhat the shape of a full moon but oblong.  I first saw this 3/8/07 between 8:30-9:00. At that time there were two red objects, they were observed closer to the ground and higher moving in erratic patterns/ almost like searching through the fields. I tried to take a picture. It hung there after I noticed it for about 20 minutes. On going out to try to observe the red lights vanished and I saw a twinkling object moving rapidly across the stars in again erratic patterns. It looked like a star with red and green lights. I observed another   object similar, closer to the ground and the white object was gone.  I have since observed this only further away appearing as a huge bright light, somewhat Y shaped. I have since observed this happening multiple times to current date 3/13/07.  My husband also observed the larger light.  It seems to have become a nightly occurrence. When the light is in the sky for some time my Rottwielers outside start howling and the house Rott growls<n>

It is an embarrassment to file one this evening, but I feel an obligation to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arriving at the H.S. parking lot around 19:15 I rolled down the windows and opened the sunroof.  Many stars in the sky, just like last night.   Two small planes flew by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 19:45 I saw and heard two jets fly over the H.S., I was amused. The jets flew over the H.S. this evening around the same time the lights were seen last night.  The jets came from the north and flew towards the south.  I could see two red lights overhead.  I felt good, was ready to home, enough of this stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the jet noise dissipated, I saw a light.  Didn’t believe it would ever happen again.  They were further away, just above the treetops.  Two of the lights were southeast and one was southwest of the H.S.  The lights went on and immediately off.   Two to three seconds duration each time.    They had a yellowish tint, the same as last night.   This went on for several minutes.  Each light went on twice that I noticed.    No trailing lights of any kind.  The lights were bright, almost firework like in color temperature.    Each light illuminated in the same way, they seemed identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was weird!  Maybe military exercises were being performed.   I hope this is the case.  The jets &#34;play&#34; in the airspace around Salem quite often, but the lights were much lower than the jets. There is probably a simple explanation.  I wished that someone could provide me with one.<n>

Always listening and looking for aircraft, of the military kind. Living 65 miles East of Whiteman Air force base, I am fortunate to see a lot of aircraft day and night. On this particular night, it was clear with no wind, and warm enough to be out with a light jacket. I was standing on the upstairs porch when I noticed two stealth bombers flying slowly to my South heading East toward Whiteman. I glanced around and noticed what I thought to be a satellite making it’s way across the night sky. That is when I realized it was heading directly toward me. It appeared to be a car with it’s head lights on bright, heading North to South as it approached I could tell it was some sort of aircraft. While it was directly over me I noticed three greenish white lights in the shape of a triangle underneath the craft, rather close in formation, not at each wing. There were no other lights on the craft to help identify its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it pasted over me I could no longer see it, however there was a noise, like when the stealth is in silent mode and you hear the air moving across the wings, however unlike stealth, there was no initial rumble as it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as this craft made it’s way on, I could feel a vibration, almost as if it were in my chest, not an external vibration. I looked up to see to aircraft one apparently winging for the other. They appeared to be large, larger than stealth the only light visible on these two craft very two small bluish lights on the underneath. These two craft were heading East to West. Not more than two seconds behind them were two stealth’s’ (I feel I pretty good at identifying them with their two stationary lights on the back to wings.)  The two craft I could not identify seemed to vanish as I watched the stealth’s tail them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this sighting I noticed four aircraft to my North that appeared to be dog fighting and two more Stealth’s heading in a Southeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing about these craft made me uneasy, no more than people felt when the Stealth was first made public. But I just wonder has anyone else seen the ‘flying cars’ as I like to call them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As it flew over it had a traingular wing shape with soft, round edges and a hump in the front, greyish blue in color, no lights and completely silent.

It was about the height on my sixth floor of my office building.  This was the second sighting of this same object that I saw in January 2007.  Once again, it was oval/disk shaped highly polished silver on one half and highly polished cherry red color on the other half.  It again, tumbled occassionaly and I was able to see the bright reflection of the 2 halves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man who works on the 7th floor was outside and I called to him to come here, hurry.  He came over to me quickly and I pointed to the object in the sky and said, what is that?  He looked and said Oh my goodness what is it?  Is it a ufo?  I said it probably is maybe a probe or some type of spying device.  It made no sound and quickly flew out of our sight.  As an aside, when I drove to work that morning, around 7:55 I saw 2 helicopters flying north following Route 355 in Rockville.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched the light for approximately 20 minutes, during which time the object did not appear to move at all. Very suddenly there was a second white light that appeared to be hovering quite close to the first. I do not believe that this was an optical illusion, given that I closed my eyes several times to find the same set of lights in the sky when I reopened them. This second light appeared brighter than the first, and it was slowly moving within close proximity of the first light. Moments later it was gone all at once, only to return again a few minutes later. At this point I began to walk toward the nearest convenience store, and when I arrived there, I was able to point the lights out to a strange man who was getting into his car.

I was planning on photographing the moon this evening.  The moon was spectacular Monday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While waiting for the moon to rise I caught a glimpse of light out of my right eye.  Initially I thought another street light had come on and didn’t give it a second thought.  However, a few seconds later a second light appeared relatively close to the first light.  The first light disappeared.  A third light appeared close to the second light. When the third light appeared the second light went off.  After the  third light went off they all came on at the same time.  Then itstarted over again.  The lights were on about 15-30 seconds each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time my adrenaline was at it’s all time high.  I became anxious and scared.  I left the parking lot to go get my husband,  by the time we got back, no more lights.  If there is ever a next time, I will stay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights came on and off very deliberately.  There was no movement that I could see.  I got outside my car to listen for noise.  There was none.  The lights were very low in the sky and seemed to be very close.  The lights appeared to be over the High School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  lights  were on the same plane, close together,  but were  not the same distance apart.  The color of the first light is what initially caught my eye.  The lights were very bright, had a yellowish tint and were uniform in shape.  The lights came on quickly and they seemed slow to turn off.  The lights were not the same color as the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fort Leonard Wood is very close to Salem.  There is fighter jet activity over Salem all the time.   I tried to rationalize the lights coming from some sort of aircraft  from Fort Leonard Wood.  This could be the case, but I don’t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never, have I seen anything like this before.  I wish my husband had seen the lights too.  He thinks I am nuts, but I am not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The color was bright golden and the shape of the object like a cigar with a protruding thinner extension, vertically protruding from the upper part of the main body.  The main body was a little longer than the extension.  The extension was pointing towards the sea, almost vertically (but not totally).  It looked like a mosquito. It remained immobile at the same spot on the horizon both times it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle to the horizon from my position was about 40 degrees.  Its size, because of the distance involved (many miles in clear skies), was three times bigger than the size of the evening star observed at the same time. I was standing at the balcony of my flat, located in the town of Messolonghi, and the object appeared towards the west; in my opinion it was hovering over the Ionian Sea and before the island of Kephalonia (Copholonia).<n> <n><n> <n><n> NB A few miles to SW direction from Messolonghi, on Peloponese, there is a military air base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Every once in a while it would move back and forth up and down very quicly but not very far.  I would say it moved about 2-4 inches in the sky each time it moved.

My friend and I witnessed a very very bright set of lights in the Northwestern sky.  They were triangular in shape.  I asked my friend what it was and neither of us could figure it out.  We were leaned forward in the car watching the light which was stationary only a couple hundred feet off of the ground.  As we got close to the light it suddenly blinked out, the sky just went black. There was no sound what so ever, and no trail left of any kind.  Suddenly a low flying plane came out of the north headed to the area where the lights were.  It circled around the area and headed back towards Whiteman Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my friend or I have ever seen anything like it.<n>

That one appeared over Dallas, Texas at about the same time and I was witness to it.  I watched it for over ten minutes while driving down a heavily congested street called Northwest Highway and no amount of gesturing could make anyone whose eye I could catch look up.  Nothing on the news of course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back to the Wilmer night sighting.  I am not sure what time she told me it was, but the reason it caught her eye, was that it looked like a black hole in the sky.  It blocked out all the stars in a huge circle.  No lights, just a black hole.  Since she was driving and couldn&#39;t watch it intently, she does not know how it dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the field below it asks me to submit to a collect call.  I don&#39;t want to do that but exchanging emails would be acceptable.  I think you can research Popular Mechanics or Mechanics Illustrated back to the late fifties or early sixties and find information on an arc welder that defied gravity.  It was for sell at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My husband and I were driving home from a meeting I had had in Phoenix,we were past the town of Gila Bend,Az I know this much when suddenly on our left side we saw lights that were in a V shape blinking like crazy we were not so much scared but more in awe, then I got panicky because I had only heard of the Phoenix lights but never actually seen them or knew what shape they were in I still don&#39;t know. This went on for quite a while the lights blinking in a manner that spacecraft from earth would, the speed was too incredibly fast. I think that maybe it was 2 objects that I saw I cannot be sure, never will be. I asked mu husband to pull over to an approaching rest stop but he wouldn&#39;t he said he just wanted to get home, I&#39;m not from Arizona originally so I don&#39;t know exactly what town follows Gila Bend. These lights went on for a while they seemed really close but I felt as if other cars were either not seeing or just plain ignoring these lights, my husband and I quickly decided we were just not going to look in that direction (of the lights)and started making excuses to one another about what they were, who they were. This is just too weird....too weird. We haven&#39;t spoken about it since not to each other, I told a dear friend and I&#39;m embarrased about it. Don&#39;t know what the heck is going on I&#39;ve travelled this highway before many times, and nothing like this has happened before. I&#39;ll probably never talk about this anymore to anyone ever,too strange the feeling even writing about it is strange, but defenitley real... I hope to never go thru this again.<n>

George Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My new wife and I were sitting on the porch at our rental beach house on St George Island Florida March 6,2007 between 9 and 9:30 PM. We were looking south over the Gulf in the sky and she thought she saw a red shooting star, although it really didn’t move and didn’t look like any shooting star we had seen before.  We both then saw several strange red lights appear horizontally in the sky, anywhere from a 10PM to 2PM radius (if you were to use a clock as a comparison). Then within a few minutes they came back and did the same thing again. A few minutes later much closer in the gulf, a single red/white light appeared and lit up the gulf like a sunrise would reflect on the water, then vanished.  The light at one point would start off as one light then seem to turn with two lights coming towards you, then disappear.  One theory we had was that there were jets from Pensacola Air Station, maybe practicing in the gulf at night with fake ammo, although I called the station and they mentioned that they usually don’t train at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Starkweather Road is a winding country road, and it was very dark, the sky was beautiful and clear with many visible stars. There were no leaves on the trees to interfere with the view of the sky, and I was driving past a clearing or small field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to Google Earth, the coordinates of my approximate position at the time were 41* 41’ 23.22” N, 71* 53’ 47.07” W, elevation 271 ft. It was three days after the total Lunar Eclipse which took place on March 3, 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking straight ahead, concentrating on the road, careful of deer that sometimes enter the road without warning. Out of the Eastern sky, a bright light caught my eye. I thought I was seeing a shooting star, but this light was perfectly round, with no aura or tail, and did not disappear in a flash as a shooting star does. It was slightly smaller than the end of a pencil eraser in the sky, but I have no idea how large it really was. It seemed much higher than a plane would fly, and did not blink or twinkle like an incandescent light. It was pure, bright white, and traveled from horizon to horizon, East to West in approximately 2 seconds. I was so surprised I slowed my car to almost a complete stop. My son is much taller than I am, and he did not see the light because the roof of the car was blocking his view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I called my boyfriend who is a mathematical engineer, currently residing in Utah to tell him about “the biggest, brightest shooting star I have ever seen”. He believes what I saw was a UFO. After discussing it in detail, I came to the conclusion that it was not a shooting star because I have seen many in my lifetime, and this had none of the same characteristics. I am sure it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 20:00 hrs. we noticed a single spherical light, just on top of a hill just west of us by about 150 yds. At first we dismissed as being something or somebody wandering around. Then we noticed the object , about the size of a car, hovering above the hilltop about 6 feet off the ground. Immediately following this observation, we noticed two more of same lights duplicating the same pattern of movement, about 10 yards from each other. We then decided to not stick around, and headed the other way, when we noticed the first light we saw coming over the hill and proceeded to follow us. this light hovered above the ground and to my left not even above or on the dirt road. This object began to gain on us, until i was going 50 mph. then it just disappeared. At which time we saw another object hovering about 200 feet off the ground and about 200 yards away. Then it immediately disappeared. No aircraft noise , gradual or sudden increase in speed, and definately not any type of aircraft we were familiar with. At this point being pretty shook up, we headed home in rather hurried fashion, when we noticed the same type of lights hovering over the crest of the sandia mountains, and disappearing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a large multi-engioned turbo proped aircraft (possibly a C-130 transport), as that is the most frequent type seen around here.  The aircraft came in from the Northeast of town, circled around the north of town to the west of town and then went to the South-South West.  I followed the aircraft until it got approximately 5 miles to the South-West, when something caught my eye, above and to the south.  There was a dim flash of light, followed by what appeared to be a disk type of craft suddenly appearing.  All the edges of the craft appeared as though they were imbedded in clouds, although the night was cloudless.  I could briefly see lines and a circle around the center of the of the bottom of the craft.  It exhibted a color of burnt orange, which I later discovered was the reflection of the lights of the city.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arms length.  It suddenly started to move, and started to fade out of sight and moved toward and followed the aircraft to the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that on the day before (Sunday) an AWACS E-3 airbourn radar aircraft orbited around this city for approx. 4 hours.  This is VERY unusual because Military aircraft don&#39;t fly around here on the weekends!  It was as if they were looking for something!!!   In the past few months, I have witnessed craft landing to the North-West up in the Mountains, usually during the week, not on the week-ends.  I will keep my eyes open, monitor my Scanners and watch the sky.  If I see something more, I will let you know asap.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a solid white light moving North East. It moved up and down in a forward motion. It was in the sky for about 5 minuets probably less.

It passed between Orions Belt and the largest star to the south.  We could not see the shape of the vessel but it had two large round lights at the front and rear and both appeared to be orange/yellow in color.  The UFO could have been any shape but appeared to be oval or egg shaped since lights were only on the front and rear as it moved. It moved VERY quickly...much faster than any plane or other object we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/5/07 18:00|Chicago|IL|Disk|4 hr 30 min|Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time span.|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55570.html|307|ndxe200703| Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time span<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Chicago, IL and I believe that I saw several UFO&#39;s yesterday. I was running late for work and I wasn’t paying much attention to the sky as I headed to an elevated train station.  But I had just missed my train as I was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.m., I knew I was definitely going to be late, because I had to be at work at 6, so I decided to relax since I was going to be late anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there’s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky.  I listened to my MP3 player for a few minutes and for some reason I decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I did I noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky.  The lights didn’t blink.  So at first I thought it was a plane, because I wasn’t expecting to see something different than that.  I soon realized that it definitely wasn’t a plane because it was dark outside.  Although planes have lights that are visible at night their frames aren&#39;t.  Planes also always move while they’re mid-air, and they’ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction they are heading.  This object seemed to be a ball that was illuminated all over, it didn’t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time I looked at it.  Then as I looked further past it, eastward, I saw two other objects that were identical to the first one.  They all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where I was standing.  These objects didn&#39;t move either.  I know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where I was standing they only seemed about 50 - 75 ft. apart from one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, I’d say more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so.  I didn’t hear any noise as this happened.  The other objects stayed in position and didn’t move.  About 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform; this was at 6:02 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat down and looked out of the window, and kept my eyes eastward on the sky for the length of my trip.  As soon as we’d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, I noticed that there hadn’t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off.  There had actually been 3. I saw that even though this one was the furthest away from me, it was brightly lit and looked identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My train headed north to the downtown section of Chicago, and even as I covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which I saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. I know that they weren’t moving, because as I was riding on the train and looking out at the objects, they started to appear as if they were moving with me, in the same direction I was traveling, which is how the moon, or water towers of local suburbs, used to appear to me when I was younger riding in a car. Obviously a water tower is a fixed object, and it looked like it moved with me, so I know the same has to be true of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because I arrived at work at 6:17 p.m. as I said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. I didn’t see the objects again, but I did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train I was on. I only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. It could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and I think there’s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown Chicago, so I don’t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. This is the only object whose shape I can’t really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but I didn’t get to really look at it. I just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark, probably brown. I felt that it looked odd because it didn’t look like a plane, yet it was flying. It was also bulky and heavy, looking, but quickly disappeared from my view. I definitely know that it didn’t resemble a plane at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually went to work for four hours but I really hoped, that the objects I’d seen by my house would still be there when I got off, so that I could show someone in my family what I’d seen. I didn’t remember to look at the sky when I was on the platform because I was in a rush to get home, but when I was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, I walked southeast where there’s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. As I was crossing the street and heading south, I saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones I’d seen earlier. Only this time it was way closer to the ground than the ones I&#39;d noticed earlier. I made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. So the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. I decided to back up a few feet and I walked in the street instead of the sidewalk in order to get a good look at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did, and basically I saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn’t a flat thin disc, it had layers. The top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, I think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that’s probably why I didn’t see them earlier. But the center layer was bright, bright white. The whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. So they just looked like panels of lights. I do not know if I’d imagined it from the influence of TV and movies, but I do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part in because I was so excited. As I kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. About 20 seconds later, I’d moved past the parking lot’s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entrance isn’t enclosed by a roof, so there’s a very clear view of the sky but I still didn’t see the object. It was gone. I continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. About another 20-30 seconds later I continued my way south and crossed the street opposite this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and I still saw no objects, I headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight. But I kept my eyes on the sky for most of my walk and I did start to notice the stars, usually I don’t. They were visible, but since it’s Chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren’t blindingly white. So when I saw another object later on, I was totally sure it wasn’t a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. About ten minutes later I turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. I noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in Chicago. It was much higher than the last one I’d just seen, and I would have taken it as a star if I hadn’t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when I was outside. This object was far away, but it wasn&#39;t as far as the stars were, and it was much brighter and bigger than the stars. It&#39;s light was white but it blinked on and off. I made out a reddish light that came from it as well. It too seemed to stand still and I think it was probably the same object that I’d seen 20 minutes before, when I was outside. But I’m not sure, I couldn’t tell its shape from so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was gazing at the sky, I then saw a really large object traveling somewhat close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached underneath it. It was large and it was loud. I ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and I believe this was a plane, but I do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, I think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. It quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so I went back to the my other window to see the blinking object. It was still there, but it looked even further away, yet it was still very bright though. So I just decided to watch some TV because I couldn’t do anything about it and then I went to bed.<n>

While making this change in shape, the color of white light changed to an orange. The oval shape became more eliptical, then it blinked out. It was not seen again. After 40 plus years in life, I have never seen anything like it. There were no sounds, such as what you would hear from an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Anyway the one object became 4 and the moved in and out of a &#34;V&#34; formation (covering about 1/4 of a mile in their wanderings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly a white Cessna was moving directly at them at what looked like exactly the same altitude.  Once the cessna was about a couple of hundred yards from them, they regrouped in a V formation, and the formation became a light red and then they all disappeared from view (almost as the Cessna was on top of them and within a few seconds of changing color).  Estimated altitude of Cessna and objects was 1500 feet.  All of this occurred within one mile directly East of the McAllen Control Tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten minutes later I continued my jogging and noticed one object had reappeared now direcltly over the airport. This lasted five minutes or so, and there was no sightings after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if the McAllen Control Tower or the Cessna pilot saw anything.  By the way I am pilot myself and could not identify the objects.<n>

As i drove south on 294 i watched this object and eventually lost sight of it.  When i got into westmont it was visible again.  The light originally appeared white and then started pulsating red and blueish lights as if the object was spinning.  This thing appeared over chicago and turned west and came close to being over my head in a matter of seconds.  It would go one direction and then immediately change direction.  It would rise from lower than the clouds up into the clouds and circled the chicago area for an hour.  I can still see it occasionally as i am typing this.  The entire object seemed to be pulsating light, not just off of wing tips as on an airplane.  Commercial aircraft were present at the time.  They would dissapear after a few minutes, this object did not.  At some points it appeared to also be stationary.  I alerted my friend to it and he saw it.  When i got home my mom and sister also saw it. None of us have ever seen anything like this before.  There was no sound coming from this thing when it was almost over my head when i was almost home.  There is 25 miles between where i work and live and this thing was visible from both places just a easily.  We all thought someone should know about this.<n>

It left no tail and seemed to emit a steady luminesence.  It descended straight down at a moderate speed and then disappeared just above the horizon.  No evidence of ground strike could be seen.  This could have been a meteor.<n>

I was driving towards a red light at a corner, and over the trees up above we saw a cone-like object moving at modernate speeds but seemed faster than a convetional airplane.  It was moving rather slow, yet super fast, almost hovering . . . as an airplane wouldn&#39;t fly like this.  There was an intense white and yellow pulsating lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cone-like object seemed super small. Like half the size of my vehicle. So I would say that it was around 6 feet across, and around, at the minimum.  The object wasn&#39;t too high up, but the trees made it hard to see until it appeared that a plane was coming into its path and it did a complete 180 degree turn to the left and then went straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned on the red light, I turned to see where it went but it was completely gone.  However, we did notice a very bright, unusal star hovering very high above.  But it was much larger than the object we had seen.  This very bright object was in path with the smaller object.  Strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was perfectly round, in the shape of a big jet; no cockpit, no wings, no engines and no noise were noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds and right above us it entered into a small cloud bank and never exited.  It was gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened so suddenly and unexpectedly, we were shocked and since there was no one else nearby; we did not ask if anyone else saw what we had seen.  We were pretty much speechless for a while.<n>

I woke up sometime around 12:00 and shook her awake because I remembered that there was supposed to be some eclipse that she wanted to see tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out on the 8th floor balcony looking for the moon (which we never found) and then she told me she thought she&#39;d found it.  I looked toward the direction she was pointing, I&#39;d say north east of where we were and saw a yellow (She said orangish red, I&#39;m color blind I guess) sort of crescent shaped figure in the sky over shoreline or possibly edmonds.  I thought it might have been the moon at first but it was upside down, kind of like a frown, then I remembered that it was an eclipse so the moon would look funny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both kept watching it for while until we noticed the change in altitude, or distance possibly.  Sadly enough neither me or my girlfriend noticed anything odd for at least 10 minutes, it moved so slow!!!  Like the second hand on a clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 minutes we both figured that it had changed directions at least 4 times until it had gotten too small to see but it never went behind anything, which meant it must have been higher up than it looked.<n>

Around 11:00 P.M., he noticed the big dipper.  But something was wrong becasue there were two (kind of overlapping each other), but one of the sets were moving at a exceptional speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The set of the seven stars in the form of the big dipper were going south by south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later the rest of my family came out and witnessed it to.   As we looked closer I also noticed that a few of them had little red light probes going around it (though very hard to see).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some may say that stars don&#39;t move becasue of clouds or something, but we measured the distance with our roofline and other stars.  Other starts weren&#39;t moving, just that &#34;big dipper.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually after 30-60 min it disappeard.  It appears that the object was mimicking stars to get around &#34;undetected.&#34;<n>

The sky was clear, we could see commercial aircraft about, there was no immediate light pollution and the moon was sharply defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22.50 I got out of the car to took a photo with my 5 megapixels digital camera.  It was shakey (I was cold and tired but didn’t want to miss the eclipse) but there was a clear red point below the moon and a little to the right.  I thought it must be a glitch, so I took several more photos (all shakey but with same red point) then I was too cold and got back in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the rest of the eclipse thru’ the (murky!) windscreen.  Because I was sure it was a camera glitch, I didn’t scan the sky for the dot - all my attention was on the eclipse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the photos on the PC, I found I couldn’t put the red point down to a problem with the camera, however I played about with the photos (using very basic Kodak software).  Other blips were obviously just blips, but this one appears spherical and holds up as that under zoom.  When I saw the Puget Sound photo, it looked to me just the same.  If it is a glitch with the camera, I apologise now - I have taken more photos of the night sky and have been unable to reproduce the red point and it wasn’t on an earlier photo taken of the moonrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband has looked at the photos and thinks I caught something real on the shots.  We’re both graduates, late forties, I’m a homemaker now and my husband a programmer with IBM for 25 years.  We also lived near to Coventry Airport for 10 years and are used to seeing aircraft of all sorts.<n>

We had an ocean front room with an unobscured view of the sky. The moon was approximately 80 degrees in the east, the big dipper approximately 40 degrees in the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed a faint orange-red light coming from the north, below the Big Dipper. It was dim, but not as dim as a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled across the sky at a steady speed, but its trajectory was erratic. It would travel a straight line for some distance, and then make strange course corrections. At one point, it completed 3 sides of a square maneuver, just before passing in front of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as we lost visual contact with the object in the southern sky, we saw a streak of light, originating from the point where we lost visual contact. The streak was at a 45 degree angle to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both in shock that we had witnessed such an event.

It began moving overhead very slowly and didn’t make any sound at all.  My friend that was sitting in the passenger seat of the car started panicking, and we sped off as soon as the light changed.  I glanced in the rear view mirror as we started down the road to see if it was still there, and it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I watched it for about 12 to 13 minutes, till it was just behind some tall thin trees. then all of a sudden it stopped for about 6 or 7 seconds then continued a little bit, paused again, then continued on a little ways, then it just disappeared. it didn&#39;t blink, it was one solid red light. I so badly wanted to dial 911 , just to find out if there were any other calls coming in about it. A few weeks later I decided to see if anybody had reported it to NUFORC. and there it was, not one or two, but five or six reports that described the same thing that I saw!

Along side the aircraft was a small white object that I can only describe as a cylinder.  It continued to move with the aircraft, and then went on its own path moving southwest.  It continued to move in that direction until it began to slow down very fast.  It was hovering in one spot for about a minute.  During this time I went to retrieve my camera, but when I came back the object was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I scanned the sky hoping to find it but to no avail.  The object during the whole account was at an altitude of about 15,000 feet. It had a long and rounded shape with a line down the center.  It was probably about 30 feet from one end to the other.<n>

This is the second time I have seen this mysterious disappearing object in the sky&#39;s night.  I also saw an identical incident on February, 19.

It was still early since I figured it would maybe happen, a sighting I mean, at about 3 am the witching hour.  Well to my surprise I was laying there playing guitar for about an hour straight, all alone laying on my back looking up at the almost full moon.  Well the moon was sort of in the west at this point but I sat up and put my guitar down and I saw three oval shaped craft with no light&#39;s flying in formation from south to north towards the old downtown airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ships looked maybe brown but really stood out, against the clear night sky about 300 or so feet above me.  They flew in such a way that it looked like one craft, and there was a jitter effect on one of the oval shaped craft like tracer but they were not moving that fast maybe 100 to 200 miles an hour.   The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 seconds enough time for me to blink a couple of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it strange because to start the night of I looked at the sky and said in my head LIVE  TO LOVE AND LOVE TO LIVE LIFE which is my sort of meditation words, and as soon as I was done playing guitar they flow over, it scared the shit out of me I called my dad and he instructed me to get off the roof so I did but remained at my roof hatch for the rest of the night with camera in hand but I was to late.  I am going to make it a point to be up there every night till I get footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good luck on your quest I am both scared a bit excited to help you with your journey, I have always believed but now my life has changed because I know.  Thank you for doing this the world needs to wake up and see what has been hidden, I was thinking about my statistic&#39;s class in collage which I went to but It was art collage, any way the chances of me catching eye of a UFO on my first night and the fact that they flow over me very low to the ground lower then a normal helicopter even it seemed, are almost impossible.  People spend there whole life looking and never see, my only conclusion is the power of the mind is a very special thing that many do not realise or they noticed that I enjoy life or, sorry, they liked my music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me, well I am in my mid twenty&#39;s and am trying to start a Animation Studio.

I am used to watching the B-2 bombers fly over Marshall on take off and final approach to their home at Whiteman AFB, 30 miles south at Knob Noster, Missouri.  This bright light did not move and come closer to the city limits.  It just hung in the western night sky. There was no sound.<n>

Looked to my NE and noticed one star kept looking and noticed 4-5 object around this star.  As I looked closer (trying to gain focus in shock) I noticed they would fade out and come back but going in a random motion.  The bigger one would stay in one stop but the other 5 would just move around it.  As no shape would take place or path.  Almost like they were refueling or hovering in that one area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walked away for about five mins thinking that I am seeing things.  Still there.  If a plane would go close by they would stop flashing lights and almost combine into one object into the bigger one.  Strange, when the plane would pass by they would all seperate and fade in and out again.  The light was a white light with a tint of green here and there.  The shape couldn’t say, I would say circle but it was too far away.<n>

To us, lights in the sky are quite common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, on this night (tonight) we were driving home from the gym and as we turned down and adjacent street from the main road on our way home I saw two objects racing *fast* on a SE to NW direction.  No biggie, right, except these things were traveling really quickly across the sky in tandem.  I stopped the vehicle and pointed the objects out to my uncle.  We continued to drive around the corner (and had to to keep it in our sights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the kicker... The object forward most was a cobalt bright blue glow. We thought is was an afterburner of a jet. But wait...following behind was another craft which had identifying FAA blinking lights. The light was red so we figured it was the starboard light that was flashing. The craft were equidistant from each other and by that I mean that the craft following or *chasing* the blue sphere didn&#39;t gain any ground nor lose any ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft flew out of sight, the blue cobalt sphere faded. We think this is because is was moving out of range of vision. The other continued to fade, too, meaning that the flashing red FAA light got dimmer and dimmer as it moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had second thoughts on the afterburner glow as the craft following was keeping pace and did not show afterburner glow as one might expect. Also, the sphere did not have any identifying FAA flashing lights. It was a constant color and did not flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is our belief that the former object was one of our (USA) jets. Neither took off from the airport as their trajectory was not that of a departing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound of any kind and felt both objects were low enough to have been heard as they passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were about a 30 to 35 degree angle from our juxtaposition to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crystal clear night and, NO, these weren&#39;t stars as stars do not fly across the sky at these speeds. There were no tree&#39;s obstructing our view and in fact we had to drive forward several times in order to avoid any objects such as houses and trees.  Basically, we were able to keep it within our sights with little trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were not tails like that of a &#34;shooting star or comet.&#34;<n>

I took the light rail to work that morning.  At 6:00 AM, I saw a black manta ray looking ship floating about 10 feet above the light rail track.  I was close enough to hit it with a rock.  It was silent and very intimidating.  I felt as though someone inside it was watching me as it flew down the tracks.  I walked to within twenty feet of it.  It flew down the tracks toward the downtown Salt Lake sky scrapers.  I watched it fly off and proceeded to walk to the station to ride the light rail to work.  I had to turn away from the ship to walk to the station and that is what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was shaped like a black manta ray.  It was steam lined in a aerodynamic and hydrodynamic way.  I got the feeling that it flew under water with as much ease as it flew in the air.  It flew effortlessly and with no sound.  I know this sounds strange but I felt as though it was alive.  I could even feel it&#39;s mood.  And I felt as though someone inside of it was watching me.  The strangest thing I have ever seen and felt in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am telling the truth and am positive I could pass a lie detector test.
