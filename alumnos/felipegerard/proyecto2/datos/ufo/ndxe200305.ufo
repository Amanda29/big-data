Driving home at night we seen a large cloud lit up. We thought it to be lightning at first but the colors in the light kept changing from white to red to blue to green, etc.. And there was one thin beam of light that shinned down towards the earth. The lights stayed constant and did not flicker on and off like lightning does. After about a minute it was goen and the whole sky turned black again. It looked like the cloud was right over our town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 5 minutes we got home and our entire block had no electricity. we ask our grandma what time it went out. She said a couple of minutes before we got home. We called the cops to see why the electric was out and they did not know. I really just want to know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I trained my 16 x 50 binoculars on the stationary object partially obstructed by billowing Cumulus clouds.  I was surprised to see that the circle was hollow and I could actually see through much of the center.  The outer circular edge had evenly proportioned sectional segments that were white in color.  I would liken the shape to a hollow style Frisbee. There were no lights, or other phenomena to report. I would estimate the diameter to be 300 to 500 feet across at an altitude of at least 30k to 40k, or perhaps even way higher than that. It would certainly dwarf the largest aircraft, such as a C5A.  It was completely stationary for the many long minutes I observed it with my wife.  There must have been others that could also plai! nly see it as there were literally thousands of people at the event, but perhaps were too intent on watching the aerobatics being performed.  Eventually, the clouds blocked my view of the object. I don’t think it could have been the rings of a planet. I don’t think planet rings could be seen by the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Air Force crewmember and veteran of C-141A’s and C-123k’s.  You may contact me should you have an interest in this sighting, although I have given all that I remember of this visual event during the brightness of a lovely summer afternoon day at the beach.  I think the object was East or Northeast of my position and offshore at The Sea Mist Hotel, which is still in existence today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were both facing the same direction chatting.  We both noticed an object flipping/moving through the grass in a random manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black and reflected absolutely no light.  It appeared at first to be boomerang or V-shaped   but after watching it approach us it was clearly two 3ft scalene triangles attached or jointed at the shortest side - as though a boomerang had been folded down the middle and was then flipping and moving on the points through the tall grass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it also appeared to be changing in dimensions as it flipped, coupled with the lack of any reflection it was difficult to comprehend. I commented to my cousin about wondering what it was, she confirmed that she was also watching and wondering.  We observed it move very close, within 40ft before it meandered back around the small hillock from which it had come.  My cousin and I were both adults,! sober, and skeptical.  I am educated with a B.A. from C.S.U.B.  I have no background in Unidentified Objects of any kind and have never experienced anything questionable to this degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have questioned my grasp on reality or vision problems if my cousin had not been witness as well.<n>

Seeing that I was clear of the ground, I then looked up towards the branch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There between my hands and my face and the branch was a small - about the size of my pinkie - cigar shaped object.  It was chrome colored but seemed to have a light smoke tint to it.  I stared at the object feeling the more I did perhaps I could see into it.  I could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I thought of reaching out to touch it - the object - it moved away from me through the leaves silently and left my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen it since.<n>

Time 4:26 am ) I had the water on the back lawn and went out to shut it off. as I was on my way back into the house I seen a bright star like light in the sky east of Magna, about 3100 to 3500 so. and 7200 to 5600 west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it caught my eye as a star or planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Light was 4 times brighter then any star in the sky. more like a airplane landing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted about 10 seconds. the light started dimming until it was gone. I raced into the house to grab the camcorder just before it went out, but I didn&#39;t get anything on tape. during the time I could see it the object did not move in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be the landing light on a distant aircraft, but that is only a guess on our part.

It was dark, clear sky. It stopped approx 300mtrs away from the circling overhead police helecopter and continued to &#34;observe&#34; it for approx 10 mins. When the helecopter vacated the area in a NE direction, the light disappeared at vast speed in a SE direction and disappeared. It not only stopped and observed helecopter, it made circular sweeps and right angled sweeps. It was impossible for it to be an aeroplane as the object was stationary when it was observing, and 2 it couldnt have been a helecopter as the right angled movements it made would not have been possible for this type of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever seen something like this , and to be honest it was a wierd experience. I genuinely hope it was &#34;something&#34; because it was facinating to watch it perform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A motor vehicle approached behind me down a well lit street and also looked up into the sky but did not stop. The car had 2 occupants in it, possible witnesses?? Dunno.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it vacated the air space, I can only describe it as &#34;bloody fast&#34; and silent.

Their were 3 of us kids (15 yrs old at the time) outside, and two adults when suddenly I noticed that there were strange blue lights that sort of looked like shooting stars in the sky.  I told the rest of the people to look up and we were all amazed. One of the adults told us that it was probably just something from Offut Air Force Base, and to just forget about it, but it was to amazing for us to quit looking at. The lights were running into eachother breaking off into many other lights and created large circular shapes in the sky. After about 10 minutes of this occuring, I over heard the adults talking to eachother saying that the lights were starting to creep them out. Me and one of my friends rushed inside because we had a weird feeling that this would be on the news or something talking about an alien invasion, so we skipped through all of the channels and were suprised to see that it was not on t.v. We rushed back out there and suddenly the lights stopped.  Everyone who was ouside decided to come inside as it was starting to get a little chilly.  Every few minutes we would look outside to see if the lights came back, and around 5 minutes after the lights disappeard, strange beam like lights flashed from the ground up to the sky every few seconds. This stopped after 2-3 minutes and that was the last of the lights that we saw.  I am VERY sure that what I saw that night was from a different planet as no aircraft that I have ever heard of runs into eachother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She seemed quite awake and I assumed she was just getting into bed late for some reason. For some reason, something made a noise outside and my wife jumped. I asked her if she had checked all the doors before coming to bed and she had not, so I double-checked everything. When I was down in the basement (walk-out) I was checking the door to our backyard when I noticed the entire back yard was lit up. My mind ran through the various options and came up blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source (which I could not directly see from my location) was somewhere on the other side of the trees but must have been very close from how bright everything was - practically daylight, with shadows being cast from ABOVE the trees. I watched for about 15 seconds, then decided to get a better angle from upstairs, which overlooks the yard and our neighbors yard as well. By the time I went up 1 story (maybe 10 seconds to go up the stairs), the backyard was completely dark again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs and asked my wife if she had seen the bright light. She said yes. We were both a bit puzzled by it, and a bit freaked out. She asked me to bring our oldest BACK to our bed (when does that ever happen?) and I opened the door next to ours with the little one. Somewhat jokingly, I told her I was going to use her computer to do a Yahoo search on &#34;Chanhassen UFOs&#34; - she said &#34;DO IT!&#34;, so here I am…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to correspond with this witness, but the e-address he provides is defective, despite the fact that he identifies himself as a software engineer.

This light increased intensity and became exceptionally bright, I thought that it was an aircraft that had turned on its landing lights, but it was curious because it was way to fast and way to high to be a commercial airliner.  After observing this light it then split into three seperate lights and disappeared, I belive I saw a small dull reddish light in the same path.  I the noticed directly behind a dull red light moving behind the first light.  The red light was moving at an exceptionally high rate of speed and appeared to fade in and out.  None of these lights had any type of stobe effect nor could I ascertain any rotating beacons or other indications that it was a conventional aircraft.  Directly after that, there was an increase in very fast moving aircraft in the same general area, I suspect them to have been military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests that date is approximate, a fact that we do not understand.

A ball of light which was traveling very fast came into view. No clouds in the sky and no moon. The light then proceeded to fade out but then would flash and reappear, doing this as it travelled. I would say that the duration of the fade out lasted about 7 seconds before it would reappear. It did this about 8 times before we lost sight of it. We then saw about 15 other lights in the next 20 minutes and none of them moved as fast or faded out or flashed. Jets were also clearly visible and the object was definitely not like anything I have seen and I watch the skies like a hawk.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My parents live a short distance from the ballpark, so we were not affected by the stadium lights.  The light show is intense, similar to a 4th of July display.  The sky was fairly clear, stars visible.  After a huge starburst of fireworks, I noticed a light emerge from the starburst.  I thought it was an errant rocket from the show.  But it moved MUCH faster and moved away from the lights emitted from the display.  And much faster than a private plane. It was moving horizontal and staying at level altitude..south to north about 60 degrees in the western sky.  The light was blinking on and off at an inconsistent rate.  When off, a small object could be seen blocking the view of the stars.  It could also been seen moving erratically.  It must have been about 500 to 1000 ft. in altitude because it was cutting through the smoke of the display.  There was no sound AT ALL.  I don&#39;t think it was a charge gone bad because there was no sound and it was not emitting a trail of any kind.  Also, such charges do not fly perfectly horizontal.  My brother-in-law also saw this.  I have an elec. engineering background and have my own business.  My brother-in-law was a technical manager for chip fab at a high tech company.  We were not drinking anything other than water and sodas that night.  We saw the light for about 4 seconds until it disappeared behind some houses...we compared notes and agree on the details of our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Before i report on tonight&#39;s sighting i will describe 2 other sightings that i witnessed last month that were similar to tonight&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first event occurred on April 7th 2003 at approximately 4:30 am (EST) I noticed an unusually bright, white glow coming from the area of the nuclear Site, as i watched for several minutes i saw what i can only describe as an extremely large disc shaped object rise quickly from the trees. This was perhaps less than a mile away from where i was at the time.  At this point it was only dimly lit but when it reached an altitude of what i guess would be about one thousand feet it became extremely bright white, almost silver in color, and hovered for a few seconds, then shot straight up into the sky.  I cannot even guess its&#39; speed or altitude at that point.  It then traveled in an arc, heading almost due south until i lost sight of it.  I waited and watched for several minutes, and to my surprise i saw it again, but this time it traveled south to north.  Again, i am unable to estimate its altitude or speed, but it only took the object about 5 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  The second sighting i had was almost exactly the same in detail as the first, but it took place on April 23rd and at roughly the same time and place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight i was out sky watching when this sighting took place.  It was 9:45 PM (EST) in the evening.  The object was circular in shape, and brightly illuminated in white to silver.  When i first saw it i thought it was just an extremely bright star.  It was just above the tree line.  It slowly started moving higher up and across the sky.  This time it was traveling from south to north.  I ran in and got my binoculars and by the time i got back outside the object was near the center of the sky.  It&#39;s travel was erratic to say the least.  It would start out with a zigzag motion then pause a second, then resume it&#39;s flight in a slight arc.  When i had the object in focus i could see that it was changing color and shape.  It would shift from silver white to orange then to blue and back to silver white.  What i was able to make out quite clearly was the fact that every time it shifted color it would also shift from a circular shape to an oval shape and then back.  It must have taken about 3 minutes to traverse the sky.  When it reached the tree line something appeared to separate from it and speed back across the sky in the opposite direction it had just traveled.  The object appeared to originate near the area of the nuclear Site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed other sightings in the area, but these are the most significant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only speculate as to what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineer and am familiar with conventional aircraft, these are in no way conventional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately the photographic equipment i have is rather limited.  I have attempted to get pictures of some of the objects using my digital but am unable to capture any useable images to date.  I have some short bits of footage on the camcorder but it too is not of a quality that would be of any use.<n>

A sun reflected orbital light appeared from the WSW but picked up speed.  It was much faster than an unpowered satellite.  As it reached SE it was joined from the south by a second orbital craft and then both sped to the east.  The entire pass was approximately 50 seconds. The HST was behind them and on-time. I&#39;ve watched satellites for years and was shocked by the speed.  It was my first unidentified sighting.  I didn&#39;t report it sooner because I needed a second sighting (06/09/03) to erase doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sighting reports from same source.  PD))<n>

It seemed to be moving slowly northeast.  The bright sun was reflecting off its surface.  One could say it appeared to be floating or drifting.  It could have definetly been a small helium balloon caught in the air currents. My impression is that it was at least as large as a basketball.  It was way too high to determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In this sense, the shape was maybe like 2 ears, lit, an eye on the forehead, lit, and no fourth light.  The lights were crime light colored and the object hovered.  It was very close, maybe 30 stories high.  I could only see the lights, and they suggested a helicopter shaped figure, but THERE WAS NO NOISE AT ALL, and it seemed to be emitting beams of light that were filtered by the fog/mist in the air!!!  It changed direction and lifted away.  It was a foggy morning, and I was out for my morening bike ride when I noticed this object hovering in the sky at a very close distance from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The trailing edges were more difficult to see, because while the leading edge glowed a dim orange color, the trailing body &#34;shimmered&#34; as if shedding a large quantity of heat, sort of like a mirage. A good description of the overall effect is &#34;shimmering shadow&#34; that moved across the sky. It traveled in a straight line, with it&#39;s leading edge spanning about 1 degree of arc (as estimated by comparison with a thumb&#39;s width at arm&#39;s length, and traveled about 75 to 90 degrees of arc in about 8 to 10 seconds. I have observed many satellites and meteors in this same location and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen before. It was not just a point of light - it had physical extent and no navigation lights. I noticed no sound associated with the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since my childhood I&#39;ve read just about every kind of UFO book made since the early 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet, I&#39;ve never seen a UFO until today and I&#39;m excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a back deck here and I sit on it to watch satellites and aircraft going across the sky at dusk for 2-3 hours from time to time.  It&#39;s my quiet time to reflect on my life, the economy, ect...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I noticed several satellites, I guess about 7, and 3 or 4 commercial aircraft flying across the sky.  Commercial aircraft are pretty bright and have beacon lights.  Sometimes you can see the glow from the windows down one side of a big jet cruising at 35,000 feet pretty easy.  You can also hear the jet engine noise pretty easy from out here in the country.  Satellites are different!  They don&#39;t glow as bright as aircraft get,, yet they can move across the sky nearly as fast as aircraft can.  A satellite moves much faster than an airplane yet at their altitude out in space, it gives the appearance of the relative speed of an airplane.  In 20+ years of randomly watching satellites and aircraft, I will testify that they will appear and dis-appear into the distance usually within 2-3 minutes.  Satellites will disappear quicker than aircraft as they rely on the setting sunlight to be seen!  But, once a satellite crosses the sunset line in space, over your location, it disappears as satellites don&#39;t generate their own light like commerical aircraft do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed what are thought to be the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites, three of which fly in formation.  NUFORC has received many such reports.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting in my chair, at precisely 10:20 PM, 5-28-2003, I noticed directly overhead three very dimly glowing lights amongst the stars.  These lights were dimmer than the reflection of the last satellite I was which was only 5 minutes earlier.  I would approximate 1/2 the light value of any satellite I&#39;ve seen.  And Satellites are dimmer than aircraft.  These lights were moving VERY, VERY slow also!  They were moving from due west to east.  These lights direction and speed caused some concern within me as I have never seen anything move that slowly and further from west to east!  Most satellites move in polar orbits around here or they are moving south west to north east or south east to north west...  Never east west!  NEVER!  I&#39;ve been a ham for 20 years and have communicated thru some of our OSCAR satellites in the past!  Have even seen them travel across the sky, south to north, upon occassion!  So direction and speed were very interesting!  Very SLOW!  Very DIM!  And moving west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thougth I was fortunate enought to see one of these moving triangles they have been talking about!  Like the triangle spotted over Phoenix!  But you could see stars thru this triangle!  So it wasn&#39;t solid.  It was three lights which were just moving together across the sky, going very slow, being very dim, and traveling from west to east!  So I felt that my space junk, or what ever it was would dis-appear, at the usual spot in the sky where the last satellite did as it would see earth&#39;s sunset and the glow would go away as these objects entered darkeness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited and waited and waited.  They got to the place in the sky they should have dis-appeared and they did not.  I assumed that because of their dim lights they must really be very far out in space so I waited some more.  But the lights didn&#39;t go out in 15 minutes of watching them.  They dis-appeared into the eastern sky at around 25 degrees above the horizon!  SO!  So they must have been making their own light and this was an actual UFO I just saw, OR, I just witnessed 3 very large asteroids which nearly hit planet earth!  It could be either!  I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An Asteroid would be far enough out that it would be plausable that it would not be affected by the setting sun AND it would explain the very dim glow and slow movement across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other thing about the siting I wanted to say was the pattern these 3 lights made which caused me to believe it was a triangle of some kind.  In the reports of phoenix, I believe witnesses said the nose of the triangle had a light and each tail peice both starboard and port side of the craft had a light.  It&#39;s merely my opinion but because of the pointyness formed by the three lights my mind had the impression this triangle was moving from west to east going sideways.  The nose was pointed ruffly North/North-East and the other distant tail lights, IF YOU WILL, were south of the nose.  I watched the distance of these lights and noticed that by the time they reached the horizon to the east before I lost them, it appeared the distance between all three lights had been reduced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m thinking this must have been 3 asteroids because every account I ever read about a UFO leaves me with the impression that the witness saw bright lights or glowing colors!  COLORS!  There were no colors to these lights!  These lights had the same color of a dim star!  Just a faint white glow.  All three were about the same dim appearance, the imagined NOSE of my triangle being the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have probably missed all three had I been looking anywhere else.  They were going so slow that you have to star at them to see the movement!  Very, very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15 minutes for a straight over head to eastern setting is an extremely long time for a Satellite!  It&#39;s UNHEARD OF!  Why if a satellite were really moving that slow it would re-enter the earths atmosphere!  I&#39;ll conclude to say that I don&#39;t do drugs and I don&#39;t drink either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My occupation is Programmer/Analyst and my hobbies are Ham Radio and Computers using the Linux Operating System.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I&#39;m pleased to have posted my very first UFO encounter here on this website and I hope that before my life is over I get the opportunity to see at least one more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone reading this report from the government has data about a near earth collision of 3 asteroids, I would like to hear about this.  I&#39;m really thinking that&#39;s what I just saw and it frightens me a little either way.  What ever those three dim lights were, at that distance it would have to be HUGE to be natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand, perhaps I did see some kind of UFO, craft of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n>

I was travelling west on South Street when I saw what I thought  was a small aircraft but it was different. It had 3 white lights on each point of an unequal triangle, there were no flashing lights of any kind. It was travelling south at what appeared to be the same height as the incoming aircraft. I kept watching it not sure if it was an aircraft.  A few seconds later I saw several light crafts which were nothing like the triangle I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home a white circle light about the size of a street light came into view of our windshield on the left and side it was coming down on an angle from northwest to south when all of a sudden it dissapeared in front of my eyes.

All of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a round air craft with white, yellow, and red lights on it.  It lasted approx. 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.  I thought it was a plane that went behind a cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the direction I was looking.  I did not hear any noise from the object.  Usually when I see planes over head, I can also hear them.  I was in my back yard on the deck which faces east.  I saw the object in the east and a little north of my house.  I live right near lake Michigan and Wisconsin Electric Power Plant is north of us.  I have heard from people in the past that they have sighted UFO&#39;S around the power plant over the lake, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  It was awesome yet scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/27/03 22:30|Everett|WA|Triangle|00:00:15|I-5 Triangle UFO in Everett|6/10/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29064.html|30|ndxe200305| I-5 Triangle UFO in Everett<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on I-5 at 10:30 at night and traffic came to a quick halt.  I almost hit the semi infront of me trying to get a look at this thing.  It was triangle shaped and on the bottom of the craft, I saw a white light a red light and a green light. One light at each corner of the craft.  The lights flashed one at a time in an orderly pattern.  It was flying very low and I rolled down the window to try to hear it, but it made no sound.  I watched it float across I-5 and into the trees, where it seemed to disappear.  I know other people on I-5 saw this thing because traffic stopped for the exact moment that it passed over the highway. I keep telling myself it was a plane, but I really can&#39;t say for sure!  I&#39;m hoping someone will tell me that it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/27/03 22:10|Phoenix|AZ|Cigar|10 minutes|What was that cigar shaped object ?|6/18/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29206.html|31|ndxe200305| What was that cigar shaped object ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night at about 10:10 p.m. and I was hungry.  I decided to go to an Circle K store which was nearby where we lived.  Without disclosing exactly where I live,  all I can say is that I live nearby Mountain, on the south side.  When I went outside to my car something attracked my attention that I thought it was an helicopter hovering low.  We get many helicopter rescues due to people climbing this Mtn. and they either get stuck or fall and injure themselves.  I looked up at this cigar shaped just hovering there, the lights of the object had attracted my attention and it was hardly moving at all.  There were pinpoint lights alongside of it enough to show that it was a cigar shaped.  I watched it for at least ten minutes if not more, trying to make sense of it, and to make out the exact location of where it was hovering over.  It was hovering North of the Mtn., seemed to be at an height of at least 800 to a thousand feet.  I&#39;m not good at distances but it was close enough for me to rule out that  it was not a plane, helicopter, hot-air balloons and a blimp.  We get blimps flyover during certain times of the year depending on the events.  We have airliners flying over and the airport is about 2 1/2 miles south of where I saw this object.  As I watched this object I observed some of the pinpoint bright lights sometimes flickering.  At the ends of the cigar shaped object there were slightly larger red lights.  It never moved, made noise, it just hung in there the whole time I watched it.  The lights around where I was did not interfere my sight since my house lights were off and the street lights are a distance away.  Then suddenly at about at least during the ten minutes I was watching it .. it just took off upright toward the sky so fast and but it seemed like it just disappeared as it zoomed off.  I went to the Circle K and there was a man standing at the corner of the store, staring at the same area where I saw this object.  I ignored him and went inside the Circle K store! After I bought some items and came outside, he was still waiting at the corner still looking up at the sky and my car was parked next to him.  He was very quiet and seemed a bit shook up.  As I was starting to get into the car the man asked me if I had seen anything strange.  I asked him why do you ask me?  He said he&#39;s familiar with me since I come to the store often, and assumed I lived nearby.  I asked what does that have to do with my living nearby.  He said &#39;you had to have seen it, you just gotta have to seen that thing, it was just there and then it took off&#39;.  I told him, whether if I had seen it or not, no body would believe it anyway.  I admitted I did see it but I didn&#39;t go into details, I just got into my car and went home.  All that night, I laid outside in my lounger, watching the sky, wondering if it&#39;d come back which it didn&#39;t.  I know what I saw was real but I can&#39;t explain it since of all the airliners, blimps and hot air balloons I&#39;ve never seen anything like it except, last week I was watching a TV show and it was about UFO&#39;s.  I was shocked to see the portion of the show where the daughter (in Colorado) goes outside to play and she saw this cigar shaped thing in the sky, called for her father, and he had video taped it.  The object I saw was so similiar to that object seen in Colorado, except it was closer.  This is the absolute truth to what I saw and it&#39;s real unless this is some secret government flying object of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I peered out of my window I noticed a Suacer shaped vehicle about 200 to 300 yrds away. At first it reflected the sun lite, then I noticed it was gunmetal colored. Shocked at what I saw I rushed for my binoculers. I watched it slowly pass the sky going west to east. It then speeded up and shot out of sight going north east I&#39;d say at about 1,000 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From Fremont to Milptas, CA a small silver egg shape slowly cam from the west around 7:30 from the direction of Sunnyvale from out of no where. It wasn&#39;t a plane and it moved too slow to be one. It slowly traveled at about 5,000ft from sunnyvale area to milpitas, north a little, then east to mountain ridge, then turned and stayed still, it then headed south quickly then disappeared. It was reflective at times when the sun hit it. No lights on it or beacons like a plane would have. It didn&#39;t seem in a hurry and a lot of people would have seen it if they were paying attention. The air is warm and still this morning, like earthquake wheather. The sky is blue with an unlimited ceiling. I hope other people report what they saw as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights had a dull reddish glow in between making a circle with the white lights making a meeting point.  I couldn&#39;t see the sides or top of the object so I&#39;m not sure of it&#39;s exact shape or have anything to judge it&#39;s hieght or size by.  It was totally silent and moving quickly from north to south.  The entire incident lasted approximatly 5 to 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed a stream of smoke coming from the ground up, from a Jet.  From the angle of it, and how it was flying gave the impression of a missle being launched in the middle of the city...sounds stange but totally true.  It looked like a missle being launched or a rocket, even the space shuttle.  But it had to be just a jet flying over head?? Anyway, as we were sitting on my friends back porch talking about this, One of my fiends spotted a dark odject floating in the sky and moving right toward us, but way up high. And moving fast. Not real fast but fast. It seem as if it were being propelled by wind like a kite or a balloon,but is was moving very directly...this is hard to explain but thats how it was. The sun was setting at this time but there was still plenty of light. And this thing flew right over us.still way up high.  at this point we were able to see that this thing looked like a large bat wing...kind of like Batmans bat jet from the movies. It was dark, solid, and had no lights on it at all.  and it was silent. no sound at all could be heard from it.  Stranger still is the we live in San antonio city, the whole city was awake and moving and I dont think anyone else in this whole city saw this incredibly amazing weird flying thing...just us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request that the witness have the other individuals who saw the object submit reports.

During Barbecue our party observed what we thought at first to be two balloons floating high in the sky moving at a slow rate of speed North to South. Then abruptly both objects stopped. Minutes later they again began moving until they both moved into the &#34;mist&#34; of a large diffusing chemtrail. While in the chemtrail they both again stopped, hovering side by side. Through binoculars (10X) they appeared to be rotating and or changing shape. We could make out a red color that appeared to be a large part of the structure. After about 10 minutes they moved out of the chemtrail and abruptly disappeared. Someone in our party said they were having a rash of UFO reports in the San Jose area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no stars visable, as the sky was overcast and misty. There was hardly even a breeze. I, then, saw a squashed-oval object - burnt orange, rimmed in a fuzzy neon light blue, in the upper half of the Southern sky. I thought that it was just a pretty star, robed in mist, until I realized that it was much too big, and moving away. It was about the size of three/four very large stars. Within the course of approx. 10 secs. it grew smaller, and smaller, until it disappeared. My dog&#39;s neurotic behavior ceased!

I was lookin at the beautiful sky that night.  There were many stars that night and it was very beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed a star moving I guess north for a distance of about nine inches and turned left and disappear from my view.  I noticed it and my friends noticed it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because we thought it wasn&#39;t real, we waited for about 15 minutes and again we noticed a star moving this time south from different location.  It also disappeared after few inches of movement.  We saw another one moving I guess west for few inches and it also disappeared.  Another one moved west for few inches and it disappeared too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end, we saw two moving south simultaneous with about one inch apart.  But one on the left was wobbling a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know exactly what I saw but I did a little bit of research and I believe it&#39;s not a plane, satellite, nor meteors.  There is something about moving star but it&#39;s not located in our galaxy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We, too, do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe that satellites would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

As I put the phone to my ear to say hello, I could hear a young girl crying in the back ground and a women speaking to her.  I said hello...there was a short pause and the women on the other end said, &#34;Is this the UFO place?&#34; I replied, &#34;This is Oregon UFO Research mam, is there something wrong?&#34;  I could still hear the girl crying in the background and the sound in the womens voice was very sharp and semi-frantic.  I began taking notes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said, in a very matter of fact way, &#34;Are UFOs real or not?&#34; The way she said this, rather insistent on an answer with her daughter still crying in the back ground made me think something had just happened at her home. &#34;Yes mam we at Oregon UFO Research believe there is something to the UFO phenomenon. I hear your daughter crying. Did something happen at your home this evening?&#34; There was a pause and the women began to cry herself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Yes.&#34;  I asked, &#34;Is this something you have called the police about?&#34; After another pause she said, &#34;we have no police here to call. It would mean one coming from miles away...besides, I&#39;m not sure what they could do anyway.&#34;  I asked her how she got a hold of my number and she said from a quick search on the internet for &#39;UFO Oregon&#39;. I then asked her what had happened and she explained that about 45 minutes earlier (which would have been around 1:45 am) she was awoke by a scream from her daughters room down the hall. She leaped from her bed and, running down the hall towards her daughters room, noticed a glow of light coming from under the door. As she turned the knob and opened the door the hallway was bathed in brilliant light coming from the room but originating from outside the girls window which was closed and covered by blinds. Her daughter was sitting up in her bed with her blanket up around her body and face, only her eyes showing as she screamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I interrupted her at that point and said, &#34;someone was outside your daughters window pointing a bright light into it?&#34;  She explained that the light was from above somewhere outside and slowly dropping to window level and described the brightness as being &#34;sharp&#34; like really bright flood lights that left lines through the room as it penetrated the cracks in the closed blinds...the lines of light running from the floor upward where she stood and from the top of the window down. She said the light was so brilliant that you could make out dust particles floating in the air caught in the light. She explained that she ran to the bed and picked up her daughter and began to rush from the room when the light went out and the room went dark. They then turned on all the lights in the house and called her husband at work to come home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I asked where exactly she was I realized that she had pulled away from the phone for a moment and was speaking to her crying daughter. When she returned she began speaking quickly and in a whisper that her husband had just pulled up and that she would talk about this with him and to please not call her back if I had the number until she had a chance to talk with him about it. She then hung up. I checked the caller ID on my phone but it only said &#34;out of area&#34; with no number available to give any indication of where this event took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of this posting at 9:45 am there has been no return calls but if there is and the witness is cooperative an investigation will be initiated. At this time there is nothing to validate whether this event is real or not but it is the opinion of this investigator that the phone call was either real or was the product of Oscar caliber acting on the part of both the older and younger females heard over the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my opinion that the event happened, whatever that event may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Assistant Director, Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler for sharing this report with NUFORC.

At times it looked like two of the lights would almost touch and then bounce away from each other.  At the time of this writing, we have observed the sighting for about 35 minutes.

It was very bright white with a bluish tone.  it flaired out it a geometric, multi-pointed, three dimensional star shape. i could see it for several miles as we approached.  It was stationary until we were a few 100 yards away.  Then, as it flashed it reappeared to the north(my right) and higher it kept going gradually higher and right more qiuckly.  It excellerated at a slow to faster pace then turned upward and west blurring in its speed into disapearance. My friend and I were agreed that we saw the same thing.  On our return June 19.  Since my freind saw a sign for Ashley Creek,we new where we sighted the lights.

(I was waiting for my husband to come home from work, and after that, he was going to stop at the grocery store. He worked until 11:00 PM.)I saw something move in the sky.(Which was not too unusual, there seemed to be a lot of what must have been satellites moving around everywhere, last night.) I saw what looked to be one craft, high in the sky, moving down directly South. It appeared to be three white lights formed in a triangle, moving together perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved really fast, faster than the airplanes that I see coming in from a far distance, and the lights stayed steady, no blinking or changing colors. I heard no sound, but it was pretty far away. (We are about a mile away from the airport, and see a lot of planes coming and going.) My dog was outside with me, and did not act any different than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed down a lot when it came down further from the sky, and started heading North-East. I was not looking through a telescope or binoculars or anything, I just had my glasses on. It seemed at one point, that maybe there were actually three lights, as one or more would move a little, but it was very hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this was, but it was so different from the lights I normally see. If it was indeed one craft, it must have been pretty big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still watching when my husband came home, and was knocking at the front door. (I was on the back steps, with the back door open.) I had to leave to go open and un-lock the front door for him, and when I came back, I could not find them. I just kept thinking about them (Or it..) today, and thought maybe I should report it in case someone else saw what I did. I saw a jet today, and thought of how slow it was moving compared to what I saw last night. I asked my husband how fast he thought it was going,(The jet today.) and he said about 600 MPH.( I think that is what he said.)  ---&gt; (If you publish my report, please do not post this next part, thanks.)I have sent you a report before, and never sent you the picture, as the picture showed nothing of significance, sorry, and I felt foolish at that point.

It had lights around the trim of it and moved in a graceful motion. It moved across the freeway...leveling itself up and down!!!with a blazing thick ray of light bursting off the bottom as it shoots up into the sky.. It was about the size of a car but only about half the height. A round disk circular shape...It was a moment ill never forget...too bad i couldnt pull my camera out on time...but ill never forget what we saw out there...whatever it was...it was an experience ill never forget.it truly looked like a ufo !!!! this is for real...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

It was warm outside so I decided to go out and look at the stars. Light pollution was fairly low and the moon wasn&#39;t out. From the east a light travelling much slower than the air traffic came over the ridge and made movements that were not consistant with commercial airliners or helicopters. There where no blinking lights, no sound, and I couldn&#39;t identify any solidity due to the intensity of the orange light. I took pictures with a disposable camera which show the light and also a commercial airliner in the same frame. I hope they turn out. I tried to call a friend to come look out of their house but my cell phone made a weird noise then cut out. I later went inside and called, it worked fine. I talked to the same friend and they said that a lot of sightings have been in the area latey and some during broad daylight. He also said, &#34;it&#39;s a wonder the press isn&#39;t doing more to address it. But you know.&#34; I looked on your site to see if anyone else had seen the same thing but it looks like updates take a while. I hope the film I have turns out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Crossed overpass into town and noticed two bright orangish lights and a dim third making a triangle shape.  It appeared to be moving slowly southward down Superior Street/Highway 17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove underneath it and could see against the sky that it was a perfect traingle shape dark grey or black with orange lights on either corner.  It also had a lighter grey circle outline in the middle with a similar colored stripe from each light to the circle.  My mother in the car noticed that the back third(from our prospective) seemed to be a bit darker, but you could still see the outline of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was driving and turned left to turn around back onto to the street for a better look, trees blocked the view and when we got back onto Highway 17/Superior Street you could no longer see any lights in the sky at all besides some stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were solid, and seemed to dim as we drove beneath as if they were located more on the top edge of the craft.

The son estimates the triangle&#39;s altitude as only a few hundred feet in the air, and even though it was deep twilight, the sky was still light enough to not only see the triangle as it approached, but to also discern the structure as they drove beneath it.  [Weather conditions were as follows:  Clear, below 12,000 feet; Visibility 10 miles; Temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; Wind out of the East at 6 mph]  Bright orange lights were observed at each angle of the object, although those lights did not illuminate the structure nor surrounding area.  The family observed what seemed to be a lighter gray circular area on the underside of the structure, with some sort of line, or stripe, or structural component leading from each angle in toward the circle in the middle.  With the car radio turned off and the window rolled down, the family could hear no sound associated with the object.  After meeting the object and driving beneath it, the family turned off on a side street and circled back around the block (while doing so, trees blocked their view) so that they were now back on Highway 17, only now they were headed south -in the same direction as the triangle had been moving - but by this time, the triangle was nowhere in sight.  The bright orange lights they had observed as the object approached (during this 3-minute sighting) had actually seemed a bit dimmer as they drove beneath the object, and the family theorized that perhaps the orange lights at the three angles were situated toward the top of the triangle rather than closer to its underside.  &#34;Apparent&#34; size estimate is that the object looked to be about the size of three full moons.

I was a star in the distance and I did a double take because of the color of it and the fact that it was moving closer. I sat up in bed completely astonished and a little curious. It was high in the sky but I could see it was like an orange fireball and it was kind of hazy looking. It was moving silently and too slowly to be a helicopter or plane. It was coming from the south east. I looked at it until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore after it went over my roof. The whole thing lasted around 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were waiting for my husband and his bother to get done fishing at harlon county damn. I asked my 28 year old ((name deleted)) who was dating my brother in law if she beleived in other living things besides us like UFO&#39;S. She said NO. I said my mom has introduced me to the life of watching for them and how they watch us back. She thought I was insane. So we went out side and the one I seen frist. I pointed out and she watched as it swayed down slowly. When we got in the car to drive up her mile and ahalf drive way so the sky would be clear of any trees. The space ship came down fast and followed us up the drive way. When we got out agian. The ship flew up and all kinds of them apeared all around us like they were watching us as we were them. They kept swaying around us and they were are differnt shapes differnt colors that flashed and when they would sway closer it was like the lights would dim and when they would just sit in one spot it was like they were bright then dim. When some one would drive close to the area they would dim down so much that they looked like another star in the sky. My mother has always told me they have been watching down at her since she was 15years old. They are there. You believe they will allow you to see. When you are hurt and lonely. You talk to the skies and they will appear. Wheather you are alone or not you show no harm they show no harm. Neberska is a really good place to watch for them. The best places I have found to watch them is the contry on Holstein Road in Kensaw NE., The country of the organ trail area which is located by the little blue rive by Deweese NE., and of course way out in the country of Franklin NE..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been a scary adventure at times but very interesting and a enjoying adventure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The other person with me looked up at something, or things in the sky. I looked up and saw 4 star-like small dots. One of them was changing colours, from blue to red. The 4 UFO&#39;s were in a group, and then broke up into different directions. I had my eye focused on 2 of the dots, and not really on the other 2, because the two I were looking at more often, were the ones moving more. One of the two i was focusing on, seemed to dissapear, and then re-appear somewhere close to where it had been last time. The other one was moving in quick jolts, side to side, up and down diagonally, basically any way possible. After a few minutes of moving they would stop for a few minutes, and then begin moving again. The sky was pitch black, with very few stars. The ones that were actually moving, and not dissapearing and reapearing, left a sort of gray haze behind them that would last for some seconds. Around each of the UFO&#39;s, was a light, a light brighter than the object, and it seemed to stretch out pretty far. The objects (excluding the one changing colours) were the same colour as stars, except one was much brighter than a star, and one was much dimmer than a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft entered from the East and then went to the West and then the South.  As it approached and got closer, you could see the craft flying really fast up and down like a heart monitor.  It made no noise whatsoever.  When the craft turned, it did not bank.  It also appeared to be VERY jittery.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The tripod was free and I tracked the object till it left the horizon.  its speed was very fast.  I could just barely keep it in the viewfinder, but both my girlfriend and I saw it.  I have seen satelites before and this was MUCH faster than one of them and this was far slower than a meteorite.  There were several witnesses with me and the object was not visible to the naked eye.  In the telescope the object&#39;s size and magnitude was that of a +4 star.  Again, I tracked the object in the viewfinder and my girlfriend just saw it for about a second, and it moved in a northern direction<n>

They were very very high and going at and incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight we saw again two lights, same kind of lights they were farter East but on the same course, they seemed to travel side by side without splitting appart. we did not look for a long time I lost them over the tall pines.

When it got overhead I could see that it was a disk shaped object or a sphere.  It moved slowly at first and hovered for seconds at a time.  It moved in a fluid way back and forth.  Came from south to the north and then turned about 75 degrees to the East.  I watched it for about 3 minutes until it was headed out of my view, then I ran to my car and headed east out of town.  I got out of town and spotted it.  I saw it for only about 1 minute before it began to speed up, then it was just gone.  It sped up fast and vanished, I could not discern where it went.  There was no sound to this object that I could hear over the small amounts of noise in my neighborhood.  I am able to hear planes and helecopters, and this I could not hear at all.  This object didn&#39;t appear to be extremely high in the sky(like a jet would be), only at about the same height that a helecopter or small airplane would fly.  Also no blinking lights like on a plane or helecopter. And no chem trail visible (a bright night sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was about 6:45 PM. The contrail was split in two pieces so I thought it had to be a plane, but I could see no wings, tail or engine. It was quite long and appeared to be just under the high stratus clouds. It was silver in color and appeared to have structure, but I saw no markings. My wife was with me, but I did not point it out to her as it was straight up and would have interfered with her driving. We were approaching O’Fallon and were probably nearest to Lebanon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly with this witness, and we found him to be sincere and credible.  PD))<n>

It does not look like a chem-trail because if you were to continue the ring it would appear to create a perfect circle.  The sky is somewhat overcast but the sun is definitely shining through.

I had never been on a plane before. What I seen shocked me. There was a sphere looking light that looked like it was bouncing really fast along the skyline. We were not up to hight cause I could still see the ground pretty good. The light was so bright surprisingly because it was still daylight out. But I was sorta stuck in shock I couldnt take my eyes off the thing, I was infatuated with it. I wanted to tell my husband to look but I couldnt. When it was finally out of sight I turned away and looked down at my self and was thinking did I really just see that. And would my husband believe me, then I started thinking that maybe I was seeing things but the image is burnt in my head and I can still see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/21/03 23:30|Hamilton (Canada)|ON|Circle|35 minutes|Three different sightings of dim, orange lights arranged in various shapes passing soundlessly over my house.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32311.html|73|ndxe200305| Three different sightings of dim, orange lights arranged in various shapes passing soundlessly over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a personal journal entry taken from the week following the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May 27, 2002. It’s been a long time and much has happened. Firstly I should report that on Tuesday, May 21, 2002 I had three separate UFO sightings. It was garbage night at around ten thirty. The evening was clear, cloudless and refreshing. I was looking up at the stars and moon, as I often do on when it’s nice, making my last trip down the driveway with the blue box in tow. Up towards Mount Hope Airport I saw six lights, two triangles fat side first, coming as a unit towards the house at an indistinguishable height. They immediately got my attention because they were nothing like any airplane lights I had ever seen. As, what I thought to be a plane approached I observed that the lights were all the same color; orange, dim and larger than I usually see on planes at night around here. As it passed over head I became even more fascinated (perplexed) because the plane made no sound. The lights were indeed close enough that I should hear sound, and in fact, they were close enough that I should be able to see a shape or silhouette of some sort. Yet there was none of that either. In fact, I could see right between the lights to the stars beyond. Now I was transfixed and as it went a little farther the light pattern of two triangles rearranged themselves,  scattering into a haphazard pattern indicating to me that this wasn’t one plane but six individual units. I was pretty freaked out but surprisingly less than I would have thought. I made some phone calls (two to a very unappreciative friend because his daughter was asleep (jerk!)) and then went out front to have another look. I called my brother with my portable phone but wound up talking with his wife because he was at the Leaf game. I didn’t bother mentioning to her what I was calling about because of the subject matter. As I was rapping up the call I saw another one. This was a singular, orange, dim light (same as the others) coming diagonally from across the street, perpendicular to my house, and going west. It was a spot of light too fast for a plane but! too slow for the steak of a shooting star. It was strange talking to someone but not being able to tell them. Then finally, after I got off the phone I saw the last one. It was a line of three horizontal lights (same as the others) traveling on a similar path as the first but a little more west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it may be an iridium flare, but it did not dim.  It traveled at a relatively constant speed, but it jumped, hesitated and weaved as it traveled eastward.  It was not a meteor, no trail or pieces breaking off.  I thought it might be a tumbling satellite, but it seemed way to bright.  It made no sound.   I watched it til it disappeared over the horizon.  Very strange object. I spend a lot off time looking skyward, using my telescope, watching and photographing the aurora, but i have never seen an objectlike this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon further inspection with binoculars, they just seemed to be lights, but obviously not airplanes.  Towards the end of what I saw, there was a large, seemingly closer bright one, but it too just seemed to be a light.  Shortly after this, I went back into the house to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran and got my binoculars to see if there were any green or red lights , but there wasn’t any.  It was just a big bright white dot.  It never picked up speed, and it didn’t make any noise that we could hear.  It also seemed to be adjusting it’s direction, for it seemed (as I watched) to be making like a wide curve turn, and as it disappeared beyond the horizon it seemed like it was traveling more east then northeast.  We spotted it when it was over head, and it took about 10 minutes before we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am unsure if the flight crew had witnessed the event,but I would be most surprised if they missed it. I have had a long career in aviation but never witnessed anything as large or as terrifying as this event. I thought that there would be a cataclysmic event when this object impacted.I truly thought that this object was going to impact in the near vicinity. it disappeared out of my line of sight behind MT Samson (approx 950ft)which was about 2 -3 kilometres away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got to Telegraph / Sibley. The sky was clear and dark blue. To the right I saw what at first I thought as an airplane.The light was unusally bright. But then the light dimmered down.And after that happened the speed of the light increased a lot. It quickly went left off to the horizon. From what I know commercial planes dont dimmer lights and increase speed dramatically over populated areas.I continue down telegraph and just before I reach telegraph and Eureka I notice another object that had dim lights too.But this one was different because instead of moving into the horizon it just disappeared. None of the lights acted like normal air planes.When I got home I looked up at the sky again and noticed an unusual amount of activity. I could they were airplanes but the amount of them and the higher altitude sky streaks were more than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up into the Northern clear blue sky and noticed something clear but had a diamond/Glassy/triangular shape to it, so I took off my sunglasses to make sure I was seeing something. At this time the object almost disapeared except I could still see a reflection from the sun on it, then I put my sunglasses back on and it was still there, But moving at a high rate of speed towards the east. I asked my fellow worker if she could see it in the sky and she said &#34;no I don&#39;t see anything&#34; and &#34;I said there it is don&#39;t you see it.&#34; I know it was not a plane or a helecopter or anything of that nature because the item I saw was not solid in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approx, five to six hundred feet up in the sky maybe. As it went towards the east it disapeared within a few seconds. I believe it traveled about 10 to 20 miles in just a few seconds before it disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had taken a good look around in all directions when I noticed two very bright white lights on the eastern horizon that I hadn&#39;t noticed moments earlier.  As I stood there trying to be sure that they hadn&#39;t been there moments before, I saw that they were moving north together at the same speed.  I looked carefully at the lights, trying to see the flashing that would let me know they were typical aircraft.  The lights did not flash at all.  As I watched, the lights grew steadily brighter and then faded, as they moved, until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on an acreage near Stony Plain. A friend and I had spent the day fishing and finished off with some food. I got back to my house around 1:30-2:00 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon getting out of my car I looked at the sky, as I usually do on a clear night. I was admiring how clear the sky was when I noticed a very bright light to the north. My first instinct was that it may be a satellite. I love watching the sky and am quite familiar with the appearance of satellites in orbit, and their linear patterns. This light however was not moving in a straight line and seemed to slow down and speed up randomly. It would pulsate from very bright to almost invisible. The duration of the brightness was much longer than the gradual fade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared circular in shape, but had no visible edges. It proceeded south in a straight line, occasionally breaking course to either side. The movement did not seem natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also quite close, compared to satellites I have seen in the night sky. No sound was emitted. The whole thing was actually quite surreal, especially since it had covered so much distance in 10-15 seconds. Shortly after it had broke from its straight course south for the 5th or 6th time, it just seemed to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what I saw. I do watch the sky constantly, for beauty and curiosity. This event stood out from anything else I have ever seen. Got me pretty excited, and a little nervous.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said, &#34;There is a UFO out here!&#34;   I went out as fast as I could, since I am disabled and don&#39;t move very fast.  It took me about one minute to get out there...then I looked in the direction he was pointing (almost straight up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is what I saw:  The object was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 as wide as a full moon.  It was definitely cigar-shaped and brilliant white.  It looked just like a fuselage of a jet with absolutely no wings.  It was traveling from about 030 deg (NNE) on a compass to about 210 (SSW), which is exactly perpendicular to my house as it is oriented.  (That is why I am so sure of the directional travel of the object)  I would estimate it was quite a ways up into the sky, approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet, although it is difficult to say with no other reference points.  The object made absolutely no sound.  The skies were clear blue.  It was near 7:00 P.M.   I first picked up the object at an inclination of about 80 degrees (azimuth 030) and followed it for about 3 minutes until it was at an inclination of about 50 degrees (azimuth 210).  It made no sudden acceleration or deceleration during the entire travel.  It then flashed BRILLIANT WHITE, so bright I lost sight of the shape of the object.  The flash was almost as big as a full moon!  About five seconds later it flashed a second time (identical to the first time).  Then the object just disappeared!  I have emailed a sketch of the object, but it really isn&#39;t very detailed as I didn&#39;t see much detail other than the shape of the object itself.  The sketch includes the object shape, the relation of a full moon in size, and the size of the 2 &#34;bursts of light&#34; that the object made, in relation to the size of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in my life I have seen something that is absolutely unexplainable in the sky.  (The first being in Mancelona, Michigan in 1978).  I used to be a UFO skeptic.  I still have not been convinced that these objects are extraterrestrial, but I can say with absolute certainty that there are &#34;unidentifiable objects&#34; traveling through the atmosphere of this planet.  I know there are more than one type since I have seen for myself two distinct shapes of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is certainly well past time for our government to &#34;come clean&#34; on what they know about these objects.  If they think they are protecting us by cloaking their knowledge in secrecy they are mistaken.  The more data the researchers have to work with, the better the chance that these mysteries can be solved!<n>

Then I saw a whitish grey oval/egg shaped disk, which appeared to be folding in half at times. It was far away and moved slowly around and about and to the east over the top of Mount Lemon. My 5 year old son saw it too, and said he saw it spinning and also folding and unfolding.  I took pictures and in the picture, their is more than one of these, with this the bigger one and a bunch of (maybe 4/5 other smaller ones). The picture turned out grey (a darker grey caller as if they were all shadows). Yet another picture turned out white dots. The object moved away just a tad bit faster, when Davis Monthan Air Force Base Jets flew over. Then I could no longer see it. The Jets were flying over previously in the day.

One night me and my wife, back in roughly 2003, was living with my grandmother and knowing we could not smoke in the house decided to go out about 1:30am and have a cigarette.  We are always looking up in the sky but tonight was special.  Had we not looked up we would have never seen what I&#39;m about to describe it was that quiet. We seen what I call the star trek enterprise.  The size of the spacecraft was so big, I&#39;m talking at least 75 to 100 yards in length.  Slightly triangular but no real light effects none other than 2 red lights that was lite but not blinking on each side of the wings.  This spacecraft was least than 100 yards in the sky and had a speed of least than 100 mph.  The level of detail outside the ship was brownish/Gray colored with different levels to the ship.  We could not see any windows but you could tell it was able to house at 1000 UFO&#39;s or more.  What was so amazing about the siti! ng is that it was so quiet you could not hear a sound.  I wish we could of at least took a picture but back then cell phone barely had enough numbers to dial!<n>

At exactly 11:45 PM, two objects appeared in this dark space of sky about eight fingers wide at arms length from each other--one slightly higher than the other from my vantage point.  These two reprised the same &#39;communication&#39; as the last occurrence in that the lower flared twice and dimmed, then the other flared once and dimmed.  This activity went on for about five minutes, then desisted.  Inasmuch as I have harbored an affinity for skywatching, I am quite familiar with the wild twinkling of stars like Sirius, but this was not a persistent twinkle; it seemed like an attentive statement/question and sensible response.  After the &#39;flared conveyance&#39;, the two objects remained in a comparitvely dimmed state for another minute after which they disappeared.  Does the earth move fast enough to obscure the view of two lighted objects if they are six finger widths rotated horizontally at arms length from the horizon?  Also, let me add parenthetically that the horizon in this part of the sky is uncontaminated with ambient light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately fifteen minutes later, I saw the same incident in the WNW sky--same object position relative to the horizon and each other, with the same type of &#39;flared conveyance&#39;.  After about one minute they too disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out the following night to investigate if what I had seen were stars; but owing to the sky&#39;s overcast melingering, I went out last night when the sky conferred clarity upon me.  That same space was bereft of anything visible, to me at least. This dark space where the two objects had been two nights prior plyed my vacuous mind with questions for which, obviously, I possessed viciously inadequate answers.  More, even if the two objects were indeed stars whose presence was precluded by some atmospheric variant the last night, why do these illumined objects only appear &lt;i&gt;subsequent&lt;/i&gt; to the initiating flash? I am not concluding causation, just an observed corrrelation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To begin with i would like to throw some light on my self and my friend, iam Anish Naidu here, iam 27 years young and a management graduate (MBA) and my frined ((deleted)) is 30 years young and also a management graduate (MBA) &amp; a net working engineer and we both have agreat deal of interest in Science, Religions, Philosophy, World Affairs, etc and it was during one such evening discussions on the 19&#39;th of May, the time was 9:45 PM, the beach was almost empty and pitch dark. We were lying flat on the beach sand with our face facing the beautiful and partially cloudy night sky did we notice this strange object, the exact shape of a &#39;Boomerang&#39; just fly its way into the land (west) from the Bay of Bengal side (east). It was flying at a great hight, even in that hight it was huge, really huge and all we could see was the exact cloud coloured frame of the huge Boomerang like object, it had no lights in them but was flying smoothly, fast, agile and with ease in between the clouds. We saw it take two rounds, each after a gap of 4 to 5 minutes and then disappear, we have never seen anything like it ever in our lives, it was too high-tech, not least bit like the modern day spy aircrafts used by the US and other developed countries, next it made no sound, it had no lights, it seem to follow a pattern, flew with ease, it was very huge and least bit like the latest aircrafts shown in the Discovery and Natural Geography channels. Me and my frined are damn sure of one thing, what we saw was a UFO or some thing really supernatural but one thing is sure after seeing it, we surely believe that we aren&#39;t alone in this astronomically huge infinite universe, we have company.

Although we did not find Leo we did see something more interesting.  We saw a chevron shaped aircraft coming from the direction of Oakland heading slightly northwest.  Since it was heading slightly nortwest I ran to the other side of the building to follow it but the craft then veered northeast.  I went back but did not see it anymore.  My wife stayed at the original location and noted that as the plane was moving away from us the lights appeared to get dimmer until she could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not see the body of the craft but it had dim lights in the pattern of a chevron with an &#34;extension&#34; on one side (Like this: ^- ).  The craft appeared be larger than passenger jets that we always see flying over this area, but since we could not be sure of the altitude of the craft it was difficult to judge its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This appears to be the same type of aircraft my wife and I saw almost exactly a year ago flying over our apartment complex (May 7, 2002 at about 8:55PM).

The duration of observation is 4 minutes. The written witness:  &#34;I take a few moments to report the observation of a UFO phenomenon I have just witnessed last night. I am not someone who indulges in tellinh his personal stories but in this case I consider that it is my duty to share my experiment in order to help someone else or quite simply to get some hints and have someone tell me what I saw because I am still disturbed by it this morning on my arrival in Montreal.&#34;  &#34;I left from Chicoutimi at about 2:10 A.M. to drive to Montreal. The night is hot and the moon strongly lights the forest of the park of Laurentides. When I arrived between the junction of Alma and L&#39;Etape two lengthened and vers luminous elliptic discs fly over the forest on my left at approximately 50 meters of my vehicle. I start to observe them without quitting them from the eyes and I completely open the window to make sure that they are not reflections or something like that and they follow me during a lomg moment. The light which surrounds the two UFOS is whitish and their movement is very particular. They make abrupt movement and move fast laterally and ahead. I can perfectly see the two UFOS during approximately 10 seconds then they disappear a split second to reappear during a moment. I wondered during one moment if they followed my car because they followed me like this during approximately 4 minutes which were very long for me. Then whereas the two UFOS in the shape of lengthened discs follow me laterally, I see two other UFOs ahead which are movin in the opposite direction to join them and thus make a formation with 4 in rhombus, which move strangely with sharp and precise movements but always with logic. Approximately at the third minute there are not two only to move above the forest, but four luminous discs. The feeling I have at this this moment is both fear and amazement but I do not want to pull up for two reasons; firstly to not lose sight of them, then by pure fear that if they also immobilize their movements I would have quite simply lost my nerves. Thereafter, the four UFOs came above the road during a few seconds in front of my car (approximately at 70m), then directed themselves again to the forest on my left. Whereas I lost sight of them I see at the same time interval 5 seconds) a plane, helicopter or another apparatus which comes by in the North at the same place where I observed the UFOs, the pilot of this craft probably saw the phenomenon because he was at the heart of the p! henomenon also. The size of the UFOs was of approximately the length of three long cars (could be smaller) and they flew relatively low at the tree top at certain moments.&#34;  &#34;I do not write this story for the pleasure but to have answers to my questions, what I saw this night. If someone saw the same observations than myself this same night in the park of Laurentides please please let it be known (I believe that I crossed 10 vehicles in the 200 km of the park and none during the observations). a second question annoys me a lot, which was this craft at low altitude seen at the same time when I lost sight of the four UFOs, was this a plane, a helicopter or something else. If somebody can have access to the possible flights of aircraft at 2:55 in the morning in this sector of the park of Laurentides there are strong chances that the pilot saw the UFO phenomenon and could testify about it but who knows who this craft belongs to. One thing is certain is that if I have had a video camera people could have be shown a spectacular display who would have upset them, nevertheless I reported it back the best than I can and if somebody can enlight me do not hesitate to write to me.&#34;  Thanks to this witness. Any additionnal information can be sent to me at pgrsel@aol.com and I will forward it to this witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He wondered if there was a highway above us, because the lights seemed to be heading south parallel to I-5.  Suddenly the lights turned and zoomed down toward the freeway rapidly.  He guessed it covered 2 miles in about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the craft slowed down, and he alerted mo of its presence.  We both thought it was a very low-flying, large airplane, and we watched as it crossed the freeway in front of us.  It was so low, we were barely looking up.  The craft turned left and headed north above the ground next to the north-bound side of I-5.  It appeared to be trying to land, when suddendly this large craft (about 40-60 feet across) banked sharply, about 45 degrees.  We were amazed that a craft that big, flying so low and so slow could have turned that sharply successfully.  It seemed that there was no way without stalling.  As it banked, the three bright, white lights seemed equidistant apart, one in the center and one on each end.  The craft was TOTALLY silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It crossed I-5 in front of us again, this time it was heading west and was only about 100 feet in front of us, and about 40 feet off the ground.  It was so low we hoped it wouldn&#39;t hit us.  We thought it might crash in the field to our right, but it descended and decelerated, no noise, no noticeable dust.  It seemed it would land safely as it almost skimmed the ground.  At this time, we were looking out the side windows, to our right, down and slightly back.  The craft seemed lower than our SUV. It seemed the bottom was flat, because the lights were skimming the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only lights we saw, were shining forward on the craft.  However, from this oblique view, they seemed to be positioned at a slightly obtuse angle (approximately 150 degrees).  It was very dark and neither of us saw any shape to the craft, except for the position of the lights.  All three lights seemed to be in the horizontal plane, as it skimmed the ground, at about 15 to 20 mph, almost touching it for about 150 ft.  Then just as I thought it was about to land, it suddenly tilted up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after this the driver saw the three bright, white lights, in the rear-view mirror.  I turned and watched out the back window as it made several more passes across I-5.  The driver caught glimpses of these passes in the rear-view mirror.  Eventually we lost sight of it as we drove out of range.  At this point we noticed the car clock light was flashing -- nothing else.  It continued to flash for a few more minutes.  The time kept changing correctly as it blinked.  Then it returned to normal without being reset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never heard any noise or saw any shape except for the lights.  There were three other sleeping passengers, who never awakened during the incident.  There were also other cars on both sides of the freeway during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We realized later that it was actually moving at a very slow speed, much slower than the planes that were flying that night. It moved from the southwest to the northeast direction passing overhead us. The v-hsaped lights has its pointed part pointing to the east while moving at very slow speed. It took about 4 minutes to pass us overhead. As it was moving, the object was rotating very slowly, too. It completely rotated 180 degrees during the course of its flight such that it&#39;s v-point was now pointing west after it passed overhead. All the time, it never changed it&#39;s northeasterly direction. After passing overhead, it&#39;s speed gradually decrease and it&#39;s lights began to grow dimmer and dimmer like it was going away from us or moving up. There were no clouds that night and it was not like the clouds were covering it making it&#39;s lights to fade. It took about 2 minutes for the lights to completely fade out. When we reviewed the video I took of it we counted about 6 lights total making the v-shaped object. Other people who was there watching the fountain show were able to see the object we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the length of observation, there were no sounds heard that would point to the object as the source. There were planes flyng that night before, during and after the sighting. The lights are of one color which is white. The course of flight was straight and constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I turned to look, I saw a round bright disc with a black rotating circle in it. The next one appeared and it seemed to be coming right out of the Big Dipper and flew east after the first one. Then one by one two more appeared right of the the Big Dipper (no west/east travel) and all four started traveling east. They were in a staggered flying formation but yet consistent and they glided east. We watched them for a minute or two as they disappeared out of our sight. Being in Phoenix, we thought they were on their way to Roswell, NM, and were glad they didn&#39;t continue to our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought that was strange until I noticed this object was not normal but very strangley metallic and it was flipping from it&#39;s top to it&#39;s bottom. The bottom of the &#34;craft&#34; had the appearence of a giant fan but it did not seemed to move. When I figured out it wasn&#39;t normal I screamed,&#34; what is that&#34; and no one seemed to hear me except my girlfriend and I pointed to it and she noticed right away it was something different. The craft would flip around very sporadicly but not moving from it&#39;s place. It stayed in the same place and I knew someone else had to have seen it because it was almost directly over the freeway but off to the left a little in a firled.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We, of course, thought they were parasuites and were wondering why they had opened up their parasuites so up in the sky. They started as a closed group but started to move apart from each others. They moved very slow, pretty much the same way one moves with a rectangular parasuite. We also noticed one object apart from the main group much much lower than the rest of the objects. We thought that it was one parasuiter that had opened his parasuite much later than the other ones. The objects came in many colors, yellow, green, blue, red etc. like rainbow colors. We noticed that the top ones started to move UP instead of down. We thought that because of the wind streams, they would be in trouble and end up all the way to New York from Boston. However, the objects started to move up and the just simply *disappeared* from the sky. We were althogether three people in the beginning of this phenomena and I invited my two daughters from inside to see the objects as well and they saw those too. I am pretty sure that there were A LOT of people in the area that saw the same thing because this happened at noon and the weather was just beatiful, full of sunshine and clear blue skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/18/03 02:00|Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)||Light|40 s|Two fast blinking lights stationary for +-45s at stars' altitude/distance and vanished - Rio de Janeiro/Brazil|6/3/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28965.html|101|ndxe200305| Two fast blinking lights stationary for +-45s at stars&#39; altitude/distance and vanished - Rio de Janeiro/Brazil<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been seeking for information about something I and two other witnesses saw on the sky on Sunday, 18/05/2003, circa 02:00, Rio de Janeiro, GMT-3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the balcony of a penthouse, with almost complete view of Copacabana sky, talking by phone with my girlfriend, who was at home. As we spoke, I was gazing at the sky, looking to nowhere, when my attention was caught by something I thought was a reddish planet (Mercury, I thought) or star, at aprox. 35 deg. high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a crystal clear night, no refraction due to polution nor clouds. About ten seconds later the star&#39;s color turned to a bright white, and I turned my full focus to it. A friend of mine was a few meters away from me and I urged him to look up and watch the scene. Few seconds later, the star began to blink at a constant rate (2 or 3 blinks per second). Immediatly another light source -- localized at a some -120 deg. angle relative to the first one and close to it (from my viewpoint, a finger width at full arm length) -- began blinking at the same rate, but kind of alternating the phases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later tiny glitters, almost invisible, appeared in the space between them. When +- 40 seconds had elapsed from the &#34;whitening&#34; of the first star, the second one suddenly disappeared, and less than 5 seconds later the first one glowed a little bit brighter and vanished. Almost all the time the two stars stood still. The two light sources were definitely no baloons nor low atmosphere gears -- we were sure they were located way far at space. If they didn&#39;t blink they would look like ordinary and common stars, just a bit brighter than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, as I was talking to my girlfriend I told her to go to the window (she lives some 15 blocks far from where I was, and also facing Copacabana beach) and try to see what I was seeing; she confirmed, having seen about the second half of the 45 seconds show, as we talked.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not hear any sound. Silver or gray in color. Object moved about as fast as a large passenger airliner in a straight line going southeast. This UFO may have been more than one object , however the way it moved so smoothly in a rolling pattern it seemed to be one at the time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She came inside to tell us about it, and myself and my 3 sons went outside to see if there were any more.  Within 2 minutes my wife noticed an object traveling north, higher than a plane, consistent speed.  Another couple minutes passed, we observed another, in almost the same path as the first.  About 4 minutes later we observed another traveling south, opposite direction as the first two, but in what looked to be the same flight path.  The sky became hazy and our observation ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is NOT a joke. I slept out in my barn tonight. The barn has big bay windows. I was in my sleeping bag watching the stars when I saw a octogon/saucer disc shaped craft take off from the trees at the end of my woods propery line. It took off, maybe 300-400 ft above my house and I watched it hover until i couldn&#39;t see it through the bay windows anymore. I ran outside and watched it decend into the trees behind the church across the street from my house. It made a humming noise. I ran inside and got my parents to come out and take a look. We didn&#39;t find any trace of the craft. This is the coolest thing that ever happened to me especially since I recently did a school report on UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I knew it definately was NOT a plane, it had four or five lights in the front/center of the craft that were pointed straight ahead of its direction, it seemed to be traveling very slowly or maybe it was sitting still I cant remember but it was 3 or 4 years ago, and the freakiest thing was that the lights on the front of the craft changed direction and they changed direction and then pointed directly up into the sky, at that moment the lights shot straight up, the craft followed suit and zoomed up at an angle in the sky then shot in the opposite direction in a weird angle, Ive never seen any American planes do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to know if anyone else has had this experience where the lights moved first and then the craft followed suit, Im searching all over this site to see if I can find a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw that night was a UFO and Im glad i finally found this website to tell my story on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were two of them, one higher up than the other, heading do north. I watched them with a pair of field glasses untill I no longer see them. Then around 03:00 I saw one more heading acorss the sky on the same path as the previous ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen them, but it is the first time I read about somebody else seeing them.(SAS jets flying over as I write).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have video tape of it for an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, and given the absence of other reports, we wonder whether the sighting might have been caused by the presence of advertising lights, or some other manmade phenomenon.

This time we had witnesses!  We were watching the Full Lunar Eclipse in the front yard with our neighbors, their 2 children, our two children, my husbands parents and his aunt.  The lights first appeared to the left of the mood and almost completely to the east.  My husband and I recognized them immediately as the same lights we had seen in March.  The lights came on one at a time then went off in the same pattern they came on in.  About 5-10 minutes after they first appeared, they came on again further north.  They came on and went off in succession again.  Then a 3rd time they appeared as they had before, further north this time.  After the 3rd display, we thought we heard a sonic bomb and a military jet fly by at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be 30-40 degrees above the horizon and a few miles away.  They were yellow/orange.  Sometimes smaller lights came on around the main lights, sometimes they didn&#39;t.  They appeared to be moving north northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Its been interesting.  Well, my friend and I were coming home from kokomo, driving west on 26.  I was looking out the window while listening to The Beatles when I saw those familiar orange lights.  There were four of them.  I told darren to pull off the side of the road so he could see.  Well we waited about 5-6 minutes and decided we weren&#39;t going to see it [just military jets in the sky, as usual].  We got back in the car and headed home.  I called my house and told my sis to go watch at the end of our road with her bf and she said alright.  It took us about 4 minutes to get to my road, 700 east, where we met my sis and her bf.  We asked them if we saw anything and they replied nope.  We told them that we were going to eat and then we&#39;d be right back.  So we started down my road.. about 1-2 minutes later [we were driving quite slow, still looking]  I saw this big orange light to the right of me.  It was MUCH closer than any of the ones I&#39;ve ever seen.  I had Darren stop and we jumped out. This light was just sitting there, military was circling the area.  My sister saw it too and drove down to where we were.  Just around then we see these little tiny orange lights break apart for the the bigger one.  A ton of these lights spilt off.. then they all faded away.  I asked if everyone had saw this, and pretty much the same thing coming out of all their mouths was, &#34;Wow.&#34;  We were all kinda stunned.. it was like watching a movie.  We looked for another minute before deciding we better eat so we can come back out.  We were home eating and you could just hear all the jets in the area.  It was apparent they were either chasing the object or it was one of theirs [though I do not see how it could&#39;ve been a manned object].  We got back out at 9:30 and it was pretty quiet.  As we were driving around the country roads we passed two slowly moving vehicles [possibly other people who saw the same thing?].  Nothing was seen for the rest of ! the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Edited for spelling errors, resend by poster.]<n>

I was in the house watching weather alerts on the television when my husband who was outside came to the door and said you&#39;ve got to see this. We were under severe weather alerts at the time so I thought he was talking about all the lighting dancing around in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got outside he just pointed to a large cloud formation with really high tops and he said watch there.  I looked up and at first I didn&#39;t see it, but then all these pin point white lights were darting in and out of the clouds.  Everytime you could see lighting flash inside the clouds these dots of light would zoom into the tops of the thunderstorm and then shoot back out.  It reminded me of a game of tag. There were so many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once, a plane came from the north (a passenger plane I think) and a light chased it for a few seconds then abruptly headed back to the clouds. This went on for a good 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The storm tracked to the south but stayed east of Interstate 35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering if anyone else had seen what we had seen, but there were no reports anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

5/15/03 23:30|Fort Walton Beach|FL|Oval|10 - 15 seconds|Flying Police Car or UFO?|5/27/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28841.html|123|ndxe200305| Flying Police Car or UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am licensed light airplane pilot.  I was standing in my driveway, my back propped against my van to steady myself as I watched the lunar eclipse through binoculars.  A shape I at first thought had wings and flashing a frontal row of extremely bright red, blue, green, and white lights flew into my binocular&#39;s field of view.  All the colored lights flashed on simultaneously and in three quick pulses that repeated after a beat.  The object steadily moved southwest from northeast at about 150 to 200 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had passed near the moon, which was then in mid-eclipse, and I tracked it with the binoculars for about four seconds.  Then I watched it move along without the glasses.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  It was low because it passed in front of me from left to right and then disappeared behind the housetops and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the strangest thing about it was that it made absolutely no sound, none, nothing.  Not a hum, not a buzz, not a whine, roar or whistle, not anything.  It was perfectly silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I judge it to have been traveling at a 15 to 20 degree slant from me and about 1/2-mile distant at an altitude of 500 to 800 feet.  As it passed, the colored lights flashing on it were powerful enough to be diffused by the moisture saturated air and also dimly reflected off the pavement and houses.  It was low because it moved in a straight line away from me and disappeared behind roof tops and trees in the west.  It had one small, steady, white light showing on its receding form.  As it moved away from me, I could see it was a silvery oval, cigar, or wing shaped object that seemed to dimly reflect a pale silver-blue color from the city lights below it.  That&#39;s why I first thought it was an airplane or helicopter, both very common around here.  But it made no sound.  Its soundlessness was the weirdest part of the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called my sister ((name deleted)) and she saw it as well. We saw the object fly over the fields about 800 ft up and then disapear into the clouds. There seemed to be a cloud of light around the object as well, but that may have been it shining through the mist. It also made a quite humming sound as i found out as I opened my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We drove to a field that is directly next to the manitowoc airport and parked in the field.  Their is a roadway that goes into the field and stops somewhere in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t think of the exact direction that we were facing, but i think we were facing North.  We were in the middle of a conversation when my friend shouted &#34;what the HELL is that???&#34;  He was pointing out the window on my side of the car when i turned and saw what he was pointing at.  This object was NO plane.  We had scene one plane go by allready and it was still visible behind our vehicle.  The shape of the object was unclear because we did not get the side-view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I sat directly strait it was 75 degrees to the right when we first saw it.  We hopped out of the car and watched it fly away shocked by what we were witnessing.  We watched it move past the field and over the tree line.  We jumped back into the car to see if we could chase it, but we couldent find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we were looking at is extremly hard to describe.  It had lights that moved rythmicly over the back.  The object could be best described as liquid light.  The light was red and Waved into the center (the center of the back, not the center of the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The BACK of the object was cigar shaped (not to say that it was a cigar shaped object) but the object itself was barely visible.  It flew very slow and couldent have been more then 55 meters off the ground.  It was larger then any aircraft that lands in manitowoc&#39;s airport.  It also was completly silent.  I will send a drawing if i can with this later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I originally tried to report this about 2 days after it happened, but it didnt turn up on the site so i rewrote it today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this expirence I refused to believe that a UFO of extra terrestrial origins would ever come anywhere close to earth or even our galaxy.  I dismised every report i had ever heard and thought the people were either just crazy or liars.  This expirents made me FAR more open to these stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we were looking in the sky and doing some small talk, a person behind me said, &#34;Hey, what&#39;s that?&#34;.  I looked up directly overhead and saw a very dark, probably dark grey or black triangular craft, flying at about 300 feet overhead with a dull non-blinking white light on each tip of the triangle. The craft was noiseless and flying pretty slow, maybe at about 30-60 miles/hour. If someone hadn&#39;t pointed it out, I probably would not have noticed it.  It was big though, probably around 60-100 feet wide.  It passed over our heads in a straight line towards the eclipsed moon and looked as if it veered to the right before disappearing into the haze. Total sighting time was about 5 seconds.  It was very eery and strange.  I have a hard time believing that we have the technology for something to fly like this.  The other two witnesses saw exactly the same thing as myself, but my friend convinced himself it was a flock of birds after hearing what we saw.  I had my glasses on and was of sober mind, that is for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having consider technical training.  PD))<n>

This was May of 2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My passenger, who has some knowledge of aviation matters, told me to look up at some strange lights to my left. (south/east over the Navajo Reservation)   I looked up and saw three bright lights smoothly moving across the landscape over a mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car immediately on the side of the road and got out.  It was a very clear cold night and myself and my friend looked closer at these lights.  The other friend was trying to find a camera inside the car and missed most of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights where flashing like a camera flash bulb going off, almost a blueish tinge to it, but the light was not regimental like a regular plane tail light and where much brighter.  They where moving very quickly and silently and it perfect formation, one slightly ahead of the other two.  Judging from other planes in the sky that night (I had time to compare) these lights where moving extremely fast but there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they stopped in mid air and then the &#39;last two&#39; changed from this flash to a beautiful round orange glow.  This slowly died away in brilliance and the sky returned to it&#39;s inky blackness.  There was never any sound at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other light kept on going, and then a few moments later a number of these orange circles appeared where the path of the flashing ceased to be.  They appeared one after the other and like the others, faded as the next one appeared a little further along the sky.  I counted 7 in all.  Then all was quite and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove back to Flagstaff in silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am a trained observer, amateur astronomer for over 40 years, and have an extensive background in science. The dates are approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way to work one morning, I had stopped for a cup of coffee at a small market that sits at the north end of Lake Goodwin, WA. As I exited my vehicle, I noted a new Boeing 767 or 777, (the aircraft hadn’t been painted yet, and was still in the green primer) coming down the length of the lake that runs north south, at an altitude of just two thousand feet and probably less. The sky was clear and visibility excellent. It’s not unusual to see these aircraft in this area, but I’d never seen one this low or flying so slowly. The flight path is a northerly one used out of Paine Field (approx 15 miles to the south) where these aircraft are manufactured and I assumed this to be a test flight. As I watched the aircraft come down the length of the lake, I was marveling at how quiet it was despite its low altitude and mentioned it to a lady who had pulled into the store a few seconds behind me and was also headed into the market, but like me, had stopped to watch the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “What’s that?” she asked and pointed at an object in the sky to the right of the aircraft (west) and perhaps 50 feet below its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been focused on the aircraft, but immediately saw what she was pointing at. At this time the aircraft was approximately a half mile or less distant. The object was round, bright white, and moving to the east. In size from my location, it approximated a pencil eraser held at arms length. As I watched, it passed directly under the aircraft (that seemed to take no note of it) missing it by about 50 feet and allowing me to estimate it diameter which was approximately 15 feet. In appearance, it was cloud like, but very round with somewhat fuzzy borders. Silhouetted against the blue sky, I could see it very clearly, and it was definitely not a bird, balloon, or another aircraft. I estimated its speed at 120 miles per hour as it covered the width of the lake (a half mile) in about 15 seconds. The aircraft passed over my head a few seconds later, but I was watching the object that maintained a constant course and speed, finally disappearing in the east fifteen or twenty seconds later. I talked briefly with the woman I watched it with and she agreed that it was something highly unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years previous to this sighting I was a passenger in a car on a highway between Butte and Helena Montana. In the sky that day, (afternoon) and on a southerly course, I saw a similar object (bright white, cloud like, but very round.) It was moving at both altitude (approximately 5000 feet) and speed (approximately 1000 miles per hour) I derived these numbers from the height of a broken cumulus deck that I estimated to be 8000 feet and the fact the object seemed to be moving approximately twice the speed of a conventional jet liner. They are by no means accurate, but probably in the ball park. I could make no estimate of size beyond saying it was small. I had the object in sight for about thirty seconds when it did something damn strange. It disappeared and not gradually. It just evaporated. I mention it only because of the physical similarity to the object I saw at Lake Goodwin under pristine viewing conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in May2003 is approximate.

While it filled the entire side of windows (bedroom and back door) we felt it odd and yet not concerning enough to get up from bed to investigate the light. Neither of us heard anything but were both awaked by the light. We furthermore didn&#39;t even discuss it until the next morning when one of us asked the other if they had seen it. To our amazement we had both not only seen it, but didn&#39;t say anything at the time thinking the other was  asleep. the next morning we joked about the possibility of the light being from a UFO as we tried to come up with ANY possible occurrences to account for how the light not only filled the windows but from where it appeared to originate, which was to the right side of the house and up. The light seemed as strong as a searchlight and yet as I said soft in color. No other noise was heard at the time and we BOTH saw the light and didn&#39;t mention it to the other until the next day. As best as we can recall, we are thinking the event happened either somewhere during the weekend of 5/2-5/11 or the weekend of 5/16-5/25. Neither of us have ever made any reports of this nature and it is only because of the article that we do now. We are interested to know if you have had any other reports of this nature during the May timeframe. We did ask our neighbor the following day if she had seen the light as we were new to this area. She had indicated she didn&#39;t because her bedroom did not face the same direction. We being new to the area didn&#39;t make any further note as we just didn&#39;t know what it could have been. Thank you for listing to us and we are actually quite interested in finding out if there ha! ve been any other reports of like type. Sincerely,  Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>
5/15/03 02:00|Franconia Notch (I-93 southbound)|NH|Diamond|1 minute|Spacecraft  Defaces Old Man|12/19/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33818.html|140|ndxe200305| Spacecraft  Defaces Old Man<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my buddy Scooter were comin&#39; back from an ice fishing trip late at night.  While approaching the old man on the mountian ( I-93 south bound) at franconia notch we saw what appeard at first to be a helicopter shining a spotlite on the side of the old man.  We thought there were some hikers stranded up there.  As we passed through the notch we saw a craft in the shape of a diamond firing laser beams at the rock face.  For whatever reason we passed safely underneath the activity.  Probably due to the hemi in my truck.  Anyways, it scared the b&#39;jesus outa Scooter and me.  Scooter said that he had seen something on the Sci -Fi channel about drone ships coming done to do the dirty work while the mother ship stays safely out of sight.   This would lend credence to the majority of most sightings being that of smaller vessels.  I think Scooter is right about this because he&#39;s into all that stuff.  He even has the complete X files on DVD.  Anyway I thought someone should know.  Some think the face of the old man was caused by a rock slide I guess to a degree they ( scientists I guess ) are right.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I said to my cousin that i must be seing things because it looks like that star just moved, but he replied that he had seen it too. I focused my attention to that part of the sky and this &#34;star&#34; was stationary in one position then seemed to turn off and immediately reappear in another fixed location in the sky. this continued for several minutes each time the &#34;star&#34; would do this appearing and reappering in the same two spots each time, it seemed to stay in the original position that it was first spotted in for a longer time than the other. The best way i can describe it is if it was jumping back and forth between these too points. We saw no movement of this light from point a to b it just seemed like someone was flipping a light switch on and off. Also noteably it did not seem to be in the atmosphere although i could be wrong, and there was not a cloud one in the sky. It looked just like all the other stars in the sky except &#34;jumping&#34; and brighter than the surronding stars yet not the brightest object, i wouldn&#39;t say, in the whole sky. Now, i dont know about alien spaceship but it was definatly very weird and i have come across one other person whose decribed to me something very similar which he saw indepentantly and at a different time than me. I would like to know if anyone else has seen such a &#34;star&#34; because it bothers me to this day. I suppose it could be explained by some natural phenominon but i havent seen anything like it before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The area was very rural and no street lights anywhere. as I reached the car, a very warm wind suddenly began to whip around me and wondering about the weather I chanced to look up. there was a glowing red triangle hovering directly above me that was not as hidden by the clouds as one would have thought due to its low altitude, and bright red glow. It circled and then moved on. the warm air left with it. Personal note: Perhaps it was a secret gov. plane they were testing, but one would wonder why they would desire a brightly glowing red perfectly triangular ship.

As I headed down the residentual street a large craft appeared.  It was hovering and had white lights on top and red lights on the &#34;back&#34;- kinda like the back of a car.  It was very large and I ran to the house and woke up my friends who came out and were flabergasted at the sight.  We stood in the middle of the road watching it go slowly back and forth.  my friend&#39;s wife ran into the house to get a camera and by the time she came out the craft just disappeared.  It was huge, almost 5 times the size of a large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/14/03|St. Louisville|OH|Oval||This is a very true and testimonial event that happened in the town I lived in for 3 years. On July 13th or the 14th 2003 around b|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50591.html|147|ndxe200305| This is a very true and testimonial event that happened in the town I lived in for 3 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 13th or the 14th 2003 around between 8-8:30 pm in Licking county, Ohio, I walked outside my home and the very first thing I did was look up into the sky like I always do to see anything out of the ordinary.This time I got my wish! As I walked down my porch steps,I looked up. Then I turned to my left towards my dog,I pet him everytime I go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I looked up again as ususal,This time I saw an airplane up in the sky.It wasn&#39;t one of them small 4 passenger but one of them huge airliners that carry abut 100 I suppose?...Anyway,I have never in my life seen an airplane fly so low to the ground before and that alone caught my attention right away.If I wanted to I could have counted all the windows on one side if I felt like it but seeing it so low below the clouds and closer to the ground was more interesting than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the plane was flying on by,I noticed this tiny white dot come out of nowhere up from behind it.As the plane was moving south bound this white dot came into better view for me.To make a better description what I saw, This white turned into a 3-layer grey oval shapped ball of light.It literally followed along side this huge plane for about I&#39;m guessing 10-15 miles?I estimated how long a mile is on the ground then took that measurement in the sky and calculated there.I watched them both fly off till I could no longer see either of them.This grey oval shaped ball of light,I&#39;m guessing very hard here,was about 1/4 % size of that plane itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Uusually I can hear airplanes,helicoptors in the sky,even many miles before they are even close to my area.This plane that was side-tailed by an unknown flying object was about 2-3 miles from the ground up.And I heard NO sound what so ever period.The only reason I even happen to witness this event was bacause I am always looking up in the sky dan and night for anything out of the ordinary,if it wasn&#39;t for my interest in ufos and aliens,I would have probably not seen none of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This grey ball of light never moved out of track while near the plane.It stayed in a very straight line all the way along till out of sight.the distance between the ball of light and the plane was probably between 70-100 feet.neither the plane or the object made any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My strong opinion that the grey ball of light wasn&#39;t a missle cause the object would have smacked right into the plane therefore causing an explosion,There was no impact and the object was like I said a few good feet away.It wasn&#39;t no cloud cause I have never seen in my life a cloud so round,grey or actually move so perfectly in a line like that,plus at speed? I don&#39;t think so.Not to mention that day there were hardly no clouds in the sky to begin with.Myabe a couple here n there but that&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t no shadow cause there was no ground to bounce off from and the plane was no where near the shape of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically that day I saw for the first time an actual ufo.And there was even an airplane right along side with it to know for sure that object wasn&#39;t an airplane!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She told me that they watched a number of funny colored lights (blue/red/yellow/white) traveling in their direction from the north. What made this a strange looking sight was that the lights seemed to pulsate, and only the white lights on the object grew very bright in intensity, and the other colored lights stayed at the same brightness. As the object drew closer to their location it seemed as if the lights, in a ring, surrounded a dark solid object which was in the center. From the glow off the lights they noted the dark object in the center was completely round in shape, with this ring of colored lights running around it. The object moved very quickly across the sky heading south. The approx length of the sighting lasted about 10 seconds before they lost sight of it due to the trees. She said it traveled in a straight line and up rather high in the sky, but low enough to catch a good look at it. No sound was heard coming from it and no tail was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: Last year in 2002 I had a similar sighting report come in from two Arrow truck drivers who were carrying concentrate ore from the mine here in Houston, B.C. Two trucks had pulled over to the side of the highway for 10 minutes at Meziadin Junction to watch an object which sounds like the same thing here in the report above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing the report with NUFORC.

As we got closer the light didnt seem as bright but when we finally came up on it, it seemed as if we were sitting right under it the was no noise at all and no wind coming from it. it was just hovering over the tree top.it had flashimg lights in sort of a triangle pattern,but we could never actually see the objecy itself.After watching for a few minutes we decided to drive up and turn around,as we were coming back down the rode it started moving across the rode we stayed a distance back a watched , we followed it towards culleoka where its speed became fast enough we could no longer tell the exact direction. This night was a very clear night,many stars, no fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped for a red-light at the intersection of Dawson and Reed Canal Road. While the light was red, a pure beam of white light shone brightly into the night sky, tapering at the bottom, and flanging out at the top. The light went only a short distance into the sky and stopped. The light remained lit for 2 to 4 seconds, flickered shortly, and then dispersed in a random pattern. At that point in time, the car radio (including all of my pre-programmed channels) began playing a high pitched carrier tone sound (similar to a facsimile or modem handshake) on every channel. I picked up my cellular telephone, and the screen was scrambled, and there was NO signal. The traffic lights went out for a brief moment, and then flickered back and went into what seemed a boot-up cycle, going rapidly from green to yellow to red, back to yellow and then green.

The photo is ambiguous, since the image is blurred, and apparently distant from the camera, but our first guess would be that the small image in the photo was caused by a bird, perhaps a wren-type bird with a long tail, flew in front of the camera while the shutter was open.  That is only a guess.  We spoke with the witness, and she sounded to be quite serious-minded and credible to us.  PD))<n>

Anyway, I went outside to smoke and I noticed a bright orange half cirle shape in the distance. It wasent a perfect circle but thats the best way I can describe it. Over the course of me standing there watching this thing it seemed to move and get smaller untill all that was left was a diagonal line with two small circles on each side. The two small circles is the only reason I thought it to be something other than the moon even though it seemed odd as soon as I saw it. THinking it was the moon and clouds had just blocked my veiw I waited to see if it came back and it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Aroung 6:30 PM I caught a glint of light from the sky and looked up. In the distance I saw a usual jet liner leaving a normal contrail, traveling west to east.But looking to the left I saw that the light that attracted me was setting sun relecting off what appeared to be a large cylindrical craft with no visible wings or tail, and leaving no contrail or sound. It was very high and I couldn&#39;t see windows or markings, and it moved north to south. Not knowing the scale of the craft I can&#39;t say how high it was, but it seemed to move faster than the jet liner. I called out to my friend and he described exactly what I was seeing. He remarked that it looked like another cylinder shaped that he and I together had spotted first near Rogers, AR about 8-9 years ago and then later that same day over Eureka Springs, moving south to north. We watched the recent sighting for about five minutes and talked about it briefly, then returned to the project at hand. About an hour later I felt a strong urge to look up and again saw a craft, this time a disc, moving silently along the same north south path as the cylinder and at about the same speed. My friend confirmed my sighting and we watched it for about 5 minutes.Because I felt that this pair of sightings was important, especially with a witness, I filed an e-mail report soon after to the coordinator and producer of the annual Ozark UFO Confernce held each year in Eureka Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to leave briefly and when I returned at around sunset, my friend said that he had just spotted another disc moving along the same path as the previous one, but there were no other witnesses. He said he was in the house when he had a very strong urge to go outside, looked directly at the disc and watched it for about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had observed vultures and small birds soaring earlier when we noticed a distant object overhead inland. A short time later we noticed it made a reflection from the sun that made us curious.  From a distance it was speculated to be a glider, balloon, helicopter, or bird with shiny black feathers.  Curiousity caused us to bet a pair of small 10 X 25 binoculars, and then determined it was a disclike craft &#34;soaring&#34; in the morning sky slowy floating toward the ocean from inland in a general Northward path. We all took turns looking, and it slowly drifted over our location. As it swooped and floated much like a bird in a thermal, we could determine the top was a dark refective shiny surface, much like a lense in a refective pair of sungalsses. As it turned, it was very thin, almost flat, becoming almost invisible from the side. the bottom side looked a lot like the turbine blades in a jet engine, but they were moving slow enough to see. The underbelly was either translucent, or reflected the light from the ground on the surface beyond the &#34;turbine like&#34; blades appearing on the underside. I was able to get several shots with a digital camera but at that distance the quality was less than marginal. We attempted to get a video but the camera had a low battery and by the time we got it charged the object was out of sight. It was difficult to determine the size. As a lay person I felt it could be some unknown kind of domestic unmanned survielance craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are visiting friends here and will return to N. Carolina on 05/16/03.  I will try to download the images I have when I return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with three of the several witnesses to this event, and we found them to be unusually well eductated, eloquent, objective, and therefore, credible, individuals.

The employee provided us with the name and telephone number of the individual with whom the FAA had spoken, a CHP Officer, who had described to them his alleged sighting earlier in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spoke with the officer at length (25 minutes), and he described having witnessed a very bizarre-looking, disc-shaped object in the skies above &#34;the freeway&#34; in the vicinity of Goleta, CA.  The officer that he had witnessed the object for an estimated 30 minutes, and that he had reason to believe that several of his family members had also witnessed the same object from a different location in Santa Barbara.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The officer stated that he first thought the object might be some type of kite, but then abandoned that notion, as he continued to watch it.  The object was circular in appearance, and it was &#34;tumbling, end over end.&#34;   He was facing north, and the object was moving to the north, away from his location, probably passing over the Santa Barbara beach.  He assumed that other reports might have been submitted to the Santa Barbara Police or Sheriff, although those two offices reported that, to the best of their knowledge, no reports had been submitted to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please see sighting report from Laguna Niguell, CA, located south of Los Angeles, for same time and date.  The five witnesses there described a similar disc, which moved to the southwest over the beach there, and apparently to the northwest, in the general direction of Vandenberg AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report written by Peter Davenport, NUFORC Director.

Can&#39;t think of it as a firework as it didn&#39;t leave any sort of trail, or seemed not to be low enough to be some random fireworks. Estimated altitude was probably 2000&#39; feet or so, going a direction of south/southwest at avery high speed. Couldn&#39;t see where the light when to due to trees on the side of the road.

It moved very slowly  while overhead and appeared to hover, although that could be its appearance as it moved directly away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The feature was a large bright red light.  It approached from the west and moved slowly over head.  When it got farther east it appeared to hover, then move slightly north and then quickly move away and disappear. It diminished  like a fading red star.  IT was significantly larger to the human eye than Jupiter appeared  that night and while it was directly overhead, the red light was about the size of [an airliner at about 4000 feet altitude].  It was not possible to estimate the altitude of the object.  It was just smaller than the size of the moon that evening (about 1/2 full size moon).  The only discernable shape was the round red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unlike an airplane or helicopter to which you can tell a light is attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that it made no sound.  There was no other sound or moving aircraft in the sky at the time.   There was no other air traffic in the sky until about 2230 hrs.

Blinded by craft. 25+ minute sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer months of 2003, I was heading home traveling West bound on Highway 40 towards Hanes mall.  It was around this point that an egg shaped pod with two large spheres on either side is seen flying around 1,500 ft, at approximately 40-70mph in a South-Eastern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to follow as far as we could and figure out what this was.  Myself and my passenger kept watch on the object as it changed direction, heading towards Lexington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began making a turn, at which point we exited on Hickory Tree Rd. and parked in the Harris Teeter lot to watch as it began its turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object turned to face us directly, and flew toward our vehicle at a slow pace.  It was visible at this time for over 1 minute.  I could clearly make out an off white color, and  spheres on either side that looked from the front like insect eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying about 800 ft above ground at this point, the craft activated these spheres, which emitted a blinding flash of brilliant white light.  Both myself and passenger were blinded for what I would guess was about 10 seconds, and by this time, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up on military bases most of my life, and so I recognize very easily a military or civilian aircraft and its flight characteristics.  This was not one of them.  This may have been some kind of drone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think we even checked to see if we were missing time, but now that I think about it, it&#39;s all together possible.<n>

The suddenly it goes around the mountain to the other side and dissapears. It was super fast. It was like a white pill. It accelerated at an amazing almost impossible speed. That was all i saw. I clearly remember this moment. Everytime i tell someone they dont believe me. But other people from the same city say they have also had sightings like mine.

Normally around this time of year we get reports of this nature because of the sale of fireworks everywhere during the build up to Guy Fawkes night. Kids somehow get hold of them and can be a real pain causing all sorts of problems and sometimes fires due to misuse. We headed toward the area from the south and arrived at 03:35 approx. About a quarter of a mile before Boscastle we pulled into a small parking area opposite a tea-house on the main road. By the tea-house there is  a small gathering of houses/buildings all which were in darkness. We started to walk up the main road toward Boscastle, but after walking for five minutes my partner called my attention to the area back toward the tea-house. Above the visible horizon at the back of the tea-house we observed low level flickering of amber/white light. So we turned and headed back toward the tea-house. We then continued to walk up along side the tea-house in the direction of the lights. After passing a few more buildings the path sloped downward toward a wooded area. As we approached the the wooded area the flickering was still visible just above the outline of the treetops. We followed the path along crossing a small stream and heading further in to the woods. After about ten minutes we could see that some of  the trees ahead were being lit up by dim flashes of light so we carried on toward these trees. I think we were both expecting to find a bunch of drunk teenagers fooling around with fireworks as in years gone by but it was not the case. I was first to see what looked like round white lights moving at all kinds o! f speeds in and around the trees. We walked another ten yards or so then stopped and crouched down by a large fallen tree to asses the situation. Each ball of light was a little larger than a tennis ball and they way they flew reminded me of the way a fly does with no true path of flight, they were all over the place. I tried to count them but it was very difficult due to the speed and way they were flying but i think there must have been around 40 of them.After another ten minutes a few of the balls flew in the same direction just inches above the ground toward one end of the area in which they had been flying and seemed to join up making a larger ball of light which intensified and hovered in that one area. Looking at the ball of light i could make out 7 black specks in a circle in the center. These black specks started to rotate and the light got brighter and was too bright too look at. I looked away from the main ball and back to the flying smaller ones. Each of these had intensified also and went beserk, flying at incredible speeds in such an enclosed area. I could hear the noise of leaves being sucked into the air when they flew inches from the ground. My partner shifted his position and broke a branch on the fallen tree with his arm making a loud crack. Immediately the lights stopped and rose to tree top height and then, a few at a time quickly faded out light a headlight going off until there were none left. We heard continueous cracking of branches high up and moving away from us through the woods. I got quite unsettled and insisted that we return to the car though my partner insisted that we examine the area with our torches. In the leaves were trenches and spirals and small piles of sticks. Some areas had earth scooped out with more twigs and sticks in piles around these areas. All the while in the distance we could hear the sound of breaking branches and i was feeling really not good about being there so i shouted at my partner now was the time to leave. We returned to our car. I don&#39;t know w! hat the hell it was. Surely ufo&#39;s are big things these were tiny. We have not reported the incident and i have not even told my wife and my partner does not want to talk about it either. I don&#39;t even know why the hell i have typed all this here as i don&#39;t feel any better for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were both more of a yellow light than an average star, and were lower down in the sky. They were both moving extremely quickly and were changing direction very abruptly. They were moving unlike any vehicle on this planet. One of the lights seemed to be chasing the other around the sky but they were steadily moving in a South East to North West direction. After a few minutes the two objects moved with unbelievable speed and disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cloud-ness night and this witness was walking from the north end of his property towards his home and was looking at the night sky, viewing the northeastern part of the sky he noticed a strange, small, out of place light. As the witness watched the light, it began to grow in size, and grew in brightness by the second. Within 5 to 6 seconds the light went from being the approx: size and brightness of a star to approx: double the size of the moon. The light, or object was traveling  at a very high altitude heading toward the southwest and at this point straight over top of him, still at a high altitude. After the light/object had disappeared from the fellows sight, another strange light showed up some 5 minutes later.

I doubt that a sub-marine &#34;UFO&#34; would track your aircraft over several hundreds of miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, you may have observed a bright spot at the head of the elongate image you saw.  Is that the case, by any chance?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the added information.  We probably will post your report, but we will qualify the object as a probable non-UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> With reference to your reply,for which I thank you.The proposal that the U.F.O. was a shadow from the plane does not seem to me to be the likely cause.The reason being that the plane was at cruising altitude.At 30,000 feet,I would have been surprised that any shadow from the plane could have been discerned on the ground.Also,please bear in mind that the shadow or whatever it was ,appeared to be a very dark grey in colour as if the source of the shadow was quite close to the sea.There were no bright spots anywhere on the shadow.I fully accept that there may be a perfectly<n> <n><n> sensible explanation for all this,but as yet I do not believe that we have found it.If you enter this case on your notice board I would not blame you in the slightest if you qualified it as a probable non-U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

As I was driving along, the sun glinting off something metalic ahead of me a little above the tree line, caught my eye.  It did not seem to be any type of aircraft or anything I had ever seen before.  It was crescent shaped and skipped along horizontally to the right for about the length of two or three housetops and then receded into nothingness, much like the fin of a large fish might appear out of the water and then disappear as the fish descended deeper into the water. I remember saying to myself, &#34;What on earth was that?&#34;  I looked all around up in the sky ahead of me but could no longer see it.  Thinking about it immediately after as I was still driving, I came to the conclusion that what I saw was only part of a larger craft of some kind, perhaps a saucer or dsk, the edge of which appeared out of another dimension briefly and went back in.  I am very puzzled by this, but I saw what I saw straight ahead of me, clearly without any obstruction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

It sounded like a plane was about to crash. The person lives about 5 km away and he still heard it. I got up and ran out to the window and just up over the houses above a hill was a sort of cone or triangular shape object (I couldn&#39;t really tell because it was dark, this was the shape I saw in lights). The lights were red,White/yellow,and green. They were blinking and the object was quite large. It hovered for about 2-3 minutes and zoomed off quickly. It looked as if it were spinning so fast the colors of the lights combined. It vanished over the hills shortly after. There were several people who saw it: Mayself, My brother, a guy from school, my father and the person I was talking to on the phone could hear it. I&#39;m sure there were others as well but it only happened last night and I haven&#39;t been talking to many people who are possibly witnesses. There aren&#39;t any military bases or airports in the area. I have saw planes and helicopters in the night&#39;s sky before but there is nothing to explain the sight I saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) and I was assigned to do a followup investigation of this NUFORC sighting report&gt;  Occurred : 5/8/2003 00:45 (Entered as : 05/08/03 00:45) Reported: 5/16/2003 8:20:26 AM 08:20 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Clinton, MO Shape: Circle Duration:3-4 minutes circular object with 5 lights seen in Henry county  I reached the witness finally by phone on July 15 the after leaving two phone messages and emails that previously did not get a response back in June.  The witness, a female hospital worker/student, then apologized saying that she was busy with her wedding and honeymoon last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then discussed her NUFORC report and the specific location where she on May 8th she described her UFO encounter on Highway 13 south of Highway 2 just inside Henry County, Missouri. She was driving home from work in Warrensburg back to Clinton, Missouri after getting off her hospital shift just after midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she first observed the craft lights that she assumed was a life flight helicopter over a field to the west heading north to Warrensburg but it suddenly moved right over to the side of the highway as she drove towards it.  She said she slowed down to less than 10 mph keeping the object in view through her windshield as this craft hovered above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that the craft was hovering no higher than a large tree above the west side of the road but no trees were nearby.  The size of the craft was as big as a house but she really only saw the bottom left side of the craft perimeter.  She said that the perimeter reminded her of an octagon shape as it curved with four small yellow/white lights on the perimeter.  It had a larger nonpulsing red light in the middle underneath and she could tell of a metallic structuring at her vantage almost underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point she decided to call somebody to rationalize what she was witnessing.  She decided to use her cell phone to call her supervisor whom she new was still on duty at the hospital.  She explained to her what the craft was doing and her supervisor asked if the craft was making any noise.  So she turned off her car radio that had been on and rolled down her window but she didn&#39;t hear any noise at all.  She then kept describing the following moments to her supervisor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A yellow/white beam of light came down out from the red light shining first in the roadside grass then it moved across the road.  It was at this point she said that the craft actually began to sway slightly back and forth causing the light beam to go back and forth across the highway 5 times.  This is when she noticed an approaching car from the south as it stopped just in front of the light beam in the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then began to move back the direction it came from slowly heading over the field then it suddenly vanished like the lights all blinked out at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was still driving slowly forward in her car and drove past the stopped car with  a man in the other car looked over at her as she drove past.  She didn&#39;t stop to ask him any questions and drove on home to Clinton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason she didn&#39;t mention her sighting to anybody and had to be reminded later by her supervisor about the incident again.  Thus resulting in the delay to report it to NUFORC eight days later on May 16th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that now she keeps watching the sky and she has a camera in her car just in case something strange is possibly seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She promised to complete a questionnaire that I emailed to her that may give some more details of her encounter and return it back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group, and Bark Becker, its Director, for following up on this case, and sharing their findings.

I work the evening shift because I&#39;m in the medical technology program at Central Missouri State University and go to school during the day.  I was coming home from work after midnight like I have done for the last 4 years.  I was headed south, and from the east, I saw 2 lights approaching.   The 2 lights where up in the sky, but not too high.  So my first response was that it was lifeflight (the helicopter used to fly critically ill patients from accident scenes), but then the thing got close enough for me to see that it was not a helicopter or a plane.  This thing was really weird; So I reached for my cell phone and called my supervisor back at the hospital because I knew she would be awake and I could talk to her.  I kept thinking no way!  But this thing was right there.  It was round, but it had edges kinda like an octagon, but I could not count how many sides it had.  It was pretty big. The thing stopped on top of the high way (13), but a little to the right, so I was not directly under it, but could see it perfectly.  Now I could see that it had 4 yellow light on the outside of the body and one big red one in the middle.  The one in the middle had a beam of light coming down, but the beam was not red, it was yellow. When I say yellow, I do not mean yellow like a banana, I mean yellow like a regular light.  I slowed my car down, but I did not stop, I was scared.  My supervisor, who I was describing this to, asked me if it made any sound, and I could not hear any sound, even after rolling the window down. Then, the thing started rocking back and forth and the beam appeared to be sweapping from side to side over the highway.  It did this 5 times, then, it was still again, and it took off in the same direction that it came, first slowly, then it totally disappered.  I described the whole thing to my supervisor, we both were laughing, and I kept thinking, no way!  But it did happen.  I was not the only person wh! o saw it, there was also a car driving north, and I saw them stop too, but I did not talk to them. I kept driving home, and forgot about what I had seen.  This is what keeps freaking me out.  I forgot to tell anybody about the experience until I talked to my supervisor and she reminded me.  I think the experience was just too traumatic for me to remember.  After I was reminded, however, I remember the whole thing, I just wish I had pictures or something because I know how unbelievable my story sound.  I am an honest person, actually, I am the most honest person I know, and anyone that I have told my story to believe me because anyone who knows me knows that I would not want to be perceived as a psycho.  It happened, I hope there is an explanation to all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound as they passed. No flashing lights could be seen and they both had a very soft silver/blue glow as they glided along. During this time there was and  aircraft could be seen off to the right of them...You could see its flashing lights as it seemed to at first be moving in the same direction then went vered off to the my right from the ground.

Until now.  As my best friend and I drove along a well traveled highway I saw some lights out of the corner of my eye.  I figured it was an airplane because it was moving through the sky and it was fairly low, however there was an airport close so I thought maybe that was the cause.  I really didn&#39;t pay that much attention until my best friend asked me what it was.  I looked again and the object had come to a complete stop.  It looked to have a search light of some sort.  She stopped the car and we came a stop in the middle of the highway.  The object made no sound.  We continued to stare at the object we then decided to turn around and come back.  To turn around and drive back by the sight where we saw the object took a maximum of 45 seconds and the object was gone from sight.  If the object had been a helicopter not only could we have felt to force of the spinning propeller but when the helicopter flew off we would have seen it in the sky.  Airplanes don&#39;t hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It flew from North to South in about 30 seconds and then went out of view in the clouds. There were engine sounds trailing it.

Intrigued by how bright it was, I looked closer then noticed it was coming closer.  Then I made out a row of bright yellow lights on top with a red light on the bottom right corner and a blue light on the bottom left corner. I opened the window so I could hear what type of noise was coming from this flying craft, but didn&#39;t hear anything, but my other cat jumped up in the window and growled. It just got closer and closer until it was finally up overhead and going over me quite a distance above me (between airplane level and where a helicopter would be if it were looking for someone). It was then I heard a sound that didn&#39;t sound anything like an airplane or helicopter, but it was a familiar low-pitched sound almost like a pod in StarWars (kind of sounded like it was under water almost).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon leaving the restaurant and walking to our car we saw three dull orange lights flying in a triangular pattern in the night sky.  The craft were flying in a northern direction.  They made approximately a 130 degree turn and flew in front of the moon.  As they were in front of the moon, they could not be seen because of the moons brightness.  Once past the moon the craft continued in a southwestern direction for approximately 10 seconds.  They turned back to the northern direction they were originally headed, rotated so that they were on plan with our line of site and flew off until they could no longer be seen.  I have never seen an airplace make the turns with the speed and sharpness of these craft.  The lights were not bright pinpoints of light as is seen on an airplane, but rather dull circles of light.  The craft did not make any noise.  During this incident, which lasted for approximately 45 seconds, an airplane flew overhead in a northeastern direction  The airplane was clearly visible and could be heard easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that there were three different craft involved and not one for two reasons:  1.  The relative brightness of the lights did not change while the craft turned or rotated.  I would have expected the brightness of the lights to dim, brighten or be obscured as the relative positions of the lights on a rigid craft changed as it turned or rotated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The positions of the lights relative to each other changed, which would not happen if they were attached to a rigid body.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Luckily, I was able to sweep the telescope across the sky so as to follow this group for several minutes until it moved into trees to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was using a wide-field, low power ocular [25 X, approx. two degree field of view] on a telescope with an altazimuth mounting, so it was realtively easy to observe and track the object(s) as they moved across the sky.  I live in an urban location (Jacksonville) with a good bit of background sky glow.  In addition, this evening there was a waxing crescent moon in the sky, and some light haze and clouds, so that there is no chance that I would have noticed this phenomenon had I not been using a telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed appeared to be three, point-like lights, perhaps no brighter than fourth magnitude stars, moving together in a tight pattern that resembled a foreshortened isosceles triangle.  The long axis of the group was approximatley three quarters of a degree.  While watching the grouping of lights move across the sky in the telescope, I was impressed by the fact they seemed to move in perfect fromation, keeping the same visual aspect and reminding me of nothing so much as the three illuminated corners (running lights) of a solid, trinagualr object seen from an oblique perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously, as I followed this group of three lights in the telescope, there was no observed occultation of stars as it passed in front of them, despite the very strong visual impression (illusion?) that I was watching a dark, solid object move across the sky.  As for direction and duration, the group was moving from west to east, and traversed the distance from Cancer to the vicinity of Ursa Major (obscured by trees) in less than two minutes.  [These are actual compass directions; in a telescope&#39;s star diagonal, east and west are, of course, reversed.]  If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that I was observing a cluster (?) of satellites.  I an pretty well used to seeing individual satellites in binoculars and -- ocasionally -- in a telescope, and these objects had all of the characteristis of such.  Also, depending on their height (if they were indeed satellites), the timing of their passage relative to the location of the day-night line for my location seems to indicate that they should have been visible.  Pretty darned impressive, whatever they were!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have witnessed the three U. S.

As she drove, she noticed the white sphere was following her, and came about only 100 feet from her car. Every time she looked into her rear view mirror, she noticed the sphere was getting closer. She made it to work on time, and as she left her car to walk into the building where she worked, the sphere was still there. She noticed the sphere had a haze around it.

I&#39;m sending this in because I saw the report that was submitted  July 13 2005 and it was a bit similar to what I saw. This was late night around 1 am, my neighbor, girlfriend and my self saw the object for about 10 minutes. It was off in the distance, I&#39;d guess several miles. It appeared like a upside down teardrop and I remember a blue glow at the top and it faded to a white glow toward the bottom. It was very bright, like the light of a jet flying toward you and was about 10x the size of a jet&#39;s front light. It appeared to have either flashing lights around the middle or a series of lights sort of circling the middle. It hovered motionless for a minute or so and also made long, slow arcs or half circles like a broad smile. After what seemed like 10 minutes it slowly moved off towards the NE, which would put it moving out to sea. As it started to move off, it&#39;s view was obstructed by tree&#39;s that were close to us. It wasn&#39;t very high in the sky either. Maybe about as high as you would see helicopters. I called the police and they said they had received several calls and that 30 minutes earlier the same object had been sighted over Margate which would have been SW of our location.

Dancing means that this object maneuvered qucikly left and right, at one point appearing to backup.  As best I could tell there was no sound.  I called my wife outside and she witnessed a more subdued motion as the pulsating light moved over the house and continued northward.  The size of the object was not readily determined - close and small or far and large - but the strobascopic nature of the light reminded me of an episode on Discovery - a light powered disk (laser pulses for propulsion).  The craft however must have flown a considerable distance, even if it was small and close.  The movements were quciker than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen and the path was erratic and to the best of my knowledge beyonf the scope of any publicly known aircraft.  The fact that there were no military planes scrambled or pursuing this &#34;craft&#34; made me think that it was some sort of military machine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were about 100ft above my car, barely high enough to miss the trees. But, what got my attention was that there was no sound coming from them. I also had my windows rolled down, and if there was any sound, I would have heard it, because it was really quiet outside. They were traveling at about 200MPH. Also, the two lights were traveling in a series formation at about 150-200ft apart. Since it was dark outside I&#39;m guessing the color of the crafts body was flat-black, all we noticed was the lights, which were about 1-2ft in diameter. My mother was also observing this from the front passenger seat. This is the first encounter of ufo&#39;s we have ever witnessed. If you want my opinion I think it&#39;s some government related project, because there has already been a fighter jet that has crashed nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I always look at the stars when I smoke.  All of a sudden I see two yellow star like light moving side by side.  They moved at first like shooting stars does but all of a sudden they stayed at the same distance of one another and went rapidly to the left and then just rocket upwards and disapeared in the sky.  In all my life I have never seen such a thing.  I`ve seen shooting stars, and i`ve seen shooting stars that breaks up but this was really not shooting stars... shooting stars cannot both stay side by side and move rapidly to the left at the same distance of one another and then just go 4 times faster and rocket upwards out of range of view.  I`m schocked.... I still don`t believe this... This event as clearly proved to me that we are not alone and no scientific explanation in my books and in all my astronomical magazine explain such a thing and from what I saw that cannot be anything else then two UFO`s.  I`m sure i`m not the only one in Aylmer that saw this... probably all the people at the marina could of seen it too or anyone looking up around these parts at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate the year of his sighting, but we presume he implies 2003.

He had been drinking, I had not. We were talking when he said &#34;(my name), look at that!&#34; and I turned and in the SW corner of the horizon there were 2 VERY white VERY bright circular balls of white light. They looked about 1/4 inch big each to me, and one was slightly lower. I have no way of determining distance, and therefore their size, as I had no landmarks to go against. I slowed the car down from about 55mph to 20mph and watched the VERY bright VERY white lights stay there until we passed into a heavily forested area. My friend asked me to turn around and I did and we came back around the same bend about a minute later than when we had first seen it (there were no places to turn around) and nothing was there. We sat there for 3 - 4 minutes waiting to make sure it wasn&#39;t some kind of flashing light or an airplane, but all we saw were just the same red flashers on the water tower that was in the due south direction. There were no towers, oil well drillings or other man made objects nearby. The objects did remain stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Information about we the observers - we are both outdoorsmen who have seen most natural lights and occurances while camping (aurorea borealis, meteores, etc) and this truely disturbed us. It was the brilliance and clarity of the light that was the most disturbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I did not notice it until my dog started barking towards Black Mesa. I tried to tell get him to stop barking, but he would not. So I looked towards where he was barking and he was barking at a light that was top of Black Mesa. It seemed like it was nothing and then all the dogs in the area starting barking too. So I kept watching the light along with the dogs. Then my dad came out of the house to see why the dogs were barking. So I told him they where barking at the light over Black Mesa. It was shaped like a oval, light. The color of the light was white in the center, and around it was two other colors yellow and lite blue. The colors seemed to virbate bright and then dimed back and forth. It was floating on top of Black Mesa very slowly for about 15 to 20 minutes. It started from the east side of the mesa, going west. I did not see were it went, but it was gone. Then I just went back inside with my dad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I told my friend who was with me outside our tent, and he agreed that it wasn&#39;t a plane, because there were no blinking lights and it moved too fast for its altitude. I told my other friend inside the tent, who was changing, that we saw this thing. He poked his head out, saw the object, and said, &#34;You&#39;ve got yourself a damn UFO.&#34; The object moved across the sky above our heads and we lost sight of it from the trees a few minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

i cannot remember what colors the planes were, offhand.i was trying to ignore them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as i said my friend was teeing off,i look up. i see a dark cloud approaching at a speed i&#39;ll relate to in time format.it appeared to be about a mile away when i noticed it. in the time it took for my freind to hit his ball,watch it land, and comment that he hit his further.it was directly in front of us.the distance is hard to estimate against the backdrop of a clear blue sky that goes ? how far until it meets the horizon.i&#39;ll guess it was about 300 ft up off the ground and 1/4 mile out ahead of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was the size of a large two story house.it started out like i mentioned as a dark cloud.more like smoke looking.i work on diesel trucks,some you start up and smoke rolls out that looks dark grey with hint of white in it.this had that appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i say to my friend.&#34;look at that cloud.it&#39;s not moving&#34;.he said,&#34; that&#39;s just some smoke or something.&#34;i watched it come from over that way &#34;,i said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he tells me to play the game. i watch more as i walk towards my ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i stopped playing and just watch.he walks toward his ball, looks at me kind of irritated.yet he starts watching to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the smoke had seemed to get less obvious.it became sort of transparent like you could see more of the blue sky through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am awestruck.i am just asking him.don&#39;t you see that? it&#39;s not smoke. i just keep asking him this. i suddenly see a small perfect rectangle in the sky.and directly off to the right the &#34;smoke was somewhat visible still.but oddly it had became a burnt orange color.fading from a see through grayish color to this orangish color. i began raising my voice some because of the small rectangle opening, my friend notices more the color changing area off to the right.i see what i thought was a bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so i point up ,because he could not really distinguish the rectangle opening.mind you, my story is becoming longer,like this was a great span of time.but actually only about a minute has passed .so we are kind of a little in disbelief that we are seeing something ufo-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i point to the bird object and tell him to look close.he half leans towards me to follow where my finger is pointing. and he kind of stretches his neck forward as you do while straining to look at something far away.then the &#34;bird dissapeared into the rectangle opening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i don&#39;t know that he fully can swear ,like me, on seeing the opening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then the opening was gone.immediately the orange color to the right appeared off and on for about a half second at a time.shimmering is how i&#39;ll describe it.there was no more grey/white smoke at this time.it was large orange object then the blue sky behind it.back and forth.this happened for about 6 seconds. then the sun reflected off of an object.my friend really lit up.at first he was passing it off as smoke,non caring at all.we all know any ufo sitings are generally at night.and i have never seen any unexplained anything.so i was unsure it was anything either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> he exclaimed&#34;wow.thats a big parachute&#34; it looked like material of a parachute or a hot air balloon.the sun suddenly reflected off of the object for about 4 seconds.the best way to describe it.s shape is the size and shape of the large sail on a pirate ship.as if we were veiwing it not from the front,as to see its full width,more as if you wear looking at a boat sail from the side. it dissapeared again.shimmered 2 more very brief times.then the smoke gradually appeared,but less visible this time.and it slowly moved away for about 10 seconds and the smoke gradually dissapeared in about 30 seconds,we saw no more.meanwhile the planes are still buzzing the general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have thought about this near every day.i have told about three people in my family,because they had told me of some things they had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my sighting of this object,i have been trying to compare with other sightings but to no avail.my friend is non believing in anything he has no immediate answer for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have been trying to find any other ufo story similiar to mine to try and figure out more what i saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i&#39;m leaning more towards a government type of project.due to the show i have seen on invisible clothing on tech tv.and the new 007 movie with the invisible car.because the object had same type of appearance about it. in both of these instances,cameras projected images gathered from surrounding area of object and project it onto the item to make it appear invisible..also the movie with eddie murphy and the olsen guy.where the bad guys were selling the top secret jet that was invisible,for transporting the nuclear weapons.a chamealion type of cloaking device.i realize these are movie tricks.but to describe the appearance of what i saw in real life.i&#39;ll use those movies to create a visual for you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that is it.i hope to read some accounts from others who may help shed a light on this sighting i had,of an unidentifiable flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I live in Palm Springs near the airport. Last summer while out for an afternoon walk, I glanced at the sky and saw a group of at least 50 silver spheres slowly moving across the valley from the southeast toward the northwest. At first I thought they were birds but they were spread out in strings and groupings. Some would break away and then circle back. I watched until I could no longer see them and decided they must be mylar balloons that had broken loose and were floating on the air current. Two weeks ago at work near College of the Desert, I looked up and saw the same objects - maybe 20 or 30 traveling in the same direction as before. I watched as they slowly moved across the sky and observed that some seemed to be tethered together in a line which would make a circle and then open up again. They were all in a group but very stretched out. Today while getting my mail, I looked up and saw them again. At first only one, then briefly a very small group clustered together. This group turned in unison, flashed in the sun, and disappeared. Birds, I thought. Just then a commercial jet which had just taken off proceeded from west to east. A single small, very silver orb paced the plane at exactly the same speed at what seemed to be 100 yards distance from the right wing. Definitely not a bird. I watched as it paced the plane for approximately one minute. The plane headed northeast and the sphere then went east and I lost it. I looked again before entering my house and spotted it due east about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was still and looked like a bright star. I watched it for another minute and then went inside. I am curious as to what is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have dropped a glowing white object into a nearby field, and Immediatley took off. After it was gone, the buzzing ceased. I went to try and find the glowing object in the nearby field and I only found a dent in the ground. The Dent was not a hole.

It was a small cigar shaped object that from where I was it was moving south in the early morning.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and it moved slowly as it passed overhead.

The time was around 3:30 am. The pasture has several horses on it but i could not see them at the time because i think they were up at the other end. After i had been out there for about 10 minutes i began to hear the horses at the other end. It sounded like they were kicking the sheet metal and squealing loudly. I stood up to see if i could look down to the end of the pasture to see what was causing the horses trouble. I could also hear dogs barking in the distance, it sounded like hundreds of them. Just as i was straining to see the horse shelter at the other end, horse and dogs quieted and became silent, no movement, sounds, or anything. It was more quiet than before all the commotion. I started to get a scared burning feeling in my chest and felt the hairs on the back of my neck tingle. after maybe a few seconds of the erie quiet i heard a whirring sound,it was real low and deep, and not loud. I stepped off the porch and i saw a light flash on the ground in the middle of the pasture. i looked up and about a hundred feet off the ground was a black craft hovering and shooting flashes of light at the ground from a pod on the right end of the craft. The craft had a multicolored mist or hot looking gas on the bottom of it. on the left side of the craft was what looked to be a rectangular red window. I thought it was a window because i thought i saw movement inside of it. After i saw movement i began to feel sick. The craft looked about 50 feet long with a dull blue light on the top. after about five minutes passed the whirring sound faded and the craft hovered silent for about 2 seconds and then zipped straight up with no sound. with in one second it went so high and fast looked like a star then it curved north and the light went out. I did not even notice that the power was off in the neighborhood until i saw it come back on after the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in the security field and have no intrest in making anything out of this. I do not want to be contacted. I hope this report helps in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother and I had just seen X-men 2 at the cinema. We were driving on a highway and there was a policecar with lights coming from the sidelane. Therefore I changed lanes and had to look in my rearview mirror. But on the rightside, looking past the mirror, through my windowshield I saw two red lights(in a horizontal line), crossing the highway from the east to the southwest. I did not think much of it at first but a second later there was a third light, which was going on and of in a white/green flash. That is when I realized the craft had a triangler shape. I shouted to my brother that there was a UFO. We got all excited and we could not believe our eyes. We thought we were kidding ourselves as we had just seen X-men 2. The craft hoovered over the highway from the east to the west. The red lights were not flashing therefore we knew it was not a helicopter. It hung over and open field for a while (a minute or so) and than sped off. I got off the highway and started following it. My brother rang my dad on the cellphone and my dad said that the camera was still in the booth of the car. I stopped the car and got the camera out. By the time my brother was recording it, it was already far away. On the recording, which is 20 seconds, you can only see one red light as a dot in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew it had to be a UFO because of the shape of it. It was a bit like a helicopter but it could not have been, because it was flying at such a height that a helicopter would have looked bigger, and there was no sound coming from the aircraft. It is amazing that not more people saw the object, because there were more cars (I think three more) that could have seen the thing. Amazing!<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need and explanation?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am actually writing this on behalf of my sister.  I almost feel somewhat stupid repeating this story.  I was surfing the web trying to research what my sister and her friends described they saw to me.  That is how I came across this website.  O.k. well a couple of nights ago, my sister&#39;s friend had a bonfire party out at her house out in the country.  There were approximately 15-20 kids there.  They set up the bonfire in between the house and an adjacent field.  The party winded down at around 2:45 in the morning.  My sister who is 17, her friend E who is 17 also, and E&#39;s older sister A, who is 19, started to clean up.  They drove their mom&#39;s van down to the fire, and loaded some chairs into it and brought it up to the shed.  They unloaded those, and shortly before getting into the van, my sister looked up toward the house and saw a figure standing  a little off the drive-way by the house.  She motioned to E to look at it.  E asked my sister if that was Justin? a kid that had been at the party?  They knew they were the only three left, so they got creeped out and hopped into the van.  Once in the van, they looked back up towards the house, and the figure was gone.  My sister described it as appearing to look like maybe it was a man, and it had lighter colored, or white clothing on.  Once the van was started, they all convinced eachother, that the figure or person, was probably E&#39;s dad just checking up on them.  They then headed back down towards the fire to resume cleaning.  By this time it is approximatley 3:20 a.m.  They headed up over the drive-way and into the grass, and down the hill towards the fire, which was still burning.  E had her brights on and my sister was somewhat looking at the floor, when she heard A say, What the Hell is that?  My sister looked up and saw what she describes as &#34;frozen things.&#34;  Figures or creatures or something in two seperate rows.  She says maybe fifteen in each row, and 30 in all.  She said they were approximately three feet to four feet tall.  And! she said they were about fifteen feet away from them, directly in front of the car.  She describes them as having a Christmas light head, and that the heads were connected to the body but she couldn&#39;t see how.  She says their arms were up, but she couldn&#39;t see hands.  She says they were stick like.  Stick people she says, dark grey or brown in color.  They didn&#39;t move.  Not at all she says.  She says they were just frozen in these two seperate rows.  (Crazy, this is what I would lable this freekin story) My sister immediatley began to cry, and then both girls screamed for E to get the car moving.  She peeled out and they headed to town.  Now what they did next doesn&#39;t really matter.  I kind of wish they would have come got me, but instead they drove around trying to think of things that the &#34;things&#34; could have been.  Deer, Trees, Goats, Sheep, Bushes, but they knew that those weren&#39;t it.  The girls drove around for a little over two hours until they finally got enough courage to go back.  Mostly because the sun started to come out.  They went back to the spot where they saw them, and there was nothing there.  My sister came home that morning and told us the story.  Now, I honestly don&#39;t believe in this ((deleted)).  I don&#39;t believe in ghosts, I don&#39;t believe in aliens, or hell, or anything that can&#39;t be proven.  So, I am looking for some logical answers.  She is telling the truth.  She hasn&#39;t been able to sleep, or eat, and when she told us what happened she could barley finsh the story because she was fighting back tears.  To say that she was shaken up is an understatement.  I am fucking pissed that this has happened to her, because she has finals over the next three weeks, and she can&#39;t sleep let alone concentrate.  Does this make any sense, what I am saying.  Like I said, I am looking for logical answers.  I am not leaving my name, or her name, or any ones name.  Because I don&#39;t want her labled as that &#34;crazy girl.&#34; It seems like the only people that ever see these things are the crazy redneck familys that ! live in a trailor park, and are ((deleted)) uneducated and just plain retarded.  So I guess that is why I don&#39;t want her name to be in this.  I don&#39;t know how to end this novel that I have written, but I guess I would like your oppinion on what we have here.  Please get back to me.  Have I described something that has been seen before?  Has there been other reports of anything like this in Illinois?  Please let me know.  For the record I am not crazy, nor is she.  Thank You<n>

It was moving in a southwest direction. As it reached the middle of the sky, it turned on a bright white light, which illuminated for miles. The light approximately lasted for 10 seconds, and it was instantly shut off. At this time, the craft started it&#39;s ascent at a very high rate of speed and disappeared among the stars in the sky. I have seen this happen approximately 3 times in the last 2 years. Keep watching the skys.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night sky was clear. I stepped out of the back door of the house and observed a circular blue-white light about 3&#34; in diameter at arms length coming from the north heading toward the southeast at approx. satelite speed. When I first saw the object it was about 20 degrees elevation in the north. The object became gradually smaller as it proceeded across the sky until in the southeastern sky at about 70 degrees elevation it instantly returned to a 3&#34; size at arms length again and shot off at a high rate of speed along the same trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this date and time.

It was flashing consistently and sitting in one spot. I told my mother to stop the car as we were on a back road that had little traffic. I rolled down my window and looked the red light. We noticed that it would move south horizontally in little spurts, but mostly stayed in one spot. We drove home and I walked out into the road to see if we could see it from there. I could just see it over the roof of a house, and my mom was standing a bit farther over and she was watching it as well with no obstruction. I noticed the light drop down a bit, beyond my view, and I thought I had slouched or something, so I stood up a bit straighter, but the light dropped down again. I moved over to where my mom was standing, and we observed it clearly. It was staying in one place again. My mother went to go unlock the door of the house, so I was left alone to watch it. Suddenly a bright flash of light came from about the same place I&#39;d initially seen the red light when we were driving. My mom had noticed the flash, and she said it looked like a plane, but it didn&#39;t happen again until a few seconds later, closer to the (then)current location of the red light. The white flash didn&#39;t happen again while I was observing the sky. I looked back at the red light and I saw that it had faded a bit, and the flashing wasn&#39;t as brilliant. At this time, I went inside, so I&#39;m not sure if it remained there, or if the white flash happened again after I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and she seemed quite lucid, and credible, to us.  Her description of the lights she witnessed did not seem to us to be consistent with the erratic strobe pattern of a typical helicopter.  PD))<n>

I looked up and said something like &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; A triangular craft was moving across the sky above us at an altitude similar to airplanes in this part of the city (near Boeing field, not far from SeaTac Airport). It had a light at each of the points that was a dim orange and the lights seemed striped rather than solid. The craft was completely silent. We watched it fly in a northeasterly direction until it encountered the city light reflection in the sky and we could no longer see it. Our dog had been in our front yard while we were away for about four hours. When we got inside, we realized that he was trembling and then he became lethargic and lost his balance. He seems to have regained his balance and some of his energy this next morning after the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and she seemed to us to be an exceptionally reliable witness.

He hasn&#39;t filled out a report yet. I have done an MS Paint document of his recollection of the wing that I am attaching. Again, it is my re-draw of a small sketch he made as he was running out the door. I recall big, round lights, while he recalls trapezium-shaped lights and wings. I recall the round lights, as I said, and drew the wings as round, although I&#39;m not sure they too were. They were definitely not pointed, we both recall (the corners were blunt or rounded).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on the aircraft other than the three point lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We think the aircraft was black, but the sky was very dark. We could see the outline of the aircraft clearly. It appeared to be much lower than cruising altitude and appeared large compared to the stars, but not noticeably larger than any aircraft I am aware of (in other words, its size did not stand out). We live close to Boeing field and somewhat near the approach to SeaTac, so we have become accustomed to the altitudes planes are typically at as they pass by our home, whether taking off or landing.  Thank you. -((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the lights, they were not blinking. They were a dim orange. The stars were white and extremely bright compared to the three lights on the aircraft. They were noticeably dimmer and more matte, if that word makes sense in this context. It was kind of a glow, but without illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDA))<n>

I made a call to someone in Snohomish County. The phone rang about 5 times when a voice came on and said &#34;there is no mourning for a world that is weeping&#34;. The phone was still ringing. Then the canned operator voice came in and said &#34;there is no answer, for 75 cents we will try your call, etc&#34;. And the phone continued to ring. I thought, &#34;maybe this person incorporated rings on to his answering machine and put used the phone company message in it&#34;. I hung up and called the number again  and but there was no answer. I called my son and told him and also my brother who was here at the time about the bizarre incident. The voice was clear and professional sounding. It actually made me a bit edgy to think someone had tapped into my phone line. I went right to bed and within 5 minutes, my dog who was in the living room, started to bark at something. I got back up went into the living room while he was barking at something toward Puget Sound. I live across the street from the beach. I waited for about 10 minutes watching but could see no one. He would not leave the window. I called the people in Snohomish again on Friday and they told me what their answering machine message said and it was nothing like the above. I will await my phone bill to see what shows up as this was a long distance call. I am the MUFON State Director for Western Washington and tend to try to find logic in all our cases. I am not sure what was going on that night but I do trust my animals when they sense something out of the ordinary.

The aim of the photograph was to capture the sunset, and on the second picture I asked my partner to stand in the foreground. At the time I noticed nothing unusual in the sky, but when the photographs were developed, there was a strange spere-like object on the one photograph. At the time (and still) the object intrigued us, and no one we have shown the photograph to is able to make out what it could be. The picture was taken with a digital camera, and we have saved the image on CD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The place where the photographs were taken is on a farm situated in game park with a very large lake, and in the vicinity there are very few houses, or other buildings and even lighting in the area is virtually non existant. It is an area where electrical thunderstorms regularly occure, although not at the time the photograph was taken.  Again as said before the object continues to intrigue us, and we are curious as to whether you are able to help us with our query whether this could perhaps be a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a blueish green luminous shaft of light emitted from the center of the cylinder&#39;s bottom, almost like a flourescent plasma. The upper half of the craft had a large clear window and had two male humanoid occupants in brown military like uniforms observing me from about 75 feet away.  I got excited and wanted to share the sighting with someone and went to the business downstairs and found the store owner.  We went outside and the craft had moved down the powerline a few hundred yards and was a small, not identifiable speck.  Skeptical, he suggested that my sighting might have been a helicoptor.  It clearly was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Details - provide all the minor/major details  I was looking out the window of my 5th floor room in the Ashland Plaza hotel at a developing lightning storm to the right. My room faced the river. I am not sure of the orientation but that would be easy enough to determine  from a map of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an object about the size of a small car floating in the air over the river – I’m not sure of the altitude, but it was a little less than twice as high as the bridge, at least from my perspective. It was moving to the left, in the direction of the wind, as I could tell from the flag in front of the courthouse across the street.  Although the wind was stiff, the object moved slowly in a controlled and deliberate manner, without the vagrant, flapping, unstable motion of, say, a plastic bag. Apparently, it made no sound. However, this hotel has windows that can&#39;t be opened, so that may not be verifiable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was black and roughly triangular in shape. It was either changing shape in motion or rolling somehow.  I thought it was a kite or a paraglider someone was flying off the back of a boat, as it was following the course of the river. That theory was shattered when it continued over the bridge. Shortly afterwards, it deviated away from the river, and me, and dwindled away to an invisible speck in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not claiming this was an aircraft or anything else, BTW. It was an UFO at least as far as I’m concerned, if only for the simple fact that I could’nt identify it. Perhaps there were other witnesses or an explanation of some kind. If so, I’d like to know.<n>

This was shocking to me! I pulled over and got out of the car. It hung in the sky in exactly the same position relative to my car!

(THERE WAS NO DRINKING AT THE PARTY... EVERYONE WAS SOBER)  There was a light wind, but not too strong.  We were sitting on the hood of my car, Nick&#39;s girfriend just went inside.  We wern&#39;t looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and  all other stuff was utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  (JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE IMAGE YOU HAVE FLYING OVER THE OUTLINE OF MISSOURI) It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  it flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slow.  It made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time. It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horzion  until we couln&#39;t tell the difference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning,  it didn&#39;t actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB)  Nick and I both talked about it for a while.  We both  thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn&#39;t a bomber. I figure it was roughly the size of a 747.  It was pretty big.  That was what was so impressive about it. We know what we saw.  I haven&#39;t talked to Nick in a year, but i&#39;m sure i could get a hold of him.  If you want any more information, i&#39;d be glad to give it to you.  I told my parents and some friends about it, but it wasn&#39;t until i saw a your logo (MIG) that I thought someone would believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
