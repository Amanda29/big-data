As I looked to the east, I could see the lights of landing aircraft all in a row for O&#39;Hare Airport in Chicago. Slightly to the right of the landing pattern was an orange colored light just hovering. I stopped to watch it because it was a different color from the landing planes. It seemed to be fixed in the air, no movement. As I watched for about a minute, the orange light shot up, stopped for about a half second and then shot to the right and out of sight in less than 2 seconds time.<n>
10/31/74 07:00|Rockford|IL|Light|5 seconds|Bright white light, very fast, no sound or sonic boom, impossible maneuvers, too fast for aircraft|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33375.html|2|ndxe197410| Bright white light, very fast, no sound or sonic boom, impossible maneuvers, too fast for aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in my early teens I was walking down a street in our neighborhood with one of my friends. This was on October 31, 1973 or 74&#39;, Halloween night. Younger kids were Trick-Or Treating that night. When we turned down a street that headed West, I had the feeling that if I looked left, to the South, that I would see something interesting. I have the definite feeling that I somehow anticipated what we would see. I then saw a very bright light moving in the sky from East to West. It appeared to be disk or spherically shaped. I knew something of astronomy at that time and about the appearance of the planets. It was brighter than Jupiter and probably as bright and as large as the planet Venus. It was a bright white light which had the appearance of a planet, not a star. It did not &#34;twinkle&#34; like a star. It moved very fast from East to West but not at all as fast as a meteor but much faster than any aircraft could possibly move. There was no sound or sonic boom. As a very fast (approx. 30 mph) wind was blowing from East to West that night (this could be used to pinpoint the exact year of this sighting) I wondered, for an instant, if it could be an aircraft in the jetstream. The speed it was travelling made it appear that it could go from horizon to horizon in perhaps just 10 seconds or so. After watching it cross at least 25% of the sky, we were amazed to see it start making 90 degree turns as if it were tracing the outline of a series of steps. it made about 3 of these imaginary &#34;steps&#34; and just blinked out. At that moment I was sure that whatever we had just seen, it was not an aircraft, meteor, bolide or any known object. Upon thinking about it later, I decided that the high wind conditions would also rule out any kind of optical illusion caused by a &#34;temperature inversion layer&#34;. The memory of this has stayed with me for the past 30 or so years. This object left no trail in the sky of any kind. It was a circular light with clear &#34;edges&#34;. approx. planet sized (in appearance). It appear! ed to be a considerable distance away like a distant aircraft would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We had just set up camp when I noticed what appeared to be 5 round lights at the canyon rim, approx. 1/4 mile directly above us. I told my wife it looked like we had some &#34;spotlighters&#34; up there, and grabgbed my binoculars.  I was surprised that I could only see round lighted objects, no vehicle.  At that point two of these lights slowly moved above us and the other three slowly began to &#34;float toward us just above the juniper/pinion trees.  We jumped into the truck and headed up the only way out just as the objects were to the camp site.  When we reached the rim of the canyon we could see many objects that seemed to &#34;vibrate&#34; as they moved just above the ground, around and over trees and the landscape.  They appeared to have two sections, the bottom green, the top red, and had a white tube like section that hung from the bottom.  (like a vacumn hose) Over the next approx. 5 miles we observed approx 50 of  these.  We came to a building that looked to be used only seasonally for cattle or the bean field workers and pulled up to see if anyone was there.  I honked my horn and was starting to open my door when the windows of the bldg began to glow red.  We took off again for the paved road, not stopping to see if there was anyone at a couple of other ranch houses we saw on the way in.  As we approached the paved road, we could see a glowing red object just off the side of the road on my side.  We passed it and stopped.  I got my binoculars out and told my wife to shine the  spotlight on it.  When the light hit the object it sort of &#34;exploded&#34; and the main peice flew past my window.  We were just sitting there wondering what was going on when my wife said a car was coming behind us.  Very soon we knew it was far too bright to be auto lights.  As I turned around and put the truck in gear my wife started to scream as we took off.  I looked in the rear view mirror to see a round, very bright object, approx 30&#39; in diameter, above an be! hind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 10 miles it would drop back and then instantly be right behind us several times.  I was going 80-90 mph down this narrow country road. We turned onto hwy 666 and headed towards Monticello, about 12 miles away.  The object stayed with us until we were close to the highway patrol truck station outside of town.  I skidded to a stop in front of the station and ran inside to tell them what had happened.  They said they were having a hard time believing what I was saying but that a trucker had a very similiar story only a week before.  They had decided that it must have been a helicopter, possibly with a flame thrower of some type, because paint was burned on the truck trailer and the trucker opened his window tolook and had recieved minor burns  and hair burned off.  I offered to take any test they wanted to prove I was not under the influence but they declined.  I asked them to go with us to see for themselves and because  we had left all of our gear where we were camped.  They called the sherrif dept. and the sherrif, highway patrol and my truck headed back there.  As you might expect, there was nothing there.  Not one light.....nothing out of the ordinary.  What could I say ?  I asked them to stay up on the rim of the canyon long enough for me to retrive my gear.  As we were throwing it into the truck, we could see them leaving.  We drove up and out of the canyon and decided to find somewhere near the highway patrol station to get some sleep.  The next day, around 10 am, we awoke, sitting up in the front of my truck, at the rim of the canyon where we first saw the lights. Neither of us remembered driving back to this spot. I asked my wife if she saw the big eyed deer that was looking in the windows of the truck at us. She did not.  For two years my brother and I went back there several times and saw many of the same small luminous balls that seemed to follow us everywhere while we were in that area.  After that we saw nothing out of the ordinary for several years that we returned to the area! .  I hav en&#39;t been there for 10 years.<n>

This one night all of us (5) for one very brief moment in time. Saw 13 small white lights flying in a triangle pattern, zig-zaging across the sky. As they moved from horizon to horizon across the sky. Less than 5 seconds. These lights never broke formation. These lights where traveling at a very high rate of speed. I would estimate that these lights where at least 50,000 feet in the air. The speed of these lights, plus the hard, sharp turns of the zig-zag formation. Truly convinces me, that what we saw that night. Was not part of this earth. I know this could be easily passed off as kids with over active imaginations. But, we truly saw something that night. A few years latter. I came across a picture of what we saw. This UFO book described it as the &#34;Lubbock Lights&#34; I showed this picture to my buddies. We all agreed that this is what we saw.<n>

It left an indelible impression on me.   I know that it occurred at night over Houston, TX between 1973-1974.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were attending a men’s flag football league game at Memorial Park.  My husband was one of the coaches.  I was seated in a lawn chair watching the game.   I saw what I thought was an airplane crossing the sky, but it suddenly came to a full stop.   I mentioned it to the lady sitting next to me.   She said she had binoculars in the car and would get them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw through her binoculars (and other people there, too) was actually not just one light, but a string of lights.  I do not recall the exact number of lights in a row that I saw, maybe 5-7.  They were close together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was getting exasperated, as the football players all wanted to watch the object through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched this object, it appeared to be turning slowly in various directions.   The string of lights would change into a narrow oval, gradually expanding until it became a full circle of lights.   It kept hovering for approximately 45 minutes, continually changing shape from a string of lights, to an oval, and to a full circle, the reversing the direction of turning.   It even turned so that it was completely vertical, with what looked like flares coming from each light, yet it appeared totally stationary in the sky.   There were no colored lights, just bright white ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, the object ascended in a southwestly direction and was gone within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At the so|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05646.html|7|ndxe197410| The Santa Clara Valley is bordered on the east by the Hamilton mountain range, and on the west by Santa Cruz mountain range.  At the southwest corner of the valley, in the Santa Cruz range, sits Mt. Umnum.  Mt. Umnum was the sight of a very large and powerful US Air Force radar station. One clear cold autumn morning, I was sitting in my car, at the foot of Mt. Umnum, waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive, so we could begin our job of landscaping a new housing tract.  As the sun slowly began to ascend over the Hamilton range to the east, turning the sky above the still shadowy valley a bright blue, I noticed what appeared to be a morning star, or lingering planet above the fog enshrouded peak of Mt. Umnum.  As my gaze lingered upon the brightly shining object, I noticed that it appeared to be oscillating back and forth ever so slightly.   This immediately grabbed my attention, and as I now gazed intently at the object; it began to grow brighter, and appeared to get larger as it continued to oscillate ever so slightly. this process continued for about 2-3 minutes until the brightly shining object descended to the same altitude as the fog enshrouded radar station, and hovered there, still visible, about a half mile away from the station.  It hovered in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, at which point it changed direction and headed directly for the radar station.  As it entered the fog bank, it literally burned a hole in the mist.  This hole lasted for several seconds before finally converging in on itself. This sighting leads me to believe that this particular fireball may have been of U.S. military origin, as the radar station was supposed to have a landing strip in it&#39;s proximity. The radar station has since been decommissioned.<n>

We were approximately one mile out of town from Hopkinsville and had come to the end of the Concord Lane.  You had to turn either left or right onto the Greenville Road.  As we both looked to the right toward town we saw three saucer shaped craft several hunderd feet in the air and looked as if they were between a quarter to a half mile from us.  The craft had multicolored lights on the underneath side that sequentially flashed.  The sighting scared both of us of course, and I instinctively turned left and continued heading out of town. We were both looking back to see what the craft were doing and noticed they appeared to be following us.  About a quarter of a mile down the Greenville Road was a secondary road.  We turned right onto the Antioch Road and noticed that all three craft were still following us.  Approximately one to two miles out this road was a small lake.  As we started rounding the curve that bordered lake Tandy, we saw all three craft hovering above the lake and the craft in the center of the three, had flames coming from the center of it&#39;s underneath side.  I immediately turned in a driveway that was just past the curve in order to turn around.  My wife says the next thing she remembered was being back on the Concord Lane heading toward our apartment.  But I honestly don&#39;t remember anything from the point in time I turned in the drive to turn around, untill I was actually getting out of the car back at the apartment at which time we noted the time being 4:00 A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As we were flying south, I was looking out the window to the west, and saw what I first thought was Venus, but then I realized that there were clouds passing behind it, and it seemed to be moving at basically the same pace as our jet.  So I assumed it must be another plane.  But as I studied it, I realized that it was too bright to be a plane, and there were not the typical blinking green and red wing lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was, it began to pulse.  Not blink, but pulse, at first slowly and then faster and faster.  As it began to pulse very quickly, it suddenly shot straight up, not at a curve, but a 90 degree ascent, and was gone in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was, but it defied all the law of physics as we know them today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I had driven home from my job in Cleveland to my residence in extreme eastern Medina County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After driving in my wife came out to meet me.  This was extremely unusual.  In a concerned manner she said what is that.  I have been hearing impaired for many years and wear at least one hearing aid.  I concentrated and it seemed like every animal or bird was making noises.  Our neighbor had horses that were acting up.  The next neighbor had chickens that were belting out and our cats were agitated.  I had no idea what had them spooked and said I was no farmer and was dinner ready.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went in and I had dinner.  Our home at that time was what could be called a by-level or raised ranch.  After dinner about 30 minutes latter I perched in front of the TV which was located in front a large window facing out to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I cannot remember the exact date I recall  watching the evening news with Walter Cronkite that evening.  My wife was sitting on the couch also viewing the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up from the TV and saw off in the distance two blinking lights about 30 feet apart of which one was red and I think the other was blue. I  thought  it was a small plane making an emergency landing and was concerned that the site was not level and had a lot of trees and a large pond.  When the two blinking light arrived at the pond they both disappeared.  Approximately 30 seconds elapsed from first seeing the lights till they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 20 seconds passed and then the big surprise.  Down our two hundred foot driveway and perhaps another 75 feet hovering silently about 100 feet above an oval craft that glowed at first dark red then light red, pink, orange, yellow and then a bright white like a fluorescent light.  As the whole object glowed it was not possible to make out any detail.  The craft pulsated all this time like it was building up pressure to take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and myself had come down the stairs and were viewing the event from the front stoop of our home.  We both felt very tranquil and had no fear.  I would have given anything to go and satisfy my curiosity.  As a matter of fact it will be my first question when I reach the here after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Viewing the craft was about a minute.  I had the feeling that it just shot upward at blinding speed, however, it could have just disappeared with some other technology.   After the event the animal sounds subsided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We learned a few days latter that a neighbor across the street had also seen the unusual event.  Other reports were made as we learned it was reported in the Akron Beacon Journal and other media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could something been exploring our earthly world and the animals with their superior hearing know it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She and her aunt went out to the Denney&#39;s nearby for dinner. Mother said that everyone in the parking lot ust kind of all looked at the same time at some trees in a nearby (field, I&#39;m guessing). Over the trees there was a silvery cigar shaped craft.She said &#34;It looked like an airplane with no wings or tail, I could see the lit up windows and everything.&#34; My great aunt refuses to talk about it to this day. The reason I&#39;ve sent in a 26 year old report is that I am trying to figure out how many people, other than those in the Denney&#39;s parking lot, saw this craft on that date. I am not at all sure of the date, but am certain of the year, the story and the locality.<n>

Orb flew away in arc less than 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In our bedroom on the 13th floor of our apartment building, I was getting ready for bed, when my husband called me urgently.  I hurried to finish putting on my PJ&#39;s and ran to find him on the balcony looking South West over the city of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.  He didn&#39;t have to tell me anything about what was urgent … without words we looked at a silent huge hovering brilliant tangerine orange ball radiating orange light … I would guess about 500 feet above the ground and about 1 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb had been sitting there for a while before I got to the balconey and I saw it for about 20-30 seconds.  It seemed like a long time.  It was not moving or changing in anyway.  So I had quite some time to make observations.  The entire object was the same bright colour.  As it was so close to the ground the orange light lit up the tops of all the house roofs and the sides of the apartment buildings.  Even though it was almost bright as day … I  could still see the streetlights lights, with their white bulbs radiating whiter light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slowly at first I could see the ball going higher and getting smaller for about a second then in a split second later it moved in an arc to the Northwest, turned into a dot and disappeared.  The path was very smooth not stop and go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my Dad about it next day and as a scientist he felt it must be a natural weather occurrence.  I did not argue with him but ihe made it clear that I should not make a fuss and report this.  We listened to all of the news reports the next day and nothing was reported.  I found this silence from everyone to be extraordinarily odd but I guess people did not want to be called &#34;nuts&#34;.<n>

Being a private pilot and former USAAf/USAF aircraft mechanic, I know what conventional and military aircraft look like because as such we pilots can&#39;t help looking up when we hear an aircraft. I would just like to add that this was not the first nor the last time I have seen strange objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked out over what was a large field at that time in the direction of the Fulton water tower.  It is a very large and distinctive tower and was about a quarter mile from my location.  It was still daytime, but clear and cold.  I saw a diamond shaped light in the sky off to the east.  I saw it go behind ther water tower, and slowly travel in a southerly direction.  It oscillated in a golden orange color.  I have never forgoten that incident.  I have told some close friends, but never my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/10/74 23:00|Hudson|KS|Light|One hour?|The light chased us.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38195.html|18|ndxe197410| The light chased us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a winter night in maybe the year 1973 or 74. There where four of us boy&#39;s out coon hunting in a group of tree&#39;s that has a boy scout camp in it call Camp Boonee. There was four of us hunting that night Ed, his younger brother Mike and Randy and myself we had I think 3 or 4 coondog&#39;s with us and where just getting into the hunt. We had ran the dog threw the wood&#39;s of Camp Boonee and where going to cross Hudson Rd and go to the east side of the road to another small group of tree&#39;s to hunt a bit. It was when we got some twenty to thirty feet to the edge of the road when a very bright white light came on up in the sky somewhere just above the tree top&#39;s. It was very bright and lit up the ground and the tree&#39;s cast shadow&#39;s on the ground and if you look right at the light it would hurt you&#39;r eye&#39;s to do so. Well this scared us all and we ran a way&#39;s westward back into the thicker part of the tree&#39;s for cover and when we did so the light went out. We all stoped in a group and where looking around to see where the light might of gone but could&#39;nt see it anymore. So we all continued west with the ideal of coming out on the west side of the tree&#39;s and then circle back to the east along the north side and come back to Hudson Rd then head back north on the road and go back to Hudson and go home. But as we got close to the west side of the tree&#39;s the light again came on above and in front of where we where, scaring us again and we all ran back into the thicker part of the tree&#39;s for cover once again. And while we all where running for cover the light went out and when we stop in the center of the tree&#39;s to take a look around we could&#39;nt see it. So we all just crouched down and waited a while looking and listening, trying to figure out where the light had gone. It was while we where all crouched down around this big old cottonwood tree looking around for this light we then saw it come on and shine down to the gound some few hundered feet to the south and east of where we where. Did it think m! aybe it had found us or maybe one of our dog&#39;s or some other animal? Well after about half a minute of so the light went out and we couldnt tell where it had gone. After setting there for maybe twenty or thirty minute&#39;s or so but what seemed to be all night we all got up and went threw the tree&#39;s to the north and east and then came to the road and fallowed it north back to town and all went to our home&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After thinking about this some year&#39;s later it is still a mystery to me. The light that shone down on us that night was very much brighter than any kind of spotlight that I have ever seen, it was almost as bright as if the sun was shining in just a small beam of light some fourty feet around when it struck the ground. It would hurt you&#39;r eye&#39;s to look right at it for very long. One might think that maybe it was some spotlight or bright flashlight from some other hunter&#39;s or some farmer looking to see who might be in there tree&#39;s, or even someone just playing a joke on some kid&#39;s in the night. But I don&#39;t think so, for Hudson is a very small town and we all know everyone and would know if someother hunter&#39;s would be out that night. And there is the fact of where the light had shown down from. It was well above the tree&#39;s coming down on a slant so that if a person was behind the light they would have to have some way to be up above the tree&#39;s and then move from one place to another all without being seen or heard, for all the while this was going on there was no sound from the light. It was a calm clear night with no wind at all. And the only sound&#39;s we heard that night was of ourself&#39;s runing threw the tree&#39;s and our out of breath voice&#39;s from the running and fear. And there is the ideal when I have told other&#39;s before about this and they sugest that maybe the light or who was shining the light where up on a tower or pole or something? But there are no towers or pole&#39;s for someone to be up on at all just the tree&#39;s. And on the west side where once the light came down from, beyond the tree&#39;s is just open feild&#39;s for mile&#39;s to the west and nothing that one could get up on to shine the light from. It was not a spotlight from any car or plane or helicopter, for there was no sound at all from any type of machine. Just a light that chased us. The time from when the light first shown down on us to the time where we all came out on the road to go home was maybe a little less than a hour I think but who know&#39;s for! shure it could of be much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have never told anyone about this until recently because they might have thought I was a psychiatric case But what I saw was real it was not a trick of light it was not weather ballons etc;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Was walking home around dusk and saw a bright light come quickly from the west and then stop. No sound. Object was Trianglar on the bottom with a beaker shape on the top. Object was initially very bright but after stopping began to dim an move slowly. At the time the object first appeared, another person driving on the road saw the object and stopped next to me. I ran home and got a pair of binoculars and continued to observe the object for approx 45 minutes until the object simply winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was observed in either the fall of 1974 or 1975. I was in high school at the time and did not yet have my drivers license. It was in the evening around dusk, probably around 17:30. I was walking home in a residential area on a clear evening just after the sun had set. It was still relatively light and the object appeared moving west to east very rapidly and stopped just overhead. The object was initially a bright white ball of light which I had to shield my eyes from. It came in so quickly and was so bright that it seemed to streak in like you would expect a meteor to do. At the same time a car was coming down the street toward me. Upon noticing the same object, the man inside slammed on the breaks and jumped out of the car asking &#34;what the hell is that&#34;. We watched the object for several minutes. It was 200 to 300 feet in the air and made no sound. The obect began moving very slowly and the light eminating from it began to steadily dim. I observed a triangular outline on the bottom and a short beaker like area sitting on top of the triangle. The light eminating from the object was still rather bright so it was difficult to see more. After observing the object for a few minutes I quickly ran home and got a pair of binoculars. The object was out of my site for perhaps 90 seconds while I was in the house. My mother followed me out to our back yard to continue observing the object. The object continued heading east and continued to get dimmer. We watched the object for approx. 30-40 minutes. At this time it was completely dark out and there were many stars. My mother and I then heard jet engines and noticed three lights approaching the object from three different directions. The object, that now appeared about the size of a star, suddenly shot up as the aircraft approached, stopped and then winked out. I did not know the man that stopped on the street to observe the object with me and I never saw him again. My mother was a house wife with a high school education who was very interested in UFO&#39;s but had never seen one before. We did not report it. I am an engineer and have been very interested in the UFO phenomenon since that time. I have seen several things, since then, that I can&#39;t explain. That sighting, however, was the only sighting that was clearly something I could not attribute to something known and I still often wonder just what it was. I don&#39;t beleive this sighting was reported by anyone else at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife and i were fishing on the colorado river at willow beach arizona some 90 mile or so from las vegas. It was getting dusky down by the river but it was stilll broad daylight above us,no clouds at all. i was laying on my back staring up at the sky when i saw a very bright white light flying over us from east to west. I immediatly jumped up shouted to my wife. Could see no shape just brilliant white light and then it began to move in a sharp zig zag pattern rapidly still going due west. I know aircraft and i knew it was something unusual. Its passed out of sight in probably less than 30-40 seconds. a few seconds later we saw another one just like the first traveling in the same zig zag pattern going west and just as quickly. i was astounded. I remember at about this same time there were reports in the las vegas paper of sightings in the mountains west of the city.<n>

Living in the country there were no lights on or around, thee sky was full of stars.  While I was laying on the hill on my front lawn staring up into the sky at the stars a super bright object that first appeared to be a shooting star shot across the night sky.  This object had no tail trailing it and it stopped on a dime.  It was very bright, larger and alot brighter than the north star.  This object stood out among the stars and seemed to pulse a little bit.  Seconds later two more shot across the sky one behind the other and stopped in the same location as the first light, it appeared to be in a triangular pattern.  After a few seconds these super bright star like lights sstarted shooting across the sky as if the were following one another.  The speed was incredible, they would move from the western portion of the sky to the eastern portion in a spilt second and each would stop on a dime.  After a couple of minutes it appeared as if the came closer to the earth because they increased in size and the bright white light became more intence.  After zipping around for a few minutes each object zipped off towards the eastern skyline following one another and vanished in a split second.  I layed there for a couple of minutes to see if they would come back, they did, as fast as they disappeared that had returned.  They were shooting all over the sky as if they were playing some kind of game, after a few more minutes they seemed to shoot off into space because they did not travel across the night sky the way they had been.  Needless to some I tell the story to this day and people laugh about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/1/74 20:00|Ankara (Turkey)||Changing|5 min.|A bright, huge, and shape-changing object, exploded into numerous smaller spherical objects which moved in formation.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57663.html|27|ndxe197410| A bright, huge, and shape-changing object, exploded into numerous smaller spherical objects which moved in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an autumn evening with a clear sky. The sun had set about an hour ago when the incident occurred.  My family (my parents and my brother) were having an after-dinner tea time at the balcony of our apartment; and I was in my room.  Our apartment was located at the top of a hill in the city, where the most of the north side of the city was visible from. Then my brother came into my room shouting that there was something strange in the sky. I rushed out to the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 5- 8 kilometers away, at an altitude of 1500 - 2000 meters above the city. It was huge.  Comparing with the buildings at that distance, I can say that it was 150-200 meters in diameter.  The object had a very bright silvery metal color. It was self luminous, and a “haze” of bright white light was surrounding it. It’s difficult to describe its shape because of the brightness and the “light” surrounding it. The “haze” was not homogeneous; it had a somewhat patchy appearance, and for short durations of time (5 to 10 seconds), it was possible to see parts of the thing inside. The inside object was roughly egg-shaped, but its shape was constantly changing. The “shell of the egg” was fluctuating like the appearance of the surface of wavy melted metal.  It looked as if something inside, trying to come out, were forcing and deforming the wall. The object had not moved around and stayed still at that location for about 2-3 minutes. Then suddenly something even more strange had happened:  The object had gradually expanded 2-3 times in diameter while its brightness had increased making it difficult to look at it directly, and then it “exploded” without making any noise (in fact, no sound at all could be heard during the whole incident). This event took about 10 seconds.  In a few seconds after the explosion, all the “white – silvery – bright” haze and other things had disappeared, and numerous (about 50 or so of them) spherical objects came out of it.  The spheres were also luminous but not that bright. They had pale neon colors on their surface with a thin layer of “haze”.  The spheres were all identical to each other. They were perfect spheres in shape.  Although it is difficult to make a correct estimate, based on their distance and their altitude, I can say that their diameters were about 20 meters or so. No details (windows, signs, etc.) were seen on their surfaces, except that their ever changing pale neon colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after their appearance, the spheres started to move towards south (towards our location).  They moved horizontally at a constant speed, and did not change direction. Their speed was about twice or three times faster than an airliner. They moved all together at the same speed, side- by-side; but they were not lined up in perfect rows. They did not make any sound at all. They did not leave any trails behind them while they move. They passed over the roof and disappeared from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides us, thousands of people of the city had observed the incident. The incident took place in local newspapers next day. The government agencies explained the incident as “a meteorite passing over the city”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That spectacular show was the most extraordinary event of my life. Despite after the 30 years passed, and still remembering most of the details, I do not have any explanation of it. It was certainly not a “meteorite”, not even close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were placed in a straight horizontal line in the sky. They stood still for several minutes.  I called for my Mother to come and see what I was witnessing.  she saw them too.  There was no sound, They were up in the sky several miles away.  (we lived at the tallest point on a street and could see across to the other hills.)The two outside &#34;moons&#34;  then moved into the center &#34;moon&#34;.  It did not grow any brighter or larger.  Suddenly, the &#34;moon&#34; disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing more to add other than at the time this was in the same general direction of the greater pittsburgh airport.  There was absolutely no way these were aircraft as they stood perfectly still and shown like three full moons. They were about the size the moon would be as it rose in the horizon in the east.  That area was quite undeveloped back then. Lots of hills and valleys. sightings of ufo&#39;s were pretty common back when I was growing up though most people, my Mom included saw actual crafts.  These &#34;moons&#34; were the closest I ever got to seeing an actual ufo.<n>

From a distance, I saw a large red glowing light near my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer, I thought it was actually a new sign over the local convient store.  When I got under the large glowing light, I realized for the first time it was not supported by any pole.  I could not figure out how store could do that. The light made no sound and did not move.  I moved away from the store to look for some form of support.  It was not more than 10-20 feet above the store.   I was the only one out at that time.  As I was watching the light, it finally dawned on me that it was not supported and in fact it was flying on its own.  A guy in a truck came around the corner and pulled over to see it as well.  I asked him to observe independently and not speak to me.  We would exchange phone numbers and write our own description of what we saw.  We would get in touch with each other the next day and go to the authorities.  He agreed.  As we both stood there, the light without any noise moved laterally from the store directly over both of us. I could not see any structure of any type.  Just a bright red light.  I picked up a rock to see if there was any structure there but I could not reach it by throwing the rock.  It moved laterally back over the store and then back over us.  Then in a flash it was gone through the universe leaving a bright red streak of light at a slight angle up.  It never made a sound of any type.  The guy got in his truck and refused to give me his number.  He said he was way to spooked to ever want to talk about this again.  When I got to my apartment, I told my roommate about what I had seen.  He said that that there had been sightings all night and people calling in on the radio talk shows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day in the Denton papers, the FAA said that they were using weather balloons and they were all accounted for and nothing else was in the sky that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The story died right there.  I know there is no balloon that can hover without moving, put out a blinding red light like that, move laterally and then shoot through the sky at the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this to any publication of any kind since the guy took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently almost 34 years later in Stephenville, Texas there were multiple sightings and many of the witness who said they saw what they believed to be UFOs.  They were interviewed on Larry King and one description was exactly what I saw.  Stephenville is within 300 miles of Denton Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
