I woke up because we pulled over.  I sat up to see what my Grandpa and Mother was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a Orange Sphere hovering above the ground next to a hedge.  Nobody said anything and I asked my mom what it was.  She said it was the sun, of course it wasn&#39;t but I was a kid and didn&#39;t know any better.  Now I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her what it was doing and she said it was sleeping so I asked her were it pajama&#39;s where and she said it doesn&#39;t wear any because it would burn them off.  That&#39;s all I remeber about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandpa is no longer with us and my mom pretends she doesn&#39;t remeber it happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard about Ed Dames talking about the same thing on Art Bell and I about fell out of my chair.  I thought it wasn&#39;t real until I heard the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You may contact me by email if you wish to talk about it.

It was as any other child night was for me. I had been in bed for some time, asleep for what I remember to be a few hours. To this day, as I think about it, I can not tell you why I woke up. But then again, why do kids normally wake up in the middle of the night? I was around ten years old. It was a summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, I woke up and there the lacy curtains I had in my room, I twisted in my bed to look out the window. I had thought I heard something. I just remember looking out the window and looking up the steep hill in the backyard. The night sky was blue-blue. But lit enough with the stars and other lighting around that you could see the sky and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seen this object. It was huge. Round, like pie shaped from the angle I was looking up to it. It was at least three- four stories tall. There were a few white lights in various places on the craft, but what I will never ever forget.. Was that even at my age, I knew no airplanes just stayed in one spot in the air like this did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was terrified at that young age. This thing had lights that ran around and around the thing, from right to left. Three colors, red, blue and green. Constantly. I remembered looking at it for what at the time seemed like forever. But now, it surely, couldn&#39;t been more than a minute or two. I ran from my room moments later, to my parents room. I tried waking up my parents. They wouldn&#39;t listen or believe me. Now, the other bit of news that sticks to me? I didn&#39;t remember hearing noise, or maybe I didn&#39;t think there was any noise while in my own bedroom. However, when in my parents room, I heard this hum. It wasn&#39;t one of them ear splitting, deaf defying hums or anything like that. It was soft. My parents later did calm me down enough so that I could sleep, but it was with them that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You don&#39;t forget things or make this kind of stuff up at the age I was. I was around ten. And now, I&#39;m 39 and its like it was yesterday. I will never forget this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Man could not look|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02837.html|3|ndxe198506| Summary : Man driving car with nephew enveloped in white light of high quality. Man observed no shadows even under dashboard. Man could not look above nephew&#39;s knees or  see outside vehicle though tried. Man  not scared about possible accident. Nephew remembers nothing even though he said &#34;What was that.&#34; immediately after event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Man was 36 years old and enjoys daydreaming. State employee. Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn&#39;t logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew&#39;s feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat. This knowledge takes time. Also,  I spent at least 7 seconds trying real hard to see any shadow. I was aware that I could not see through the windshield but wasn&#39;t scared.<n>

Ohio, about 1/2 mile south of the Michigan state border.  We were in my small truck with the windows rolled down and it was fully dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a large red light, about 300 feet in the air, approaching us slowly parallel to the road we were on.  It was silent and so dark that we couldn&#39;t see any shape behind or around it.  We had time to come to a complete stop while it pulled up straight across from us over a cornfield, then shot away to the north at an extremely high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days before this, a local electrical transformer had exploded at the corner of Co Rd R and 19, about one mile SE of where this occurred.  This could more exactly pinpoint the date of this siting.  Friends of ours wrote it off as an after effect of that, but this light was much too large to have had anything to do with that event.<n>
6/30/85 21:30|unknown|AZ||1 hour|Alleged Drill or non-drilll for military base UFO approach|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97256.html|5|ndxe198506| Alleged Dril or non-drilll for military base UFO approach<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not really a UFO sighting report—however, I thought I would relate the following story:  In the 1980s, my wife and I took an evening walk to a restaurant in our neighborhood for some iced tea and a piece of pie.  We ran into my aunt who lived in an apartment building just down from the restaurant—she was having light refreshment with a neighbor. We joined them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were visiting, a couple of teenagers sat down in the booth behind me.  One of them told a story that I of course cannot verify or check out.  I had a little trouble keeping up with the story because I didn&#39;t want to be rude to my aunt and her friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this was his story:   One weekend, he went to visit a girlfriend who lived with her family in the base-housing section at one of our air force bases. At the time, we had three air force bases in our state, plus one Marine Air facility.   Because I missed a portion of his story, I&#39;m not entirely certain, but I believe he was talking about one of our air bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, he said, he and his girfriend went to the base movie theater on either a Friday or Saturday night.   When the movie let out, he and his girlfriend and virtually all of the people who attended the showing began their return to their homes in the base housing area.  As they were walking, a siren began to sound.  Immediately, all of the people headed toward various base houses.  He said that there was no hesitation.  His girlfriend chose a house and two or three other people followed them to the front door.  The girl did not knock, but simply opened the door.  The family acknowledged them and invited them to sit.  Someone in the house closed the drapes in all of the living room windows and left the room, presumably to close them in the other rooms of the house.  The teenager made the point that there were drapes and not blinds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were various conversations in the livingroom.  I cannot remember whether or not the family they had walked in on offered water or other refreshment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime later—it was not clear to me how much later, as he was telling the story  but it seems as if it could have been close to hour—the siren sounded again.  The visitors thanked the family and everyone left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His girlfriend told him that what just happened may or may not have been an exercise. She said she was not really supposed to know, but she had learned that the exercise or non-execise was a procedure when a UFO approached the base. The teeanger asked, “You mean, like a landing?”  The girl did not really answer the question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, I have no way to knowing whether or not the guy was telling a true story, but perhaps others know of similar procedures at other military bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

6/30/85 20:00|White Plains|NY|Chevron|1:40 in total|A nighttime sighting of an arrow or triangle shaped craft, which moved very slowly, almost hovering, with no noise.|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11980.html|6|ndxe198506| A nighttime sighting of an arrow or triangle shaped craft, which moved very slowly, almost hovering, with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The living room in my parents apartment, where I was at the time, faced east, or slightly northeast. I was lying on the floor watching television, when above the hills to the northeast I noticed a far off light, or lights. This was not at all unusual, as we lived near an airport, and planes flew near us all the time. While I was watching television, I noticed that the lights appeared to be getting ever so brighter a little at a time. They were obviously moving toward me as I watched them, yet at the same time it was taking an inordinate amount of time to do so. As the lights got gradually brighter, it was obvious theat they were moving toward us at an extremely slow rate. I wondered about this, and remember thinking to myself that if this was an airplane, it was going unbelievably slow. The time was about 8:00 pm. I finally got up and went to the window for a closer look, and although you could tell it was moving toward you, movement at all was almost impossible to detect. When the object finally made it&#39;s way close enough to be overhead, I went out to take a look at it. As it passed overhead, we noticed a distinct &#34;V&#34; shape to the formation. Again, it moved at an incredibly slow pace. The best way I can describe it is to say that if you look at the minute hand of a clock, it is difficult to actually see it move. You can if you stare closely, but if you look at the clock, then look away and look back, you will notice that the hand has moved. It was alnost the same with these lights. Movement was almost undetectable while staring at it, but after a few minutes, you noticed it had moved. Anyway, I remember commenting at the time that I heard no sound at all, not even a hovering noise. Some people say it was light aircraft in formation, but I really doubt it. There was absolutely no &#34;play&#34; in between the lights. In other words, When airplanes fly in formation, there is some variation in movement between them as they go along. There was no evidence of that at all. One truly had the feeling that this was one structure. Also, there was no sound, and while going overhead, it practically hovered. We watched the lights as they moved southwest, and then lost sight of them. Thinking it was over, we went about out business. At about 9:20 pm, I left the house to meet a friend of mine. I walked out of the apartment and up the driveway, when I was visually struck by what you see in figure 3 in my illustration. As I turned up the driveway, the lights were right in front of me (and above). I don&#39;t know if I can relate the size of it, or how wide it spanned, in writing. It was no longer a &#34;V&#34; shape, which could be attributed to the angle at which I was viewing it. I actually had to turn my head from side to side to see it all. It was huge. I immediately ran back to the house to alert my parents. As near as I can figure, based on the distance away our apartment was, to run back inside, tell my parents, and return with my father, would have taken about 45 seconds to a minute. In this time, when I looked up again, I saw NO discernible movement in the lights. Thay seemed to be right where they were when I first ran back inside. This again made me realize they were not airplanes. My dad and I watched them for about 15-20 minutes more, as they traveled in a northerly direction. As they moved, we were in a position to view what would have been the &#34;back&#34; of it. I then noticed that as it made it&#39;s way north, the light (or &#34;a&#34; light) from the back shot forward in a bee line to the front of the formation. Then the lights slowly proceeded north until out of sight.<n>

It was too low and in the wrong place to ever have been a conventional aircraft and it was travelling very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I alerted my family to look as it was such a strange thing to see, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there was a report in the local newspaper that a person in a nearby town - Cobden- had reported seeing a similar light, however between Cobden (to the south) and my town is a range of hills; and what I saw could not have been seen by that person unless it had travelled around or over these hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was dusk but the light was cleary visible and I pulled over to the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my son exited the vehicle.  I then observed the light send a beam of light to the earth.  My son was having difficulty locating the light so i kneeled down and held his face and pointed it in the direction of the light.  At this point the light beam quickly retracted into the light source and the light source then flashed across the horizon at an incredible speed and vanished. The light source didnt look like a solid object.  The most fascinating thing was how the beam dropped to earth and retracted.  There were no helicopters or planes visible in the sky just the light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My husband looked but thought it must be a plane, so my son and I got in the car and drove to get near it and saw it was hovering very low in the sky perfectly still, noiseless.  We could see it was a black perfect triangle, and had a white blinking light underneath at each corner blinking in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many others on a school parking lot nearby were also watching it.  A jogger said he had ran the block 3 times and it had not moved.  My son and i rushed home to get my husband and our 8 inch reflector telescope to view it better.  When we came back the sky was dark, but the thing was still stationary, hanging there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were almost directly underneath it, and set up the scope on the field grass.  The instant I got my eye on the viewer the lights all went off on it, just like someone flipped the switch off.  It was very eerie,  but after our eyes adjusted to the darkness in the viewfinder we could see the color seemed to be flat black or dark flat gunmetal gray.  It also seemed to not be featureless on the bottom but to have an undulating or webbed appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After awhile, the telescope began to reveal that it was very softly glowing orange, like coals that are almost burned out.  (You could not see it at all naked eye against the dark sky)<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all watched it hang there over us for most of an hour and it never budged.   Mosquitoes were biting and it was hot, so we finally left it there suspended in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A large disk like object came out of nowhere and I remember the lights flash in a circular motion over the sky. The object came from nowhere and then just disappeared. This must of occurred within a few seconds. I still remember that night and gives me goose bumps when I think of that night.

I know because the behind our back yard 2 neighbors were standing in the driveway looking straight up at this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it must of done something to our physci or memory  because we all saw it including my mother she remeber&#39;s but only slight trace&#39;s of the memory  the best I can recall and remeber is seeing this thing floated or hovered silently about 38 feet above the ground at about house level it come across the corn field and stopped directly in plain view out of our back yard just above backyard&#39;s neighbor&#39;s house or gravel drivewayop level it made no noise was a classic circular on sideview all around the disc shaped craft was perfect circle lights going around counter clockwise in a timed unison every circle that light up was a different color like red green orange blue white It seemed these counter clockwise flashing of lights which was flashing half a second or so probably had to do something with its propulsion of the craft it was clearly not of this planet I tell you like an anti gravity craft something I never have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While staring at this craft with awe I remeber I looked back at the sliding glass door from back porch and my mom was looking at it too, I then  looked and 2 of my neighbors from the house&#39;s driveway it was hovering above with these flashing lights  going around and the 2 neighbors were standing directly below it pointing and marveling at the bottom of the craft. The ufo was a brownish color like metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this ufo had to of done something to our memory because the only thing we could remeber next was it fading away in the distance hovering at an unknown rate. I drew a picture of it to my mom&#39;s friend but we were all like in a state of denial or something but it really happened! This thing was for real I know what i saw but god i wish i had had my mother take a snapshot with the poloraid camera we had back then you know the instant flash  and picture. It was so weird but happened and I guess its one of those things when you see something like that you dont think of anything else rational or think of getting the camera because all you can do is stare at this thing that is really there but you cannot believe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> messes with your physci because your brain can&#39;t register what you are seeing as normal or  rational but it&#39;s there. I&#39;ll probably never ever see another ufo in person again because it is  so rare but I know this was real and happened maybe if I had hypnotic recogoniction or something  I could unlock the rest of what I saw but can&#39;t remeber it happened id bet my mother&#39;s life on it  that this was for real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This witness was a retired woman in her early seventies of good character that attended our church in San Bruno, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read that Clear Lake, California, had a number of UFO&#39;s sightings over the years, and since this woman and husband had a secondary home there, I asked her if she had seen any UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that several years ago (1980s) that she had been walking her dog during the daylight hours.  They came to a small rise overlooking the lake, and when she looked down she saw a saucer-like metallic craft parked by the lakeshore with a plank extended out from the craft over the water.   She saw three very tall and thin beings with translucent skin.  There were not like any human beings she had ever seen before.  Their clothing material looked similar to our rainwear material.  Even though she was very close to them, they never looked at her directly.  They seem to be preoccupied with the water, as if they were taking some onboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She became frightened and ran to some nearby homes that overlooked the lake. She knocked on the door of a friend of hers.  When her friend opened the door they saw the craft shoot straight up at tremendous speeds and disappeared.  She also noticed a neighbor from behind his fence who also witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said the next day there were UFO reports in the local paper.  She did not report it.  Before this encounter she had no interest in UFO&#39;s and wouldn&#39;t know where to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, her health broke down and her family put her into a care facility.  So I assume she is no longer alive and able to tell her story.<n>

It was a dull green color. It was not moving or making any noise. We could see the propellers but they were not moving either.  I don&#39;t know if this was a UFO or what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked for ropes thinking maybe it was some life size military craft balloon but there were no ropes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the weirdest thing we have ever seen.

While we both sat there on an igloo cooler, we stared at disbelief at the beauty and clarity of the stars that filled the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While staring into the night sky, looking towards the East, I spotted a single light moving across the sky.  As I watched the light, it turned into two lights, with one being slightly above the other at about a two o’clock position, similar to how a plane would appear if it was traveling across the sky and slowly turned towards you.  The two lights became further and further apart, causing me to finally exclaim out loud that that was a HUGE plane because of the distance that they were from each other. (I assumed them to be wing lights on an aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they grew even further apart at an undeterminable distance, seven more lights appeared one at a time from either within the first light or from behind it and swooped into formation behind the first light as it made its way back across the sky from either the direction it came or in the direction it turned, with the second light falling in behind them.  These objects seemed to emit their own bluish, white light with no blinking lights or colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They traveled in a Westward direction, with the larger, round shaped first light leading the smaller, seven round lights that were closely followed by a large rectangular light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I watched in amazement as the 9 objects slowly and silently made their way across the sky before and above us. We tried to rationalize the fact that 9 airplanes or helicopters in the night sky would make SOME noise, but we heard nothing.  We finally decided that it must be a smaller plane pulling a lighted banner. As if to prove us wrong, the large rectangular object rose slightly above the line of the formation and shot across the top of the formation to the halfway point, where it stopped and slowly drifted down between the formation to stop below the formation where it hovered in place until the last of the seven smaller lights finally passed over it at which point it rose back up to continue to take up the rear of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the formation glide silently across the sky until we could no longer distinguish the objects from the stars and turned to look at each other for a long moment, then back at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point we both arose from the cooler and clumsily gathered up our fishing gear and made our way back to the campsite to find several friends standing there looking at and searching the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if they had seen the lights, and with astonished looks on their faces they muttered a meek &#34;Yeah, What was that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We replied that we were not sure ourselves what they were and we all spent the rest of the early morning discussing the possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At sunrise, we all broke camp and left the camp area and returned home to Dallas, Texas.  The following day I contacted the Dallas Times Herald (no longer in existence) and asked them how I could find out if there were 9 aircrafts in the area on that night, at which time I explained what we had seen.  I was told that their paranormal investigator would contact me shortly.  I never heard from that person and assumed they had discovered some military exercise that had taken place over the area that night and never re-contacted them or attempted to contact anyone else of authority concerning this sighting.  I believe I filed an online report with MUFON a few years back, but aside from that, I have told no one but friends or acquaintances about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saw a large spherical shaped object hovering for about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Siting - Gander Area  Newfoundland, Canada  This event took place in 1985.  I realize that this was 22 years ago, but it deserves telling and some attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two brothers and I were on a fishing trip in a place called Bear Cave Road which is located behind  Indian Bay, Newfoundland, Canada. We camped on the edge of a lake called Alley’s Pond and just after dawn on the following morning,  I got up and went outside to try my luck with some early morning fishing.  It was a clear morning with not a cloud in sight and as I looked toward the opposite side of the lake in  the eastern sky, I saw a large object hovering above the tree line about a kilometer away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be about a hundred meters or more across. It was saucer shaped and had a string of orange lights on the outside edge of the object which seemed to be moving around the outside circumference on the edge of the object. Although it reflected some sunlight, it appeared to be of a dull coloration. It remained motionless in the sky and I went to alert my brother who was up and about. We both stared at it for a minute or so when I suggested that we go over and have a closer look. We both got in a boat which we had and started up the outboard motor. All this time it still remained motionless about a hundred feet or so above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only moved about a hundred feet when the lights turned a blue color and the object moved at very high velocity at a forty five degree angle away form us. It did not make a sound and in an instant it was gone. To this day, I cannot get this experience out of my mind. My brother and I both saw exactly the same thing and we will occasionally bring up the subject, but otherwise it is all but forgotten. I did not report the experience mainly because quite frankly I didn’t know who we could report it to until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

During this immediate time of the sighting, I looked out of my driver&#39;s window, looking east and observed an object which was a Cylinder shape in a stationary position, not moving at all.  It looked as if it was 150-200 ft off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Cylinder shaped object appeared to be very large, long in size and had blinking multi-colored lights along the side, in a straight single row.  The tail appeared to have a yellowish-orange glowing tail, which appeared to me like an after burner on jet aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared to be hovering in place.  I am presently a Helicopter pilot and have been around all types of aircraft and this was not an aircraft.  It looked almost cigar shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this object, my view was obstructed by approximately one city block of trees for approximately 10 seconds before my view was opened up again.  At this time the object was gone, completely out of sight and not seen again.  The distance from where I observed the object, it appeared to be stationary over the down town area of Kankakee, which was 4-5 blocks east from where I was at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone, except my wife. I have always been a skeptical person but that sighting convinced me of what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple days after, the Kankakee Daily Journal newpaper printed a sighting of the same thing I had seen, by a couple living in rural Grant Park, Il which is 12 miles east of Kankakee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you take this information as truth and not a hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You!

I stayed there for a minuet and said to him &#34;wait, lets see if the come back&#34;. He was gone down the road so i had to go also because he had the ride.

We were sitting on the tailgate of our station wagon, star gazing. It was about 2:00 AM. We had binoculars to watch the stars. I took the binoculars from him and looked up into the sky. At that moment I saw 3 saucer-like shapes traveling in a formation, one to the left and right of the middle saucer, in a horizontal line across the sky. There was 3 lights on the front of each saucer. They were very bright. In my binoculars, they seemed to be traveling slowly, not speeding. I gave the binoculars to my husband and he saw the same thing. The ships lasted about 10 minutes in time, then just seemed to disappear as fast as they appeared. We could not see them with our naked eyes, just through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction.

It was at a low altitude.  It very slowly moved over us and continued moving away from us to our right.  Then about six helicopters, presumably from Edwards Airforce Base, came from our left (we were going south) and went over us and chased after it.  We never told anyone until we heard of a similar object being spotted and watched for in Russia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It disappeared quickly.  It had no sound.  I was quite shocked for what I saw and had no clue.  I came back inside and told no one.  I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe me.

As I was walking down the street, I happened to look up in the sky and I noticed a black, tri-lobal object in the sky.  It didn&#39;t move and I glanced around to see if anyone else was observing the same thing.  I looked up again and it was still in the same position.  I went into my friends house and told him about it but when we went to his living room window, it was gone.  I should point out that I was about 10 yrs old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a sunny day.  Approximately 10 minutes from Westnedge exit a thick gray cover enveloped the car.  Could not see any cars, brake lights, and no sound of cars colliding.  The gray covering left and all of the cars were facing in various directions.  There were no accidents.  We all straighted our cars out and left.  When I arrived at my friends house they were outside wait for us.  I had called before leaving at 15:00 and they expected us at about 17:15.  They said they were worried because it was after 19:00.  That&#39;s when I noticed the sun was lower in the sky.  This has been bothering me for 13 years.  How can this happen during rush hour and on an freeway?  I feel a need to try and locate some of those people to talk with them, but have no idea how to do so.<n>

We lived on farming land. We were out playing at the edge of the field one day when we heard a strange humming noise, we looked up and saw a small saucer shaped object with few lights around it approximatley 7 or 8 feet above our heads. We stood stunned as it only hoovered above us, it seemed as though we stood there for a long time. Finally, I do not know why, but we stated running from it, at least 150, or 200 ft away from it. It chased us, swooping down close to our heads. It then left. The strange thing is we were stunned and amazed, but we forgot about it, I mean we did not fear or think about it anymore, It was something that came into our minds once every couple of years. I have had one other experience since that time. I was sleeping on the couch, and was awakened by a bright light flowing through the window, it looked as if the moon had fallen right beside me. I pulled the covers over my head, it still shone through, but it did not really bother me, I went right back to sleep. I will never forget what happened when I was nine though, the older I get, the clearer the memory is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see aliens, all I saw was this saucer shaped object, and heard the intense humming noise it was making. I guess at first we were not scared, just in shock, for it seemed that we stood there for hours. Then suddenely we were filled with fear and fled. It followed us, swooping down at us, I have never ran so hard in my life. And I still cannot understand why after this happened it seemed like it was no big deal, why we didn&#39;t think about it very much, I mean that should of been enough to make you go crazy, but afterwards, it did not even bother us. We have rarley even discussed it.<n>

We pulled to an overlook parking lot and got out of our truck and watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights, no sounds other then crickets chirping, as we watched, the stars disappeared slowly behind a solid black shadow. We estimated that the object had to be at least 300 ft from the front to the back edge and around 400 feet from side to side. It moved slowly and in a straight line and took around 5 minutes to go from horizon to horizon. We were in a valley at the time, so the mountains were fairly close, and the horizons were only a few miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are positive it was not a cloud as the sky was perfectly clear. Since there was no sound it could not have been a blimp or other man made flying object. We stood there for around 20 minutes to see if it came back or anything else would happen, but it remained quiet and uneventful. We also checked all the local new media sources for the next few days but no one else reported seeing anything that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did hear of similar types of sightings in that same area at different times that year, Thank you for letting me post this and I hope it will add to all the other information you may have on similar type sightings in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was only able to view it for a few seconds. It wasn&#39;t dark at 2:00AM because at that latitude it doesn&#39;t get dark in mid-June. Still, it was dusky and overcast so the true color of the craft was hard to determine. It appeared dull gray to me and there were no lights. Even though I had both windows down, I couldn&#39;t hear any sound coming from the craft. No engine noise whatsoever. I estimate its speed at roughly 400 mph and its elevation at around 1000 feet, possibly lower. The object wasn&#39;t huge, roughly 75 feet in diameter. Seward is south of Anchorage so the craft would have been heading north. I am coming forward with this now because Peter Davenport indicated on the rdaio that all sightings are relevant, no matter how dated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The other person with me at the time of sighting was the trainer at the same farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and the other person were transporting a load of 6 horses from a farm in Houston to our base farm in Waco Tx at night.  Around 10:15 pm we pulled over to check the horses, water them ( it was a very warm night)  We opened up the side door of the transport and proceeded to tend to the horses. We were driving a semi tractor trailer type transport<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later we noticed the horse getting agitated, ears flicking back and forth, breathing heavier, stomping their hooves. The other person stepped out of the transport  to see if there was a coyote or something they caught scent of, he saw nothing.  The horses agitation increased<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:30  my companion called me to come outside the trailer I did. He pointed up to the sky, northwest direction, I looked. There was a patch of the sky that was darker than the rest, and the stars were blocked out. It appeared to be moving towards us in a southeast direction At that time the semi started to run roughly, the lights started to dim all over it and inside the trailer. The horses were quite agitated at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dark spot in the sky was now almost overhead and we were aware it was a triangle shape, and very large. In my estimation it was over 2 football fields long, or over the length of my outreached hand to the sky, I did that to try to judge the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead there was no sound. It was definitely a solid object, had a appearence of metal, possibly stone, or another hard surface. And as it passed over  the semi tractor trailer ceased running,like the fuel wasn&#39;t getting to the engine and the lights faded  to going totally off. The horses were very nervous by this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approx. 10 minutes ( the object moved slowly) it had passed completely over us and was heading in the southeast direction still.  As it got farther away the semi tractor trailer started back up, the lights came back on, both gradually as if they were filling from being drained off or something. the horses settled as it got farther away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us were shaken at this experience, and have never forgotten it to this day  We watched the object until it disappeared from decent view which was around 11pm  then closed up the trailer, and proceeded on our way to Waco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us have spoken or reported this until this past year. Only to the Coast to Coast radio website, and have told a few close friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first, I thought it was Haley&#39;s comet which was due later that year, but quickly realized it was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over to the side of the road which is something I would never do because of safety, but this situation was overwhelming.  (No other cars were on this road).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#34;light&#34; then came directly beside us moving about 5 miles per hour.  It was cigar shaped (looked like an airplane with no wings), as long as a football field, made no sound, had a large light near the front and smaller ones down the side (which is why it looked like a comet with a tail - from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just above the treetops just to our right (It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son got out of the car and walked down the sidewalk beside it as it slowing traveled by. (I kid him now, that his photo is probably hanging on some martians wall!)  We were sooo amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept assuring the children that this had to be some special project the government was working on and that I&#39;m sure others had to have seen it and we would watch the 11:00pm news to hear what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not afraid (I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s at that time).  We were just amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we tried to follow it by going around the block and heading in the direction it was going.  We went to the next street over and pulled over hoping it would fly over us, but it never did.  So, we went home and watched the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The news man said they had recieved numerous calls of a UFO, but &#34;all I can say is what they tell me to say - it was falling space junk.  It was spotted entering the atmosphere as a fire ball&#34; (about 10 minutes before we spotted it). &#34;It was sighted from Tampa to Georgia.&#34;  --- What we saw was definitly not falling!!  A<n> <n><n> <n><n> nd at that moment my eyes swelled with tears, because I realized that what we had seen was so rare that very few people would ever get to experience something like this in their lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the newspaper the following few days, people that had spotted it came forward describing what we had witnessed, but no one had come as close as we had.  I did not tell anyone except close family members, because my husband was in law enforcement and I didn&#39;t want people to think his family was looney. (Of course, some of my relatives didn&#39;t believe it either, and I don&#39;t blame them - I probably wouldn&#39;t have believed it either.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I and my children (who are now grown) definitely believe in UFOs and really feel blessed to have experienced this.  I believe that God created the universe and it only makes sense that there is more life elsewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were southbound on an interstate highway entering the outskirts of Tulsa.  I do not recall the exact date or time, but I know it was mid summer of the year I turned 15 (in april).  There was some kind of municipal airport we were approaching through the valley (into it?).  That day there were an unusually high number of private aircraft flying that day (most of them were &#34;unpowered&#34; &#34;light&#34; and &#34;ultralight&#34;private aircraft).  I remember watching the gliders soar in thermal updrafts for a long time as we got closer(20 min. at least).  There was one &#34;glider&#34; in particular caught my eye.  Not because it was vissually extra ordinary, but because it appeared to have no angualr momentum.  I observed the craft for about 4 min. marveling at the skill of that pilot to keep riding the same current for such a long time.  &#34;Those arent glider wings!&#34;  Suddenly the craft I had just been watching for a realllllllly long time looked like a silver disk.  It was late afternoon, because the sunlight reflected brightly in a radial patern from each side of the center of the disk.  From a great distance these reflections looked like a long wingspan &#34;white&#34; glider (the kind that get towed up by powered aircraft).  The moment I realized what i saw, I told my Dad to try to pull over.  we could not because by this time the landscape had become decidedly urban (I had not been watching the road for quite a long trip).  I watched it for as long as I could wishing the video camera was &#34;assembled&#34; (2 piece camera/vcr system) so that i cluld be taping this un-beleivable event.  My view was obstructed finally by an overpassing highway onramp.  When the obstruction cleared, the craft was gone.  I remember there being a refinery or some other heavy industry site that appeared to be the same distance from me as the craft, but on a Southerly vector. The craft: Silver disk with a bulge in the middle. it was about a hands width at arms length North of the refinery. The altitude is hard to guess, but it was about as high as 2.5 the height of the refinery. It was tilted on axis both toward me and 45 degrees to the side. (i could see the entire top except the part obscured by the &#34;dome&#34; in the middle. It appeared to be hovering...or moving verrrrry slow. No sound apperent (caravans windows do not roll down in the back though),<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We feel compelled to comment that it is not unusual for a glider to remain virtually motionless in the sky, particularly if it is flying in ridge lift or an atmospheric wave.  Glider pilots dream of such situations.  However, we have no explanation for why the object would change its appearance.  PD (Flight Instructor/Gliders, 1978-1988)))<n>

It was moving very slowly and at one point was literally above us!! it moved in a circular direction over and past the mountains and then came around and headed north.  I decided to write my ufo encounter because i have read similar stories about this huge object.  Many report seeing small crafts flying around and speeding off but this object that i saw was VERY big.  and another thing i forgot to mention is that it made NO SOUND!! This encounter happened 15 years ago but it still puzzles me to this day.  What was it?  if anybody has had a similar encounter with this giant craft please email and let me know.<n>

Called the Sonoma County Sherriff dept and they gave us your number.  In our phone conversation- You explained it was Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the conversation with you, I shared a UFO I had seen about 25 years ago and promised I would email it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I was listening to Coast to Coast (as always) and you were on.  You were great and so clear and the main thing I heard from you was send in the report- no matter how long ago- for your records.  In our phone conversation, I promised I would report this to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was New Years Eve about 25 years ago. In my living room- I had 2 couches facing each other in front of the fireplace. My dear friend, ((name deleted)), was sitting on one couch facing me and I was looking out the huge window behind him.  He was talking and I saw an object o in the window behind him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, I did not know what it was. It was elongated and had lights at each end and in the middle- seemed they were red and green or blue. blinking on and off but mostly on. I was so stunned  as I looked at it and tried to make sense of it in my mind.  It hung for a moment and I was too impressed by it to interrupt my friend.  I could not miss a moment of it.  After a moment, I swear- it went straight up in the sky- really straight up.  Before it went straight up- I tried to tell him &#34; look backwards and see this&#34; by then it was gone.  SO FAST- SO SO FAST There is absolute no doubt in my mind that it was a UFO.  It was long-and seemed to have a cigar shaped center and shorter bottom and top level. I know it was something from out of this world.  The bottom might have been longer- Not sure I will never forget it. I felt so at one with it. It is weird but seemed so far away and so close at the same time.  It was so powerful- so clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was so unusual and difficult to describe.  The lights were not normal lights nor neon. I do not know what to say about the lights-  They were very bright but nothing I know. They were deeply clear like nothing I know.  The lights were sp strong- so clear- so there- I can still see them but do not really have words for them- round/oval/ perfect in dimension.  Distinct- different- just different This is more difficult than I thought- trying to convey what I saw.  What was there-  anyway ,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter- thank you with all of my heart for what you are doing.  It was really difficultt for me to write this. I think one reason it is hard for folks to write is because it is so hard to explain what they have never seen before,   Blessings to all living things.  Thank you It wanted me to see it. I am grateful I had the oppurtunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very exciiting you saw your first ufo the eve we called.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sebastopol, Ca<n>

My computer was badly corrupted.  I hope you can still accept this message from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to comment on the Casselberry Florida sightings if I may.  I myself, my husband, my mother, and my Niece were at Dog Track Road and Hwy 17-92 at the red light about 11:00 sometime in the middle 1980&#39;s and we saw something very strange.  I myself heard a low hum and I said what is that sound?  My family and I looked up out from our windows and saw what appeard to us as a huge low hovering object that seemed to be the size of the car lot that was at the light.  I remember saying that looks like something off of Battlestar Galactica.  We all saw it.  It also seemed to have different colored  rectangle shpaes on the bottom of it which was the part we were looking up at from our car to the best of my memory.  Some of the rectangles were smaller than others.  I think I remember a Purple color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, we have told ourselves over the years it was something we have made to much out of so it has been disregaurded, but has always been a memory that I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like it before.  I saw the comments by someone on this sight that lives near a dog track in Casselberry, and I&#39;m thinking it must be the Old Dog Track on Dog Track road in Casselberry.  The placement of their sightings and sounds near the palce we saw strange things has prompted me to e-mail this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will make one last comment, I do remember being kind of scared and my husband said lets get out and see it closer and I remember saying, &#34;No, way!&#34;  I&#39;m not getting out of this car.  We drove on throug the intersection when it was our turn to go and it appeard to be done.  If there were any other cars at that red light that night it couldn&#39;t have been very many since it was late at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How do I know when someone could respond to my message?  I will try to get my Micrsoft Office to work for me.  Sorry, again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

From the bottom of the craft there were different coloured lights reds, greens and blues. I was  returning home from a get together with  relatives, when i saw this object in the sky it was only about 50 feet in the sky.I stoped the car and got out to have a closer look, There where about a dozen people there on the side of the road all looking at the same object.there was no sound at all  it was just hovering in one spot,after about half an hour the main lights on the front of the craft, slowly started to narrow until they were gone, and as soon  as they were gone so was the craft.I made my way home,to find out 3 hours had past.From were i saw this UFO is only 8 miles by road. I cannot explain the time difference, from midnight until 3am.As soon as i got home i rang the Airbase  which was 30 kilometers from my home, and they replied that they have had many calls on the same sighting as i had.<n>
6/1/85 23:00|Republic of Ireland||Flash|15 minutes|fishin from a beach , an object out on the water had a large light no sound repelling lead weights|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47289.html|52|ndxe198506| fishin from a beach , an object out on the water had a large light no sound repelling lead weights<n> <n><n> <n><n> As someone who does not really believe in UFOs, I relay this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1985 we went to county Kerry Ireland on a holiday we stayed in a place called Glenbeigh.  Their were three familys, myself and two of my freinds all lovers of beach fishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will explain that my two friends both in their forties were sensible, ordinary family men, not into making up stories.  we usually went fishing together, but on this night we were going to meet on the beach at different times, one of my freinds Bob was the first to leave, a bit later the second friend John left<n> <n><n> <n><n> we were all going to meet on the beach,a beach usually  pitch black at night. I was the last go to the beach. I drove on to the beach hoping to find Bob and John but I was unable to find them, so I left to go back to my caravan on the way back up the beach I came across Bobs car high up on a sand dune  but Bob was no where to be seen.When I got back I found Bob at the caravan site looking pale and shaking,He said he was fishing on the beach when he saw a light out on the water, said at that point he was not really concerned, as he was fishing he noticed the light getting closer to the beach but up from him, This light which he described as like a light from a helicopter travelling just above the water but no sound,the light eventually came closer to him, again it was out from him, but within casting distance.He said he was not too concerned, had not got a clue what it was but carried on fishing anyway.He said he started to get scared when as he tried to cast his line out, it the fishing line kept dropping at his feet, his line would consist of one  large hook and a lead weight. He tried casting several times but with the same result, feeling a bit nervous at this point he started to panic when the light started to come towards him, he jumped in his car and drove away as fast as he could, thats how he ended up in the sand dunes, when my other friend john returned a short time later he relayed a similar story. They were fishing seperataly as they could not find each other in the dark. Does this mean it was a UFO I dont know, but whatever energy was coming from the light source was repelling lead weights. Not wanting to look foolish they made discreet enquirys with the locals asking such questions as ,has anyone ever noticed anything strange on the beach late at night. But apart from telling them that their was a lot of spanish Galleons wrecked on the cliffs, and people sometimes say they can hear the screams of the dying. But that of course is just local folklore.It has facinated me to this day and I am so disappointed I missed out on that experience, of course I would have been just os scared as my friends were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just curious to know has anything similar ever happened to anyone else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then another one appeared (2 minutes later, perhaps obscured by trees initially) at about 30 or more miles north (or to the right of the first-seen sphere) but exactly at the same elevation as the first-sighted sphere, and also complelely stock-still in the sky.  I then instinctually knew this was extraordinary, and pulled off the road to observe, after seeing this for a total of 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After one minute, both spheres simultaneously moved toward one another, at a steady, very slow speed, in a totally steady linear path, over 60 seconds, then met exactly together and remained the same size and brightness as if superimposed but without change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now one, it slowly became smaller, as if moving to the west, but not changing directi! on or moving ( remained very still).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared over the next 30 seconds till not visible.  No sound was apparent.  No wobble, not corona, no glow.  It seemed that the golden light was self contained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked like a huge barrel tumbling through the air there was no sound or anything the sighting lasted a little over a minute as it pasted over our head to the hill on the other side of the road. I think it was several minutes before we could talk we were in such unbelief.  The next morning I called our radio station to ask if anyone esle had saw anything.  The Radio station said nothing had been reported.  The next day which was Sunday morning I pick up a new paper I can&#39;t recall if it was the Winston Salem Journal or the Charlotte Observer and noticed someone else had saw something.  However I didn&#39;t report it till now if.  I really do not know what we saw .  Thanks so much for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I was young, I used to lay in my front yard and look at the sky at night.  Very often I would see these exact objects.  They remained stationary, but slowly rotated (like a wheel).

It was like it was looking at me. I was shocked that no one in the houses all around the feild where not outside looking at it! I slowly moved off the street to sidewalk looking at the thing the hole time. Then i felt the hair on my body stand up. I started to run as fast as ive ever run down the street to my home. I ran inside to tell my mother and father what i saw. I wanted them to see it but was afreid of something bad happening. Thats pretty much it. Havent told many about this. But my mother remembers it well. The object was around 50 to 75 feet perfectly round. It had lights that kind of remind me of r2d2&#39;s head of star wars. I remember 1 bigger light near the middle. They were blue red and white in color. the other parts where all dark looking metal. My fam! aily lived in a house near a path that crossed the feild. Our dog was chained up towards the feild behind the house. After we moved down the street it burned down. My father had &#34; given my dog away to a farm.&#34; before we moved. I was around 9 years old. I remember it like it just happend today. My life changed from that day on.

My mom and I took a trip out to Phoenix to pick up our dogs from her boyfriend at the time.  I was outside playing in the apartment complex with a bunch of other kids.  This craft of some sort came out from behind the left side of the apartment building.  It was hovering low but it made no sound.  It moved super slow and seemed to be there forever.  Long enough for all of us kids to go get our parents and they were standing out there looking at it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember if I walked closer to look at it but it seemed to me that if I had stood on the block wall that circled that apartment complex I could have touched it.  I think it had lights that went around the edge of it.  I don’t remember what shape it was just that it was dark and like nothing I had ever seen before.  I don’t remember feeling afraid or in danger.  I can’t even remember it going away or if it was there so long that I lost interest. I remember everyone who was standing in the driveway looking at it was very calm, very quiet and I don’t remember ever discussing it with anyone until recently.  My mom even remembers it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone in Phoenix at that time saw that same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was approx. 20:00 and I was standing in my aunts living room staring out the window at the rain passing through the light of the street lamps. I love looking at the rain.  I then noticed a spherical shape in the sky.It was pretty small and I can only assume it was very high.  It looked like a miniature unar eclipse.It was dark in the middle and had a faint light all around the edge.  It then started to drop toward me, getting bigger in size as it got closer and closer. The size grew dramatically starting from a tennisball size to about 50 ft in diameter.It looked like it was going to hit the house!  At that time I jumped from behind the couch where i was standing and screamed for my parents!  I think it was my mom that came to get me and told her what i had seen.  She obviously did&#39;nt believe me.  I later went back to the window and as quick as the UFO appeared,it had disappeared.  I do remember that it was dark grey in colour as it got closer and looked like it was also spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 years later I was watching the news(Netwerk) on TV with my dad and there were reports of UFO sightings in another area of the country. There were also a few photographs on the screen.And the picture was 3 ball shaped objects that looked EXACTLY like the one I had seen!  I told my dad that what I had seen ewas true, but he just shrugged his shoulder and left it at that....

My friend and I just got into a old style hot tub when a wierd feeling cameover me and I happened to look out over the horizon to see a saucer shaped aircraft hovering at about 500 yds or so. It was a shiny silver color and was prefectly areodynamic. It had two lights on it that would spin around the sharp middle part to where they would hit each other and bounce back and forth. It made a light humming sound like the sound of electricity flowing. The UFO moved very slightly left than right a few times and in a flash it was gone. I know what I saw and it was NOT an aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen before or now. I currently work on F-15 eagles for the government. I&#39;ve never, until today, told anyone but my wife and family about my experience. I think it&#39;s time to find out what I saw was military or alien.<n>

After several years of denial, my father recently confirmed that he too witnessed the following events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After leaving the local convenience store heading towards Leonard, I noticed a cylinder like object hovering nearby.  From my perspective, the object appeared to be the size 18-wheeler.  The object was stationary for about 3 minutes and proceeded to parallel us as my father drove towards downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the object for about 10 more minutes towards Leonard.  We continued seeing the object moving slightly faster than we were driving.  About half way between Trenton and Leonard, the object moved south west over an empty field, staying at the same altitude, and rapidly moved upwards vanishing into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not resemble the traditional UFO flying disk shape.  The object was shaped like a flattened blimp.  My father described it more as an elongated egg.  I remember that the object was red with many lights--red, white, and possibly blue).  The object was glowing with a dim red.  The edges of the area were glowing a darker red.  Additional red lights flashed in a random pattern at the bottom of the object.  The white lights were along the side of the object.  I believe that the blue or green lights also were along the bottom of the object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the initial sighting when the object was hovering, the object appeared to have a metallic-like texture with at least one horizontal crease.  It&#39;s hard to describe, but the object was more than a form of light; it had an odd, wavy, gridded, metal-like texture to it.  The white lights did not appear round, but rather small squares.  In retrospect, the white light may have been the illumination of the horizontal crease.  The lights also did not appear to illuminate the surrounding area.  I could not see any wings or propellers--as would be on a helicopter.  The object did not make any sound and despite how close it was.  It also did not disturb any of the surrounding trees.  A helicopter that was as near as this object was would have been audible and disturbed the branches on the surrounding trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, these events occurred many years ago and I wish that I had made a more detailed observation of the events at the time.  However, I was a child at the time and only recently had these events confirmed by my father who was reluctant to discuss these events.  It would be incredibly helpful if others could guide me in the research of this event and other events similar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We had finished eating and were enjoying a swim in a stream that ran along one edge of the clearing. The clearing was about 150 yards long and varied in width from 10 to 30 yards.  The weather was warm bright and sunny when we notices a shadow start to pass over us we looked up expecting to see clouds forming, however what we saw was a large dark grey metalic object triangular in shape with sides that appeared to be approx. 80 to 100 feet in leangth. The underside surface had some irregularly spaced protrusions of an unidentifiable nature. No windows or artificial lighting was observed. The object was moving at about a slow walking pace.  No sounds could be heard coming from the object, however as it passed overhead at an estimated altitude of less than 250 feet, a low subsonic humm could be felt more than heard. As the object passed overhead our tape player died. we assumed at that time the batteries had died. After the object was out of sight we noticed that the two digital watches in the group were no longer functioning, the one analog watch was still working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning to our submarine we put new batteries into the radio/tape player even with freash batteries and later pluged into an outlet the divice refused to function. The same thing with the digital watches.  Also all of the audio tapes that we had with us were now blank and we were unable to record on them in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us had cammeras and attempted to take photos.  The photo lab that attempted to develop the film told us it looked as if the film had been exposed to x-rays as all the film we had with us was &#34;fogged&#34; and no prints were possable this included film that had been shot earlyer in the day and was no longer in the cammera and new film that had not yet been opened when the incedent occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/85 13:00|Prineville|OR|Other|15 minutes|Small silver pyramid object just above the power lines observed for about fifteen minutes in the mid 80's|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36108.html|69|ndxe198506| Small silver pyramid object just above the power lines observed for about fifteen minutes in the mid 80&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had this siting years ago and have told many friends about it but have never made a formal report but am doing so now per the Coast2Coast request tonight.  I was about twelve or thirteen years old and my younger brother and I were washing and waxing the car and boat, which we did every summer before going to the lake to water ski.  After finishing I went inside the house then my brother came in excitedly telling me there was a UFO outside and I thought to myself, &#34;Yeah, right!&#34; thinking he was messing with me.  I reluctantly went out and looked up into the sky where he was pointing and saw a perfectly shaped silver pyramid floating about ten or fifteen feet above the power line next to our driveway (only forty or so feet from where we were standing).  The pyramid was about five or six feet tall, had four sides, three of which were dull silver and the fourth which reflected the sun in our eyes every time that side of the object turned our way.  The object was heading East at a leisurly pace and we could walk to keep up with it.  After becoming fairly confident it wasn&#39;t going to jet off I ran inside to tell my parents and ask them to get the camera (we had a fairly strict family and I wasn&#39;t allowed to touch my dad&#39;s camera) but my mom thought I was joking so I ran back outside to watch the object slowly move across the sky.  About fifteen or so minutes into observation the object simply vanished.  Over the years I&#39;ve tried to find out if others have seen the same thing but have found only a few marginally similar reports.  Needless to say since becoming an adult I always travel w/ a 35mm (now a Nikon D100) because I don&#39;t want to miss the opportunity to capture something like this on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/1/85 10:00|Seoul (South Korea)||Other|3 minutes|Silver, upside down T-shaped flying object hovering low slowly and quietly then flew away in about 3 minutes|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59837.html|71|ndxe198506| Silver, upside down T-shaped flying object hovering low slowly and quietly then flew away in about 3 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were lying down on our front yard to read books. Then I saw a flying object silently and slowly flying across on the top of our house. I was immediately struck at how low it was flying and how quiet it was. Our house was located at the edge of a hill, so I immediately ran up to the rooftop, which was easily accessible through the upper room. I grabbed a small, juvenile telescope from the upper room and tried to examine it more closely from the rooftop. By the time my brother and I were on the rooftop, it was slowly hovering across the town towards south and then quickly sped higher into the cloud and disappeared little later. Here is the description of what I saw through my telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completely silver in color, and it was an upside down T-shaped flying object.  A drawing would be better to explain how it looked like, but it looked like two large cylinder pipes stuck together to form a shape of letter T. The ends were rounded off. Although it was somewhat hard to tell how far it was from where I was standing when I started examining it with my mini-telescope, I think it was at least 12 feet in diameter at the base. There were no windows, doors, or any blinking lights. However, some black letters were visible across the bottom of the flying object. I still remember how the characters looked like, and even to this day, I have yet to see any human scripts that resemble those characters. I have gone through http://www.omniglot.com to find any scripts that may look familiar, but I couldn’t find any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have kept this information to myself over all these years, because whenever I would tell someone about it, I was made fun of, and even my younger brother, who was with me at the time, seems to recollect very little about it. That’s probably because I was the first one with the telescope and by the time I gave the telescope to my brother it was farther away and he had trouble locating it on the view. I decided to make a report on this website, because I have not seen any other UFO sightings where letters were involved, and in this type of shape. I’d be able to recognize those letters if I were to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw this staationary light in the sky that we thought was a helocopter. We picked up some smokes and headed back to my aunts who lived in the core area. When we looked into the air the light was still there. It appeared to come closer and more clear. We coould see a honeycomb under the disc, and it hummed and hissed as it floated in the air. It floated there for a few minutes and gradually all the neighbors were out on the streets looking up at it. Oooo. Ahhh. What is that? A UFO, it&#39;s a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway it hovered for a few minutes and suddenly it flashed a very bright pinkish light from there honeycombs underneath., It shot rings of light from unterneath, one after another, you know like the way the transporter looks in Star Gate. Very quickly and in the blink of an eye it flashed and zoomed up into the evening sky. I always wondered what the heck could build such a craft and I would imagine how it would be to fly one. A memory I will never ever forget, thats for sure... I never had the opportunity to share this with anyone on such a large scale as the net, but that was not the first time I saw one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a time even earlier when I was a young lad back at home in a village in central manitoba. A brisk winter night. My brother, his girl friend and myself looking up at the sky saw an amazing light show. This experience too, is etched into my mind. About seven lights flew in formation across the sky from the north east. Suddenly they all shot off in different directions. I believe that it was in  seven different directions and then they all came back together at amazing speed and bounced off each other, as it appeared, and went in all directions again. They did this about four times before flying off for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well anyway, thats what I saw and I know that I am not crazy.. If I had a paper I could even draw it for you, I believe!!! There have been numkerous sightings in our region throughout the years and some of these UFOs even come only meters above the houses. I wonder what they want? What ever they are they must be man or flown, or what ever by super intellegent beings from another place or time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were walking slowly and talking, when I looked to the sky and saw two red fireball like shapes making manouvers around each other. It lasted for about five minutes. My friend got very scared and asked me what that was,but I couldn´t answer. It could absolutely not be an airplane lights or some atmospheric &#34;thing&#34;. The object were clearly seen and we had enough time to make sure we saw what we saw. After five minutes, objects separated - one flew to (apx.)north and the other one to (apx)south. We watched them flying from each other and disappearing from the sky in the distance. I remember that as it happened yesterday and I certanly won´t forget it as long as I live. I will not send my name,but I will soon send you an hotmail account so you can further question me on anything you might find important.

Lying o|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17668.html|74|ndxe198506| For days the news reported the comming of a meteror shower. At approximately 11:00 PM, my wife and I retired to the south lawn. Lying on lawn chairs facing skyward, the night sky was filled by hundreds of shooting stars; As the night wore on, the stars increased dramatically. My wife screamed, &#34;Oh my God, the North Star is falling,&#34; looking in the direction her face was frozen, I sited what appeared to be a meteror blaseing through Earth&#39;s atmosphere; a tear drop trail of flame trailing behind. After entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere the glowing meteror landed at approximately 20,000&#39; above Earth&#39;s surface, the glow dimmed, and the meteor began a slow desent, at what appeared to be 30-50 mile north of our position. Perhaps, above the remote area of Coperopolis, California. The meteor did not touch down, however it ignited several thousand acres of grass fires, in the range land around Coperopolis, which burned for weeks following the siteing. The meteror became what appeared to be the landing light of an approaching aircraft, flying staight ahead south, while sweaping east to west. At approximatelt 1-mile north of our position, my wife and I tossed all reason out the window, and agreed to remain still, as the UFO approached at approximately, 4-feet below our eve line, rising approximately 20&#39; above the eve line. The craft passed at appoximately .5 to 1 mph, as it approached there was no sound, however, the earth shook erouptly. The approximately 200&#39; craft passed slowly, at a snails pace. Approximately, 1/4-mile straight ahead south the craft arived over the Stansilaus river, at which time it bolted skyward, without a soud, at the speed of light. I recall thinking that the craft would be over Chicago within moments. (Professionals, former flight-line, El Toro.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
