I could see the cigar shape with each blink of the strobe like light. we heard no sound at all. the ditches were alwas full of water in this area so there was always lots of insects and frogs there.my grand father lived about a mile from the site so I knew the area well. I was 18 and my friend was 17 at the time. after about 20 min, the craft rose into the air and started to move away slow at first and then all of a sudden it simply winked into the night sky. that is when my friend and I both yelled at each other&#34;UFO!!&#34; this one and only encounter changed my life and put me on a quest to figure out the truth of life and all I thought I knew about it. I now know what is going on and where we are headed so I have started an online book to tell what I know.<n>

My aunt had a small pamphlet which talked about a group of people in Arizona who regularly meditate up to the skies in hopes of attracting UFO sightings/contact.  My cousin-in-law, who was 16 years old at the time, and I decided to go outside onto the open patio at the southern side of my aunt’s house and try to meditate up to the skies in hopes of attracting our own UFO sighting/contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though we didn’t really know how to meditate, within a couple of minutes something appeared approximately 80-100 feet above the ground, just above the tree line in the southern sky, and it was approximately one quarter mile away from us.  It looked like a glowing light, and it was moving slowly from the east to the west just above the trees.  There was no definable shape to the object other than that it was a glowing round light.  (If you were to elevate a lighted Volkswagen Beetle one quarter mile away and suspend it above the trees, that is what the approximate size of the glowing light could be compared to).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we saw the glowing light, we jumped out of our chairs and exclaimed to one another that there was something up in the sky.  My cousin-in-law immediately ran into the house to beckon the rest of the family to come and witness what we were suddenly seeing.  I remained behind, on the porch, and watched the movement of the glowing light.  It proceeded to move to the west, and just as the first of the other family members was coming through the door to the outside, the glowing light dropped down below the tree line, making it impossible for anyone else to see it.  My cousin-in-law and I implored the others to believe us, that we had indeed seen something out-of-the-ordinary, but there was no visible proof anymore of what we had seen only a minute before.  Most of our family returned inside to their party, laughing at what they thought was our feeble attempt at a UFO sighting hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In good faith that we had indeed seen something, and in an attempt to be supportive, one of our other family members jumped into his car with my cousin-in-law as navigator, and they drove off to circle the location of the house and the sighting by driving around the large country block.  When they returned they spoke of seeing only a bright light anchored to a telephone pole above one of the neighbor’s homes.  (The light anchored to the telephone pole was not visible to us from my aunt’s house.)  They did not see a glowing light moving in the sky.  And neither did I see the glowing light again that night, or any other night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It suddenly dissapeared with a very fast vertical movement. no sound heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one or two in the evening, in broad daylight, no clouds, object was seen hovering nearby mountains, not above but in front and then behind of the top, particularly strange movements, pendulum-like, fast and then slow.  Cylindrical shape, clearly metallical and shiny like polished aluminum, no lights, perceived some rounded form in the middle, perhaps ring shapes on the top and bottom, probably sizable object of about 20 ft. long and 6 ft. wide.  No balloon, aircraft or any other object in the sky.  Was observed on rural area of Peru.  Object clearly seen in front of mountain background, no sound heard.  Object aparently disappeared but witnesses perceived very fast movement upward, in a northern direction. Event happened when I was about 12 or 13 years old, in 1966 or 1967, maybe thirty years ago. I just want to know if this kind of object or similar sighting exists in your archives or database.  It not only was  real, is a vivid image that for 30 years I been wondering about. I don&#39;t want explanations, I am not an ufo believer, but I have seen what I have seen, nobody believes it really, but for me this is not a matter of faith, is just something I saw as a boy and can&#39;t find no explanation for it. Please let me know about it, specially this rather strange object, diffrerent from the classic ufo&#39;s that everybody knows.<n>

I was staying overnight at my cousins house in Waukegan Ill. I heard the humming and went to the window when I saw 2-3 circular discs hovering outside my cousins window, I ducked down then peeped up over the window sill and within seconds they left. I never told anyone cause I thought they would think its teenage imagination or anxiety irationaly behavior.But I know what I saw and I&#39;ve kept that buried with me for 40 yrs. To this day I know what I saw was real and haven&#39;t told anyone. I believe space continues and I was not afraid. Thank you, Kathryn Slododzian fessing up after<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was a warm summer evening, clear sky, no clouds, after dark. Others present were a neighbor aprox 20 yrs old, also my mother and grandparents were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> we observed a very bright light as bright and large as a 747 landing light would be if the plane was maybe 2000 feet up. (no airports within 200 miles of that location) brighter than any star in the sky and made no sound. the strangest part of this sighting was the flight pattern. it started in the south west coming from what would have been new mexico and flew in perfect uniform stair steps making sharp 90 degree angles  as it flew diagonally across the sky from southwest to north east in the direction of main and vermont. if you held your arm out full length and measured the distance each stair step covered, it would appear about the length of a finger. Of course how far in miles that would be depends on how high it really was flying above the earth. To my knowledge there was no flying machine on earth at that time that could make 90 degree turns repeatedly in mid flight other than a helicopter, and if it WAS a helicopter with a light as bright as the one we saw, we would have heard the sound AND seen more than one light. the same goes for a plane, if it was a 747 or other jumbo jet with that bright of a light we would have heard sound, and no normal airplane jet or otherwise could turn a perfect square corner let alone do it repeatedly in short succession. we watched as it went all the way across the entire sky diagonally and dissappeared in the far north east. I reported it to both the police and the newspaper. There was an article in the paper the next day saying that there were similar sighting across the united states the same night, in the corresponding states to the ones that would have been covered by the flight pattern that I observed. I have been interested in UFO phenomenae all my life since my early teens, and have never seen any other reports of this strange stair step maneuver. if you have heard of any other reports like this I would very much like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/66 22:00|Malibu|CA|Triangle|10-15 seconds|Huge triangler shape object seen up close over the tree line in the Malibu mountains in 1966|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40935.html|6|ndxe196607| Huge triangler shape object seen up close over the tree line in the Malibu mountains in 1966<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time this event happened I was attending a weekend summer camp put on by the Santa Monica Boys Club, in Santa Monica California. The camp was held in Santa Monica / Malibu mountains. This camp was only a Friday to Saturday night sleepover, returning late Sunday afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time this event happened I was about 10 or 11 years old. Most of the kids in the camp were a similar age, give or take a couple 3 years up or down. In any event this would make the year about 1966 or 67.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night that this sighting happened, I and a small group of kids my age was walking back to the camp sight, which was a ranch where we bunked. I and a bunch of other young campers had just come from a scary story telling sessions by the camp counselors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had all sat around a camp fire, maybe 50 - 60 kids as they told us these stories. When the session broke up we all headed back along the trail by which we had came . This was a tree line trail where the trees, pine I think, were a least 75- 100 or so feet high, maybe even taller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The elevation where we were at in the mountains was about 6500 feet. I remember this because the counselors told us the air was going to be very thin up where we were going when started the trip. It was very dark, but you could see by the star light okay. We might have had a flash light, but of that, I&#39;m not sure of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next though I am sure of. I was walking back to camp with about 6 or 7 other boys about my age. The rest of the group with the counselor were spread out on the trail in front or behind us at some distance, but none were close enough to been seen, but could be heard. Suddenly, some one in our group spotted a bright light in the distance through the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all thought it was a star, but someone said it way getting bigger. As we watched this light get bigger and bigger, very quickly, say in about five second or so, it went from looking like one of the stars in the night sky to a giant dark triangular shaped craft zooming directly over our heads in what appeared to be 2 - 3 hundred feet above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was huge. It was close. It made all most no sound, but it could be heard, like a whooshzz sort of sound, but definitely extremely quite for  how close and large it was. The bottom of it was line with circular colored lights, I believe red, yellow/white, blue and may be green. They seemed to be flashing a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over our heads we tracked it. Even though up close we only got a good 2-4 second look up close at it from front to back you could see all the detail in it. It was big like a football field. It disappeared in the distance in another three to five seconds, looking like a star again and that was it. We all turned to each other and said  &#34; wow, we just saw a ufo!&#34;  Strangely enough I don&#39;t recall us talking about it to much back at camp and I don&#39;t even recall if I ever mentioned it to my dad. But I can tell you this, to this day I can still see it in my mind as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note about 15 years ago a friend of mine gave me Whitely Stribbers Communion book and told me I should read it. I really had no interest in it, but one night I felt strangely compelled to start reading it. I suddenly came across a passage where he starts describing the object I saw that night. I have since come to find that Art Bell has seen the same object. The thing that is most interesting to me was the time frame when I saw it, the mid 60&#39;s, and where, the Malibu mountains. I mean that still pretty close to a big city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything since, but I have had two freakish events I kind of relate to that incident. The first is, I was house sitting a place in Mar Vista California around the time I started reading the Stribber book. The girl whose house it was, was a film editor. Before she left on her trip we were partying a little at her house. In the bed room she had big sliding doors. Now I admit we were a little drunk but she swears she saw a ufo looking up from her bed through those doors while we were talking. She got very scared. And for some reason, I to seem to get unnaturally scared.  For the next week as I house sit at her  place I could not go to sleep before dawn. I was terrified every night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second event was about 5 years ago. I thought I woke up and saw a gray alien, the ones with the big eyes standing by my side of the bed. My girlfriend was asleep. I got the distinct impression that he (why do I think it was a &#34;He&#34;? ) was surprised I woke up. I got mad and I punched him in the face, then I suddenly fell back to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I thought that was a strange dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some how I&#39;ve always thought that these event&#39;s were connected, but the first one is the only one I can be sure that happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At sleep away summer camp {Surprise Lake near Cold Springs NY on the old Cornwallis estate}.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a strange night.  After the day&#39;s activities we returned to our bunk on a forested hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a light shinning through the window that normally was not there.  My four bunk mates and I did not really think anything of it because it actually illuminated the whole cabin which was normally dark and kind of scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the woods below a place on the hill side called &#34;Bald Spot&#34; a patch of granite where no trees grew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We figured a counselor must have set up a flood light out side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night I dreamed two figures were standing over me looking down at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the left was a typical &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; with almond shaped eye shades and on the right, a round headed, round faced and round eyed looking dude with a mouth stuck in the position like he was saying &#34;oooo.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Roundy Round&amp;quot; had on like a sombrero that made him look Mexican.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; had on a silver space suit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; had a long probe/rod with a round glowing orb at the end of it that he inserted into my forehead all the way to the back of my skull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then looked at each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; pulled the probe back out of my forehead and showed the still attached glowing orb to the &amp;quot;Roundy Round&amp;quot; They both looked at each other bewildered, like &amp;quot;I guess we got him already!&amp;quot; and moved across the cabin to my sleeping bunk mates, visiting each one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; inserted the rod into their forehead, and when he extracted it the orb that had been on the end of the rod stayed in their heads!  Next the &amp;quot;Grey&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Roundy Round&amp;quot; waited at the doorway as all my bunkmates arose like they were sleep walking, and followed them out of the cabin into an intense white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the covers over my head. I figured this is just a neat dream and fell back asleep. For some reason I was not afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all awoke the next day as if nothing had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Very next evening the counselors created an unusual activity for us. They blindfolded our whole encampment{20 kids}. They marched us through the early evening to a geodesic dome structure that was an indoor basketball court.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This they artfully transformed into an alien space craft using aluminium foil, crepe paper streamers, strobe lights and the creepiest rock music they could muster on a portable phonograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat along the inside perimeter of the dome and the counselors who were made up and dressed up as &amp;quot;Aliens&amp;quot; proceeded to abduct us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in on this as one of three volunteers that helped the counselors decorate the geodesic dome &amp;quot;Spacecraft&amp;quot; in preparation for the activity. I had been sworn to secrecy!  Now after about a half an hour of this event the counselors had to call it off, as most of my bunk-mates where being frightened to tears by what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of them actually screaming for their mothers in terror! The counselors could not even console them by showing them it was all a hoax, and quickly had to evacuate the dome to get the children to the safety of the mess hall!  In retrospect I realize now that the whole encampment-19 kids and 5 teen-aged counselors were actually abducted the night the light shined through the window. The next night the light was gone!  The night in question I was left in bed because &amp;quot;I was already implanted or they could not implant me for some reason&amp;quot; The very next day the counselors subconsciously reenacted the whole event. At that time I actually felt left out, because they left me behind. In retrospect I was the lucky one.<n>

The sky wasn&#39;t completely black, but some stars were visible.  We were living on Richford Avenue in La Puente, California.  The sun had just set about a half an hour before.  It was very hot that day.  I was 14.  My Mother was in the backyard swimming alone in our doughboy pool.  I was inside of our house and heard her screaming.  I ran outside thinking she was drowning and she was pointing up in the northeastern sky screaming &#34;LOOK!&#34;  I looked up and saw 3 triangle lights that appeared to be about the size of a quarter to the naked eye.  One was a little bit larger than the other two.  I am not good at judging distance, but they were very high in the sky, at least a mile I would guess.  They appeared to be playing &#34;tag&#34; in the sky.  They were white.  The larger of the two raced across the sky vertically and stopped, and the other two would follow.  The speed was unbelievable.  They went back and forth, up and down for nearly five (5) minutes.  This was over 30 years ago and our technology did not have the ability to dart completely across the sky, hover and then dart the opposite direction and stop again, defying inertia.  After they finished playing tag, all three went straight up in the sky until they were out of sight.  There was no sound.  They were perfectly quiet. I will never forget this, it is etched in my mind forever.  That memory is as clear in my mind today as it was 30 some years ago.  I called the police department to report it but they told me that I had to have been mistaken.  It made me feel very afraid to say anything since that time.  It is something my Mother and I only told our family about and kept it to a very close circle of friends, but I have always wondered if anyone else saw it.  I am a professional person and have worked in law since I was 16 years old.  If only we had computers back then to track things as we do now.  Thank you for this website.  I have waited over 30 years to be able ! to tell someone that might listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I searched the sky over the city to the east and saw a F-104  ((sic--see below.  F-106&#39;s &#34;Darts&#34;)) which I had seen in my area before and was famillar with.  The jet was heading diaganolly across the sky toward the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked toward the front of his flight to see if any other aircraft were with the jet.  I then observed a glowing reddish orange ORB moving in the same direction as the jet but again in front of the jet about perhaps a 1000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared the size of the eraser of a pencil if held a arms length.  The eye could not focus on the oject as it appeared to glow as an ember in a fire glows.  There also seemed to be a counter-clockwise swirling to the glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to slightly turn my head to the left to view the jet and all the while I could make out the features on the jet clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb crossed over the island&#39;s seawall at a point I later measured and found to be 1 1/2 miles from my point of observation.  The only noise I heard was that of the jet and both objects proceeded out over the Gulf.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then heard futher jet noises from the West and turning to look over the city to the west I witnessed two more F-104&#39;s flying only about 1000 ft. above the roof tops as they proceeded toward the Gulf toward the orb in an interception heading.  I lost sight of the Orb and jets as my view was blocked by a hotel that was on the seawall at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting I found out about the A.P.R.O. and filled out a sighting reoprt they had mailed to me later.  I had no interest in this field of ufo &#39;s prior to this sighting.  Thank You<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I stood there waiting for the motor pool to arrive, I saw in the distance what I thought was an aircaft coming in to the base for a landing.  Usually, I would not have taken much notice of this because I had seen many different aircraft night landings.  But because this aircraft (object) had what I thought was a larger than normal white landing light, and was approaching the runway at an unusually slow speeed and wavering in such a manner as if though it were flying through a rough air pocket, I began to take notice of its approach.  Also, I could not hear any sound coming from the its engine.  I was certain that this aircraft was going to crash before it could land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was that this object was a helicopter, and the helicopter had lost engine power and was trying to make the runway to land.  But, as the object appeared over the runway, it just stopped completely in mid air and didin&#39;t move for what seemed like two to three minutes.  The bright light was still shinning but I still could not hear any sound from the engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, the object started bouncing up and down like a bouncing ball.  This bouncing lasted for about 5 seconds.  Then the object stopped bouncing and became stationary for about two seconds.  And, in another split second the object hurled itself about about 25 yards to its left and began bouncing up and down again for another five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then again stopped bouncing and remained stationary for about two seconds.  And again, in a split second, hurled itself seemingly back to where it had stopped in the beginning, and began again bouncing up and down.  But this time as the object bounced, it seemed to stop abruptly in mid-bounce (as if it had just noticed that I was watching it), and in another split second shot upwards into the atmosphere as if it had been shot out of a cannon.  It ascended upwards at maybe a 50 or 60 degree angle and at a speed faster than any aircraft I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for approximately three or four minutes and watched the bright light on this object ascend into the atmosphere and grow smaller and smaller until it became smaller than the few stars that were in the sky and finally disappearing from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

This is at the highest old mountain range in Ontario called the Blue Mountains.  At that time, I had no other friends to play with and I used to wander off into the woods with my 22 Rifle playing Daniel Boon.  The exact date, I cannot remember anymore, but it was one of those hot still bright summer nights that I was out and I was sitting down just looking at the stars.  I was looking North, North West.  At this time, in a cloud less perfect star viewing night, with millions of stars above me, I noticed a bright blue Object that I believe was a satellite, traveling in a South East direction directly overhead of me.  Satellites were known at this time and I often had seen them before.  This time however, the Satellite was being followed directly behind at a distance of, looking up, one quarter of an inch.  The following object was also blue in colour but about one quarter in size and was dimmer.  I watched these two objects until they passed out site still heading south east.  In my opinion, these objects were in near space, and were not aircraft.  I am now 52 years old, an outdoorsman, and a stargazer.  I have seen many satellites since, but never one being followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a cattle grazing pasture diagonally positioned in reference to the restaurant.  With traffic coming and going, suddenly an object that greatly resembled the space craft of the day, (capsule shaped), sat down in the field slowly as fire was coming from the underneath side.  My brother and I stood in awe as we watched.  The craft sat there for what seemed to be five to ten minutes when with fire coming from underneath, it began lifting back into the air and rose several hundered feet, the abruptly turned on it&#39;s side and &#34;shot off&#34; with a great swooshing soud and left a mist type vapor in the air.  Our father, who worked at a metal company only a quarter of a mile from our house was leaving for lunch with a co-worker at that same time and witnessed the same occurrence.  We often still talk about what we had seen as children with our Dad, but to this day, I have never heard any other mention about what we saw that day by anyone in the Hopkinsville community.<n>

This went on for about three minutes then the three disks ligned up side by side, stopped then shot straight up at a nighty degree angle until they were out of sight. I don&#39;t really remember the date. But it was daytime outside when I watched the craft. From the sun&#39;s reflection of the three objects I could see they were mental craft. It was summer, Pacific daylight time and I was walking home after work. I would like to know if this was ever reported by anyone else?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Cape Rosier, Maine, is on the coast and is fairly remote and very rural.  I had a summer job there at a bed and breakfast kind of place.  A friend had come to visit me, and we had been to the 4th of July celebrations nearby.  She was staying in one of the cabins down by the ocean, so we decided to sit on the shore and visit a while.  It was very late – perhaps 11:00 or midnight.  We noticed that across the bay, just above the tree line, there was a big green glowing ball, and it was moving slowly to the right.  We continued watching it until it went out of sight behind us and to our right. This may have taken a half hour.  A few minutes later I sensed something, and I turned to see the green ball hovering above the trees just behind and above us.  Then we heard a splash, and turned to see a white raccoon emerging from the water in the little cove we were sitting by.  It was a big raccoon and instead of being afraid of us, it was coming straight to us. I could see the phosphorescence dripping off his body.  My friend said, &#34;Hi, little raccoon!&#34;  I instantly felt scared and I grabbed her wrist and yanked her up and we ran to the cabin.  We stayed in the cabin for a while, but eventually went back outside.  There was no sign of a raccoon or a light or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we asked people if they had seen the green light, but no one we asked said they had.  I don’t remember seeing anything written about it, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years after that my friend and I would mention that night and wonder what we had seen, and what that raccoon would have done had we stayed put.  Unfortunately I have lost touch with my friend now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just noticed that you asked for background:  I was a 19 year old college student.  This was a summer job.  My friend was a few years older than me, maybe 22 or 23, and I think she may have been teaching at the time.  I can’t remember.  We were both in our right minds, and didn’t drink or do drugs or anything.  This sighting was completely unexpected and unexplainable to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a small sailboat, and we were occasionally rocked by big waves as speedboats navigated close to us.  We had sailed from the east side to the west side of the lake near Dallas Naval Air Station.  We then were working our way back across the lake, but by sunset, the wind died down to almost nothing, and we were somewhat stranded in the middle of the lake.  As it got dark, we worried that some of the speedboats might not be able to see us as they continued zooming around the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9:30pm, I spotted what appeared to be a rather tall yacht coming towards us at a fairly fast speed (30 mph est.).  As it passed us within 40 feet of us, all we could see were several round and lit-up porthole windows facing us.  There was no headlight in front of it.   Although it was eerily silent with no sound of a motor, we were just happy that it had missed us and were more concerned with the waves that would soon hit us, and possibly tip us over.  We all gripped the sides of our boat waiting for the shock waves, but no waves ever came to hit our boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day we have no explanation of the incident, except that this craft that passed us defies any description we can come up with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Just before dark, we (my mother, sister, brother, my mother&#39;s niece and myself) were standing in the yard talking and just looking at a clear evening sky.  We noticed a bright light (about double the brightness of Venus) streaking from the south to north.  It appeared to be very high in the sky.  Just as it got nearly overhead, the (light) divided into two lights and each turned abruptly, one east, the other west.  The turn was immediate, not in a slow arc as you would expect.  Each object then disappeared over the horizon...one east the other west.  We knew we had seen something, but didn&#39;t understand what it could have been.  The speed at which this object moved was not dissimilar to the speed of a meteor, and the objects were gone in a matter of seconds.  From where we lived, the view was probably 10 miles in either direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we approached the main road, we saw dozens of cars pulled off the main road (Rte 165 - 3 miles north of Jarrettsville) and people scrambling up the embankments to watch what we were also witnessing.  The lights looked like the headlights of a very large jetliner, but as it came closer we realized that they were too low to the ground and too big to be jetliner lights. And as it came closer and went overhead (apxy 20-30 feet above us), it had NO sound, NO shape of any craft joining the lights together.  They travelled in unison, going maybe 10-20 mph.  As they drifted silently above us, several of us reached up like we were trying to touch it, it felt that close.  The really strange thing was that after it went over, the lights were still visible (as headlights would not be going in the opposite direction).  Everyone stood quietly mesmerized until it disappeared over the Eastern horizon. When it finally disappeared everyone just sort of looked at one another and let out a nervous whispered giggle and said &#34;What the hell was THAT!?!&#34;  No one knew. When we got to our parents house, my mom called the local airport and also BWI -- and no one had an explanation.  She called the Air Force and they gave several &#34;viable&#34; explanations -- &#34;weather balloon&#34;, &#34;ball lightning&#34; (yeah, right... going 10 mph over a period of half an hour!) and &#34;swamp gas&#34;.  At this point we gave up.  I was probably 12 at the time, but it is still as vivid to me as it was 30+ years ago.<n>

Can&#39;t recall the exact area, but we were from Dover AFB and I recall several outings where troops of other scouts used the same site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our troop consisted of all Air Force Base personell dependents, so we were all intimately familiar with the sights and sounds associated with aircraft and support equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were hiking the object approached from behind, 4 or 5 stories in height above us, silently.  It stopped above us and slightly ahead of our path.  Everyone with me turned and ran back to camp, which was a distance away, as I believe we had been hiking about a half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fascinated with it and stayed and watched it.  It was a mechanical object, with clear textured details on it&#39;s dark grey surface of lines and fixture details you typically see on well represented craft in most scifi craft we depict today.  I would guess it was about 40 feet across.  The center of it&#39;s circumference was about 5 to 10 feet in height, and was lighted with multi colored light banks, that rotated around it&#39;s circumference.  I recall white, orange and green lights in equal rectangle sizes.  I vaguely recall a bank of clear window-like details above, but I can&#39;t remember this detail for sure.  Absolutely silent and with no discernable affect to my position, such as temperature or wind variance.  It was a still summer night, and I am guessing at the month, and may be off by a year at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began to slowly move away and I followed on foot until, shortly it quickly, silently sped away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to camp, to a group of very distressed friends.
