At a round (9:oopm) that evening I notice a light moving from south to north. What was unusual about this light was that it zig zag than move straight, zig zag than move straight again for about an hour til it flew over the mountains toward White Sands, New Mexico.I thought what an ingenious way to avoid radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the date may be approximate.

I only saw the bottom of it as my field of vision was limited by the roof line of two homes.  It was utterly silent.  It had no strobe lights, or port or starboard running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The outer perimeter of the object was lite by a white light.  The interior of the teardrop shape was dark except for three circular white lights; two near the wide end of the tear, and one at the pointed end of the tear.  The object traveled wide end forward.  I have no way of knowing at what elevation the object was flying because I had no frame of reference.  With my arm had fully extended the object would have been about the size of my fist (at the time I was 13 years old).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was completely silent. If there was sound, none could be heard. Speed between 3-5mph moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1967 I was 14 years of age. I am now 46. Am not sure of the exact date because that exact information was lost long ago. I did write it down after it happened and drew a sketch. They (NASA) had just launched a sattelite that morning and we(the neighborhood gang) a small group of five kids including myself (me the oldest) were outside at the corner of N.W.9th Street and 42nd ave. Gainesville, Florida looking at the sky to see if we could observe the sattelite go across the sky. We had seen them before and knew what they were---a light white in color that looked like a star way up there moving much faster than a jetplane in a straight path across the sky. Anyway all we saw at first was stars--the sky was clear--no clouds.... This was on a night where us kids had school the next morning and although it was just after dark, we were stretching our time outside before our parents actually made us come inside for the night. The kennedy Space Center is not terribly far as the crow flies and when the sky is clear, we can easily see the space shuttle shortly after it is launched. But back then there was no shuttle. We could hear a single engine plane landing at the Gainesville airport less than five miles away. I was looking off to the north east and one of the other kids excitedly said &#34;Hey! Look at that...It&#39;s as big as a Battleship!!!!&#34; (Well, it wasn&#39;t as big as a battleship, but there was a large dark object coming our way just above the trees probaly no more than 100ft up at the most and 50-60ft at the least.) When I first looked over to my left to the north the first thing I noticed was some Red glowing lights moving towards us thru the trees. As this thing came out from behind the trees to the clear area over the road we were standing on then we got a clear view of it. Looking at it from directly underneath, it was a dark solid triangle and from my memory thru all these years, each side was of equal length. there was a round red softly glowing light on each corner so that if the lights were not exactly ! on each corner they were very close to the point of each corner. These lights were no more than three feet in diameter, possibly a little smaller 1-1/2--2ft in dia. They were not reflecting off the underside of the object. There was NO SOUND. We were not afraid, but I said &#34;Lets get your parents&#34; and we started running south down NW9th street (the same street we were at the north end of---The same street that my friends lived on) We were able to run ahead of the object so it couldn&#39;t have been moving more than 5mph...It was coming the same direction (south) not directly over 9th street, and not directly over the homes on 9th, but between the street and their front yards. By the time we ran the distance of about 5 homes and quickly got my friends parents out of the house to observe this, this thing had reached our position. The Two parents saw it too as it came over us again. After we raise a fuss over this thing it seemed to rise up higher and level off at maybe a hundred feet or mor higher than we first saw it and it continued on. It never went any faster, but the farther away it got it simply blended in with the sky-- the farther away it got , the harder it was to see until we coult not see it any more. although with binoculars it would have been observable for longer.I could type more details.... but I&#39;m getting tired for now-- I could answer more details easier in person, because there is more to this story as it continues 11 years later-- not with me but someone else and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest over State road 19.<n>

I was following right under it. smooth under belly, definatelly metal, no sound, no vapor trail,than a sudden right turn, no banking,two blocks,I,m still with it, sudden right turn again, I am still with it,1/4 mile back to freeway and end of street. I stoped shut off engin jumped out and watched and listened, no sound,it disappeared over the freeway to the north at aprox. 85. M.P.H. note I was with in 2miles of the Boeing ,space center in Kent,Washington. At that time I was an employee of The Boeing Co.and reported what I had seen to my boss and got no where. I reported the siteing to my father,in upper management with boeing, giving him detailed drawings of the craft. I asked him many times what was hapening to mr report,I got the brush offfrom my own father. my father retired supertindant of Boeing Field, he may not of known anything. I reported the siteing to the goverment as well, there were pictures in the local paper of a ufo taken in the daylight on the same date and poblished in the vally herald news paper and dismissed by the Air Force as model airplains, the photos were what I had seen that nighrt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/5/67 22:00|Hallandale/Hollywood|FL|Triangle|~ 10 minutes|I observed a bright light in the distance that seemed to be making some very strange/irregular/quick movements across the night sky.  T|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05988.html|8|ndxe196705| I observed a bright light in the distance that seemed to be making some very strange/irregular/quick movements across the night sky.  The object kept getting closer as it was heading our direction.  We pulled over off an exit ramp and observed the triangular shaped object silently hovering overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, years ago, sometime between 1967/68, while driving home from a movie with my younger brother and my best friend (actually, my friend was driving, I was the front sea passenger), I observed a bright light in the distance making some very impressive, yet highly unorthodox, movements across the distant sky.  As we continued to observe and we realized we were approaching the object and that it was heading our way too.  The strange motion behavior I&#39;m referring too, is it would appear to quickly race across the sky, come to a virtual standstill, then quickly dash across the sky in another completely different direction, where it would once again appear to just halt in the sky.  It was a single bright light and did not have any flashing lights (typical of conventional aircraft).  This observational phase went on for a few minutes.  Eventually, we realized it was getting real close as we pulled off the highway exit ramp and pulled over.  We were in an old ragtop VW so we didn&#39;t even have to get out of the car to witness what we then saw.  Much to our astonishment, virtually hovering right over our head @ approximately 500-1,000 feet was a single, black, triangle shaped object.  It had lights on each of its three tips, but none of them blinked, and they were all white/yellow in color.  Needless to say, we were all blown away.  We had never seen or heard of anything like what we were now observing.  As we watched, the object literally just floated silently overhead in a very small circle course, right overhead.  I remember verbally describing it in detail to my friend, so we could both validate we were observing, as frankly, it was very difficult to believe, event though we were all seeing ith with our own eyes.  It was black, and totally silent.  It would just slowly hover overhead or just come to a complete standstill.  Becasue it was a clear night and the visibility was good, we could clearly see that it did not have wings and it certainly was no helicopter or any other conventional aircraft.  It w! as simply a black triangle with no markings or flashing lights of any kind.  It was completely silent in the quiet night sky; no prop sounds; no jet sounds.  After watching it for a few minutes, it quit circling overhead and started to fly away slowly.  Then, as quickly as you could blink your eye, it suddenly just shot off into the night sky faster than a bullet, without so much as emitting a single sound.  It was truly an astonishing event to observe.  We were all excited and drove home where we told our story to my disbeleining mom and dad.  I actully called the local police dept. and Miami International airport to tell them what we saw and ask them if they had seen the object or traced it on radar.  Both indicated that they didn&#39;t have a clue about what I described. None-the-less, my friend, my brother, and I all knew what we saw, and it was very real, and it wasn&#39;t anything that we knew existed in conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I learned to just remain silent on the subject, as the usual response was one of disbelief.  Frankly, that didn&#39;t bother me too much, because had I not seen what I saw with my own eyes, I too would&#39;ve had a very hard time believing it.  Then, I saw a special on TV recently (where I got your webpage info) and was totally blown away to discover that other people had also seen triangular UFOs!  Prior to that, I thought all UFOs were circular or cigar shaped, as that&#39;s mostly what was represented in the various UFO books that I had stumbled on over the years.  However, I must confess, that I have always been an airplane bluff and have kept pretty current over the years, so I was totally blown away when I first saw our F-117 Stealth plane.  It made me wonder, &#34;where did the air force come up with that idea/design?&#34;  Also, I have since actually seen the F-117 and though my memory has definitely faded some over the years, I&#39;d guess that the physical size of the triangle we saw, was about the size of an F-117.  However, what we saw was definitely NOT an F-117, as they can hove! r and they are louder than hell.  Needless to say, I am convinced that what we saw over 30 years ago was definitely not of this earth.<n>

We had to take this road that was out in the country so it was very dark. (no light pollution) I was looking out the window up at the stars when I saw this cigar shaped object come from the moon. It was very bright and it traveled from the moon to a star and then stopped for a few moments. It then started again and went to another star and stopped.  At this point I was quite excited and convinced my mother to stop the car at which point she and I got out and proceeded to watch this thing. Much to our surprise, another object shot out from the moon and proceeded to do the same thing except going in the opposite direction.  We continued to watch these two objects do their star stop and go for aprox. 20 to 30 min. until they finally faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother is now 82 and I&#39;m 45 and we both still remember this incident as if it just happened.
