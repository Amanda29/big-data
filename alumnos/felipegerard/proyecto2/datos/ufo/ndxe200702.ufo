About half way to Bethel when I was near East Fork State Park, I witnessed a red pulsing object in the sky some distance away.  As I drove it headed from south to north crossing the road across the sky when it dropped below the trees.  I didn’t see it again until I was entering Bethel I saw it to the north heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudy night &amp; flying below the clouds.  It was a red slowly pulsing light much like you would see at the top of a cell phone tower.  Only it was moving &amp; much higher in the sky then a cell phone tower &amp; cell phone tower lights flash on &amp; off.  I don’t think it was an airplane or helicopter because there were no other flashing lights on it &amp; no strobe like lights on it.  Did anyone else witness this?<n>

We were watching the stars and just talking about life in general when all of a sudden we saw something moving. At first we thought it was maybe a star twinkling or even an airplane until it shot off. The object was no larger than any of the stars and looked no different other than it seemed to be blinking. We laid there in complete awe at its ability to dart in any direction, stop, and then continue to move rapidly throughout the atmosphere. It seemed to only stay in a small area of the sky rather than move around to many different corners of what was visible. We watched it for probably twenty minutes until it seemed to just disappear. We couldn’t find it in the sky anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/07 20:30|Sarasota|FL|Disk|10 - 15 seconds|Round- Disc Shaped Craft  with 4 - 5 windows or lights, hovering silently in lower level of clouds|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57075.html|3|ndxe200702| Round- Disc Shaped Craft  with 4 - 5 windows or lights, hovering silently in lower level of clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 8:30 p.m., Wednesday evening, February 28th, 2007, Sarasota, Florida. My husband and I were driving North on McIntosh Road, South of Clark road, having just left the Sarasota Square Mall, when in the sky all of the sudden we could see an object light up. It appeared to be round and have 4 to 5 lights or windows from the one edge we could see. The ship was fairly close to us and somewhat large, and then it just turned off. My husband said to me, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;, I replied &#34;I sure did!!&#34;. Then it &#34;turned on&#34; again and after another 3 or 4 seconds turned off again. I was desperately feeling inside my purse for my digital camera without taking my eyes off the area of clouds from which this was occurring. As we were still traveling I had to look out my window (which had been rolled down already due to beautiful florida weather)and look back because the object never moved, only hovered and did not make a sound. It never came back on again and I told my husband to stop and go back, but having our 3 children in the car, he did not want to. There are no towers or anything in this area. It was a clear night just a few clouds in which the object lit up. I still can not believe we saw what we saw... I can assure you of this though... this was not an airplane, or helicopter, or lights from some grand opening... this was a rounded, &#34;disc&#34; shaped object that humans have not built yet, (at least that i know of)The ship was fairly close to us and somewhat large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Normally I wouldn’t have paid any attention, except there were no flashing lights and they were very low to the ground I’d say close to three hundred feet off the ground.   They were very still and seemed to be motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to pull into the parking lot of the grocery store so I could get a better view.  I pulled to the side where the field was and sat facing the field so I could observe this.  The whole time I was speaking on the phone to my boyfriend.  When I finally parked the car I could see that these were not just two big lights rather they were a multitude of lights arranged in a triangular shape. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that from the hwy behind me, no noise as that of a plane could be heard. The first craft began to move south at a slow pace. I’d say at a maximum speed of 10mph. Then a moment later the second craft followed. The first craft had a row of four white lights, then a row of three, the middle light on this row was red. Then a row of two lights and one light to complete a triangle. The red light in the center of the craft was blinking, but all other white lights remained solid and consistent. The second craft was exactly the same as the first one, however it lacked the red light, only white lights in the shape of a triangle. As the crafts moved over head you could make out a faint shape around the triangle, the only way you could even notice was that it would block out stars as it moved even though the triangle part wasn’t over the star yet. Both craft continued at this slow pace until I could not see them from the front anymore and then they became invisible in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t have anyone else in the car, nor did I have a camera. Believe me I wish I had both! Where I live is close to Red Stone Arsenal (military base) and Huntsville used to be headquarters for NASA. So I can’t say that it wasn’t a military plane, but it sure wasn’t a plane as we know it today. Either way UFO or secret plane I have never seen anything like it in my life!<n>

But on this night I now believe they are real.  We went for beer after work at a local bar near to the sea side, after about ten minutes somone beside me said what is that in the sky above the sea.  I looked over towards the sea then sighted about 18 small low lights orange in colour all moving at exactly the same speed and all the same in size.  We moved closer towards the lights to get a better look it seemed to me that it was one very big object then it sunddenly went dark<n>
2/28/07 19:22|Gila Bend|AZ|Light|5 Min|Four lights in the southern sky, one stationary and the 3 others had a methodic illumination pattern.  ((NUFORC Note:  Flares??

I was west bound on Interstate 8.  At 7:22 PM at mile marker 89.5 I saw a light appear to my left in the sky at approximately 30 degrees and what appeared to be approximately ¼ mile away. I saw this one light appear and my first thought was, &#34;It must be a radio tower.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second light appeared right next to the first light.  Approximately one second later a third light appeared.  The lights then went off in reverse order then came back in the order in which they appeared the first time.  In all there were four white lights.  One was stationary and the three appeared and disappeared in a methodic manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not totally black out as there was a nearly full moon.  I could make out that it was a craft of some sort as it appeared to rotate slowly. It made no sound. Then, suddenly it was like someone turned off a light switch and it was gone. I got on the phone with my wife and explained to her what I had seen. While on the phone with her I was looking around the sky trying to locate the light. I looked to the North (the complete opposite direction) and way off to the north on the horizon I could see the same light pattern. In both instances the object did not appear to be traveling in a certain direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back from Somerton AZ two days later I carefully reviewed the area where I had made the sighting. There were no mountains, No towers and no homes. There was only open desert and a cow every so often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my dad in Indianapolis after speaking with my wife that night. I began to explain what I had just seen and in the middle of me explaining he chimed in and finished my sentence. He said he had seen the exact same thing about 30 years ago in Greenfield Indiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if there were any other sightings around this time period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed, but the first possibility we would want to eliminate is military flares over Gila Bend Firing Range, to the southwest of Phoenix.

I told two other people that our friends are back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go outside to see if it was a plane heading towards us.  The bright light was about 30 stories high and maybe a half mile away (west of woodburn.)   The item was stationary in the sky.  I went back in side and asked the girls to come to the window.  We observed the bright light for about 30 minutes.  Durring this time my sister in law recieved a phone call and left the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later a neighbor went into his backyard and the bright light went away from and started to fade. As soon as the neighbor went back inside the bright light came back and was bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 minuter later the object shot away from us and was gone.  It was gone in a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This bright light has been seen many times in the last two months in the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??

It was roughly the same size and intensity as Venus (which was visible off to my left) travelling from north west to south east.  No aircraft lights were seen on or near the object as would be expected from a conventional aircraft and before leaving our sight it blinked very quickly once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove off in the direction of the light but never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before we were out walking in a snowfall and saw five bright blue flashes that lit up the entire sky (cloud covered).  These appeared to not come from any one point but seem to light up the entire sky like a flash bulb.  This after a relatively quiet time in Sonora regarding UFO/strange activity (several things seen in past year).<n>

I was so startled that I almost hit the carport. I stopped there and got out of my car.  They were almost directly over my head and barely over the tree tops.  They were moving about 10-15 mph.  There were steady lights on each corner with a blinking red light in the middle.  There was no sound!  For an aircraft to be that low and not make any sound is amazing!<n>

We were making our approach to Atlanta Airport, but still about 75 miles out.  I saw a bright dot outside the window that I took for Venus because it was sort of scintillating.  Despite the fact there was complete cloud cover that night, I still thought it was Venus somehow breaking through.  It was too bright to be another aircraft, unless it was pointing a landing light right at us.  But it couldn&#39;t be Venus, because we were moving in relation to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for 15 minutes, on and off again, as we &#34;passed&#34; it.  It must have been as far as 50 miles away, so it took time, but it wasn&#39;t fixed like Venus would have been.  And, it didn&#39;t move at all, like another aircraft would have. 20 minutes in, we were coming in for a landing and I could still make it in the distance.  Even at that distance it was brighter than all the other incoming planes.  It was mostly a bright white dot, but I could make out shades of red and yellow that occasionally shifted.  Waaaaaaay too high up to be a radio tower of any sort.  I had a camera, but thought &#34;what&#39;s the point?&#34;  It would just be a dot.

The object appeared to be about 3-5m minimum in diameter, could have been bigger, and was completely shiny with nothing interms of design or edges, a pure metallic sphere and passed over onto my wing side where i saw it, was about 500-1000 ft from me, and like i said about 500 ft to 1000 ft below the horizon and I can definitely see it in contrast to the green background of the ground.  It may have been hovering or traveling at a very slow speed.  With the sun reflecting the front portion of the sphere, I can literally focus on the rear and from there I followed it and made sure it was in fact a sphere and shiny metallic surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was filing a flight plan with St. Petersbrgh Flight Service Station at the same time and was interrupted by the sighting and I filed the report instantly and in the same conversation as with the filing of the plan with no pauses with the station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until now, no news on what it may have been but i was told information was sent to nasa....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She ran inside to get binaculers and the ship turned over with the binaculars we could see so much of this equipment...The metal was very shiney and smooth as if molded..we could see what looked like 5 or 6 engines all spinning in different directions in side those tubes were more tubes spinning in the opposite direction as the big tube..instead of fire coming out of these it looked more like lava or coals being sucked into these tubes.... the engines or what not seemed to stop spinning from the inside tube first then the outside one would stop. it then again appeared to turn and you could see the saucer shape..it fell behind 2 mountians the smoke trail was gone within 10 minutes..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I looked up in the sky I saw a silver looking object which could have been mistaken as a giant beach ball.  It was almost certainly the color that would blend with the sky but distinct enough that you know that it was not &#34;part of the sky&#34;.  It was a very clear day and somewhat average temperature. It appeared to be partially hid behind a cloud.  At the top of the sphere was an illumination of some kind that was almost white in color.  It appeared to be a reflection of the sun.  As quickly as I could ask my daughter if she saw it and then turned back to look at it again - it was gone.  She was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I have never been so surprised in my life.  My daughter thought it was a weather balloon.  However; I do not think that it was a weather balloon at all.

I was looking out our picture window , which is located in the next room, but is visible from the chair I was sitting in.  I like to watch the birds, and have bird feeders in a tree outside this room.  The sun was coming up and was very bright that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 3 very bright lights in the woods across the road from our house.  The lights were very unusual.  They  formed a side ways, ½ circle shape.  No unusual noise was heard.  The lights did not move or change colors.  Most of the trees across from our house are probably 20 to 40 foot tall.  These lights were probably ½ way up the trees, in the dense woods.  We have lived on this property for about 13 years, and I know there are no houses or anything in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had gotten up and was getting ready for work.  I called him to the window and asked him if he could see those lights. I asked him if it could be the sun reflecting off something, and what he thought they were.  He replied it was something in the woods, but he didn’t have a clue what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my digital camera and tried to take a picture, but could not get a good shot from where I was.  He told me to give him the camera.  He went outside and climbed up on a ledge beside the porch and took 2 pictures, then the camera went dead.  We talked about the lights for a few minutes., and then he went back to getting ready for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I set the camera on the table, and started making breakfast. He ate and left for work.  I guess about 20 minutes. had passed, by the time I finished cleaning off the table and washing dishes.  I went back to the window and looked, but the lights were gone.  So I went about my day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I decided to download the pictures to see it they even turned out.  What a SHOCK!!  2 pictures turned out, but in order to see what looks like a space craft, you have to enlarge the picture.  I am having the picture blown up to a 8x10, to see if it will pick it up even better.  I am not a computer expert or anything, so I am not sure how to make the picture any larger on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear I am nut a nut or anything.  And I am thrilled that my husband saw it too and was able to get the pictures he was able to get, before the batteries went dead in my camera.<n>

I saw an object I first identified as a helicopter flying low, approx. 150 to 200 ft. It was yellow-orange in color with multiple bright white lights and a flashing blue light. I pointed it out to my passenger, who was watching it at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was silent and moving at low speed, but accelerated as we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over in the parking lot of a bank and watched as it continued moving, eventually disappearing into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By my observation, it was slowly gaining altitude, as it remained at an even height in relation to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was missing the red/green navigation lights common to helicopters and airplanes, and had a definite solid structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an ex-Navy signalman with practical experience in spotting and identifying aircraft, as well as living a majority of my life in close proximity to SAC bases around the world as an Air Force dependent, as well as living 3 years 1 mile from a major helicopter repair depot.

Object was within 1,000 feet or maybe less by my estimate, &amp; was large enough to be seen clearly. It had a metallic orange color, and was a rounded, triangular shaped solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its appearance reminded me of a kite or a top, although thicker in proportion than a kite &amp; similar to the helium balloons at the supermarket. Although it was observed in a very bright sky, there was not a shiny metallic reflection, and no visible seams, markings, windows, edges or lights. It was positioned vertically, as if it was standing on end, and did not have a horizontal (flat) flight appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed and direction could not be estimated visually with any certainty or accuracy, given the effect of the airliner’s flight speed on perception of movement outside the plane. However, I had the sense that it was flying east, which was opposite the direction of my flight.  At that relatively close distance it was only visible for perhaps 2 or 3 seconds, before the wing obscured further viewing of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was that I thought I was seeing a near miss. Not dangerously so, but too close to be within normal tolerances. It definitely was not any kind of airplane, and if that was a weather balloon, it sure seemed like it was too close to our plane for safety!  I wonder if the cockpit radar registered this object?<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as my background, I am a 46 year old male self employed in real estate consulting. I was not drinking or hallucinating, and have no history of delusional perceptions or behavior. While I can&#39;t verify the object was extra-terrestrial, my observations were clearly identifed to the best of my ability, &amp; it is fairly classified as an unidentified flying object.<n>

As I was driving down the highway, I saw a red blinking light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i didnt think too much of it, just another airplane.  But when I looked up again, I saw that the light was moving very very slow, too slow to be an airplane, and way to close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to it, I saw the outline of a craft, and saw that it was cigar shaped.  I pulled out my cell phone to try to get a picture of it, but i began to swerve and I didnt want to hit a car, so i put my phone away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i passed it, I looked back and it looked to just be hovering over the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was freaked out by the whole thing.

My best guess would be that it was at least 80,000 feet high, and I could not hazard a guess on its size.  I had never seen any star and/or planet at that location at that time, so, that is why it seemed a little strange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was originally a flickering bright electric blue, but then started to fade into a white dull glow. The ten minute episode had the light bright royal blue color turn into a fading dull white color before it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other stars in the sky that night, but with the thin layer of high cirrus cloud over our area, the stars all seemed to be not as bright as usual, and that is why I found the brightness of the “object” strange and a little odd. I pointed it out to my wife, who had the same comment, i.e. – it was quite a bright blue color, like something very electric.<n>

I pointed it out and asked him what it was because I knew it was not a plane but it seemed too large and bright to be a shooting star.  He replied he did not know and we ran to keep watching it as it disappeared behind the view of building but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were chatting for about 5 minutes right in front of my apartment when an incredibly bright, white ball of light suddenly appeared about 100 feet (rough approximation) in the air, seemingly out of nowhere. It looked like a perfectly round sphere, of a pure white light (a white like none I have ever seen before), and had a white tail of light that tapered of at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling in a north-western direction, was totally silent, and quickly disappeared.  It only lasted about 5 seconds but I saw it clearly as I was facing its direction.  My friend only saw it out of the corner of his eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went walking in the direction that it was headed, since it looked like it was going to crash into the ground, to see if we could find anything.  However we didn’t see much nor did we run into anyone else who we could ask if they had also seen it.  We only walked about a block though.  My first impression was a missile (due to the fact that we have frequent military aircraft flybys) or a firework.  But it couldn’t have been either because of the nature of its appearance.  I don’t know what it was but I am thoroughly excited by the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was requested, I am a skeptical individual but have a desire to believe. I can’t claim that it was a UFO since I know very little about the nature of sightings and what-not.  As a kid, though, I was obsessed with them.  My friend didn’t seem too interested and also seemed a bit entertained by my speculations over what it could have been.<n>

In this relat|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55480.html|38|ndxe200702| After years of living and working in the &#34;big city&#34; of Edmonton, I came to live on  my parents&#39; farm in Westlock in 2004.  In this relatively short time I&#39;ve experienced paranormal phenomena captured on film and EVP, AND most recently, my first UFO experience!   Westlock is a small town approx. one hour north of Edmonton, Alberta and the area in which I live is about seven miles from the townsite, free of any artificial light that can hinder night-sky observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This recent episode actually constitutes my second &#34;sighting&#34; of this nature, which occured Oct. 3 2006.  At the time, I was the only one who witnessed the event and at the time wasn&#39;t certain if it warranted a report.)   Back to this January event: I had gone to sleep that evening at about 10 p.m. and woke up at 3 a.m. for no particular reason.  But I was compelled to look outside - something I do almost compulsively now whenever the sky is clear at night. In the southeast sky, above the treetops (mature black spruce about 20 feet in height) was what looked like a very bright star bouncing (or dancing) around - akin to a balloon or bag that gets caught in the wind and remains aloft. I know what satellites look like, and planets and plane lights, etc.  This wasn&#39;t it - in fact, at the time, it was almost like I knew intrinsically that this was something otherworldly, a feeling I have no explanation for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 30 seconds before bounding upstairs and waking my mom. I had witnessed practically the exact same &#34;star-like&#34; performance on Oct. 3 and after telling my mother about it,  she wanted to be informed if it happened again, no matter the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After she bounded out of bed, we both peered out of the 2nd story window and  watched this &#34;star&#34; move in circles and up and down, and it continued to do these acrobatics for a full half hour. Afterwords, it just seem to fade into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t seen it since, but about a week ago I heard what sounded like a &#34;whirly-gig&#34; coming from the direction of the treetops (something a kid would put on their bike or you see in gardens - sounds like the plastic blades of a wind toy.)   It was too dark to confirm what the source was.  For a moment I thought it might be something caught in the trees or a weird wind weather system, but after careful analysis, I&#39;ve excluded those possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, about a week after our sighting, the military have started to do training flights with low-level helicopters in the area and I watched one zoom over our farm about 50 feet from the ground.  This can&#39;t be a coincidence, can it?   If anyone in my area knows anything or has seen anything, please report on this site (I don&#39;t have email at this point!)  Lynda<n>

The sky was partly cloudy.  I saw two white orbs in front of the moon, one after the other.  First one moved left halfway accross the face of the moon and abruptly moved up then disappeared.  The second one followed the same path.  I couldn&#39;t tell how far away they were but they must have been very far because they did not illuminate anything close to the groud.  They didn&#39;t reflect off of any of the clouds and it was quite cloudy and as seen through my binoculars, they did not appear to block any earthshine on the moon.  They appeared to travel vey fast since the whole incident, that is time from when first object moved form left to right and then up over the top of the moon to when the second one followed the same path and was no longer visible.  The whole incident took less than one minute.  Because of the poor &#34;sseing&#34; conditions (clouds, intermitent rain followed by visible stars and then clouds again), distance was quite hard to gauge as was the size of the objects.  Both objects were quite clear in my binoculars and when they crosed the moon they were brighter than the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it was a helicopter with a spot light but as we got closer it appeared to have what looked like three extremely bright headlights.  It was flying at a slow speed as we got closer and were directly under it we could see it actually had two additional bright lights on its belly.  All five lights were round, the same color and were steadily lit.  The aircraft was black and triangular.  It was a clear night. We didn&#39;t hear any sound come from the aircraft but of course our windows were up.  The reason I’m reporting this is because I’ve seen planes fly by in the nighttime sky and they usually have green and red blinking lights.  This aircraft did not.  It seemed to be moving Northeast.   We were so amazed that I pulled into a parking lot, but when we looked back it had disappeared.  How can an aircraft with such bright lights and flying at such a low altitude disappear so suddenly?   I mentioned this incident to a friend and he said that they were probably landing lights, but there are no airports in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; provides only e-address.

This is a current interest of our homeowners association which the Board of Director is now considering for our community.  We live on a 28 acre lake so some members of the Board of Directors were thinking about placing a large colorful fountain in the middle of the lake for esthetics. To support this project, I took my Canon 20D, a high quality 8-megapixel digital camera, and set it up on a tripod at our community pavilion using a ISO or light sensitivity rating of 1600 for night time photography. My photo shoot went well.  I probably spent about 20 minutes getting all the photos I thought I needed. I was not aware of anything in the background night sky as I took my time lapse photos. I was only interested in getting good photos with proper focus and good exposure. It was not until I returned home, took a nap and woke up again about 11:00 PM that I decided to download the digital images from my camera to my computer. As I was going through these images I noticed a fuzzy spot near one of two radio broadcast towers that have powerful strobe lights. The two towers are located about 9/10ths of a mile east southeast of the location where I took the pictures you&#39;ll see below. When I zoomed in on the photo of the radio tower to the left in the photos below I could see that my camera had captured an image of something I&#39;d not been aware of at all when I was taking these photos. While I was taking the digital images I noticed there were some aircraft quickly passing overhead but didn&#39;t think much of it except to curse a bit because of the visual interference. However, I knew I could easily eliminate these streaks left by airplanes by using my graphics software. Below you can see one such aircraft that came into view while I was shooting my photos. It left a visible trai! l in my time lapse photography.  All of my photos, except one or two, were shot using time lapse photography. I used a 5 second exposure time, set the ISO to 1600, the F-stop was set at 5.6 with manual focus set at 55 millimeters. So any moving object in my field of view would have presented a trail, as you see below, caused by the time lapse photography. The UFO I later spotted in my imagery did not move. It was fixed in place as you&#39;ll see below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A plane moves across the night sky on one of my first images of the night sky  (Photo)  Below at the arrow is where you see the movement of that plane during my 5 second exposure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camera is facing southeast. You can see the vertical ground-up illumination of the background sky lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This image was depixelated to enhance the ringed view of the city background lighting effect. I saw this plane in my viewfinder as I was taking the photo. So this plane was very obvious because the lights on the aircraft were somewhat bright. The azimuth of the aircraft heading was about 100 degrees or ESE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> aircraft in flight  (Photo)   At 8:05:40 PM on Feb. 24, 2007 something quite mysterious and unexplained appeared in a series of digital images I took which you&#39;ll see below. An unknown object or UFO  appeared in my images after I came home to view them on my computer. When I describe this as a UFO sighting I certainly don&#39;t mean an alien spacecraft. I don&#39;t even know if this object was flying.  In the context of UFO I mean that I haven&#39;t yet figured out for certain what this particular UFO phenomenon might possibly be. One assumes that the object which shows up in my digital imagery must be some type of unknown aircraft or perhaps some type of light generated phenomenon in need of an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve conducted studies of the physical properties of &#34;light ducting&#34; phenomena which occurs in atmospheric layers and also have considerable field experience in atmospheric physics.  I&#39;ve even written scientific papers on super refractivity and the UFO phenomenon. I spent a two year stint working on a government program to examine UFO sightings reported by foreign governments who sought to understand their own UFO sightings which they reported to the U.S. government. In nearly all cases our government scientists and astronomers could easily attribute a reason for nearly all of these sightings reported by foreign governments.  After considerable thought and research they most often were explained as falling space debris, likely meteors, astronomical sightings of stars or planets or other known celestial phenomenon.  Occasionally these UFO sightings are of earthly origin such as migrating flocks of birds and even large swarms of insects that catch light reflected from earth. Some sightings of insect migration even present radar returns on occasion. So I am no stranger to the fascinating subject of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I&#39;ve been able to tell from my initial examination of my UFO photos of February 24, 2007 --- that you&#39;ll see below --- is that the unidentified object captured with my digital camera remained aloft in my field of view from 20:05:40 PM until the last image I captured of it which was 20:15:52 PM. I&#39;m assuming it may have been present beyond 20:15:52 PM but I just don&#39;t have the physical evidence. I do know for certain that it was not in view prior to 8:02:02 PM because I have imagery of the exact same area and nothing was present in my imagery. The period in which my camera imaged the UFO was over a 10 minute period of time in a very small area of the sky. Airplanes quickly transit the sky as you see in the first photo above. They are very easy to distinguish. However, I was taking time lapse photography and the UFO in view was almost motionless during that 5 second interval the images were made with my Canon 20D. That long dwell time in the sky in a near motionless presence is very strange indeed.......unless the object was hovering or was a very far away. The UFO did slowly move in relation to the tree tops below but this movement was less than 10 degrees as it remained fixed about 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon. This was right above the pine tree tops at a distance away of 1,000 feet. All the time I was taking photos I was unaware of this object in the dark sky. It was almost pitch black sky at 8:00 PM and the moon was not out. Only the small amount of illumination from house lights and street lamps was available. So my vision was not nearly as good as you see in these photos which were taken with a $1,500 digital camera. I used an ISO setting of 1600 and a time exposure of 5 seconds which allowed my digital camera to see what I did not take notice of. The resulting images with a high ISO can literally turn night into day. However, I was not after that effect. I only wanted to capture realistic evening photos so I later could superimpose a fountain onto the lake and then be able to present the im! age to o ur homeowners association Board of Directors. Again, it was only hours after I took these photos that I realized there was something unusual on the digital images that I couldn&#39;t explain. Not only did I see in the images a suspected UFO, but I also saw a very large globe appear in the sky which you&#39;ll see in one of the photos below. This is a phenomenon that I do not attempt to explain except to suggest it may have been some sort of visual artifact within the camera. However, there is this perfectly round globe inside of which is the UFO as observed in several of the photographs. Again, I reiterate that I was not able to see these strange things while I was taking these images. I am able to slight enhance the presence of the light colored globe but have only done so in one image you see below. This globe-like halo effect is the most mysterious thing I see in any of these photos. I am mystified by its unique appearance. I have the original 8 megapixel images on my computer but to make the images you see below I have depixelated them which imperceptibly degrades the quality of the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any seasoned photographer, even an amateur photographer understands that sometimes there are artifacts of light that get into their camera lenses and bounce around.  This sometimes produces visual effects that obviously were not seen with the naked eye when the photo was taken. Often these artifacts are passed off as real ghosts by true believers. I&#39;m sure there are UFO&#39;s reported that are nothing more than extraneous refractions of light that get into the camera and somehow distort images. However, in this case I have 8 photos of the UFO object and all were imaged at high resolution using an 8 megapixel camera. I have all these images in their original native format.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first image I have of this UFO was taken at 8:02:48 PM. The image below shows the UFO with four white lights and what appears to be red lights interspersed between the white lights. The white dot below the object is either a star or perhaps a bad pixel. This UFO object is very large in the sky but it&#39;s really not that bright, certainly not as bright as any of the aircraft I saw flying last night. Aircraft are usually seen as small points of moving light and the aircraft engine noise is sometimes faintly discernable. When using time lapse imagery these aircraft always move along a ray trace on a photograph as you saw above. The unidentified object below, which I never observed visually with my own eyes, was really quite wide. As you see I am a careful not to say flying because I don&#39;t know if it was flying and, in fact, I suspect it was NOT flying because it remained somewhat stationary in the same approximate location in the sky for over 10 minutes.. So I use the term UFO very loosely to suggest the object simply remains unidentified, at least by me. I have measured the angular width of the UFO and determined that it is 1/4 or ) 0.25 degrees (or 15 minutes) in width. For reference purposes the width of the sun and moon are both 0.5 degrees. So the object below would be just 1/2 the width of the sun or moon. Using simple trigonometry it now would is possible to determine what the true width of the UFO would be for any given distance. See the on-line trig calculator at http://www.carbidedepot.com/formulas-trigright.asp . If the UFO was exactly one mile away its width would be 23 feet. If the UFO was 5 miles away the width would be 115 feet. At 10 miles away the width would be 230 feet. At 15 miles away 345 feet. And lastly, at 30 miles distant the width would be about 690 feet which is typical for many cruise ships. Sailing 30 miles off the coast of Florida is typical for these cruise ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The home you see in the photo below is directly across the lake and is exactly 1,010 feet away from where the camera took these digital images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below you see the first appearance of the UFO  (Photo)   The next photo was taken a full minute and 20 seconds later at 20:06:00 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THe UFO seems to have slightly repositioned itself with respect to the bright star which now is perfectly in line with the object. The lateral movement is about 2 to 3 degrees to the right when compared to the photo above  (Photo)  Same photo as the image above. Notice that there are two radio broadcast towers in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The taller radio tower you see in the image above is located along an azimuth of 126.5 degrees (ESE) with ref. to True North and with respect to the camera. The tower is 0.875 miles or 4,625 feet away. It&#39;s calculated height is 438 ft. high. Ground elevation is 26 ft. above mean sea level. North is up in the photo map. The tallest of the two FM radio broadcast towers is located at 28-02-50.50 North latitude and 80-40-31.69 West longitude. It has two strobe lights.  The shorter FM broadcast tower with only one strobe light is 241 ft. high and is located at 28-02-55.08 North latitude and 80-40-32.54 West longitude. It is located 0.82 miles or 4,311 feet from the camera. The azimuth from the camera to the tallest tower with two strobe lights is 132.2 degrees (w/ref. to magnetic north) or 126.5 degree w/ref. to true North. This corrected azimuth applies the year 2007 correction for magnetic declination of 5 deg. 44 min. West for this particular location. The shorter radio tower lies along a magnetic north compass azimuth of 128.5 degrees which also is corrected to 122.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. This means there is 3.75 degrees of angular separation between the two FM radio towers as observed at the point the camera took the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The terminus of the white line is the radio tower with two strobe lights located 0.9 miles away from the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Photo)   Below is a satellite view of the tallest broadcast tower you see with two strobe lights as noted in the images above and below.The measured shadow length of the tower is 386 feet. I suspect that with the sun angle observed that the shadow approximates the actual height of the radio tower. However, when I checked with the FCC licensing for this tower I saw that they only permitted the licensee to have a 100-ft height tower. It therefore may be an illegal height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Photo)  The image below was taken at 8:06:22 PM or about 22 seconds after the one immediately above. The object remained at the same range or distance. I simply zoomed in or blew up the size of the image differently in both the images above and below. The angular width of the UFO remains at 0.25 degrees in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can see in this next photo the UFO is really quite bright in the night sky so it surprises me that I didn&#39;t take notice of it when I originally was shooting these images. But the fact was my wife was cooking dinner for me so I wanted to hurry along and get this photo shoot done and return home. Never in my wildest imagination did I think my images would show the presence of a UFO in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next image you see was taken at 20:14:56 PM EST.  During the post processing phase I digitally zoomed in on the object to see the individual pixels that clearly show that there are four distinct white lights with what appears to be red lights in between the white lights. The lights look to be equidistant to each other. The object is angled at about 45 degrees in this image. I should note that lights transmitted within atmospheric ducts or between thermal layers of air as well as desert mirages often become angled, distorted, inverted or even twisted. In this blow-up it appears that the object is colored both red and green. There definitely are pixels in the image that recorded red and a few also were recorded as green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This appears to be the best image I got of the UFO. To the right is the tall radio tower with the two strobe lights.The UFO is just below the arrow. Using a precision Suunto clinometer I accurately measured the height of the tallest tower to have an elevation angle of 5.4 degrees above the horizon. The angle above the horizon for the shorter tower is 3.2 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The azimuth of the UFO is 119.95 degrees w/ref. to true north and the elevation angle is 5.5 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next photo was taken at 8:15:07 PM. It is the brightest image of this UFO I imaged on Saturday night, Feb. 24th. You can see in the image below that the UFO appears to have been rotated on its axis. Now we see only three white lights.  We also see a red light on the left side suggesting this rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Azimuth of the UFO is now at 120.875 degrees w/ref. to true north  Now something changes in the angle of the object with respect to my camera view of it. The time of this image is 8:15:18 PM, or 9 seconds after the image above was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Photo)  Below is the full view of the object seen just above. The UFO is seen at an azimuth 121.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. Because the sight picture has changed so much it suggests that this is an optical aberration and not some kind of aircraft or alien spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Photo)   Now we quickly see an entirely different view of this object. This image was taken at 20:15:38 PM or some 20 seconds after the image seen immediately above. We now see 8 white lights and perhaps no red lights. Because of the double rows of lights I am inclined to think this is an artifact of light refraction. The image actually seems to have been split and set in parallel rows with four other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the photos that were taken between 8:14:56 PM and 8:15:52 PM there is the presence of a very strange light globe in the imagery contained in five frames. You cannot discern the angle of illumination for the globe in the photo immediately below, but you can see it in the photo that follows the one below. The angle of light illumination is not vertical as one might expect if the globe was the result of city light illumination. This aspect of the photo is very puzzling. The UFO is inside the light colored globe just above the radio tower strobe light. I was not aware of this light colored globe in the night sky when I was taking these photos. It is very discrete and only discernable with time lapse photography. It was much later after I looked at the digital images that the globe was first visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The azimuth to the UFO is about 122 degrees (ref. true North)  The photo below is greatly depixelated to show the angle of illumination on the mysterious globe in the background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the last image I took of the UFO at 8:15:52 PM. It may have lingered for a while longer but I was never aware of its presence, otherwise I would have taken dozens of images of it in rapid succession using 5 second times lapse photography. In this image the previous parallel lines of four lights each now seems to be bent at the near end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY THEORY ON WHAT THIS EVENT WAS:  So what do I think these strange lights in the night sky were? From my scientific field experience in the South China Sea a quarter century ago, I believe the most likely explanation for this sighting was atmospheric ducting phenomena. This occurs under somewhat unusual but not rare circumstances called temperature inversions. What my camera imaged is possibly a light source that was coupled into an atmospheric duct or a laminar flow of warm air inverted above cooler surface air creating a low level ducting channel. This type of duct permits light and even radio signals to be transmitted great distances without any appreciable loss of energy. When I draw a straight line from my observation point where the images were taken along the 121 degree azimuth of the UFO sighting, the line travels towards the Bahamas. In fact it passes close to Grand Bahama Island where Freeport is located.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another possibility is that this sighting of strange lights was possibly a cruise ship at sea about 30 miles from Melbourne, FL. Some of these ships are very tall and could serve as the light source for the UFO sighting. These ships also are very well lit at night. The map below shows various cruise line routes to the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands. They depart for these cruses from Port Canaveral located 40 miles north of Melbourne and head south not far off the coast for some distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Google satgellite view of eastern Florida)   Why was I able to photograph this phenomenon?   All I can conjecture is that for some reason the unexplained light suddenly decoupled from its light channel about where I was located when I took the images.  Perhaps the decoupling out of the atmospheric duct occurred overland and it was simply fortuitous that I was in the right location at exactly the right moment in time.  There&#39;s no doubt that my camera recorded something very, very curious. However, my inclination is to seek a rational understanding and not speculate that extraterrestrials came visiting on February 24, 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll just have to guess that this light show I observed in my imagery was nothing more that light passing over the Atlantic ocean which warmed the air.  The light was then sandwiched by a cold boundary layer of air from land.  This caused a condition of super refractivity resulting in the unusual sighting of strange lights. Below you see a ray trace in red which is the azimuth along which I first sighted the UFO. At the bottom left corner of the graphic below you see a scale which depicts distance in miles. So 50 miles is about an inch on this graphic.<n>

I motioned the security guard to come over.  I pointed it out to him and told him it was the same object I had seen the previous evening at approx. the same time.  We were looking towards the north.  We stood together and watched the object as it hovered and slowly moved eastward (almost drifting like a balloon) around the hillside and dipped out of view.  It was in view for approx two to three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both agreed it wasn’t a star or a plane (the sky was very clear w /a few planes high up).  We both watched it together for approx. two to three minutes before it drifted east and dipped downwards.  The guard said it seem to be over RT. 775 in Ohio.<n>

Nunn (formerly the Cumberland) Parkway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the Gradyville area we spotted an unidentified flying object hovering to the left side of the parkway.  The lights were blue, red and green.  It was an oval shaped object and it never moved...we slowed down, but did not stop as it was kind of scary.  There had to be numerous eye witnesses to this event as traffic was heavy on the parkway that night.  My husband who has never believed in UFO&#39;s asked me to post to this site so we could see if anyone else may/may not come forward about the sighting of this object.<n>

Neither of us responded, believing it to be a reflection of a distant aircraft.  Until it grew in intensity and it changed its shape; now an elongated diamond-shape. This &#39;flare&#39; lasted about 15 seconds and gradually faded, the entire time holding its position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3 minutes the light abruptly dropped about 10 degrees downward and slowly fade out. The interesting thing was that we knew our heading and we knew that due south, precisely where this mysterious light shone, is Vandenberg Air Force Base.<n>

A stange streaking object appeared over his left shoulder and continued across the screen behind his head and then over his right shoulder.  I would have thought it could have been an air plane, but it had a strange flight pattern.  I couldn&#39;t find any footage after the fact, but I do know that the time on the Fox clock at the bottom of the screen was 7:39 AM.  I would guess there is an archive someone could access to retrieve the footage, but I don&#39;t know how.  It might be worth a look.<n>
2/22/07 23:30|Myrtle Beach|SC|Light|25 - 30 sec.|White ball of light over ocean east of Myrtle Beach, then planes to "investigate"|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55448.html|58|ndxe200702| White ball of light over ocean east of Myrtle Beach, then planes to &#34;investigate&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something that was definitely not an airplane, or a seagull, or refracted light from Venus through swamp gas, right after the Slayer show behind the House of Blues, Myrtle Beach (2/22/07). I was perfectly sober though a little tired from the show, so I was sitting on the curb behind the HOB waiting for autographs in a crowd of about 30 people and was facing due E. At the risk of sounding like a fool to these strangers and losing sight of it in the sky by trying to share it, I chose not to draw attention to what I saw. I wish I would have thought to take the camera in my pocket out and snap a few shots, but I was in a state of shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just a hazy light ball and it was definitely airborne because along the back of the HOB is a fence that is at least a little bit taller than I am, but it is also 20-30 ft. away from the curb I was sitting on. Perspective-wise it was a good couple of feet above the fence. Behind the fence and off to the right, (the direction it was traveling), was a light pole some distance away with a light gleaming away in my face, and hotels in the distance along with shrubbery and branches along the back of the fence. It was a windy night, pretty clear and it was sometime between 11:30 and 12:00 AM. I was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette and chillin&#39; facing about E, away from the HOB towards the ocean and checking out the stars. I saw the typical air traffic and seagulls enjoying the windy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a small, faint and hazy white light and at first I thought, &#34;That jet is hauling a$$!!  I’ve never seen a jet moving that fast&#34;, then it struck me how much like a star it resembled. Because it was just a ball of light it was hard to judge it&#39;s size and distance, however if the planes that appeared after I saw it presumably went to the general area it was at, and my own judgement of perspective wasn’t too far off, it was definitely waaay out over the ocean. I checked it out on Google Earth; from the direction I was facing the shore was roughly .7 of a mile away, these planes and my own judgement of perspective put it AT LEAST a mile or more away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s path, from when I first noticed it started out parallel to the earth and traveled like this for maybe 5 seconds. Then almost a 90 degree turn at what seemed to be straight up, then another sharp degree of turn up and away at an angle, then another turn at a downward angle, and yet another at a down and backwards angle, then once it reached about where it&#39;s original path was, it resumed. Half of these turns were in a span of maybe 1-2 seconds, but no more than 3 at the absolute most and the other two were really short. Once it resumed it&#39;s &#34;original&#34; path it faded out after about 3 seconds. Like a lightbulb slowly going out, then instantly it began glowing again, so quickly I never lost track of it. From my perspective it was headed into the gleaming light, but it faded out for about a second, if only for a second and then came back to full glow before it &#34;passed&#34; behind the light pole and remained glowing, so I never lost it through the light. Now, on the other side of the light pole and after about another 2-4 seconds it faded out again for the second time and that&#39;s when I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching for it, but it never reappeared. It&#39;s path was straight, and looked very deliberate, not like it was a trashbag blowing in the wind or another seagull or something. The three things that have me pretty much convinced what I saw is some sort of a UFO is the blazing speed, the ease of the change of direction without even slowing down and that it was traveling in straight lines, not circling or twirling as if something caught in the wind. It was like someone was holding one of those laser pointers in the sky only it was faint and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was glued to the sky, but saw no more. About 5-7 minutes later I saw two planes coming from the N along the coastline or there abouts and heading that direction, about the time they got where it was, I noticed another plane that must&#39;ve come from the SW or that general direction. The two planes from the N went further S and I almost lost them behind the hotels and stuff on the horizon and then returned, while the other plane continued N for a few minutes and returned. I wasn’t sure what I was seeing, so I just stared in disbelief. I thought about telling some of my friends, but decided not to get picked on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I documented this the next morning and waited to see if someone else reported this, but I’ve not seen anything yet.  I am a believer and was before this incident, but still remain skeptical as to what I saw.  If you also saw this, I urge you to report it. I also am attaching various files that may explain this in greater detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then thought I was seeing an evacuation helicopter moving toward Ashe Memorial Hospital, some 7 miles to the west and he had his spot light on for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see any movement laterally, but it seemed to be growing, indicating that it was moving toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the light, it turned off.

I was standing in East Huntington area, Altizer to be exact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my work place for a 30 minute lunch break and I immediately noticed the glowing orange object and I said to myself, &#34;That&#39;s a weird and unusually bright star to be so low in the sky.&#34;  I estimated it to be approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From  my vantage point in the parking lot it seemed to be across the Ohio river over southern Ohio and in The Procterville  or Scottown (if it was further North) area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the furthest end of the parking lot (away from the bright street lights and light washout) to get a better look.  It seemed to be at least 3 miles away or maybe 5 miles away over Procterville.  I kept studying it, as it was an unusual orangey fire color and seem to undulate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the time I remained reserved in my opinion as it seemed to grow and shrink or maybe even pulsate. From the East, a small plane was coming in and going toward the West (possibly towards the Chesapeake airport [a very small landing strip] in southern Ohio).  I could easily see the red blinking FAA light on the left wing as it traveled from East to West or from my right to left, as I looked north.  As the airplane flew from East to West, from my right to left direction), it went directly underneath the orange, glowing object and the object shrank to a small point of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the plane had passed under the object, it enlarged and brightened again and appeared as an undulating, flaming top.  This is when I began to lose my reservations that it was just a low or rising star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it and noted that the sky was clear with visible stars and the crescent half moon but the exception of some moderately quick moving clouds coming from the West.  It was a very breezy also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched until the Object dimmed down its intensity and blinked out in two or three seconds.  It seemed to collapse into itself as it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked some more, scanning the sky to try to relocate it but I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison, the red blinking FAA I searched for it again during my second break at 10:30PM, as I was leaving my job after midnight and again when I arrived at home a short distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my fourth sighting and I have felt &#34;keyed up.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an very good witness.  We have encouraged him to look again in the same area of the sky, at the same time of night, in order to establish whether the object might be a celestial body.  PD))<n>

It was clear out, with a bright quarter-moon and bright stars.  Looking up and in front of me, I noticed a rapidly moving completely silent craft.  The craft was shaped roughly like a somewhat skinny axehead, with the &#34;axe blade&#34; in the front, two fluted sides forming the right and left flanks, and the smaller base of the axe in the back.  The front end, perhaps half the length as the sides, may have been somewhat rounded.  The back end was perhaps half the length of the front end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the craft must have passed almost directly overhead just moments before, I couldn’t hear any sound from it.  It was perhaps nickel-sized at arm’s length.  It did not appear to be self-illuminated, but the moonshine from behind me must have been illuminating it enough for me to see it relatively clearly.  There was a bit of a shimmering appearance to it.  This was not an easy object to see, however.  If I hadn’t been looking at almost that exact spot in the sky, and if it hadn&#39;t been moving, I wouldn’t have noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving across the sky fairly quickly, directly eastbound in a straight line towards Lake Michigan, and within fifteen seconds or so passed out of sight behind the trees in my yard.  I ran down the block to the next clearing, but I was unable to see it again.  I was alone with my dog, and certainly there was no time to get anybody else outside to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d like to encourage anyone reading this to watch the skies, high and low, day or night, for unusual objects.  If you see something inexplicable, get somebody else as a corroborating witness if at all possible!  And get photos if you can.  Call the newspapers and radio stations!  And at the very least, file a written report.  Don&#39;t just keep it to yourself.<n>

However the engines were too loud for a smaller search and rescue type helicopter. So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two &#34;star-like&#34; lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not realize what I was watching until after the event. The two lights were traveling in a very straight path almost as if they were trying to elude the military helicopter, or possibly the helicopter was escorting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event only lasted for aproximately 30 seconds. It took three seconds for all aircraft to cross the night sky over my head. I could not make out any shape around each of the two unidentified lights I am not sure what I had just witnessed, but this was very unusual. I have been an Airworthiness Inspector for over twenty years and in aircraft for thirty, and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I certainly saw something, raced up to tell my brother, and he saw it as well. I was peeking my head out our window to see if Sirius had set yet and to see Saturn, when I noticed what looked like two stars of equal magnitude that I didn&#39;t recognize (not that I&#39;m knowledgeable enough to notice something out of place...it just looked odd). They were moving though, so I thought plane...which would be nothing out of the ordinary, they are always overhead, blinking away. These really weren&#39;t blinking...and the lights were too far apart to be from the same plane. it passed overhead slowly, couldn&#39;t have been extremely high in the sky, on account of the wingspan covering a wide field of the sky. There was a noise similar to the kind of noise you get as a large plane many thousands of feet in the sky passes overhead (you know, you see it and the sound is slower, so it appears that the sound of it is trailing behind)(it was very low in pitch, could be easily heard from indoors, and spooked a few of the local animals, including a cow...which I didn&#39;t know lived so close to us:). I could not make out a shape of the object, just its lights...three of them two on the outside being a very light orange with the third being grayish but not centered in between the two on the outside. They weren&#39;t crisply flickering, I&#39;m not even sure you could say they flickered at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure who to contact, I looked in the phone book under Evansville Regional Airport, but the numbers were for parking employees, Security office...none of them seemed like the right contact for this type of question. Anyways, I just wondered if anyone else had seen it and reported of it, or if there was some kind of way you might forward this to anybody who would be interested or aware of what was flying overhead during that time. I am an amateur stargazer, have seen planes, planets, meteors all the like; but this was quite unusual and worth my trouble to email you, and hopefully I wasn&#39;t to much trouble for you to hear out.

2/22/07 01:00|Summit|NJ|Changing|15 minutes|while driving through the mountains of northern union county, saw a triangle.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58908.html|73|ndxe200702| while driving through the mountains of northern union county, saw a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While i&#39;m not entirely positive of the date of this sighting, it was winter, and after the new year. In any case, a friend and i were waiting to for some other friends, and decided to make the 5 or so mile drive from berkeley heights, to summit. For the first couple minutes, it was a normal uneventful drive. That would soon change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving the car and noticed an enormous object fly overhead, at first i assumed it was a plane, but without any accompanying noise, i was forced to take a second look. At this point, i pointed up. My friend looked out the window and saw what i was pointing at. It was a craft, flying a few hundred feet up with 3 lights, and a triangular shape. The color of the lights was indiscriminate as it changed often. The object also appeared to be moving north east towards New york city. Just as we came to the realization of what we were looking at, the object seemed to disappear. (as if it knew we were observing)  At which point we noticed a new object (possibly the same object), starlike in appearance , which had appeared near where the other object seemed to disappear. We stayed fixed on it, as it was now moving easterly back towards us, from a position seemingly off the coast, but near the city. All of a sudden the object jumped literally from one end of the horizon to the other instantaneously (east to west). It hovered in this new position for about 2 minutes and then proceeded to jump straight up and disappear..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say my friend and I had no doubt as to what we had seen. Our only question was as to its origin. I&#39;ve always been interested in UFO phenomena and spent many a night as a child peering up hoping to catch a glimpse. Ive seen things that are suspect, but could easily be ruled out as being something entirely explainable by the right expert. This was entirely different however, there was no question that this was not any aircraft i had ever seen, or any easily explainable natural phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

When I looked outside I suddenly saw a very large neon green ball shooting across the sky.  It looked outside I suddenly saw a very large neon green ball shooting across the sky.  It had an extended green and white tail.  It was much larger than any meteor I have ever seen and seemed to be about or below cloud level.  It was awesome!!!  I immediately yelled at my boyfriend &#34;look, look!&#34; but by the time he turned around it was gone, so it only lasted about  3-5 seconds.  The window looks out to the north and the object went across the sky from approximately west to east. I am guessing this was a similar object to the sightings that were reported back on January 24th.  I am an avid sky watcher and make a point of sky watching during any major predicted event such as meteor showers etc.  This was unlike anything I have seen before.<n>

Suddenly I felt hot inside my body and I ran to the door to get some fresh air.  I looked to my left out the door, which is the North, and saw two HUGE what looked like white headlights moving slowly and fairly low over the trees next to our apartments. They were NOT airplane headlights as I have seen them go over many times as they pass to go over to the nearby airport.  I called to my daughter to come and look and she came over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing we saw was the headlights went out and three white lights came on and formed a huge triangle shape. I told my daughter to grab our binoculars so we could see up close what this thing was. The thing made no noise whatsoever the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it began flashing red and white lights, the kind I&#39;ve never seen before. They sparkled like diamonds and were flashing in all directions and the (what I call) spacecraft, stopped and hovered up in the sky above our complex.  Nobody else was outside except just me and my daughter. I grabbed the binoculars and took a look and saw the ship was moving in it&#39;s place and spinning slowly in the sky and I could see detail of the markings on the ship through my binoculars. The ship was a dark grey metal with squiggly looking lines and shapes all over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got scared and handed the binoculars to my daughter to make sure that what I was seeing was real.  She looked and got scared and tried to pull me into the apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said did you see what I saw? And she said YES!!  It&#39;s a UFO, get in here!  Then I got really scared and went in for a moment to calm down my daughter. I went back outside again to see if it was still there and it had started moving towards the south slowly and I watched until it disappeared over the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, even though it allegedly had happened just five days earlier.

Bright white light alternating sporadically from white to red then back to white.  1/20th as bright as an eighth moon and 5 times brighter than an air plane landing lights.  Similar in nature to a satellite in motion which are normally barely visible to the naked eye if visible at all.  The main difference between a satellite and this is the amplitude of brightness and the alternating color.  One other similarity to a satellite is the cyclical nature in which it appears.   One way or another, this is an extra terrestrial object.  I have spent a reasonable amount of time tracking satellites which are tracked and publicized as visible from these coordinates.  Having been unable to identify a man made object in this orbit which emits this type of light I have no choice but to classify this as a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

A few minutes later a Piper cub flies by at about 5000 feet the first thing we notice on the plane are the blinking lights and these lights or spheres just seem to have just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was a ((deleted--electronics)), and rode Trident class submarines, as well as teaching ((deleted--electronic)) operation and maintenance, and training instructor candidates to be instructors.  I have had a year in college of: engineering physics, calculus, and English, almost a year of biology, nearly two years of chemistry.  I have no college degree.  After ((deleted--near 20)) years in the Navy, I worked designing, writing, and delivering custom training, as well as did presentation coaching, in Atlanta, GA, for 4 years before the economy went south, and I was laid off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now work for PNM, Albuquerque’s power and gas company, as an accounting technician.  My brother teaches at a Christian elementary school in Albuquerque, has taught there for 10 years.  He put 4 years in the USN, as a Boiler Technician, in the surface fleet.  We are both Christians.  I am open to there being life on other planets, and I believe UFO sightings are real, especially now!  He is much more closed to both UFOs and alien life, believing there is probably a &#34;logical&#34; explanation in most cases of sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go out back every night at my brother’s house where I live, here in Albuquerque, NM, and have a cigar before retiring for the evening.  I did so on February 10, 2007, at about 8:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I am smoking, I look up at the constellation Orion and at other stars and constellations.  On this evening, I was looking south and slightly west at Orion in the dark, clear, cloudless night sky, when I saw movement to my left out of the corner of my eye.  I turned my eyes to the southeast, and saw what looked like a &#34;vee&#34; formation coming from the southeast, on a northwest heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vee consisted of 7 objects, each roughly the shape of a B-1 bomber, only, by my estimation, a little longer from nose to &#34;tail.&#34;  They were all the same color, sort of a pale yellow/tannish/gold color, and glowing softly, (it crossed my mind) almost as if lit by lights from the city, but way too bright for that (even if we had enough &#34;city lights&#34; in our residential area to provide that kind of illumination) on a dark night.  Each object appeared to have a distinct thin black outline around the glowing colored area.  I say each object, because I distinctly saw dark sky between each of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the approximate minute to minute and a half that I viewed them moving toward me and then close to directly overhead, the vee shifted twice to sort of a &#34;lambda&#34; shape (Greek letter).  (Take one leg of the vee, and move the head of it down to the mid point of the other leg.)  The leg of the vee that moved was the leg nearest me, on the west side of the formation.  I yelled for my brother several times, finally got his attention by sticking my head in the door for a second and yelling, then moved back to watch the formation again, as he came rushing out.  He could just make out the formation by that time, fading into the northwest night sky, which was lighter, looking in that direction.  By this time, the glowing color of the objects contrasted against the lighter blue sky was darker, sort of an orange/yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No movement or change in shape was made by each individual object (i.e. no wings flapping)--objects simply shifted in formation, and moved in one direction, and, they were completely silent.  I really cannot gauge the altitude at which they were, but, looking back, had I held up my pinky finger, at arms length, the nail would have, I am pretty certain, completely covered one of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Related information:  my mother told me the next evening, that she had heard that day, a short blurb on local news regarding sightings of what I had seen the previous night.  The official story, apparently, was that there had been an Air Force exercise of some sort, planes supposedly from Kirtland Air Force Base, which is here in Albuquerque.  (We have either B-1 or B-2 bombers, here, not sure which.)  If this was an actual exercise:  1)	Why/how were our Air Force’s planes/jets GLOWING??  (What possible purpose could the capability to glow serve for a war plane, one that is bent on avoiding detection to begin with?) 2)	The direction from which they came is not the direction they would have come from, if they had originated from Kirtland AFB, which is southwest from my sighting position, unless they had taken off, made a wide circle, and then come from over or around the Sandia Mountains, which are to the east.<n>

It was a very clear night. I saw a bright yellowish light moving in the sky. I thought it was a plane, untill I relized it was changing speeds dramaticly. When we came to a stop I really noticed it. It would go slow, almost come to a stop, and then speed up. And it was moving faster than any plane I have ever seen. When we reached our destination, It was almost right over us. All of a sudden, the yellow light went away, and all I could see was a small black greyish round object moving through the sky. And it was way to far up for a plane to give off light like it did. Then after about 10 seconds, the light turned back on, and dissapeard into the sky.

I thought I would add one more to the mix.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but it was in that time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my living room watching TV.  From my position I can see through the dining room window.  The sun had already went down and it had just gotten completely dark.  I estimate it was around 7:00 to 8:00 PM.  I see a bright light through the trees tops across the street.  My husband is sitting across the room with his back to the wall.  He has no view of the window.  He sees that I see something and ask what it is.  I said I see a bright light and it must be a helicopter searching for something.  My house faces east and the light was comeing from the east going west.  I go outside to get a better look and a few seconds later I am followed by my husband.  I told my husband that it is not a helicopter cause there is no noise.  Soon we could see the lights where the wings are suppose to be.  There was one on each side.  One was blue and the other is red.  I don&#39;t remeber which side one or the other was on.  The white light, which was in the middle and out front, outshone them by about 5X.  I assumed the white light was landing lights.  We started to hear a low roar from the engine.  It passed right over the top of our heads and just a little to the north.  I should of been able to see the landing gear and the noise from the engine should of deafen us.  This was not the case.  It was too quite and I couldn&#39;t see the plane.  I couldn&#39;t even make out the outline.  My husband made the comment that this is strange.  Viewing it from the rear the two lights on the side changed to one white and the other red.  I ran into the house to get the binoculars and out the back door, but it had already cleared the trees in the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and myself are both ex military.  We know what planes and helicopters sound like.  We can tell the difference in the helicopters by their sound.  We don&#39;t have to see them.  I am also retired from the FAA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live east of an Airforce base.  There is a flight path behind our house going south to north.  This is the training path of the Airforce.  There is also a National Guard helicopter base to the south of us.  Their path is east to west south of our house.  The also sometimes go west to east on their return trip, but not all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked on the internet for information on the stealth plane.  Even though there is quite a bit of information about them it doesn&#39;t say that they are quite.  Also the lights on the side were to far apart and to far forward for it to be a stealth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When I downloaded this picture, I noticed something odd on the upper right; I&#39;ll be...a classic saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, I was outside my parents house in Woodbridge about 9:45PM and started taking pictures of the night sky.  I aimed the camera to where my neighbors lights would not reflect and used no flash option.  I found 2 pictures from that night shoot that had orbs-one of them HUGE(Picture with stars visible and moon)! The last was the same backyard, different night.  Yielded 3 Orbs almost in a triangle pattern. These pictures are included, and shot with a HP 6 gigapixel camera.  I read &#39;The problem with ORBS&#39; over at Rense.com and this camera did not yeild the same spots when I tried other nights; 100% paranormal. All stars in the &#39;HUGE&#39; picture where white and not &#39;gassy&#39; which would cause irregular colors commonly associated with UFO&#39;s and Stars. Will send photos if asked to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The size as I viewed it was about a quater of an inch if that or less. As I watched this I for a few mins. I mentioned to my friends to look up.  We all saw this object moving back and forth,side to side (left to right).  This object which for the mst part moved slow as we watched all of a sudden just darted north west. We LOST SIGHT OF IT, quick!!    I`ve never seen a UFO in my life until that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about to close the drapes when over the water (I live beside a large River nameed the St - Laurent, I noticed a phenomenal light formation in the air. I knew right away that this was a type of craft I had never seen before in my life. It was bright and shun with three round lights. From the outline I assume it was triangular. Within 5 seconds of looking at it I made no hesitation and grabbed my sony digital camera out of my desk droor. I remembered the batteries were almost dead and hoped I had enough to snap the shot. I turned on the Camera and Snapped the picure. When i went to snap another one the camera shut off. I observed it for about 15 seconds longer when all of a sudden it took of twords the left so quickly that when i turned my head to follow it, it was just as if it dissapeared out of mid air. Honestly for all i know, whatever it was, it just might have. Please Email me so i can send the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While driving home on County Rd. 78 ( Luthman Rd.) in Shelby county, said person stopped along the road near a state park area to use Blue Out House to relieve himself. While using the facilities he had left his car door open with the radio playing loudly on a local fm station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon exiting the Blue Out House he noticed his radio went to complete static. As he attempted to take the few large steps thru the knee high snow, he for whatever reason looked out the channel and upward to see a what appeared to be a high rise building like structure hovering above him the surrounding area. This area being, LehmKuhl Landing according to the Google map Of which I centered on the intersection of St. Rte. 119 and Luthman Rd. after doing a Google map search for Fort Loramie, OH 45845.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be a kind of Black which seemed to mimic the stars around it in order to blend in. The surfaces where hard to distinguish enough to discern a exact shape, nevetheless best guesses lean towards upright rectangular shaped. The distance between observer, the object, and the lake below was extremely hard to Observe therefore the altitude of the UFO was not possible to calculate. Guesses lean towards the Huge object to be approx. 1000ft in the air while the top of the object must have been approx. 30 to 60 floors high as described by the observer while comparing it to a hovering apartment building from a large city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the observer was stunned and had been standing, staring in amazement for approx. 30 seconds the silence of the entire area including the object was noticed. There was no sounds except for the car and the staticy radio. The object ubruptly shot off towards space with no sound and at speeds uncomprehendable to the observer. The object traveled thru a cloud in the sky which left a hole that quickly refilled in the cloud. It would also be noticably important to mention that there were considerable windy conditions during this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night while typing this out the weather conditions where described as winds having calmed causing freezing fog to plague the dark area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it might be the moon, but it was too large.  (Had watched the new moon and Venus, just after sunset, the previous night - the crescent we are reporting was much larger, appearing to be the outline of the bottom a very large circle. It grew larger, then smaller, then vanished.  There appeared to be indistinct small lights along  it, and a bright orange light near the tip of the crescent (on the right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We wonder about the possibility of a mirage, as the conditions were rather humid from melting snow, and there is a highway intersection several miles west of this location which is lighted by an orange light on a pole, on the right.  If this was a mirage, it seems to have been displaced to the south of the actual location of the intersection.<n>

And moving vary fast. We stood there looking for about 2mins when we seen what looked like three explosions in the upper atmosphere, at this point the contrails stopped both my son and I gasped when we seen what looked like a large black round ball hanging in the air just above the explosions. The black ball then seems to go strait up and totally out of site. My son looked at me and said I wish we had a camcorder to catch that, I said to him when I get home ill call the police to see if there was a plain collision to try to explain it. So when I got home I did just that the officer that I was talking to said there was no plain crashes or collisions at that time. But there was to be a meteor shower that day and that is what We must have seen, I know in my hart and my son to that what we seen was no meteor shower that day.<n>

I was on the east side of the Sacramento river, facing west, having just come off Sutterville road and about turn on Riverside. It appeared to be just on the west side of the river, not quite straight ahead, and it was just a little to the right. My first guess was that it was a meteor, and I looked all over the local news next day for stories of a meteor hitting the ground somewhere in west Sacramento, but there was no story. According to a map of the area, the most probable area of impact was in a place with very few streets, which probably means very few houses. It may have struck and not been noticed, or it may not have hit the ground at all. That is what makes it interesting. It should have struck the ground after it went below the top of the trees. It wound seem unlikely for a meteor to evaporate just a couple of hundred feet before it reaches the ground. They usually do so while still high in the atmosphere. I have seen a few of them do just that. It crossed the entire arc of visibility (to me) in less than a second, and did not fade or slow down as it went, as it would have if it was going straight across the sky from behind me. If it was farther away than west Sac, or moving horizontally at high altitude, it had to be huge, and going at an unimaginable speed. It appeared round, and I estimate its size to be about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length. It appeared a little bit fuzzy, so I can&#39;t be more exact than that. These flashes in the sky are interesting, but I have never seen anything I can positively identify as an alien vehicle of any sort. I will watch this site to see if anyone else saw this object.<n>
2/18/07 20:15|Slana|AK|Light|20 seconds|02/18/07, 2015AST, a pale green light was observed travelling along the southern slopes of the Alaska Range in eastern central Alaska.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55353.html|98|ndxe200702| 02/18/07,  2015 AST, a pale green light was observed travelling along the southern slopes of the Alaska Range in eastern central Alaska.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 18, 2007, 2015 AST, I observed from inside my cabin a pale green light that seemed to rise above Noyes Mountain 25 miles east of my location.  Initially I thought it was a bright star, but as it appeared to grow in size and move, I got a pair of 10x binoculars and went out on my porch to view the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to descend down into the Suslota Creek drainage slightly below a 6400ft ridge that runs east to west on the north side of the drainage.  Several times the light was out of view because of the treeline.  The light then started to rise as if following the terrain and slope of Suslo Mountain 5 miles east north east of my cabin.  The altitude above ground level could not be determined, however, as it passed over the top of Suslo Mountain the light was close enough to the ground that the light green color reflected off the snow cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then descended down toward the Tok Highway and seem to level off approximately 500-800 feet above the ground, traveling westward, then turned back to the northwest and began to ascend diagonally across the face of the mountains to the northwest of my cabin.  After reaching an altitude that was at least 1000 ft. above the mountains, the light moved off to the west north west.  Observation was lost at this time as the light was obscured by the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time that the light was observed was 20 seconds. Weather at time of observation: wind 330 at 8kts, temperature -8F, baro 29.35, visibility cavu.  The straight line distance the light traveled while observed is approximately 35 miles.  There was no sound associated with the light, no satelite tv interference, nor did my housedogs or sleddogs react to the light. No distinct object shape or structure was seen, just a pastel pale green glowing light, similiar to a ball of St. Elmo&#39;s Fire or ball lightning. All turns and movements appeared to be deliberate, smooth and co-ordinated, and the speed at which it travelled appeared to be constant as best determined by this casual observer. No abrupt changes in speed or direction were noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With nothing to compare size with in the darkness, I would estimate from the reflected light in the snow cover of Suslo Mountain and at the distance of closest observation of 3.5 miles that the light was 30 to 50 ft in diameter. From the east-west direction that the light was traveling to the point observation was lost,  it was obviously and deliberately terrain following along the southern slopes of the Alaska Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was by chance that I was sitting at my cabin window and glanced outside at the time of the initial sighting, had I been elsewhere in the cabin, it would not have been seen and there was no other unusual occurance or sound that would have brought it to my attention.  It would have passed totally unobserved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is a 60 year old male, 40 year resident of Alaska, former Coast Guardsman, a license vessel Master, and Commercial Pilot with fixed wing and rotorcraft ratings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we suspect that he is an exceptionally well qualified witness.

It was really bright and very low, I drove into my cousins driveway and told the occupants to look outside because I thought I saw a UFO or something.  One of the boys looked outside and said, &#34;Oh yeah I see it, it might be a star.&#34; Then I left the house and continued to watch the object in the sky.  It kept changing colors to red, blue and yellow-orange.  I then picked my boyfriend up and I told him about the UFO. We went on the grade near Hays and parked there with our lights off and watched this object for 10 minutes.  It started to change and look like a fireball, changing colors again, red, blue and orange and a little blue green light came out of the right bottom side of it.  The object or fireball began to dance side to side up and down then it would stop and it started to grow larger. My boyfriend said, &#34;You better start the car it looks like its coming toward us.&#34; The object started to come toward us as it moved back and forth.  It seemed to know that we were watching it, I started to get scared and started the car and when the lights came on in my car the object disappeared from view.  We then drove home and called friends in neighbors about the UFO.  Apparently alot of these objects or UFO&#39;s are sighted over Hays.  It was scarey!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))<n>

2/17/07 20:10|Colmesneil|TX|Unknown|1 hour|The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ‘amorphous’ nature.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55351.html|104|ndxe200702| My wife, her parents and I witnessed a very strange object at approximately 20:10 on Saturday, February 18, 2007. The object had no discernable shape or size (but must have been somewhat large due to its apparent distance from our location). It was very bright white, or blue-white, or orange, or red-white in color; which constantly changed in no particular order or sequence, and continuously varied in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light intensity of this object was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current aircraft landing or taxi lighting system I am familiar with, and the object was observed traveling away from our location, therefore, by comparison, landing and/or taxi lights would not be very apparent, if this object was a landing aircraft traveling away from us. In addition, the familiar blinking of aircraft position lights was not present at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object from an initial distance of approximately 4 miles and approximately 15000 feet AGL (which seemed to vary somewhat), as it traveled away from us from east to west, for about ¾ of an hour. The height AGL of the object was approximately constant (about 15000 feet); therefore, after ¾ of an hour, the object was about 16 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ‘amorphous’ nature. We viewed this object for almost an hour, mostly through field glasses and a high powered camera lens, and were struck by the constant change of its shape, size, color and position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The experience was disturbing for us, since we could not explain its behavior. However, if the flight path is extrapolated on a map, it does come close to Ft. Hood, TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the object was a new military aircraft undergoing flight qualification testing?<n>

I was looking straight up with my head slightly tilted back against the seat, so I could look out the window at the night sky that was a darkish blue at the time. At the very edge of the window I saw a rectangular translucent white... thing. It was almost invisible, so I was unsure if it was just me or if I was really seeing something. It wasn&#39;t moving. When we turned, I tried to locate it again, but couldn&#39;t. I was kinda tired too, so I&#39;m not sure if it was my imagination or not, and that&#39;s also the reason why I wanna be anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about an inch in size in between my thumb and index finger when I hold out my arm. There was also a star at the very edge of the shape, not sure if it was part of the thing or not, just saying it was there. It wasn&#39;t at the exact corner either, just  slightly to the middle of one of the short sides. The translucency was more or less even across the entire thing except towards the corners where it was more transparent, making the corners appear kinda rounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll leave my friends e-mail adress to you and you can contact me through him if you want to ask me something else, this report was also done through his Swedish computer, didn&#39;t wanna leave my IP adress.

The image is still there, but again, blurry, or a shadow.  I took 3 more shots inside the house at blank walls, &amp; at a calendar on the wall.  No image.  There has been no alterations whatsoever of the shots, &amp; they are still on the memory card in the camera.  There is nothing on the lens or the filter that would cause this.  We saw nothing in the sky.  We were basically in the same position on the deck, just turning around, looking at the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I uploaded the shots to:  http://picasaweb.google.com/gholabird/2007_02_17<n>

Traffic was conditions were mild to moderate congestion, at a pace of 60 to 70 mph, then all of a sudden the traffic went to a near stop pace at 25mph on the freeway?  Insane, so I swerved in my Acura Integra to lean into the left lane to see what is the hold up.  Then I see this dot, greyish in the atmosphere hovering in no motion at the right side view of MT Rainer which would align over the city of Orting at my best guessing.  I would not speculate that it an air force plane as i am quite familar with the plane flights.  I tried to get my camera and video tape it but the upcoming bridge was in the way.  Traffic still slowed a near stop.  I did my best to observe the dot,.  This is when I notice a dance behavior that is unlike any known earth design technology. right to left, now think of the given distance between my position relative to Paci! fic Algona to Orting Washington, for an object to dance hover in the sky above Orting, then it darted to my right and disappeared.  The news said it was a Japanese satelite, I have seen the ISS and the shuttle in space at my home park here in Lakewood Oakbrook they don&#39;t dart and disappear, there is a certain physics that engineered that kind of movement  Andrew.toombs@gmail.com<n>

White lights on the sides, red light shimmering in the middle-bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> while driving down I-90 west around dead man&#39;s curve, i noticed something different out of the corner of my eye, something bright. i looked towards the airport and thought i saw extra lights from a plane. i realized there was a new control tower, triangular, with different lights in the corners. the lights on the edges were enormous in proportion to all the other lights nearby. it was hovering DEAD STILL approximately 50-150ft above the runway. when i realized it was not a tower, that it was suspended, i craned my head outside my window and almost crashed my car while looking. something told me to park the car and watch, but i didnt want to have the police pull me over. i was not scared at all; i watched it hover for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> as a test, i memorized the image in my head. i took my eyes off of it for 45 seconds, in order to turn around on E55th street. i ran the light, flew around, and had full view of the entire runway within 10 seconds of entering the freeway (now I-90 east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> there was NOTHING IN SIGHT. in fact, the entire airport was now dark, whereas before it had been almost totally illuminated by searchlights. i parked on the side of the road near the dolphins and got out of my car and searched tghe skies for a good 2 min in all direction. there was no sight of ANY lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after i am finished with all the math calculations, i have figured out the object had to have traveled faster than 7,000- 14,000MPH in order for the object to be completely out of range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He had walked up to the fenced garden area to check on a recently acquired mare, which had attained a bad leg injury and was rumored to be pregnant.  He was very frightened to see translucent orbs approximately four feet in diameter circling 10-30 feet above the mare.  He described the appearance as :lighted fog.&#34;  According to him there were a large number of these orbs &#34;dancing around,&#34; which gave him the appearance of intelligence rather than simply moving in a random fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After he started his truck one of the orbs moved onto the hood area, which immediately cut the lights off, as well as the engine.  At this point the traveled a hundred yards or so on foot to their dwelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother stepped out on their front porch and was so frightened by what she saw through the bare trees that she refused to go any closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I received the call from my father.  I called a neighbor to witness the scene to ensure nothing was medically wrong with them.  He brought a camcorder and attempted to record the orbs, which had risen to a couple hundred feet at this time.  He tried to use his cell phone and the battery suddenly went dead and every time he would raise the camcorder to record the orbs then they would all clump together and shoot off at lightening speed out of sight.  Within a short period of time they would return, expand and do the same thing as before.  The movement reported was remarkable and comparable to a kaleidoscope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several other witnesses who observed this phenomenon from 3-20 miles away.  However these witnesses observed the lights at high altitude and my father was the only one that I am aware of who noticed the occurrence at such a close distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He is an extremely reliable source although I will not disclose further information so he can remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They observed the phenomenon from approximately 8:30 to 10:30 pm on a Friday evening.  Weather conditions were cold and clear. Nothing like this has been observed since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Look at this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, my husband, child, and myself, went to the window and tried to figure out what we were witnessing.  We quickly concluded that, even though the separation between lights was considerable, it was certainly one aircraft.  There were lights on each tip of what would be a triangle.  In the center, there was a black void, darker than the night sky.  A slight &#34;whirrrrr&#34; could be heard as it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to say what size the craft was, other than to say it was huge!!! (bigger than a football field)  We couldn&#39;t figure out how far away it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about 4 minutes, as it flew North East, until it was out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

As it headed towards us from the North West area it started to gracefully arch towards the North and broke into a triple arch shape and disappeared.  It was something we have never seen before!

It is hard to judge size because the lights are receding to the south and I had not seen it directly overhead. The base leg to Reagan Nat. Airport is directly in front of my house, if I were to use a 757 at 3000 feet to guess the size I would guess it to be wider than and longer than the 757. There were 6 lights directly in line on each side flashing they were white most of the time though I think no. 2 from the front alternated red. As it was dark it was hard to guess size and speed. There was no noise. I saw this 12 miles from the White House. 2 helicopters showed up from the north several minutes later they continued south for several miles and then circled back where they joined almost over my house. They slowed to almost a hover and then continued on to the north. Channel 5 News has a fairly large copter, I called and asked if it had been over Vienna at 7pm and they said no, and they had not had any calls about a strange craft. This Craft flew 90o across the base leg of Regan airport at 7pm with planes landing at less than 1 min. intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

We were located off the California coast, cruising at a fast speed (20-22 knots, the Captain had said that night), and reached the Golden Gate at 06:00 that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coughing up a storm at ~2 A.M., and my husband went to find a hot lemonade.  I was awake anyway, so I pulled back the curtains and stood in the window to watch the ship’s churning water – mesmerizing!  After about 5 minutes, three softly glowing objects came into view – three uniform, nearly spherical objects, evenly spaced in a line parallel to the ship’s hull and hovering just above the water surface.  Based on the appearance of dolphins from the window, and of people seen standing on piers, I’d say that these spheres were somewhat larger – maybe 12-15’ high.  Perfectly smooth, and with a pale bluish-white glow.  They appeared to stay in one place while the ship moved past them.  They were hovering, but didn’t disturb the water below them. Just as they went out of my sight, the left one (toward the bow) splashed down into the water and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course I hadn’t thought to tear myself away from the window to get the cell phone or camera (both in the safe, and of doubtful use through a window at night…).  And, of course, three more glowing spheres, hovering in a straight line along the edge of the wake, came past the window ~2 minutes later!  ~4-5 minutes after that, two more spheres were seen, but farther away from the ship.  The first and second groups had been located just where the ship’s wake or foam line ends.  The last group was about twice as far away.  The “bow-ward” of these last two also dropped down into the water and disappeared.  I was still standing at the window, in amazement, when my husband came back with lemon tea.  I told him about the spheres, and we watched for awhile, but no more sightings.<n>

There were two on top and one on the bottom. It formed a up-side down triangle. Then, the three lights combined and went to one big light and it was gone in a split second. I got on the phone and called my friend who was ahead of me, and I asked her if she seen it, and she seen it too. My son was fast asleep beside me. The noise did not wake him up yet, that is how low the tone actually was. Then, it happened again. Same thing, the low tone above us, the three bright yellow lights combined into one and then... poof... gone! When it was over us this time my son woke up, and asked me what it was.

The white light moved up to the red one and the red light zipped back to the NW, fading to orange and disappearing.  The white light faded and hovered. I lost track of it in the trees.

I took another 90 degree turn and once again it maintained a parallel flight pattern. I then took another 90 degree turn and it followed behind at a fixed distance. I repeated the rectangular pattern of travel and the light maintained an equal distance. At this point I drove straight in an attempt to outdistance the light and it grew smaller indicating that it was in fact flying relatively close to the surface.  I continued direction of travel and light grew dim, but when I made a 90 degree turn I noticed the light maintained a parallel flight pattern albeit at a greater distance than before.  I then drove toward the light once again and it then rapidly grew distant and small. It appeared that several aircraft in the area with blinking lights also may have seen the light as they were seen hovering in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NUFORC?

It was in February, but I&#39;m not sure now of what year.. approximately 2007.  While walking back to the house, I got a very creepy feeling, and it felt like the hair on the back of my neck was standing up.  Just then a formation of lights came up from behind me, shining on the snow beside me.  They were about five feet to my left, and were brilliant white, with very sharp edges, much like how the light from a laser pointer looks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were only visible on the snow.  There were no &amp;quot;beams&amp;quot; with them.  There were about six of them, and they were each about a foot in diameter.  They weren&#39;t in a round formation, as you would expect from a searchlight.  They were more the shape of a cluster of grapes, with the leading edge of the formation being wider, and tapering toward the back.  There was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down, and the lights slowed down.  I walked a little faster, and they kept pace.  They did not shine directly on me.  After about fifty feet, they suddenly sped up and were gone.  The strangest thing was that I just went into the house and went to bed.  I didn&#39;t say a word to my wife, until about four days later, when we were driving down the highway at night, and seeing oncoming headlights jogged my memory.  I&#39;m not aware of any missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know why I didn&#39;t look up!

2/14/07 20:30|San Ramon/Danville|CA|Disk|Approx. 1 Hour|Red, White and Blue Lights on Object Hovering over Dougherty Valley, San Ramon area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius.  PD))|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55397.html|136|ndxe200702| Red, White and Blue Lights on Object Hovering over Dougherty Valley, San Ramon area<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling east on Bollinger Canyon Road, San Ramon, on 02/14/07.  At 8:10 p.m., I noted (at the 11:00 position) a flashing red and white object overhead.  It was traveling at a slow pace, then stopped and hovered.  While heading back going west on Bollinger Canyon Road, the object appeared to keep pace with us.  We then headed north on Dougherty Valley Road, then west on Crow Canyon Road, toward Danville.  The object kept pace with us; it was at a fairly high distance, so we could not determine its shape.  While in Danville, going south on Brookside Drive, I again spotted this flashing red and white object.  As we turned a corner, still on Brookside Drive, this object turned, lowered its elevation, and headed toward us.  At this point, we realized it was heading straight toward us.  We became frightened and as this object came closer, I turned my car around and headed back, north, down Brookside Drive.  My son stated to me later that &#34;if you threw a frisbee into the air at this thing, it would have hit it.&#34;  At the point in which I was turning our car around in a driveway to get away from this thing, my son was able to see the object up close, from the passenger side.  He states this object had one blue light on the one end, and rotating red and white lights all around at the bottom.  He states it was circular and &#39;HUGE,&#39; although could not explain to me how many feet in circumference it seemed to be.  We decided to purchase soft drinks at the McDonald&#39;s off of Crow Canyon/San Ramon Valley Blvd.  As we sat in the parking lot, we noted we could no longer see this object.  As we headed back toward home, going east on Crow Canyon Road, my son stated he saw the same object, but this time it was pacing us at a much higher distance.  Once we reached Dougherty Drive, we no longer saw the object.  The timeframe for the above is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  At approximately 9:30 p.m. that night, I took my dogs for a walk down our street.  I was walking toward the west down our street;! when I turned around, I saw a flashing red and white object hovering down the cul-de-sac, past our home.  I became frightened and kept my eyes on the object as I was walking.  It was moving in a zig-zag motion, very slowly and cautiously, toward me.  I went inside the house and informed my husband and son what had happened.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been so frightened in my life.  We decided to take a drive, the three of us, to see if we could see this object further.  This was at approximately 10:00 p.m. that night.  We drove in the same pattern as I had taken previously, then headed back home.  We didn&#39;t see anything during that time.  As we were headed toward home, I took a street called Monarch Drive and decided to go up Monarch Drive, which is on a hill, overlooking the Valley.  We were headed east.  We got out of our car and saw three objects, each had flashing red and white lights.  We were not able to see their shapes, but noted that they at times would just hover, and/or move very quickly, first right, then left.  Eventually, we headed back off Monarch, onto Bollinger Canyon Road, going west.  As we headed home, we noted that two of these objects were now pacing us, one in front of the other.  All of a sudden, the object behind the other picked up speed and literally flew over the object in front of it, seemingly missing the object in front of it by inches.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I decided to go up to the balcony, and then that&#39;s when I realized the light was crossing the sky, from north to south, on the shoreline, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is about 250 meters (273 yards) from the shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a red light from an airplane&#39;s navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This red light would get very intense and then would grow dimmer but wouldn&#39;t entirely disappear, unlike an airplane&#39;s red navigation light which basically seem to blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not an airplane, I&#39;m very certain of that. Planes crossing the Atlantic, arriving at Lisbon&#39;s International Airport usually do their approach exactly over the area where I live so I&#39;m very used to watching them and I recognize their navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say for certain that it wasn&#39;t a (conventional) plane because the light was completely different, it was much lower than a plane, and it crossed the sky alot quicker than a plane, as it completely disappeared from my sight in about 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting there wes a civilian plane on the sky, so besides the obvious differences I also had real time comparison with an actual plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Portuguese Air Force 30 minutes after the sighting and told them what I had seen, and they were very helpful and asked me the (I assume) usual questions: estimated altitude of the object, duration of the sighting, etc. and told me they would get back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did, 10 minutes after that, and the person told me he had contacted civilian and military airtraffic controllers and they didn&#39;t saw anything on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t took any pictures or recorded the sighting, but even if I had a camera with me, I don&#39;t think I would have anyway, since it didn&#39;t even crossed my mind long after the sighting was done. I was just mind blown looking at it.<n>

They were flying from south to north.  The three craft were flying in close formation about 35-40 ft between the craft.  Covered the distance of about 10 miles in a 3-4 minute time span.   Crafts profile was thin, dark in color, 25-30 ft long 3-4 ft high, conical in shape. On the topside, an elliptical shape object, white light emitting at about 1 second intervals.  Light not extremely bright, the object being opaque between flashing, all three craft emitting at the same frequency.  One craft left the formation briefly and flew up into the cloud directly above them then reappeared.  Flashing light could be seen when the craft was inside the cloud.   Assent and descent near vertical in that the craft’s image remained horizontal  during the process.  Definitely not to any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was headed southbound on I-435, about 2 miles south of I-29, and at first I assumed this was a landing plane. It was much brighter than a plane, however, and it was &#34;pointed&#34; due north rather than east/northeast, which is the direction of the airport from this freeway. As I drove nearer, I realized that the object was not moving. I slowed down to about 45 mph to get as close a look as possible from my driver’s side window. The object was triangular in shape, with banks of very large, bright white lights across the &#34;front&#34; two sides. There were two other colored lights, I believe red and blue, which were smaller and near the points. The triangular shape was very well defined from the bottom, and in the dark in looked to be a grayish/metallic color. I continued to watch as I drove by, and the object remained in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so alarmed and curious that I considered calling the police, but I didn’t know the name of the county I was in and dropped that idea. I also considered pulling over and getting a better look, but it was an extremely cold night and I didn’t feel safe stopping on the side of the freeway. I did call my husband to describe the experience to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an extensively published nonfiction writer and adjunct lecturer in English at a university in Kansas.<n>

There was nothing unusual about the night. Low clouds were moving in with the stars still visible through the breaks. I only say this because there was no storm brewing (ie. not lightning). A car was driving by and there was (what appeared) a flash of light which illuminated things around me. I figured it was a reflection and paid it no attention. Then it happened again. At that point I went to the railing to see where the flashes were coming from and just at that moment I saw a bright bluish-green flash to the south of me with a very distinct rod-like center. It was just a single pulse that lasted only a second. I stayed outside for another few minutes hoping to see more, but nothing happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke with a meteorologist the next day about the possibility of it being lightning, but he said that under the conditions, it probably wasn’t lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m an artist by trade and have always been open minded to alternate possibilities.

Anyway after letting off the last of the fireworks one of my mates happened to spot a couple of glowing lights in the not to far distance, we didn’t think anything of it at first, but then a few minutes later the lights were still there in the exact same position- it seemed as though these lights had remained stationary all this time. Then all of a sudden the two lights seemed to split into five or six objects, and then coming at us with incredible speed, they then stopped just above us, now I was scared. The lights were emitting a sort of strange glowing feel above us, then two of the craft flew over some nearby hills going out of sight and then a large beam of light was seen coming up from over the hills. The rest of the crafts still hovered over head performing amazing maneuvers seeming as if to defy gravity with there smooth twists and turns- and then they shot up and disappeared. We ran up a large hill to see if we could spot the craft- but we couldn’t. The craft were never seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnessed a bright, disk shaped object seen flying from the sky to the ground at at close range. (Photos Taken)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west from Rochester on Rochester Rd toward Lake Springfield.  When I reached the stop sign, there was a very bright light shining inside my car.  It was like a spot light from a police car.  I looked behind me and did not see a police car or any other vehicle.  I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky that wasn’t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a steady speed it came from a couple miles up to ground level in approximately 5 seconds.  It hovered over the ground about a 100ft away.  The craft looked like it was the length of a city bus.  I could see the grass moving as it rotated.  It stayed there for less than a minute. When it was at ground level the lights dimmed, and I could see the craft rotating horizontally like a wheel with blue colored lights blinking around it with white light coming off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned brighter and the grass was moving faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lifted and turned about 80 degrees and took off about 3 times faster than it came down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it took off, the craft was a very, very bright blue. The whole craft was shining brighter than a light bulb, more like magnesium burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it left, my radio started going nuts. It stopped working. My car wasn’t running. There wasn’t even a light on my tape adapter (for CD). This shows I didn’t even have the battery working. After the craft left, my car would not start for 1 minute. A minute later it came back on by itself and the radio did. I didn’t have to turn the key to start it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to take pictures of the craft (with my cell phone) as it was coming in, when it landed, and when it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event seemed to take place in less than five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am concerned that I felt fatigued when the ‘spotlight’ was on my car.  I also have very little recollection on how I was able to travel from the location the sighting took place in Rochester and ended up outside the Muni property by the lake.  I have no memory of this.<n>

'Dancing in the sky'|3/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55435.html|155|ndxe200702| UFO sighting, Batangas, Philippines. &#39;Dancing in the sky&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of February 12th of 2007 just after midnight I and five others which included my mother, Auntie, 1yr old daughter, boyfriend and the boat operator was onboard a small courier boat travelling from ‘Coco Beach’ back to ‘White beach’ where we were all based during our 3 week long holiday. Both of which are tourist beach resorts located in Oriental Mindoro, Batangas, Philippines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a 30 minute journey back and we have just finished a big meal from the Coco beach restaurant so we were all very tired.  Everyone around me just closed their eyes and I followed (except for the boat operator of course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10-15mins after, I opened my eyes to look up at the sky.  The sky was clear and I can make out the star formations.  Exactly after a minute, I thought I witnessed a Shooting star as it appeared to shoot in one direction and quickly disappeared.  For 3 seconds I was thinking to myself I should make a wish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it reappeared moving in different directions at incredible speed. It had different coloured lights. I witnessed a colour formation of white, red, orange and blue. I froze and kept my eyes on it as I was afraid I’d lose sight of it. I couldn’t tell the distance but I know it was very far as it was more or less the same size of an average star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes of watching, I woke up my boyfriend who was snoozing with his head on his arms at the very front of the boat.  I told him to look up at the star that was moving in the dark sky and as he was in a daze he quickly dismissed it and said ‘Nah it’s because the boat is moving up and down’ (as in his own words).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I remained quiet until it reappeared brighter then proceeded to point again. ‘There it is, over there’, I said.  This time he was quiet trying to focus and concentrate.  We watched it swerve in zigzag motion and a straight line, speed up and then slow down again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a split second I took my eyes of the UFO to look at the sheer concentration on my boyfriends face he let out a ‘Wow’.  I looked back at the object and he informed me that it just made a spectacular circular motion, which I just missed.  My boyfriend proceeded to record the object on his camcorder but resigned to the fact that it was too hard to focus on the object at such distance especially at the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another significant detail was that there was an aeroplane that was coming from the far right moving towards the west and we conversed on comparing the two. I said, ‘there is no way that UFO is a plane. We have nothing that moves that fast’.  And so we concluded the same as the two objects aligned directly above each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we watched the UFO move the same way it was towards the west until it faded. We arrived at the shores in complete awe. It was one of the most memorable moments in my life and will probably never come across a UFO again.<n>

I turned off my car and went to open the door when I noticed a bright light in the driver side mirror.  I didn’t think anything of it I just had  thought it was a very bright plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I gathered my belongings and got out of my vehicle and looked back up to notice that the object I noticed was extremely bright and was not moving.  I did not want to lose sight of the object so I used my cell phone to call inside the house to my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came out side and by the time he had come out there were two right next to each other.  They were very bright and the color was red and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a few minutes and a third one came from behind the middle one and they were in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching we were looking toward the south.  The one on the right moved out toward the south west and sat above the mountains.  After the one on the right moved out to this direction another one came from behind the middle on and took the place of the one that had gone.  We could still see the light from the one out in the distance just sitting there and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this was gone the one to the right of the middle one moved into the middle one and there was just two.  The two stayed in the same spot for a few more minutes and then they started to go out farther to the south.   And then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later they appeared in the same spot that we first saw them (two) and they stayed for just a few seconds and then they slowly disappeared towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with witnessing of landing lights on distant aircraft.  There are several civilian and military airports in the Everett area.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

Long story short, while we where smoking, I caught a bright light appear to our east just about above Sea-tac Airport.  It was about 15 degrees up in the sky, and it was brighter than any lights coming from the aircraft flying below it and infront of it.  It moved very slowely in the north direction at a very slow pace.  It moved about 10 to 15 degrees in 30 min moving north. Now as it was moving north it was what seem to be changing alttitudes.  It was Very bright, again much brighter than the large craft coming from the airport not far from where it was seen.  It had no flashing lights.  I have lived next to airports for most of my life, not including when I was a young child lived next to Miramar naval station in San-Diego CA for quite some time, and this thing I saw in my oppinion was not moving or acting like a normal aircraft.  I got a 10 to 15 min video of this light.  When the camera focused in on the light, it was flat on top and bottom, Rounded on both sides, and had a very perticular pattern to it. A pattern I cant even describe.  The two people that where there with me were flabergasted as well was I. It took me about a min to realize what was going on and then went and grabed my camera to get 10-15 min of video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It seemed to be close, closer than the airplanes.  It did not blink or twinkle in any way but moved steadily along in the direction of the field where two separate government water wells exist.  The light moved faster than a plane, but much slower than a shooting star.  As I watched it move quickly across the sky it began to grow dimmer and  over a matter of 3-4 seconds it had completely vanished.  Right before it was out of sight the now much smaller  object  seemed to turn the color of a pale burnt yellow light.  I watched, but it did not reappear.<n>

During this time, no other stars were visible as I was in the city and there were no planes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It could not have been Sirius as i&#39;ve been mesmerised by Sirius for some time now since i discovered what a previous sighting i had from home was the dog star via the greenwich observatory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &#39;star&#39; as ill call it was so, so bright and just hung there in the sky.  it was constantly there just moving as we did so perhaps it may be explained as a planet.  it definately wasn&#39;t a plane as we came past stanstead airport and planes were taking off and landing and showing all characterristics of planes whereas this was just there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stopping off at a place called Fourwentways in Cambridgeshire i could not see this &#39;star&#39; even though this is a open place and the &#39;star&#39; was so bright it should have been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching the skys as i always do on this long journey from Norfolk to London whilst keeping an eye out for this &#39;star&#39; i noticed on the horizon various other extremely white lights or &#39;stars&#39; and then every so often there would be a bright red &#39;star&#39; which appeared to move.  one going high into the air and then back down to earth again.  I assumed these were arials of some kind but i then say some closer ariels that you could make out to be arials that the red light didnt move on yet these other red lights moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just past Stanstead Airport almost on the borders of Essex in a field to my left was what looked like a huge circle of flame but it was in such a way that it could not have been a field on fire it was moreso a complete unmoving circle of flame but it was only lit 3/4&#39;s round and not a complete circle and it wasn&#39;t out of control as a field fire would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So stunning to see and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner saw the bright star i was looking at but he was driving thus concentration on the road was paramlount.  the only other witness was my 1 year old baby who i dont think would be abe to tell you anything!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus in the southwest sky??

From the side it looked like a flat flying saucer but as it banked left and right it had rounded wings that looked like a manta ray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not notice a vertical tail section normally found on an airplane.  It had red and white strobe lights that clearly outlined the crafts shape.  Unlike any other craft I have seen including known stealth planes like the F-117 or B-2.  It made about 5 or more low level runs until it dissapeared into the mountain ridge line NW of us and seemed headed towards Edwards AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted about 2-3 minutes. We saw several cars pass us but I am not sure if they also saw the craft.<n>
2/10/07 17:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Disk|2-3 Minutes|I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55242.html|166|ndxe200702| I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright daylight when I saw three disk shaped craft in the air, against a bright blue sky.  They were black and flying at a very low altitude.  They weren&#39;t moving fast, in fact unusually slow for any aircraft, slower than even a bird would normally fly.  One could say they were hovering but moving at a very slow pace.  I was in the library studying for school at the time the sighting occurred.  I just happened to look out the window I was sitting next to, and there they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a light on the object.  I couldn&#39;t tell if there was a light on all three of them, but I only saw one light appear at a time.  The light may have been blinking, or I may have only seen it every so often because the object was rotating.  It was hard to tell what exactly happened although these objects were very close to me.  They changed directions like this while all three of them remained in a very tight formation all moving the exactly the same speed.  They did not slow down to move around one another or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really seemed out of the ordinary was that the objects were extremely close to one another.  At times it was hard to tell if there was more than one of them; not saying that they became one at any point, but that is how close they were.  The rotated around one another, perhaps in a circle each one taking turns being the lead craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left my sight however as my view became obstructed by the edge of the building.  I then moved to another window to see them, but I did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also peculiar was that there seemed to be more jets than usual after I saw the objects.  Now I have just moved to the city about six months ago, but I know where the airport is and what it looks like when jets and planes leave for takeoff or come in to land.  I saw three different jets, too far away to tell if they were commercial airliners or fighter jets, but it was very unusual.  Usually when looking into the sky there may be one plane every ten minutes that one could see in the sky from where I was, for there to be three at once was very unusual.  They were flying at seemingly random areas of the sky, not anywhere near where they would be if they were coming in to land or were just leaving the airport.  The jets also seemed to be climbing in altitude at an unusually high pace, for whatever reason, but I do not think that commercial airliners would climb at this high of a rate.  Whether this had anything to do with the objects I saw, I do not know, but I do know that this alone was very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I saw this occur, I went out again to see if anything else was out there, but there was no sign of any strange objects.  I then went inside while the jets were still flying above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not unfortunately get a picture of the objects as the camera I have on my phone is could not take a clear picture of the bright sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was going down a straight street with houses on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to my left and saw a metallic sphere a little larger than a basketball floating about 20 feet in the air.  It was going in a straight path at about 5 or 10mph.  It went between 2 houses, over me and then between 2 other houses on the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon looking at Google Earth later in I saw that the path it was taking was due east.  It was really eerie, and gave me crazy chills down my spine when it flew directly over me.  It made no sound and it looked like a giant floating pinball,  but it didn’t seem be reflecting anything, it was just intensely shiny.  It looked like something you would see in a movie, except only it was real and it caught me completely off guard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.  PD))<n>

It was a Pin shaped light with distinct sharpness.  There were no clouds in the area it appeared.  The long skinny light was positioned perpendicular to the horizon and did not touch the ground.  It appeared as a comet almost but there was no distinct fading of the light at any one point.  It was bright throughout the object and didnt have a tail.  Many calls were phoned into local tv stations and even the local museum but the only answer that was given was space junk.  Space junk wouldnt be able to create that perfect shape/light and remain in the same spot for the time period it had.  it appeared in the southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear day, but the lake was dark with a winter storm.  Once in a while I looked toward the lake to my left.  I saw something floating above some houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a kite at first, but as I peered through my window I saw that it was long, thin, and spiral in shape, brownish gold, and that it appeared to be hovering while the body of it just kept spiralling.  It looked a bit like one of those fly-catcher strips.  I looked around to see whether it was tethered somewhere, but saw nothing.  It appeared to be just floating there.  In size, considering its distance from me, I’d say it was about 4 to 5 meters tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it left my view the sunlight hit it and it really shone.  That’s the last I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened last week, but I haven’t told anyone, as it was such a silly looking thing, not exactly what one might expect to see floating still on a cold, blustery winter’s day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Wayne IN  I travel the same route at the same time everyday and have for the last 7 years.  Have never seen anything out of the ordinary until this morning.  I always watch the stars and know the constellations, as they are the same everyday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I noticed a blue-white light in the sky, similar to an LED type light.  This light did not appear to move in any direction and was not a star, planet, helicopter or airplane.  I noticed that the stars that should have been in that part of the sky were no longer visible because something was blocking them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached Ft. Wayne, the light appeared brighter but still wasn’t moving.  I pulled over to the side of the road and came to a complete stop.  When I got out of my truck to observe the object in the sky, it blended in nearly perfectly with the night sky but was one or two shades darker.  The blue-white light was near the rear of the craft on the belly.  The light was round in shape with conical shaped protrusion coming off the bottom.  The light was bright but you could see through it enough to identify the structure emitting the light.  The light was not in the shape of a beam or floodlight but rather was more iridescent.  All the edges of the craft distorted the night sky similar to the heat you see shimmering off of a hot blacktop road surface.  The object was triangular in shape but turned on its side, resembling a wedge, with the point facing northwest.  It was moving at an extremely slow rate.  There was no sound.  There were no other distinguishing features to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to continue on my way turning northwest with the object; it remained constant in the sky until I headed south and lost site of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 in Ft. Wayne (Allen Co.) and reported the object and was told that there had been several other reports of the same thing.  The dispatcher that took my information was very dismissive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I arrived home, the light seemed to have moved from the far West to what seemed to be almost directly over Old 31.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Woke up my father to witness this.  He is a private pilot who is familiar with the skies.  I did not have to point this light out to him, as it was very apparent.

(very light cloud cover was present). There was absolutely no apparent source, and we were even unable to tell if it was coming from or towards the geosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing this phenomena for about 15 min. we went inside, puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  In most cases like this one, we would ask whether the light might have been an advertising light.  However, in our experience, most modern advertising lights have multiple beams, irrespective of whether they are based on multiple incandescent lights, or on a laser system.

I like smoking there cause i have a nice view of a lake and all i can see how the moon reflects on the lake.  The night was cool and there were no clouds just in the distance that look like fog in the sky. It was really high in the sky and it capture my attention how these little tiny lights were going around and disappearing and it looked like they were crashing with one another.  There was a plane underneath and i thought it was the plane&#39;s lights or something.  The plane would get closer the lights would get brighter and motion was faster.  It came to a point that the plane past by me and the lights were still in the same place. I started to wonder if what i was seeing was for real, tiny little lights shaped like little jupiters going around in circles around and around looking like they would crash.  I stared at it and i would see how from 6 lights i was seeing it was dimishing one by one each one going around for the last time and disapperaing, i would not see where it would go until i saw the last one leave. i was not afriad but excited that i was able to experiment this.  I wish i knew if what i saw were flying saucers or maybe just thunder or advertisment lights. but there was not anything coming from the ground.  Tommorrow i&#39;ll go and see again....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/7/07 22:07|Shinnston|WV|Triangle|5 minutes|Black Triangle with lights and no sound.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62320.html|187|ndxe200702| Black Triangle with lights and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on RT 19 south between the small community of Enterprise toward Shinnston, WV in north central WV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove to work for the midnight shift, I saw a bright light in the sky.  It was brighter than the usual star so I assumed it was a helicopter.  Besides, I could tell the light was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove through Enterprise, the light seemed to be getting closer.  I passed through Enterprise and came upon the community of Big Elm.  The light had mysteriously disappeared.  When I came around a turn near the Big Elm Elementary School, I saw something big just above the treeline over West Fork River to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my car to take a closer look.  The object had three lights in a triangle shape.  The lights went between red, orange, blue, and yellow.  I turned into the driveway to the school and got out of my car.  I heard no sound.  As the object slowly passed above me, I could tell that it was a triangle shape against the night sky above.  It looked to be about the size of a football field and to be only about a couple hundred yards above me.  The object passed by me.  I watched it pass by the school until it was out of my sight.  Still no sound.  There were no cars around until after the object had passed above me and was going toward the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued on my drive to work.  When I got to work I called my wife to tell her my story.  We live in Rachel, WV.  The object was moving North East in the direction where I live so I thought maybe she could see something also.  When I called her, she went outside to look at the sky.  She said she did see three lights in the sky that were in a triangle shape.  She didn&#39;t hear anything.  We can&#39;t be sure that she was looking at the same thing I saw but she also watched the object until it was out of her sight and did not hear a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting I have placed on the website.  I alse reported the light that went into the moon.  My wife is so disappointed that I have seen objects but she hasn&#39;t.lol  I will continue to post other UFO experiences I may have on this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was brighter than the airplanes I usually see.  It kept &#34;winking&#34; on and off until it finally winked off for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I looked out again and saw red and white colored flashing lights in a shape that seemed oval or saucer shaped.  It was so low that it looked like it was hovering directly over the lake.  It didn&#39;t move for a few minutes and then it suddenly zig zagged back and forth at an angle a couple of times util the flashig stopped and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/7/07 20:45|Austin|TX|Formation|2 minutes|Amber glow with two star-like points of light all moving in a triangular formation|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55228.html|189|ndxe200702| Amber glow with two star-like points of light all moving in a triangular formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:47 pm on 2-7-07 while waiting for the UT shuttle, I witnessed an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon for about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first spotted a very faint amber object about 150 feet in the night sky above Waller Creek running alongside San Jacinto St in front of the UT Art Building.  At first I thought it was a balloon or parachute floating, but as I observed it more intently, it was more of a dim, amber/golden glow, roughly trapezoidal, but it was more amorphous and had no hard edges.  I had dark shades running through it, as if something were inside it, or possibly surrounding the glow--it was hard to tell.  I tracked it visually as it flew silently, north over Waller Creek at a steady, slow pace maintaining the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that below the amber object were two very dim points of light similar to stars that were moving with it.  The points of light were at odd angles from the amber glow and their distance from each other formed an uneven triangle.  All three lights moved together and stayed in the same triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were transfixed as I tried to determine what it could have been.  Being an artist with excellent observational skills, I flipped through every possible explanation in my head: It didn’t even remotely resemble a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon and stars don’t fly along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not solid like a balloon, parachute, weather balloon, or any other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the amorphous quality of the amber glow and the dimness of the two moving star-like objects just didn’t make sense to me, compared with regular airplanes I’ve seen hundreds of times before.  Something was just not right about this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about running to keep up with it, but I was exhausted from having just run 4 miles at the track, and I think it was traveling too fast to follow on foot, though a car could have kept up with it easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects moved farther away, my bus showed up and I had to leave.  When I got on the bus and looked around at people, I had a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, particularly my visual and olfactory senses--lights were much more intense than usual and I was acutely aware of everyone’s movements and of the faintest smells around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the rest of the night I couldn’t stop thinking about the UAP.  I kept thinking about what normal object would match what I had seen earlier, but there were none.  I know what I saw and it was anything but normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m very reluctant to mention this to anyone, but I thought it important to at least report what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light looked to be about 500 feet in front of the helicopter. They seemed to move at the same speed and altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be about the size of one of the helicopters lights but was not flashing and was a strange pink color, not a even color all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a partly cloudy, very dark night and I was outside. No porch light on and no traffic way out here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seen a similar object on or about Jan. 6th, during the day but there were no other aircrafts in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/7/07 19:00|Spokane|WA|Disk|about 5 minutes|Strange lights in the southeast of Washington moving at high speed.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55209.html|191|ndxe200702| Strange lights in the southeast of Washington moving at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Spokane Valley, WA and I had just gone out to the street to move my car in the driveway for the night when I noticed a light moving quickly across the southeastern sky, from right to left. The light was unusual, multicolored, and seemed to be flashing in a rotating motion. My immediate thought was a meteor (I&#39;ve seen meteors before) when all of a sudden it made an abrupt change of direction from left to right. That&#39;s when I noticed the second object, which seemed to be wavering in one position, the light pattern was the same on this object. The first object came within close proximity of the second object and stopped, then the first object started to move at a rapid speed straight up, then stop and move down towards the horizon very rapidly, almost like a figure 4, again it raised up, at an angle, and stopped. The other object did not move. At this time I noticed a prop driven aircraft approaching from the north, I could hear the sound of the engine in the distance and recognized the red flashing safety lights (Felts Field Aviation is just 2 miles from where I live and this sighting took place so I see aircraft on a regular basis.) As the aircraft got closer to the objects the first object that had been moving across the sky suddenly dropped to the horizon and I lost sight of it, I have to say I lost track of the second object since all of my attention was affixed on the first one that was doing all the strange maneuvers. I quickly ran in the house to call my girlfriend and brother to come and look, my girlfriend came out and witnessed the last of the event. She saw the erratic movement up and down, across left to right, she saw the lights move and actually go out then back on, then witnessed the object drop all the way to the horizon. The aircraft seemed to pass directly through the objects location and continued on, by then both objects had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked out the window and saw that my motion-detector light was on.  I went downstairs thinking to see a deer or sasquatch, but there was nothing there.  I looked up and saw a bizarre oval shaped craft that seemed to be moving east/west very quickly.  At first I ruled it out as being a UFO since I am very close to the airport, thinking it was a plane.  But I have never seen an oval shaped plane before.  The craft continued to move back and forth east/west when it began to glow a mysterious green color.  Suddenly, the craft took off to the north and was gone.  It must have been going hundreds of miles per hour because it was gone in the blink of an eye.  I don&#39;t know what it was but it was not a plane or a helicopter.  I did not see any aliens or things like that, only the craft.  I will look for it again tonight.  I will see if I can flag the craft down to land in my yard so that I can befriend our outer-space allies..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light dissapeared suddenly and there was no visibility of the object. There was ample space in the sky to see as the object continued in the direction of my perspective. This thing just dissapeared. The event was approximately 15 seconds. No sound could be heard eminating from the object before it&#39;s aproach or after it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had 3 spotlights on the side pointing to me and several red blinking lights on top and bottom.  It was closer than the last one and the wind was coming from its direction and still heard NO sound.  I have seen helicopters at night and this was not one.

Last night at around midnight I saw it outside my window.  It scared the bejesus out of me, and I walked to my room and put the covers over my head.  I&#39;m so disappointed in myself.  I wish I would have gone out to investigate.  It was BRIGHT orange and it lit up the sky as it traveled.  First I saw it behind the trees and then it ascended upward over the roof of my house so I couldnt see it anymore.  I got a cold chill looking at it.  I&#39;m such a wuss!<n>

Much of the night sky was overcast with clouds.   Two beams of light were &#34;dancing&#34; behind the clouds.  At first I dismissed it thinking they might be reflectors, but after a few minutes the lights had moved from way in front of me to over me.  I leaned again my car to take a good look and the two lights turned into five.  They moved all over the sky in circles and some times chased each other. I went in to call my two daughters and we watched the lights for 15 minutes, but still cannot explain what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Local sighting near Prescott Valley, Arziona suggests mysterious orbs may be coming back!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 5, 2007 at around 9:00 p.m. MST I was in the passenger seat of a car heading south on Highway 69 from Prescott Valley,AZ towards Dewey, AZ .  To the south (looking towards Phoenix, Arizona) I noticed three lights equally separated in a triangular shape, hovering just above a local mountain range.  I quickly recognized these lights as resembling the largely talked about Phoenix Lights above Phoenix, Arizona spotted 10 years ago on March 13, 1997. I quickly pointed them out to my friend (who is a very well-respected woman who works in one of the local school districts) who was driving the car and she agreed that these lights were very out of the ordinary. I watched the lights start to quickly spread apart, one orb heading east, one heading west, and one heading north. My view was then disrupted by a hill on the side of the road for about 5-10 seconds. When we finally passed by the hill, the three orbs had disappeared into the night sky leaving me in a state of awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M.

I noticed a formation of 4 or 5 bright lights in the sky to the south-west.  The lights were in what I would describe as a random pattern.  We decided to take an exit off the interstate so we could get a better look.  I ended up on a service road heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked for a place to turn around I looked in my outside review mirror and noticed that suddenly all of the lights were in a perfect line!  We went about a mile down the service road, turned around and pulled over to the side and watched for a while.  One thing that we noticed when the lights were in a random group as well as when they were in a straight line, is that one or two would fade out, then slowly &#34;fade&#34; back into view.  It was a clear night (CAVU).  After about 10-15 minutes, they all &#34;went out&#34; in no particular order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, on the evening news, they were reported as flares, as high as 10,000 ft.  Which raises some questions: Why would they be dropping flares that high (flares are used to light the ground.  At 10,000 ft. they wouldn&#39;t do any good) and if they were dropped from a plane, how did they manage to drop the first group of flares in such a random manner?  Also, why would some of them fade out then reappear?<n>

My daughters and I were at the pool at night.  They were swimming, I was standing at the edge of the pool.  It was a mostly clear night with some light scattered clouds.  I heard the noise of a small plane.  I looked up and could see the plane by its lights and some reflection of the resort lights as it headed off in a ESE direction out over the ocean.  It was flying at about cloud level.  It was not traveling at a great rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught my eye that at first I thought was a meteorite.  It came from over my head/shoulder traveling in a northern direction (along the coast).  It made no sound.  It moved at a very fast speed, then slowed down almost instantly.  It made a sharp move in about a 45 degree angle toward the NW then made a circular move behind one of the clouds and ended up coming almost directly back at me.  It had a single, white light in front.  The whole thing was sort of manta ray shaped and had a silvery white glow (very subtle- which was just a bit more than what would have reflected up from the resort).  It came a short distance toward me then very quickly turned completely around (a 180 degree turn in almost no turning radius) and sped away through the cloud again.  It moved very differently than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  It was smallish, like the size of the single engine plane.  It was very organically shaped, smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They appeared to be dropping to the right, and my visibility was being blocked by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and went back to Alma School Rd And turned south and went to the next road by the Safeway Shopping center,  just north of Chandler Heights Rd.  The lights were more visible again for about a minute and then it lowered out of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went into the shopping center lot went into the store to purchase a few things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were gone when I left the store at approximately 20:15.   At that time there were the lights of several planes in the area where I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M.

It was orange for four seconds then turned lime green and went lower than the trees, out of view. I didn&#39;t see it again. A few minutes later there was a red and white blinking light coming towards Laconia, crossing over Lake Winnisquam.  It looked like a plane, but then the blinking lights appeared to be more than two at a time and jumping around. I got my binoculars and my twelve year old son came out with his new mini-camcorder. He set up to view the plane and see if it could record in the dark. I looked through the binoculars and saw red and white blinking lights flying low over the lake.  My son was excitedly trying to get my attention because what he could see on the little video screen was several colored lights on one object, randomly blinking.  He taped 28 seconds as the silent object got closer and flew to the right of us and out of our sight over Laconia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We downloaded the clip to the computer and were able to view it on a larger screen then break it down to see thirty frames per second. Each frame had a different configuration of lights. One frame had a single red light, the next showed several lights including yellow, blue, purple, pink, red, white and green. When played at real time, it was impossible for our eyes to keep up with the colors or speed. When slowed down, the clip  shows a disk shaped craft with many blinking lights circling the outer edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that when I looked with and without the binoculars, I only saw red and white lights. The camera lenses were able to capture the colors humans can&#39;t see as the lights blinked at such rapid speeds. After taping 28 seconds the object was closest to us and the view screen started showing too much static and was stopped.<n>

It wasn’t very high in the sky.  I watched it move in the night sky for about 10 minutes before it moved north and seemed to get smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very large object. An airplane had passed next to it, and the airplane was about 1/50 as compared to the object. It was a saucer shape. There were thousands of lights surrounding it and inside of it. The lights though were separated enough to make the saucer shape. It moved relatively slow across the sky heading north. The object made no noise. It was very close to the ground. It went no higher than seven thousand feet. Two other people witnessed this sighting. There was only one object. The lights within it were colors of green and blue with some red. The lights looked like stars almost. The lights were all moving together in unison. The lights were all the same size. It was at night and the moon was out. When the object flew through the light of the moon, there was no &#34;metal body&#34; or anything to bind all of the lights together. It was completely see through. It slowly got smaller as it moved away. We stood there for ten minutes and watched it float away.<n>

2/6/07 13:30|Tucson|AZ|Oval|45min-1hr|Sceptic observation of 3 "fighter jet sized" oblong, black and silver light flashing crafts.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55205.html|216|ndxe200702| Sceptic observation of 3 &#34;fighter jet sized&#34; oblong, black and silver light flashing crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my back yard on the east side of Tucson having a break from yard work and visiting with a friend. We apparently live in a flight path as we often have jets from Davis Monthan AFB flying over and often helicopters at a lower level. As we were talking, I noticed what my mind assumed were jets practicing for an upcoming air show in the sky behind my friend. I had this initial thought because the maneuvers of the 3 &#34;jets&#34; seemed very much like what we see when the pilots practice. As I was talking my eyes kept going back until I had to interrupt the conversation. I suddenly realized they were not only very oddly shaped, (oblong and black) but they were very close and there was zero sound. We got up and went to the edge of the yard as they were coming closer. My friend said they look like sky divers as they were apparently connecting then releasing in a triangular and straight pattern. It looked as if 2 would connect and let go then all three would do the same. This went on for a few more minutes and we both commented on things like weather balloons of some sort or perhaps some kind of weather anomaly. We were both trying to figure out the explanation. They began flashing what would be best described as, a silver light. Not in a specific pattern (not that we recognized) but random and they would stay lit when they connected into the straight pattern. It became more and more obvious that we had no idea what we were looking at. When they connected and lit, it seemed as if they &#34;melted&#34; into a single craft. Then a jet passed over the area above them. This reinforced the lack of sound as we could hear this jet quite well and it was farther than the unidentified crafts. They then began to rise into the sky as we watched the display of aerodynamics and the light show. My friend called her daughter in-law who was in the neighborhood. She told her to go outside and my friend tried to help her locate them over the phone. I ran in the house and took a 12&#34; x 12 mirror off the wall. We h! ad alrea dy decided that a photo at this point would be useless. When they were at their closest, we were still trying to rationalize and now they would just be too far away.  I went back out and tried reflecting light towards the ground at first to see if I could get the same reflection off the mirror in proportion to where I was situated on the ground. (They were NNW of my home when we first spotted them) After realizing I could not reflect in this direction I began trying to flash the mirror, in theirs. Perhaps I was looking for some kind of a response. My friend went to meet the daughter in-law as she was terribly excited and wanted my friend to point out what we were seeing. She was not able to find them again to show her daughter in-law, after she left my house. I watched them a total of about 30 to 40min more until they had gone so high, they were just a periodic spec of light, and then they were gone. I am no aviation expert but I have never, ever seen a plane or any other piloted craft go so high up. I keep trying to make sense of what we saw. If I had been alone, I would not have told anyone what I had seen and I would have been sure to stay out of the sun for the remainder of the day. I am considered by others and myself to be a skeptical person, so I welcome any logic that could explain all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/5/07 20:42|Dumfries (UK/Scotland)||Fireball||Saw bright orange objects at night in the sky.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55152.html|217|ndxe200702| Saw bright orange objects at night in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home last night and it was a lovely night to look at the stars, as that is what I do often as I was looking at the stars I saw two bright orange objects that were moving faster than what a plane moves but slower than a shooting star.  My partner and I just stood there and stared for a while and then one just disappeared so we continued walking wandering what it was when we looked up again and saw another five.  They were exactly the same but when one of them went towards another one it moved out the way.  I don’t know what it was but I would really like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/5/07 19:15|Prineville|OR|Unknown|2.5 minutes|Lights moving in a straight line, slow and steadily close to the ground with a very slight sound.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55193.html|218|ndxe200702| Lights moving in a straight line, slow and steadily close to the ground with a very slight sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening of February 5, 2007 at approximately 7:15 PM my wife had stepped out onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette. She was facing east with her back to the front door when she saw lights moving above and to the left of her in the sky. The lights were to the north of our house approximately 200 yards and appeared to her to be about 200 feet in the sky. She noticed them as they cleared the roofline of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon on this evening rose around 9:15 PM so this was the darkest part of the night. We live in a very rural part of the county so there are very few lights and almost no noise except for the occasional coyotes and dogs barking. There were no vehicles on the nearest road during the sighting. The air was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife called to me through the front door. As I stepped out on the porch I immediately saw the lights tracking due east. My immediate impression was that the object was very large due to the spacing of the lights and the way the lights slowly, consistently tracked without any variation in speed or direction. At no time during our observation were we able to discern any physical form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was absolutely still. I thought I could hear a faint sound like a commercial jet way out in the distance. It was like a slight wavering rumble, just barely discernable. I wasn’t sure the sound was emanating from the lights so I quickly scanned the sky for aircraft marker lights but none were seen. During this event no dogs barked which is remarkable in it’s self.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you consider the line of travel, there were two lights in the rear oriented much like taillights. These lights where about 3 feet wide by 4 feet tall and 20 feet apart. They had square corners and were flat. They shown like frosted glass with yellow incandescent light coming from within. They were at a medium glow and no light reflected from anything structural around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 feet above the right taillight, and about 10 feet to the right, there were 3 more lights. These were about 1 foot square with tight radius corners much like a passenger jet window. These were spaced about 7 feet apart horizontally. The line they formed to the right, and forward of the taillights, gave me the impression they were mounted on a curved surface. They were facing the 4 o’clock position and were the same color and intensity as the taillights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed some binoculars I keep by the front door and we proceeded to watch the object as it continued its track low and slow. I had to move around to keep a line of sight through the trees. I noted at its most distant observation the 3 window lights were situated so that the center light was above the right taillight. I didn’t see them move, I just noticed they were in a different position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event covered a span of 2 to 3 minutes. We estimated the speed of the object to be 35 to 45 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were passing by the park when the dog started barking. We looked at the field and there were little crafts flying over the grass. Every once in a while, a few would vertically fly up to the sky and new ones would come down. The sun gleamed off the surface of the crafts, and they made a metallic clinging when they would bump into each other. They made whirring noises and I knew they were not insects because when we approached them to see what kind of insect they were (my spouse is an entomologist, they backed away as one and seemed to join together to form a vertical column and drifted straight up into tht sky. We watched to see where they went, but they did not disperse, but remained in a straight column until they were too small to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving south at an incredible speed...much faster and quieter (complety quiet actually) than than the L-39 and F-16 jets i have encountered  during my life.  I am a licenced skydiver and canopy pilot with 603 jumps and have &#34;logged&#34; over a year of residental (night and day) time at airports.  I have been witness to close encounters with all sorts of conventional aircraft, and this event does not fit the bill...AT ALL!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also love to (try so far) photograph shooting stars, and have witnessed many.  Some during the day, but most at night. They always have some sort of trail of either smoke or still burning fragments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, when they are traveling in the lower atmosphere, they actually burn a more red color instead of the white plasma seen in the high atmosphere stage.  This I can say for sure...It had no tail, it was close (maybe 650 feet away at 60 degree angle to horizon), it was completly quiet.  it was traveling pefectly straight/level/south, the light looked the same coming and going, it was round, and the light (which was all I saw) had a very strange quality to it. It was very clean or pure looking, and didn&#39;t blink at all.  Like a giant l.e.d light, that had a sligly stronger output of blue spectrum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear on all that is good in this world, that this is not a hoax, and that I have truthfully relayed all facts in this matter in the way that I understand them to have occured.<n>

I ran to the window looking into the sky expecting to see a plane on fire. The blast was very loud and a plane explosion is the first thing that came to mind. When I scanned the sky line I noticed a bright oval glowing light in the sky. I then stepped back to open the window to get a better look and when I looked back in the area the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned on my police scanner and the dispatch was getting numerous 911 calls (around 30 from what I heard) from people in the area. All reporting a bright blue flash that came with the blasts. From the calls it seems to be that the callers ranged about a 1/2 mile in distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Police scanned the area for 2 hours. And also contacted the Power Companies to see if any transformers had blown. All seemed to be ok, and the Police could not pin point the area of the blast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights did not flicker at all so I ruled out a transformer blast early on. The 2 blasts sounded like a sonic boom, but the blue flash does not match up to a boom of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report helps in some way. I cannot explain what happened last night, but neither can the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a medium sized gold colored ball shape emitting gold sparks.  I have a telescope outside so I prepared my scope to get a closer look.  As soon as I aimed my scope the gold light either burned up or disappeared. I think that happended because it took me a while to get my eyepiece in the house and aim the telescope though.  I have seen this object before and I am wondering if it is some kind of test balloon. I saw the same object about a year and a half ago.  The object was in the sky over the Hollywood Hills which is in the southerly direction from my home.    There was a small plane or helicopter nearby the object. The object was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was decending at a shallow angle and travelling strangely slow.  The object had a trail and to my recollection it was greenish blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling southbound on US 65 highway that evening, returning from Sedalia to our home in Cole Camp.  The sight of this object made us quickly forget about what we had been discussing and take interest in this object.  When sighted we were near the intersection of US 65 and westbound MO 50.  After the object dissapeared out of sight to the southeast we proceeded southbound.  We traveled as far south as Lincoln while keeping our eyes fixed low on the sky to the south.  No other sighting was made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had discussed the sighting with my father a few days later to find out of he had witnessed anything similar that evening.  He had not.  I have not reported this sighting until now as I have just discovered this website and decided to specifically search for other accounts of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above time is approximate - I will attempt to reconcile my time that evening against other records and clarify it further in the near future.<n>

I am not sure of the exact time, maybe between 8pm and 9pm.  Location of sighting was Naperville, IL  a suburb 27 miles southwest of Chicago. I happened to be facing North toward a double glass sliding door.  The front of this home faces East.  Immediately I noticed what seemed to be two fireballs falling from the sky.  They seemed to falling from right to left, at an angle of approximately 15-30 degrees.  The first one was larger than the one following behind.  I would estimate the size of the larger one to be at least ½ the size or perhaps even ¾ of a full moon.  They were both bright orange and yellow blazes of light, as fire is.  Those who did not see them thought it could be fireworks. I have never seen sparks from fireworks this large and bright. And certainly no kids were out in the neighborhood because of the frigid below- zero temperatures.  This was an incredible sighting, very beautiful.  I have seen falling and shooting stars many times from such afar, very far distance, but never this close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite serious-minded, and therefore probably quite credible.  We suspect that the object may have been a meteor.  PD))<n>

When I looked up I saw a orange bright ball in the sky.  We were near Burbank Airport, so I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing, but there were no flashing lights typical for planes.  Then I noticed how slowly it was moving and it was slightly wobbling, moving left and right as it traveled.  This lasted for about 1 minute or so.  The object then stopped and hovered for about 15-20 seconds when it began to flicker.  It then ejected a smaller object.  It then began to fade in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I usually see them as lights at night, assuming they are the same ones...? At first I was watching a plane and then I notice a bright white dot behind it and I knew what it was. It started to move parallel to the mountains headed west I think, north bound if it was a car on the 101. It was so far away I could&#39;nt really give you a distance but it was behind the plane and it was a small dot so I am assuming pretty far away, a mile maybe?? As I was watching that move across the sky from a stand still I saw another dot materialize in an area of the sky the first one had just crossed and started to watch the second one start to move west also. Then I noticed another one in a different part of the sky standing still. One of them dissapeared.... WOW!!!!!!!!! I called my mom over and she saw them too but barely... It was really hard to see them up there so unless you are looking for em or they get your attention they are very hard to see...  I frantically ran around looking for my cheap $20 binoculars. They magnify 10x25  so it wasn&#39;t much help but when I looked through them at one of the ufo&#39;s and it was close enough to see that it was definetly a very shiny metallic craft and it looked like a cluster of about three to five spheres!!!!!!!!!! this is truely amazing and I am so excited that they are coming here but for what reasons? I think we will all find out soon enough...........I hope... this world needs change!!!

This object tracked my car along the road, becoming stationary when the road turned toward the object. The object continued to track my car until just before the Winterbourne Herringston turn off, whereupon it moved off at an incredible speed, widthh ways, in an easterly direction.  I estimated that this object to be approximately 30/35 metres long, and very bright (whitish light).It was completely silent.  This sighting was particularly exciting as my previous sighting of 5 disc-shaped objects occurred on the same date in 2006 (reported on UFO evidence website). Coincidence?

The object had white lights around the bottom of the craft that seemed to pulsate while it moved. It also had a red &#34;beacon&#34; light in the middle of it that just glowed. When I saw the red light I figured that it was just a plane until it did something that convential aircraft DO NOT do: IT HOVERED!!! When I saw it do that, I immediately turned my car around to get a closer look at the object. Once I turned the car around to get a better look, it seemed as though the object just disappeared into the night sky. I&#39;m not sure how many people saw this object but it caused enough of a disturbance on the ground to cause near accidents because some were trying to look at it while they were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

These two objects are above the back of the red stop sign (in the picture I will send you).  These objects are probably just balloons.  Using Microsoft Photo Editor, images on my computer automatically come up at 25%--however, one cannot see these images at 25%.  I then clicked enlargement up to 50% and saw two distinct objects above the back of the red stop sign.  (I did not, nor could not see these objects at all when I took this picture yesterday).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably just balloons, but since this picture was taken at 4:53 pm, and it would be dark in one hour, why is the, &#34;balloon,&#34; dark in the center?  I played with the gamma correction, and noticed these, &#34;balloons,&#34; were dark in the center and had a (white) structure at the top and bottom roughly in the form of a cylinder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if I am looking east, and the sun is setting behind me in the west, why are the balloons dark in the center?  It was an overcast day, so maybe this explains it, but I don’t see how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe balloons simply look like this--I have never photographed balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will now attempt to send this picture.  However, if it requires Microsoft Outlook, my computer is having major problems with this program, and I will not be able to send it this way.  I can only send it through my yahoo address as an attachment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this photo is of any interest, please contact me before publishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards<n>

They were traveling away from me, heading north towards Philadelphia. They one object faded in the distance leaving the other alone in sight for another minute.

At first I thought it was a shooting star but shooting stars have a long tail as it enters the atmosphere.  The object that I was looking at was bright and all of the sudden this object split into two bright lights and dimmed at exactly the same time and seemed to have vanished but that wasnt it, there was another object that appeared as soon as the lights split.  It came from between the burst of light and traveled straight.  I doubt that it was a plane because I have never seen a plane travel that fast and I am for sure that this event did not occur in the earths atmosphere.  I&#39;ve seen this object in the sky for many years and I&#39;ve been following it but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen it do this.  All I know about this object is a very light blue color and that it seems to flee from the sunlight and it moves faster than anything on earth and it&#39;s brightness is so dim that you can barely see it but if you look at the sky closely it&#39;s always there and I usually see this object between 4 and 5:30 before sunrise.  It seems that I can sense it for some reason because I can look at the night sky and tell you exactly where it&#39;s at.  Ive shown plenty of people but they havent been able to explain it either.<n>

Friday, Feb.2<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:30 p.m., Friday February 2nd I was traveling south from Schaumburg when I spotted two brightly lit, elliptical shapes in the sky. I have trouble gauging distances but I would say they were at least five to ten miles away.  They &#34;floated,&#34; or &#34;hovered,&#34; with no apparent propulsion system, moving south-southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between the shapes was a light that flashed every fifteen seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What intrigued me most was the fact that the shapes did not change in distance between each other as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was too far away to view any details, if there were any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thought was that they were cloud formations, but after seeing them move for twenty minutes I did not see any change to them, and they remained equidistant from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought that they could have been a pair of airplanes pulling advertisement banners. I have seen these planes over the last few months, but they stayed fairly close to the Schaumburg region. These shapes were quite a distance away from Schaumburg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not jets, blimps or other aircraft that I’ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anybody else see these things?

It seemed at first to be the brightest star in the night sky so I better positioned myself to observe it. It suddenly began to move in a strange almost wobbly way bobing up then down to the north east it varied in intensity and after witnessing this for 1:30 sec it rose sharply and then dropped under the horizon.<n>

I was grabbing boxes out of my moms vehicle since we just moved. We moved into the deep country, so I know I didn&#39;t see an illusion or anything. What I saw was a large, glowing orange ball of dim light. There was(what I thought to be) a rectangular shaped craft floating some ways above the orange ball. It was to the right of the orange ball, hovering vertical to it. Then the rectangular craft slowly floated vertically towards the orange ball. Then the orange ball floated slowly away, then took off faster than anything that I have ever seen. That is when the rectangular ship stopped, and began floating over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it turns out, the ship was a huge triangle like ship, with three lights at each point. The light in front was blinking blue, and the two in back were blinking red. The craft was completly silent, except for a small buzzing noise. It flew over my house at about tree level, so it was very close. Then it turned right, and began flying away from my house. That is when I noticed that the craft had three massive rocket looking things on the back, which were glowing a dim, bright, neon color. Of course, I ran inside of my house, telling my family what I just told you. My family is of the skeptical type, and me and my brother are the only ones in our family who believe in this stuff. So then I ran back outside, to see that it had turned back, and was flying over my house again. I ran back in the house, searching for a camera, to find out that it hadn&#39;t been packed yet. When I returned outside, the craft had disappeared. I don&#39;t know what it was, all I can say was that it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was dark except for the street lights over the middle of the village street.  I was walking due east under a slightly overcast sky and I could only see only the brightest stars through the very thin layer of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a dull but not at all loud, low frequency roar directly over my head and immediately thought it was a DC-9 or similar size commercial jet coming into the local MBS airport about 25 miles away. Small commercial airliners sometimes make a landing approach depending upon the strength and direction of the wind and can be seen overhead. However, as I looked up I realized I wasn&#39;t looking at the bottom of an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A triangular shaped object with 3 round glowing white lights and a fourth larger one in the middle of the 3 was about 1000 to 2000 ft off the ground.  It moved quickly in a perfectly straight line without any wobble or side-side movement at about 100-200 mph (this was also hard to estimate). The interesting feature was that the entire bottom was lighter than the darker sky and there was small red light that hung down slightly at the &#34;back&#34; of the object that hung down and was glowing steadily (not blinking).  The center round white light had a second ring around it and it was bigger overall than the three other lights at the corner of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve made a computer sketch of the object--I didn&#39;t have camera, just taking the dog out for a walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/1/07 18:45|Bowdoinham|ME|Triangle|30 seconds|An eqilateral triangle, lit at the tips, hovering just off I95 between Brunswick, and Bodoinham ME at approximately 6:45pm.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55130.html|260|ndxe200702| An eqilateral triangle, lit at the tips, hovering just off I95 between Brunswick, and Bodoinham ME at approximately 6:45pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overview:  This sighting took place on the evening of Thursday, February 1st, 2007, at approximately 6:45pm.  I was driving in the northbound lane of I95 between Brunswick and Bodoinham Maine.  It was the late part of dusk, about 75% dark.  The object that I saw was on the opposite side of the highway, hovering perfectly still about 10-20ft above the tree line, which would make it about 50-60 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object itself was an equilateral triangle approximately 15-20ft on the side.  At each point, on the underside, was an almost painfully bright bluewhite light.  The sky was in the period of late dusk, but not entirely dark.  Thus, it was possible to see the edges of the craft more or less clearly in contrast to the sky.  The object was perfectly still, and made no sounds that I could hear, even after rolling down the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Timeline: The part of the highway in which the sighting took place consists of a long gentle curve to the right, with the southbound side of the highway on slightly higher ground than the north.  As I began the curve, the object came into view.  It was very bright in the near-dark lighting conditions, and my first thought was that I was looking at some strangely lit new radio or cell phone tower, and even remember thinking, &#34;Gee, that’s awful bright to put right over the highway like that at night, its as bright as a car’s headlights on high beams.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the object, I realized swiftly that as far as I could see, there was no tower supporting it.  It was at that time that I realized I wasn’t looking at a normal object, so I slowed down considerably, and really did my best to take in as many details as I could before I drove out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was triangular, and black as far as I could tell.  The corners and edges were very sharp and distinct.  I did my best to take in as many details as possible.  I rolled down the window to try to hear anything, did some mental evaluations of the height above the trees, which wasn’t very great, and I tried to look at the underside, which I got a great view of from my angle as I drove by/under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something about what I was seeing made me uneasy.  I felt like I was missing a crucial detail, even as I did my best to get all that I could.  It wasn’t until I sat down to start composing this account that I realized what it may have been, and it is simply this:  The bright, highbeam intensity lights on the bottom of the object did not light up the trees, the highway, or the underside of the object, which they clearly should have.  Looking back, something I felt that was odd was how completely black the underside of the object was.  When I say black, I mean black like it was almost absorbing light.  It is an eerie realization to make after the fact, because at the time, all I thought was how weirdly perfectly black it was.   It’s the thing that now, in retrospect, makes me even more convinced that what I saw was out of the realm of the ususal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something else that I thought was odd was that, despite the fact that there must have been 6-10 cars on the highway going in either direction, no one even slowed down or seemed to take notice of the object.  Admittedly, as interested as I was, I didn’t stop either.  But it was something interesting to note.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final piece of possibly related information is that less than 5 minutes later, I saw a helicopter moving very slowly over the highway perpendicularly to road.  It moved from my side, over to the southbound side.  In more urban areas, the sight of helicopters is fairly common, but up in rural Maine it certainly is not, especially moving slow and low over the highway.  Now, there is a small airforce base in the Brunswick area, which might explain why it was there, but in the many years of traveling this route at least once a week if not much more frequently, never have I ever seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling out of sight, I tried going over every reasonable explanation of what I saw in my head.  In the end, there were only two mundane explanations that are at all possible for what I saw.  The first is that it was a helicopter, since helicopters are the only conventional aircraft that can hover at that height.  However, the was no wind-displaced debris, as there would have been, and as close as I got with my window down, I would have heard it as well, which I didn’t.  These details aside, the fact that I clearly saw a helicopter 5 minutes later at a very low altitude and a very slow speed means that it wasn’t a helicopter.  The second possible mundane explanation was that it was in fact a new radio/cell phone tower.  Keeping this in mind, I specifically drove slowly along that stretch of road on my return trip looking for a tower, or for anything for that matter, that could possibly have given off that light.  Needless to say, had I found something, I wouldn’t be filing this report with good people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and please feel free to contact me for any clarification or further questions you may have.<n>

I turned around and saw numerous orange/red lights moving in the same direction but in non-uniform formation. They were high in the sky and were followed by a white plane which appeared to be escorting them, it was without doubt moving &#39;with&#39; them. Each orange blob of light had no flashing lights on it, they didn&#39;t seem like helicopters or planes. The sky was quite dark and I could not see if the objects were bigger with red lights mounted on them or if they were just floating lights. They moved slowly and not in a way that seemed incongrous to modern technology. I thought they may be hot-air balloons but they seemd too bright and too high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People in the street were watching the lights and laughing about &#39;aliens&#39;. The lights then became obscured from view by the tall buildings. I hurried home to watch the lights from my balcony on the 4th storey but by the time I got home (5mins) they had gone. A helicopter was circling the area and did so for 15 mins. Probably a mundane explanation for this but it seemed very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a not a believer in UFOs at all, I am of sound mind, 30 years old and someone I mentioned this to told me to report it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this has been helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in February, 2007 at approximately 2-2:30 a.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was snow on the ground and I remember bright conditions, like moonlight reflecting off the snow making the night seem lighter than normal for that time of night.  I was driving south on I-77, just north of the Pleasant Valley Road exit.  My car window was cracked open because I am a smoker and I was flicking ashes out the window.  I had the car radio on, but it was not turned up loud and there was no music on---my habit at that time of night was to listen to talk radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were not many cars on the highway with me and I do not remember any cars near me traveling in my direction close to me.  I was focused up ahead as I was nearing the exit.  There were fairly dense trees to my right off the road.  I sensed movement overhead and looked up through my front windshield and just slightly to my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops, traveling north but almost as if it were following I-77 northbound (but next to the southbound lanes).  It was not directly overhead, but no more than maybe 20-30 feet to my right.  I could clearly see the outline of the craft and remember thinking it was not an airplane.  I also made note of the fact that the lights were solid and not blinking.  I put my window all the way down and could not hear anything---it was completely silent.  I estimate the craft to be about 100 yards across at the widest part.  It was clearly outlined against the moonlit sky.  It did not look metallic from my angle; I had the sense that it was black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my attention to the road ahead and drove as quickly as I could to the curving exit ramp.  As I came around the curve of the ramp, I was going to end up facing north.  I looked in the direction I had seen the craft and (as large as it was) I expected to see the back end of it.  I could not locate the craft again and assumed the tree tops were in my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the paper and online after my sighting, hoping to see reports of other sightings, but I found nothing.  For a long time I just felt satisfied that I knew what I saw and it was nothing I had ever seen.  After almost 2 years, I’ve decided I want to report my sighting to SOMEONE just so my sighting is documented somewhere.  I’m not saying it was extraterrestrial, but it definitely was a UFO because I could not identify it, it was definitely flying, and it was an object.  Could it have been a stealth bomber?  My instincts tell me that a stealth bomber is not 100 yards wide, but I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
