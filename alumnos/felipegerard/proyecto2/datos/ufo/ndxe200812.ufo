Appeared to be larger than Venus, but smaller than the full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light seemed to flare in size however orange color remained the same.  No sound was heard, speed remained constant during the duration of sighting. Many fireworks in view, however, this wasn&#39;t a skyrocket or firework.  Light seemed to be descending when last seen.<n>

We were on the South side of the building facing south, when we both noticed a formation of lights.  The speed of the formation and altitude was steady and resembled what one would expect from airplanes heading toward Lambert International airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was composed of points of light that looked just like stars, approximately 9 points of light with a tight cluster in the middle of this formation that appeared to be one object with five points of white lights on it that were in a diamond pattern.  The position of the points of light did not appear to change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation was traveling towards the northwest.  We had eyes on it for approximately two minutes and lost sight of it because of the view to the west is obstructed by the buildings design.<n>
12/31/08 22:00|London (UK/England)||Light|5 minutes|ufo lights seen|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67775.html|3|ndxe200812| ufo lights seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 10:00pm on the 31st december 2008, i was watching t.v and two orange glowing lights caught my eye from outside, at first i thought it was the engines of a plane on fire they were quite high up in the sky and i was worried so i went up to the window and called my partner over, we must have watched these lights for at least five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time the two lights got larger as they obviously got closer or lower, you could tell that they were hovering and were moving in sync with each other.  They moved fom east to south west as they drew closer we could hear a loud whirring sound almost the same as a very low helicopter ( they were still quite high up in the sky, i can only compare it to maybe a helicopter thats at full hight, it was hard to tell.), they moved almost as though they were observing something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see a shape or a object around the two lights they were almost like just two orange balls of fire, as they went west they came to a standstill literaly side by side ( if this had been any aircrafts they would have certainly crashed) the two lights then became one and it slowly got smaller and smaller and higher until eventually it dissapeared (like when you watch a boat sail out to sea).  It looked to me as though they had litterally left the atmosphere, it was a completely clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later my partner saw one of the lights again but for a split second before it had gone again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were no aeroplane or fireworks, i am completely taken aback by what i saw we actually called the police and Ministry of defence to report them!!<n>

Still looking up in the sky about 15 seconds later another obect passed over head with same flight path and speed.  It was Moving far too fast to be an aircraft, but remained visible longer than any shooting star I had ever seen before.  I submit that it could have been a shooting star.  But for 2 objects to be traveling on the same path and low in the sky I had my immediate reaction that it was something more...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Headed towards Higgensville to get on I-70. We were going to a christian concert called I-hop at the Bartel hall in Kansas City, Mo. My friend was driving the van and I was the passenger. I suddenly saw light in my window and looked up to see this huge object  moving along with us in the sky. It was up to the right of the van and coulndn’t have been any higher than a very tall tree.  I yelled for Kim to pull over . She couldn’t see anything but light and didn’t know what was going on. I grabbed my Nikon d70 digital camera(I went to college and took photography classes) and when she stopped I yelled for her to get out and look at this thing and I started taking pictures. I remember her crying and saying ,”lets go, please.” I could only think of getting a photograph of this thing. I think I was just in shock! It was moving with us, but when we stopped the van, it stopped and was just hovering above us. It made no noise at all. It was round and had about eight lights around it and every three seconds would flash on and then off. When the lights would go off, I remembered every thing was completely dark. I had to count, 123…to get a picture. I did get nine photographs, Which later I discovered matched exactely to one I spotted on the internet on you tube that someone had taken! I got in the car because my friend was crying. We pulled up to 1050 rd. and called 911. I spoke to an officer . He asked a lot of questions about what I saw and then said that he was going to get his camera and head out there himself. He said that he would come out the next day and see the photos that I got and he never called. I later discovered My arm hurt and We were sick.We went to the concert that night although we were in a daze and very shaken up. We were headed back on I-70 about 1:30 a.m. and we suddenly saw to our left the object was landed in a field. I know this sounds crazy but it is ! true. Th ere to our right was this big fire ball type thing that flew past the van and vanished. We coulndn&#39;t hardly speak. We went straight home and haven&#39;t gotten a good nights rest since.<n>

As the object moved slowly toward my location, it’s shape and detail became larger and more visible.  It was spherical, orb-like in shape.  It had 2 visible bright lights that appeared to go AROUND the object, 1 red, 1 white.  I watched this object for about 5 minutes before it instantly disappeared.  Soon after the sighting, military jets were witnessed travelling in the same sky area as the object.<n>

There was quite a large distance between them.  It was a frosty night and the sky was very clear with all the stars visibly lit up.  I was admiring the stars when I noticed them appearing parallel to each other.  The light on the right appeared to &#39;hover&#39; up and down, side to side.  The one on the left did the same and then all of a sudden the one on the left went very fast straight over to the light on the right.  I actually thought they were going to collide and put my hand over my mouth in fear!  It appeared to sit directly underneath the other one for a few minutes.  Suddenly the other light which was now above it moved off really fast.  It moved backward away from our house.  It moved faster than I&#39;ve have ever seen any type of aircraft ever move.  I opened the window and could hear no noise during the whole duration of the sighting.  I watched as they both flew off into the distance and were very quickly out of sight.  The next day I went out to see if there was something which they may have been looking at and I realised my neighbours farm could be seen near us and it is always lit up really well at night.  They use street lights all round their yard and these are on all night.  However, the room I saw the lights from does not have a direct view of the farm as it is at a different angle.  Anyhow, the lights were in the sky not down near the ground.<n>

I had just finished parking my car in my garage and was walking around the corner to my apartment building when I looked up and saw a very bright object emerge from behind a tree moving west to east.  It was too low to be a satellite (about 249 miles too low!) and had no strobe or wing lights.  It made no sound as it passed overhead.  About 10 seconds after I sighted the object it got a bit dimmer.  I figured that it had passed behind some of the haze. This meant the object was probably around 5,000 to 10,000 feet.  I continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  The whole sighting took about 8 to 10 minutes.<n>

We live in the mountains of Western North Carolina, out in the woods. There is no light pollution, so when the nights are clear the stars are all there for the naked eye to see. We went to take the dogs out around 9pm. There was a very bright light due south hanging behind  the ridge line. It was very, very bright white  and pulsating. Moving  horizontal and vertical, sometimes on the diagonal. An aura of changing colors,blues, reds, greens around the center of the light. It cast light on the ridge.  Not an aircraft........No sign of a beam coming from the ground anywhere....It was casting light................<n> <n><n> <n><n> We grabbed the video camera and got about 5 minutes of footage.  It looks like it is something 3 dimensional and spinning on an edge.  There is a dark side to it.  As we watched the light it started moving back away from us and then back towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of the sudden it started to throw what looked like a large six sided spider web light formation.  It appear suddenly like an explosion.  At first the webs of light appeared to propel the light away.  One web had vertical lines of faint color.  Another had diagonal lines of another color   A third had horizontal lines.  We have these on the video.  Then the light began to move away from us.  So far away that our camera could no longer pick it up but  we could see it with out naked eyes.  As we watched this for a few minutes, moving back and forth across the sky,  then hanging out in the eas, two more appeared with the first one.  There were aircraft in the area at this time.  We think the planes  were in front of the lights because the lights looked to be very far away now.  Watching the video later we saw that the light explode into the six sided shape and then back into a light.  We also discovered that we ha accidentally left the camera on and picked up more of the web shapes while we were looking at the 3 far off in the distance.  We called the local police  and TV stations to ask if  any other reports of strange lights had come in. The TV station said that in the last couple of months there were other reports in the area, but none like this.<n>

My 13-year-old son and I were sitting in our Jacuzzi this evening looking at Orion’s belt when my son suddenly pointed up at the sky.  He had spotted something flying and asked me to identify it.  The object was flying overhead coming in our direction from the east and heading westward in a straight line.  It was triangular in shape and had a relative size of about one quarter of a full moon (if you cut the moon up like a pie).  I would estimate its altitude to have been about that of a conventional, single engine propeller plane, or perhaps even as low as a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a dim but solid orange glow to it and there were no blinking lights (red or green) as most aircraft have when in flight.  Although I cannot estimate its speed with much accuracy I can say that from the time it entered our field of vision from the east to when it disappeared to the west took no more than three to four seconds.  Thus, I would say that it appeared to be traveling quite fast.  What astonished both myself and my son, however, was the fact that the object made no sound whatsoever.  No buzz of props, no rumble of jet engines-nothing-not even after it had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bizarre and surreal feeling watching it seemingly &#34;glide&#34; at such a speed over us.   The absolute silence of the craft and its flight is what got us to report it.  From the time we first saw the craft in the east to the time it left our field of vision in the west the craft had traveled approximately 110 degrees (180 degrees being from one horizon to the other on a perfectly flat plane).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father, and he seemed to us to be unusually serious-minded and credible.

It was at about the same altitude a standard propeller aircraft would fly.  The triangular figure was so fast it flew into and out of our sight in 3 seconds.  The strange part was that it was completely silent.  We were puzzled when we thought how an orange arrowhead shaped flying object flew silently across the sky at the speed of a jet engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father, and he seemed to us to be unusually serious-minded and credible.

It was West or maybe just slightly South of due West, and about 15-20 degrees up.  I went outside and watched it for a few minutes trying to figure out what I was looking at.  We live near a regional airport, so I thought at first it was just a plane way off in the distance.  But after watching it for a few minutes, decided that it definitely wasn’t a plane.  It was a very bright light, and almost looked to be strobing it was so bright.  Occasionally it appeared to have red lights flashing across the bottom, but that may have been my eyes playing tricks on me after staring for such a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was a good ways off, maybe 10-20 miles just guessing, but very hard to tell at night with nothing to reference it with.  My wife brought me my camcorder and I recorded it as well as I could.(very hard to hold it steady when zoomed in)  The image I got when zoomed in is very weird looking, but I’m not positive that the image is actually what the object looked like or if it is a result of digital optics through the night sky.(I’m far from an expert on this)  It finally moved a few times at a very high rate of speed, stopping for a minute or two each time before disappearing.  This is only the second time in my life that I have seen something in the sky that I couldn’t explain.  Both times I got the same ‘hair standing up on my neck’ feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))<n>

At first I thought that my Canon Digital Camera was damaged, because I saw a brilliant circle at the top of the house.  I shot the picture anyway.  I shot another photo farther trying to avoid that white brilliant circle.  It was moving up in the sky.  I shot the third photo and I couldn&#39;t see the white circle.  My husband and I decided to look at the photos and we were atonished of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo showed a very brilliant circle composed of what seems to be multiple prisms crystals. The structure shows two black wholes and it shows three divisions around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second photo shows the same circle more brilliant and going up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third photo by using the zoom of the camera shows many transparent circles in the sky and two around the house.

Then, I saw a bright orange light ascend from the ground in the distance, as if a firework, prompting me to say, &#34;Dad, look, there is a firework.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this ‘firework’ did not set of, but continued to rise, prompting me once again to say, &#34;Maybe it is a flare instead?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the light quickly diverted to the left, towards the sea and continued to gain in height and in distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped and I opened the door hoping for a noise of some sort, only to hear a nearby plane, to which this light had increased its speed and quite possibly travelling up to, if not faster than the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another surprising issue was how bright the light was in comparison to stars and lights from planes nearby.  No sooner had 3 minutes past, when the light faded and disappeared in the distance.   Seeing it the air alone was weird, therefore, seeing it ‘take-off’ from land or somewhere below skyline and then continue to fly away seemed even more of an intriguing suspicion of it being a UFO.<n>

The proximity of Travis Air Force Base to this location cannot be ignored due to the nature of this event. There were two very distinct and strange occurrences witnessed and attempting to digest, as what I was, witnessing did not relate to the disk that appears to be following the jet airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fist strange occurrence was the absence of sound emanating from the jet engines, in a valley with foothills on either side you would expect to hear the roar of a jet flying at low altitude.  The second bit of strangeness was the air speed at which the jet airliner was moving, well below stall speed and technically should have fallen from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The markings on the jet were indistinguishable so I raised my camera and started to shoot pictures of the jet, to my surprise, a brilliant flash of light just behind the jet appeared as I shot the first picture.  I looked at my camera and saw what appeared to be a disk like shape that was not visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to shoot pictures of the jet in sequence until it disappeared further into the valley.  Odd as it may sound you would think that a jet airliner with four engines would make some noise.  There were people all around shooting pictures of the castle and no one seemed to notice the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the pictures on my flash card and would be interested in anyone who can provide high-resolution digital imaging as I have about 15 pictures in sequence of the airplane moving through the valley.<n>

I had felt an urge or suggestion from I’m not sure, to open the sunroof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I opened the sunroof my eyes were facing forward and then it was suggested to me to look straight up and I saw the UFO.   The UFO was moving to the East and I was facing West.  It seemed to slow down and then moved in the direction of the arrow again.  It looked similar and yet different then your usual saucer shape for it was three connected saucer shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now picture in your minds eye the three saucer shapes and 1 was double in size and picture it was at 12:00 on a clock.  The 2nd saucer shape was at 3:00 and the 3rd saucer shape was at 5:00 and they were connected with connectors that where half the width of a saucer.  Now follow me on this one. 1st one connected coming out at 5:00 and connecting to the second one at 10:00 and 2nd one coming out at 7:00 and connected to the 3rd one at 12:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew immediately that it was an alien craft of some sort for it was not emitting an exhaust like from a jet and because of the way it looked.  What came to me next was that this is the real deal! I remember thinking that it was way up there for I did a finger and thumb crazy measuring (like kids in the hall- Crushing your head sequence) and it was about a half of an inch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that sounds crazy but I wanted to put some sort of perspective on and then it disappeared and I was yelling and laughing and saying I got to call D, J, and H!!!!! This is awesome!<n>

I was outside smoking and watching highflying planes flying from west to east, I like to watch planes late at night coming out of Memphis or going into Memphis to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning though while watching two jets that were miles away and could only barely be seen an object with &#34;swirling&#34; (the only way I can describe them) red lights on it’s ends swooped through my field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cylinder but flying long ways, not straight along its axis.  It had to be less than a half-mile away and was very fast yet silent. I could see it’s outline and could tell it was under control of something, it was flying with a pourpose and not just falling or streaking through the sky.  It seemed to make a sloping turn during the short time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew behind a tree in my backyard and did not emerge on the other side.  I scanned the sky for a long time afterwards looking for it but never saw it or anything similar again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past 5 years I have nightly gone outside to smoke, since I don’t smoke in the house.  I have seen hundreds of airplanes and helicopters fly over and numerous shooting stars, but this time I saw something that I could not explain as any sort of conventional aircraft or a meteorite at all.<n>

In my perpective, it seemed to be about 3000 to 6000 feet up and appeared to us to be seven inches high, I do not know how to calculate what size that would make it.  It passed between Anguilla and St. Martin for a duration of 90 seconds, V shaped with extremely bright orange on the bottom, bright red in center and startling white at the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to actually waver back and forth due to air resistance as it passed between the two islands, it was not moving at all like meteorites which we have witnessed many times in the past.  It may have had a flat surface which would cause this wavering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it pass just fifteen degrees to our North and headed out to open ocean to our South West.  It was obviously burning up and started to get smaller and smaller until it burned out before crossing the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The conditions were perfect, cloudless, the moon had already passed over the horizon, very little light polution, we have a video phone, video of it and are trying to enhance it because of the low quality.<n>

The deck that is at the back of our home overlooks the woods on a portion of the Manitowoc River.  My view was partially obstructed by trees, but I clearly saw some distinct lights quite low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three white lights in a horizontal row, the middle light was the largest and brightest and most directly focused toward me.  The shape of the object was difficult to discern completely because of the brightness of the lights and the fact that the lights were reflecting off of some kind of slight smoke or haziness.  It appeared to be either a stunted oblong shape or a slightly rounded diamond shape.  It stayed practically stationary the whole time, but would occasionally sway horizontally to one side or the other.  I kept staring at it to try to figure out what it was, and then I saw three or four very small red lights zig-zaging around it.  I also thought I heard a sort of reverberating humming sound, but I’m near the highway so that could’ve been anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strongly regret that I did not take any photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got scared and came inside.<n>

Seeing that this was a bit strange, I went to get my binoculars after a few minutes of observing this strange light. After retrieving my binoculars, it came closer at a high rate of speed.  As it turned to go west I observed what was orange, now become 2 red objects and one yellow/amber object. The light from all 3 objects did not strobe and the lights appeared as orb/arrowhead shapes in single file one behind the other with two red and one the amber object trailing. As the craft came closer these craft were of triangle shape and all were of equal distance,  but then converged into a triangular formation. The amber was at it&#39;s highest point in the triangle formation, and as the objects traveled through the sky, the formation changed to a single file formation and then back to a triangle formation with the amber object now at the bottom of the formation. There was no sound from these craft and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.  The speed was enormous for the distance I observed. The objects were about 32-36 thousand feet (perhaps less), descending quickly and were about 3 to 4 miles away. I was able to observe the object for about 6-7 seconds going west. I have a nearly unobstructed 180 degree panoramic view from the back of my house  which points almost directly north. I live in an area that has a lot of airplane traffic, so I know these were not planes. However, soon after, there was a plane that flew over my house and then abruptly changed direction,  the same direction that these craft were headed.

12/29/08 19:45|North Coventry|PA|Teardrop|1 hour 15 minutes|bright star-like object hovered over wooded area for at least 45 min.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67740.html|38|ndxe200812| bright star-like object hovered over wooded area for at least 45 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sighted object while driving westbound on PA route 422-it was surrounded by 7 or 8 aircraft which appeared to be helicopters, south of the highway. The object got my attention due to its odd attitude (vertical and slightly tilted to one side, illuminated, and just odd and non-aircraft looking)as well as the number of aircraft moving with it.  Object and aircraft continued west and seemed to pause near Limerick Nuclear power station, and I passed them at this point.  After exiting at PA Route 100 south I regained sight of object and followed it. The object came to rest over wooded area between French Creek State Park (which lies in both Berks and Chester Counties) and Camp Nueva Esperanza area in North Coventry Township, Chester County. Remained brightly lit and stationary for at least 25 minutes. Meanwhile, a series of 3-4 jets (probably military, seemed to have dual horizontal tail fins and lights )alternately made slow wide turns around the object&#39;s location during the entire time (I had first mistaken these jets for commercial aircraft on approach to Philadelphia International Airport, and in fact spotted at least one commercial aircraft heading that way).  One of the aircraft made a closer approach to the object than the others.  Eventually the object moved slowly westward toward the French Creek park area, as did the aircraft circling it. I lost sight because it got further west and I do not know the back roads in the Northern Chester / Berks area. Was still brightly lit when I departed. Object&#39;s shape looked like a helicopter hanging from its front end , i.e. cockpit at top and tail at bottom. Light was much brighter and a bit yellower than the surrounding stars. Although the aircraft engines were audible as they circled the object had no discernable sound at all. I will add that someone I mentioned this to stated that he had seen a large, illuminated non-moving object in the sky when departing the Philadelphia waterfront area at approximately 5:45 that evening. I felt nothing pa! rticular ly threatening about this object, but definitely felt it was not a conventional craft.<n>
12/29/08 18:40|Northport|NY|Light|about one hour|Unexplainable bright light in the sky in Long Island Ny.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67748.html|39|ndxe200812| Unexplainable bright light in the sky in Long Island Ny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of December 29th 2008 around 6:40 pm my boyfriend and I noticed 4 to 5 extremely bright lights in the sky during a drive to our friends home. The sighting originally took place as we were driving down Ocean Avenue in Northport,Suffolk County Long Island. Whenever we drive down that road, which is practically every night, I always look out at the view because it overlooks the water and is very scenic and beautiful. I was startled immediately by it because it was very unusual and there isn&#39;t a huge amount of plane traffic especially in that area. It appeared to be very very bright shining lights in the sky. I was unsure at first whether or not they were some kind of man made lights on some kind of building because of how bright they are but I know the location and there are only residential homes in the area beneath the road by the water and the lights were clearly not a part of anything. I pointed them out to my fiance who was driving and he couldn&#39;t tell what they were either. It did not look as if they were in any precise formation. They all seemed very close up, way to big and bright to be stars and definitely not planes. They seemed to hover or stay in one place. They were at all different heights in the sky, some lower some higher but in the immediate vicinity of one another. As we continued to drive I could continue to see one in the sky. We drove from Ocean Avenue to 25A and when we stopped at a light at the corner of Waterside and 25A there was that one huge bright light still visible in the sky. I frequently look up at the night sky and admire the stars and watch planes, it is something that has always stunned me. This was definitely NOT a plane. In fact there seemed to be quite a few planes in the sky which added to my suspicion that it was something unexplainable. Seeing the light in comparison to the planes really showed me how distinctly different it was. When we stopped at the light I wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t moving, that it was hovering or stationary. I wa! tched it for about 30 seconds between two tree branches to see if it was moving even slightly. It seemed to stay in place perfectly and maybe move very very slightly to either side. It was shining like nothing I have ever seen in the sky almost like it was a light that was rotating or oscillating. I then called my sister and parents who live right up the road in Fort Salonga. They kept asking me to take a picture of it but whenever I would try to with my cellphone the quality was so poor that it did not look like anything significant. I was able to take a video of it on my phone but again it looked barely visible and it was very frustrating. As we continued to drive I lost sight of it but then it was visible again when we were driving down the Sunken Meadow state parkway. We pulled into our friends neighborhood in Commack Ny and the one bright light was STILL visible outside of his home. We told him to take a look at it and he said that he has noticed it before but couldn&#39;t tell us what it was. When we went inside I could see it through his bedroom window and I noticed an extremely low flying plane in the sky while we were looking at it. ( Maybe trying to also see what it was?). I did not look out the window for about 15 minutes or so because my fiance was having a panic attack or feeling really anxious for no apparent reason. When I looked out again it was totally absent from the night sky. My mother called my Grandmother who lives in Ridge Ny which is about 20-30 miles East of where we were and she also spotted it in the sky. The whole experience/sighting lasted about an hour and it was visible from a pretty impressive radius throughout Long Island. There are six witnesses I know of who have seen this particular light in the sky. I wanted to report this to see if possibly anyone else had noticed anything bizarre or strange. I have a very poor quality video of it on my cell phone but it is not distinctive and it looks so small on tape when it was so massive in real life. I am guessing this is due to the quality! of the lens and camera on the phone. I wish I could have gotten better recorded proof but 6 people throughout four different towns saw it so I am at least glad I wasn&#39;t alone in seeing it. It did not seem to be descending or moving around at all. When I originally saw the 4 to 5 other lights I lost track of them behind the trees and only the one light was visible the duration of the sighting. My fiance does suffer from anxiety but we were fine the entire way there and I thought maybe there could be a correlation between him feeling that way and what was in the sky. We had no car troubles and I only saw a white light. My mother claims that while she was watching it it was changing colors but I did not notice that. Since there were more than one maybe it is possible that she was looking at something different than I was. She said she thought it could maybe be a star dying but that wouldn&#39;t explain how many I originally saw and the light was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/29/08 18:05|Beaverton|OR|Triangle|10 seconds|Black Triangle Fly-Over (Beaverton, OR)|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67732.html|40|ndxe200812| Black Triangle Fly-Over (Beaverton, OR)<n> <n><n> <n><n> General Description of the Event:  I was heading to my brother&#39;s house on the evening of Monday December 29th, 2008.  At 6:05pm I was driving west on SW Taylors Ferry Rd. toward SW Washington Drive when I saw a strange set of lights fly overhead.  These lights fit almost perfectly the description of a &#34;Black Triangle&#34;, three white lights creating an equilateral triangle with a single red light in the middle of the other three.  I could not make out any structures on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down and almost stopped my car as I watched it go behind the trees.  I felt the urge to follow it but the speed was too great to match in a residential area and it was traveling in a direction I could not easily follow.  In all I saw the object for about 10 seconds before it went out of view.  I immediately drove to my brother&#39;s house a few blocks away and told him what happened.  We went outside to look but did not see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Thought Process:  At first I thought it was a low flying plane and thought nothing of it.  Then as it flew overhead I thought, Hey, that looks like the general description of a black-triangle UFO,  I should figure out what type of plane has those light patterns so I can debunk it, and began consciously trying to make out a conventional aircraft shape and patterns.  As I failed to make out any familiar aircraft to go with this light pattern I began to realize I might be looking at something much more unique.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object Description:  Four lights total; three white lights creating an equilateral triangle and a fourth red light at the center of all three.  All the lights were steady with no flashes or pulsation, constant brightness.  They did not move in relation to another.  These lights were pointed down toward the ground, they were not pointed forward (as might be typical of an aircraft flying at night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white lights appeared around the same color temperature and appearance of a typical halogen bulb.  The red light appeared to be white light that had been filtered to red.  Although vivid, it was not monochromatic (such as a red LED or laser light), it looked more like a red-filtered stage light.  There were no strobe or marker lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say for certain what the body/structure of the object looked like.  It was dark with little ambient light surrounding it and none of the light emitted was self-illuminating.  I would like to say I saw a black triangular structure but I cannot be certain.  However, I was consciously trying to match a airplane shapes and patterns to what I saw and failed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size was approximately 30 ft between each white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object Flight: 10-15 degrees West of North traveling with constant speed, direction, and elevation. Approximately double the tree height, so around 200 ft above ground.  I would estimate speed between 60-80 MPH. It seemed to keep perfect alignment with the horizon with no visible rolling.  Object was leading with an edge of the equilateral triangle created by the white lights, while the final &#34;point&#34; of the triangle was pointing in the direction opposite of travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Notes: I was in the car with the music on and windows up.  I did not hear anything unusual as it went overhead.  I have a Camaro with T-Tops, so I could watch it fly overhead through the t-tops. There were no electrical or any other disturbances as it flew overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background: I am a 23 year old male. Graduate of Mechanical Engineering.  Native of the Beaverton area in which the sighting occurred.<n>

Brightly shaped craft has been observed by many co-workers for about 3-4 months off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night 12/29/2008 at approximately 20:00 hrs. I observed 3 craft hovering in the distance all at various heights of around 1,500 ft to 5,000 ft.  They were hovering in the Southern, Southwestern, and Northwestern sky separated from one another of about 2-10 miles apart as a best guess.  At these heights I would guess they could have been the size of a commercial airliner if not smaller.  Obviously they were not, nor exibited typical flying aeronautics of Earthly aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considerly the earth rotates along with the moon moving, these craft were observed at different heights as well as different locations throughout the evening. The closet craft exhibited the well known &#34;wobbling&#34; effect.  I&#39;ve read numerous books on UFO sitings from Britain. Ireland,  The United States and around the world.  I consider myself well versed on the subject from Dr. Mackey and other physicists who believe in the fact that craft are indeed originating from other worlds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape and size were difficult to ascertain, although they appeared extremely bright, too bright to be a planet or star in addition to their movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to document these incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, together with the description of the appearance of the objects, I suspect that the first possibility to be ruled out would be stars and planets.  However, I cannot be certain.  PD))<n>

When to the Southeast and approximately 75 degrees above the horizon I witnessed and erratic vapor contrail that dropped in several loops terminating in a rather large vapor cloud, with small vapor trails dropping from the terminating cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several seconds later there was a &#34;echoing&#34; boom, somewhat like a sonic boom when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier.  I thought it was a high altitude jet or a rocket that had gone out of control, so I rushed home as fast as I could and called my wife to come out and look at the vapor trail that was slowly dissipating to the ESE.  The trail was still in sunshine yet and was visible for about 25 minutes in the fading daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many news reports published in Alaska about this incident.

There was no indication of an upward projectory and the whole incident was much larger than a flare incident.  after the light burnt out, the vapor trail was still very  much obvious.  this also indicated to me that the object was much bigger than a flare from a flare gun.  this display took place in what I thought might be an Army training area near Delta Junction which is also south of Fairbanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I calculated that our plain was going roughly 500 miles an hour and this thing was going at least as fast as we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did my reasearch and this thing was moving faster than any small aircraft can go.  Another intresting fact that should be noted is that it was flying roughly only 100 to 200 feet above the desert mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for roughly one minute before it disapeared off into the horizon.

I looked down and it appeared just beneath Orion as if it just winked into existence.  It was just above the tree lines and very large, I can not judge distance and size very well, so this is just as close as I can figure... Above the tree tops but way too low to be at helicopter height or airplane height.  It was just above a 12 story tall building.  I hope you understand this, I&#39;m still really shaken by it.  Freaked.   All of the above, I&#39;ve never ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, it was a perfect triangular shape (the lights from the street illuminated it slightly and it was darker than the night sky behind it), black in color, with three very large lights on each tip of the triangle.  It moved at a very steady pace that I could easily follow with my eyes, above the tree line, and for about two-three blocks down  the street.  The lights were very, very dimmed... like they were on the lowest they could go without being turned completely out but they were illuminating absolutely nothing. the lights looked like they were slightly bulbous and not streamlined with the rest of the .. craft?   It flew straight down the street, didn&#39;t spin, nor did the lights come on and the entire thing, during the entire time it was completely and utterly silent.  I could hear the highway in the background, cars a few streets over but it was like someone pushed a mute button on this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it fly down the couple of blocks and then it just went completely black again.  Just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, about 3-4 minutes later, both my sister and I witnessed two helicopters in the vicinity; one flying toward where the object disappeared and one that was circling around the area.  It was too dark to tell what kind of helicopters they were.  I did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my sister and brother-in-law have seen this same object.  One just the other night on highway 85 from Denver, Colorado and my sister saw the same thing on the same occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m going to go out tomorrow and sketch the area from the point of view where I was sitting and draw in the object how I saw it from that point.  Maybe that will help determine the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background?  I do paranormal investigations.  I can handle ghosts, intelligent and residual, nature spirits, poltergeist activity and even the nastier things that go bump in the night... but I was always afraid of 2 things that get lumped into the paranormal category and one of them is UFOs so I never study them.  I was much happier when I was in denial, thank you very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly afterward I called my friend, who is a paranormal investigator and reporter and left him a voice mail message on his cellphone (freaking out) telling him to call me right away.  About 15 minutes later he called me and told me that he thinks I saw &#34;what the British call a Silent Vulcan&#34; and to go to this website and file a report with Peter Davenport.  And since he&#39;s into the UFO side of things and I&#39;m not, I listened to him.<n>

When it was 9:17 P.M., I first noticed 3 orbs, but then they multiplied to 6 reddish-orange orbs. The three that came out of the first three were blinking, unlike the original orbs. They seemed to be making strange shapes or symbols in the sky. We quickly pulled into the Publix parking lot, which was practically vacant. My father, my brother, and I walked out of the car while my mother stayed in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another man there too. He was going down the same road and noticed the same lights. A bag boy from Publix seemed to notice them, too. They were completely silent and left no steam or smoke. My brother tried to take a picture of them, but they were probably too small to show up on camera. The man who was there watching with us was trying to take pictures of the strange crafts with his phone. They did not show up once he captured the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, one of the witnesses, and I heard ringing in our ears.  It was strong in our left ears, but faint in our right.  After the event, I decided to do some research on UFOs, and realized, this sighting is very similar to a series of lights sighted by thousands over Arizona.  I would estimate the orbs to be about 15-30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was staring at the orbs, I felt a knot in my stomach.  They were slow moving, yet got to each other very quickly.  They moved faster than our car which was traveling about 35 mph while heading down the road.  It was easy to tell they were not part of one orbs.  The objects seemed to be mid sky, no where near the horizon.<n>

Around 9:14 P.M, my brother pointed out three redish-orange, spherical objects in the sky, which we soon discovered three more to reach a total of six.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled out our digital camera, but the objects were too small to be considerably noticeable.  Frantically, we pulled into the parking lot of Publix, just down that road, where we stopped and witnessed the six objects.  We sat there, befuddled, trying to determine what it was.  I remember rolling down my window, trying to determine if they were radio antennae.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be slow-moving, however, it moved faster than our car, which was traveling at about 35 miles per hour.  In the parking lot, another man pulled off of the same road to witness these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stopped in the sky and appeared to align themselves in regular patterns.  The formation was as followed:  Four lights formed a square while the other two slanted in a line below the square.  They seemed to be midway in the sky, not near the horizon, but where you would expect to see radio towers.  They appeared to be the size of a planet in the night sky, but smaller than the moon.  From where we were standing, they looked to be about 10-30 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood in the parking lot watching them line up and move along for about 2-3 minutes.  During this time, an airplane flew below it, however, records at the Hollywood International Airport state that everything was as it should’ve been, and no special aircraft were in the air at that area or that time. The quantity and formation of the lights changed, however, the color did not.  They seemed to be heading west, towards the Florida Everglades.  After the experience, I noticed a faint ringing in my left ear on my way home which soon subsided.<n>

This time, I got out the binoculars and eventually the video recorder and saw what appeared to be a very large orb moving forward and backward.  While looking through the video recorded, at full zoom, the orb appeared to focus in on me, giving me a glimpse of an &#34;eyeball&#34; type of configuration.  It had a very dark center and what appeared to be symmetrical structures encircling it.  The movement was very erratic and quick when looking through the camera but to the naked eye, was just bright and flashing.  After about half an hour, the orb seemed to show other colors inside the dark center, possibly red.  My husband observed through the binoculars and saw two objects, one seemingly beaming light on the other one.  At the end of the experience, the lights descended in to the horizon and left us with about seven glowing red lights that we could see through the trees.  The glowing red lights were visible for at least an hour or two after.<n>

I went and got the camera in the view finder the oject was darting around but to the naked eye it looked like it was standing still. My camera wouldn&#39;t take the picture just darkness. the lights where bright white and close to the house it was triangle in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this summer I was coming home and parked the car.  There was a red oblong shaped. It had lights that were retanglar in shape they were red this object was so close to me that I could see the metal inbetween the red lights it was huge like the lenght of a football field.  Dead in the air like not moving at all there is no way that something that big could even stay up there and not fall that I know of.  Our Farm lights are off so I don&#39;t know if that has something to do with it cause it was like they were going to land or doing somekind of obersevation we do have hogs about a mile away.  Shortly, after I has this experiance like two days later someone reported Des Moines lite up red all over. I am here to tell you what I saw two days earier and I am sure what I saw could do that easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do think this area is a hot spot for this type of activity.  I didn&#39;t contact you  because my husbond didn&#39;t want the problems that come with this but I am not hoaxing you nor did I ask to see the things but this is the second time.  I can&#39;t get the picture I had hoped to get this time because all that came out was dark but my camera doesn&#39;t shut it self off either and all the times I tried it would snap the picture than shut itself down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live 12 miles from Spencer Iowa but our town is Langdon Iowa pop 56 that is why I have to put Langdon. We live on a Farm here. We do hog confinement type work out here it is out in the middle of nowhere so to speak and I wonder if this has anything to do with this activity.<n>

It must have been a half-mile in altitude and never changed direction. It was moving very slowly, as if simply being blown by the wind and it made me think it was a balloon for a long time, albeit a very large and strangely shaped balloon.  It was shaped like a parenthesis (with the arched part up and was dark gray. I would estimate its length at 30 feet and its height 5.  I was really amazed that I could see it for so long and I even saw it through binoculars but am still uncertain as to what it was if not a UFO. Like I said earlier, an odd-shaped balloon is the only thing that comes to mind, as it seemed to be floating with the wind. It never changed its position however, as a balloon might, as it stayed steady in the air except for occasionally rocking slightly to one side. It eventually drifted over the river and out of sight.<n>

It was very windy outside and I had just pointed out to my girlfriend to look at how hard the tops of the trees were swaying due to the wind and just as she looked up twards the top of the trees it there appeared to be an explosion/flash in the northeastern direction and was directly followed by the complete sky lighting up in a green flash.  I could not see an object before or after the event.  It did appear that the flash caused the green lighting of the sky.  Also it was the whole sky that lit up green not just a part of it or so it appeared that way.  The event was extremely quick, a second or two at most.  This was the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I am very curious to find out if the account was witnessed by anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were returning from a medical checkup I had in Madison, Wisconsin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was clear.  It was about 1 AM.  It was the end of December 2008.  Leaving Iron Mountain, Michigan we turned north on M-95.  We went only a few miles when I noticed 4 white lights off to the right and barely above the pine trees.  (I was in the passenger front seat.  My wife was sleeping in the back seat.  And her sister was driving.)  I told my wife’s sister to look.  We both watched the lights.  They each looked about the size of a silver dollar.  The lights were not overly bright and looked an inch apart.  Then suddenly the 4 lights changed to 2 lights that appeared to be the shape of crescent moons about 9-12 inches apart.  Again they were not overly bright.  We were traveling north.  The lights appeared to be moving south south-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it might have something to do with possible towers in the area.  We have never these lights before.  We have traveled this route countless times before.  I have since been along the same highway four times during the day and night.  Any towers we saw had red lights.  Nothing like what we had seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve again seen the strange rotating light reflecting on the clouds over the house across from me.  Same house as last time.  Tonight is a very clear night with almost no cloud cover so I could not see it for long, but I was gazing at Orion while out on having a cigarette and a small patch of thin clouds drifted over the house.  For the duration of the cloud cover I saw the same lights.  They look almost like what would be car headlights in fog but they rotated stationary over the house - lights facing outward.  No actual craft/vehicle/source can be seen, only the lights reflecting from above the clouds.  When the clouds drift away the light cannot be seen at all but when more clouds drift over, it can be seen again continuing the rotation.  This is really started to freak me out.

I then thought it was a glare on the mirror since it didnt move or a street post, but the posts in our area Ft Washington MD are not that high.  I went and laid her down and got my binoculars.  I had kept them out from my little gil looking at the planets a few weeks ago.  It was still twinkling and appeared to have alternating patterns of colors and then nothing.  This was too weird so I opened the window to seee better but closed it it was cold out.  AI kept looking at it from the binoculars in amazment, it did not move, then finally it began to move  crazy like up then down then began to move across, i was like oh ((word deleted)) what the hell.  it then began to move across the sky, like cloud view or helicopter, inbetween, still had the color alternating thing, and a whoosing sound like a jet but deeper in sound,  I appeared to have a dk grey metallic  like stucture with like some red lights amongst the bottom.  As fast as it was and that crazy noise was unbelievable.  i stood in the window kept sayign   Oh my God and then started crying.  I didnt know what to do or say,  i then got my son up who always has stated that he sees some different planes and told him about it.  he said he had just heard the noise but did not know what it was.  Please know that i am just a normal person, i do not drink or do drugs so this was not some imagination.  I have been googleing all morn to see if anyone else saw this.  If so pls contact me.  I do believe in &#34;UFO&#34; as they call them, but never did i expect to see one in my lifetime.

The call was taken in two counties as the object was witnessed while traveling across county lines.

The sky was bright to the south due to the setting sun, with some high altitude clouds in the background. Visibility was very good. There was a slight breeze from the north, which was slightly bowing tall palm trees in the area. I became aware of a stationary black dot just above the skyline directly to the south of my location. I first took it to be a tethered advertising balloon, but soon realized it was too high in the sky, and would interfere with aircraft. After several minutes I went into the house and got a pair of binoculars to get a better look at the object. With the binoculars I could see the dot was actually oval shaped. There were five or six smaller circular objects spread out below the oval in a semi-circle. These objects were not visible to the naked eye. I watched for several minutes, periodically fiddling with the adjustments on the binoculars to get a better view. The large object seemed to remain stationary, while the smaller objects slowly moved about beneath, seemingly grouping up with each other in various configurations. All the objects were opaque black, backlight by the bright light of the setting sun. The oval looked like it might have had a reddish spot near the top, but it could have been due to the lighting. I watched for about five minutes until I received a phone call. I tried to locate the objects when I finished the call several minutes later, but they were gone. I cannot estimate how far away the objects were but feel they were fairly distant. There were general aviation and commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I rule out balloons due to their not reacting to the wind and the regular spacing that the objects maintained in relation to each other. Balloon I have seen released into the sky quickly dissipate and follow random paths following the direction of the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am no computer whiz, but I have made two drawings which I will attempt to attach which illustrate my observations.<n>

I think I was looking at the pine tree seen in the video first, then i noticed what i thought was a balloon. Didnt think much of it at first till i noticed it wasnt moving with the air how a balloon would typically do. I&#39;ve seen balloons float before in the area because people usually have partys around holidays or on the weekends and they always float in a north east direction and these objects were and stayed in  a south east direction from where we were standing. Thats when i told my brother if he was seeing what Im seeing and I told him how it was weird how its kinda just sitting there. that when i started recording and i noticed it was moving back and forth, told my brother and he noticed it too. We noticed it was moving back and forth because of the tree. Of course the tree is stationary and you can see in the video how the star/balloon UFO was moving back and forth. my brother ran inside to get the tripod kuz it was difficult to zoom and focus of the object, then we lost it. I continued to look for it up in the sky and found it again, I tryied recording it but it was too small to focus on. Then i noticed that there was another next to it and it seemed as if they were playing (they were moving close and away from each other). Seconds later I lost sight of them again and then noticed a third maybe twice as far or small as the previous and it simply blended into the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on my balcony and the night was very clear.  There was no noise at all from the objects.  They were very bright and quite large.  They flew across then the one in front flew straight upwards then the second did the same.  They appeared to be flying synchronised.  They flew across again and then straight upwards again, then across.  The objects then went out of view, due to a Tower block.  I had no alcohol on this evening and smoke outside on my balcony so am very used to seeing aeroplanes etc in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It apeared to be a plane or a helicopter so it was about 4 times brighter than a star, However there was no noise while it moved across the sky about 45 degrees (favoring the north) than it stopped and than started and stopped a few times.  After about a minute it started to get smaller as if it was moving further away from us. During this the light elongated into a line instead of a sphere which seemed to have a whitish bluish light with the orange. Than it completly vanished. It seemed to close to be a satalite, or space station.<n>

Upon further inspection with binoculars, we saw that it had Blue, Red, (?Green), and yellow blinking lights. Looks as though the yellow - white light is in the middle and the other colored lights surround it. Examing the rest of the sky we see 3 more of the same. One in the NW sky, one in the NE sky, one in the SE, one in the SW. The moon is almost full. There are a lot of planes as well in the sky tonight, but these lights are stationary, and they don&#39;t blink like an airplane. I saw the first one at about 20:30. Now at 22:42 all 4 are still in the sky. What are they?<n>

PD))|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67636.html|85|ndxe200812| Two light objects sighted flying south off the west coast of Sarasota, FL<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following event was observed on December 25th 2008 at approximately 8pm eastern time from the 7000 block of Point of Rocks Rd, Sarasota, FL (N27-14.6 W082-32.00).  The visibility was greater then 10 miles, the cloud layer was scattered at approximately 5000 feet and the winds were out of the south east at approximately 10-15 knots on the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8pm eastern time, I observed a lighted object roughly 3 miles to the north west of my position about 60 degrees above the horizon, moving south paralleling the west coast of Siesta Key.  The object initially appeared to be a plane with an engine fire but as it approached closer to my position it became apparent that it was more of a spear emitting light similar to intensity and appearance of a common marine flare, flickering yellow and orange/red in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled from its position north west of me, almost due south, paralleling the coast for about 2-3 miles.  At its closest point of approach it was due west of my position by approximately 2 miles, or about 1.5 miles west of the beach of Point of Rocks.  At this point the object appeared to stop moving and began to climb.  I was unable to determine if the object actually stopped moving, or turned its motion directly away from me.  Either way, the object climbed into the cloud deck and began to fade from sight as it passed through the 5000’ scattered cloud deck.  As it began to climb and fade from sight, another object, identical in appearance to the first, appeared approximately 2 miles to the north west of my position at approximately the same altitude taking an almost identical flight path as the first.  The first object had faded completely away by the time the second object made its closest point of approach to my position.  It also appeared to stop or turn away from my position like the first, climb and penetrate the 5000’ cloud deck and fade from sight.  The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from visually acquiring the first object to the second object’s fade from sight.  My best estimates of their velocity would be in the 60-120 knot range.  I estimate this based on the position of the object above the horizon in relation to the cloud deck which I estimated to be at approximately 5000’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the objects, as mentioned above; they emitted a tremendous amount of light energy with flickering similar to a flare. I was able to train a high power telescope on the second object and saw nothing but a pulsating light that I would have reported as a flare if the trajectory had not been what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently work as a professional offshore pilot in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  I have seen flares, fighter jets afterburners at night, oil rig burn offs, boat fires, large shooting stars breaking apart, plane crashes and countless other night time lights and phenomena.  I am convinced that this was none of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Doing my best to confirm that I did not witness the flare of a vessel in distress, I spoke with the local Coast Guard Sector.  As I was explaining what I observed, the Petty Officer Cut me off mid sentence and asked if I think I saw a UFO.  I advised I was not sure when he told me that he just received a report from another source in the same area of an identical sighting and it was being reported as a UFO.  I placed calls with all of the local Air Force and FAA airspace controllers, who all reported no operations in the area.  I followed up with the Coast Guard on the December 26th, who advised there were no further developments with this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we suspect that the person is a superlative witness.  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses present, or from anyone else in the Sarasota, who may have been witness to the same event.  PD))<n>

We had noticed a really bright light in the sky for the last few months, but tonight it had moved lower down on the horizon.  I pointed it out to my sister and we began discussing how that could be possible.  I said that it couldn&#39;t be a star, because the axis of the earth doesn&#39;t move fast enough to change our viewpoint on stars overnight. As we were talking about this, the object moved sideways very quickly in the sky, and the light started dimming, until it looked as if it were trying to mimic a star.  We kept looking at it and were in disbelief, when suddenly the light went completely off, leaving only a faint reddish-blue point in the sky.  The reddish-blue &#34;craft&#34; started moving very rapidly in short movements diagonally and vertically, and then vanished from sight completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 20 years old, and my sister is 17, and we were completely sober at the time of this happening.<n>

So I used a zoom camera to get a closer look, it must have been at least 4 miles distant. I took a picture of it but I wasn&#39;t used to the camera and so didn&#39;t get more than one shot fairly clear, crappy focus. I only just looked at that one image today and after enhancing it I can see a small black three or 5 sided, flat UFO with a light circle rim on its most prominent surface, it looks like it is banking like a plane in the shot.

We were visiting friends after attending a midnight Christmas service at a local Church. At approximately 12:30 am we entered the A47 perimeter road into Earl Shilton, which is under construction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before entering the road entitled “Carr’s Hill”, I observed a large reddish light towards the northeast. The light was stationary or moving very slowly. I did not mention it to my wife at the time as she was driving. Suddenly the light became slightly brighter and from beneath the light appeared a smaller light, which immediately descended to the ground and disappeared The smaller light seemed to be controlled as it descended very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned it to my wife and she confirmed she had also observed it. We drove to the other side of Shilton, which opens up to the soar valley and we would be able to see the night view of the countryside stretching to the light haze of Leicester, however both light sources were not to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to observing only a light source in the middle of the night, I am unable to give a true perspective of size, the light source did disappear behind the hill of Earl Shilton village and therefore the light source would have been of considerable size.   Using this perspective I would estimate that the light descended toward the area of small village called Thurlaston.  My wife and I can only rule out a Meteor, as the light was all but stationary, with complete cloud cover. Or a Firework, as it appeared in the sky for too long to sustain such brightness and besides flares go up not down.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the worst part of a windstorm with SW winds sustained at 34MPH (54KPH) and gusts to 62MPH (99KPH).  As she was finishing up brushing her teeth I took a look outside to see the trees swaying in the high winds and saw an aircraft in an unusual position in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living outside Rochester, which has an international airport, it is not unusual to see planes, mostly incoming, approach from the east, headed west along New York state route 441 which later becomes Elmwood Avenue and leads a nearly straight line to the Rochester airport.  On this night, however, the aircraft I saw was at least a mile north of route 441 and had a spotlight similar to those I saw on police helicopters when I lived in Los Angeles.  It also had blue and red lights, but the spotlight was most noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the door to get a better look. My daughter, a firm believer that UFO’s are not real, saw what I was looking at and her exact words were “Is that a UFO?”  I told her it looked like a helicopter.  However, within a minute it was nearly overhead and we couldn’t hear it.  Its’ speed was much slower than most planes, and the spotlight (which was pointed toward the ground, but slightly to the right of its’ flight path) was very bright.  The speed and the spotlight seemed to suggest that it was a helicopter, except there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued past our house where it seemed to pick up the path of route 441-west, towards the Rochester airport.  My daughter captured some video on her cell phone but it was captured through a closed window and appears to be a speck of light in a dark sky when viewed.  The flight path, the red, white and blue lights and the speed all seem to point towards a helicopter, or maybe even a small plane flying into a 40- to 70-knot headwind. But why would a helicopter be using such a bright spotlight? There were no police chases here that night.  And, its’ speed was faster than any possible police chase on these curvy, hilly roads.  It traveled at least 5 miles in about 2 minutes. And it was at a height of several thousand feet, too high for the spotlight to illuminate the ground.  It was cloudy and windy, but no fog or rain or snow to explain the use of the bright spotlight.  I also considered the possibility that an aircraft had landing gear trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To both of us, this seemed like it might have been a UFO and it might have been a helicopter with a bright spotlight.  It is possible that the wind was howling so loudly that it drowned out the helicopter sounds.  This sighting was unique enough to get my un-believing daughter to think it might be a UFO.  I’ve seen much stranger objects, back when I lived in the Hudson Valley region of New York State; objects the size of football fields that moved unlike any aircraft, and this sighting does not come close in comparison.  The object we saw, though, is still unexplained as far as we are concerned.  We are also aware of the obvious implication of seeing something unidentified flying across the sky on Christmas Eve night, but for now we’ll just call it a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting, we were at 43.15 degrees North, 77.34 degrees West looking East initially, then South, and lastly Southwest as we lost sight of it.<n>

I saw 2 bright orange lights in the sky quite high up but moving slowly in a south east direction.  They were quite far apart but travelling at the same speed in the same direction keeping the same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and both of us leaned out the windows to listen for the engines, but only silence.  Then 3 more in a triangular formation followed at the same speed in the same direction.  The were spaced out but a definate triangle.  The orange circular lights all looked the same.  We were freaked out - then a larger orange light appeared following the other 5. They seemed to be going higher as they moved away.  At first we thought it was aircraft, but was cutting through the flight path to Glasgow airport in the opposite direction.  They all moved at a steady speed always keeping formation.  The silence was creepy.<n>

First i must say that i have seen what i believed to be a ufo several years ago (5 or more)  that was three very bright lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were muptiple witnessness that saw the object that simply disapeared after a few seconds.  So in saying that, since that incident i have become obsessed in watching for ufos or anything that could not be explained.  I have become an avid skywatcher and have not seen anything out of the ordinary since, until now.  After this incident i searched online for the proper way to report this type of thing and i found this is the way to go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of Wed. Dec 24 2008, after trying to return a christmas gift i was heading home in the major metro and just before i reached my destination i witnessed a large strange orange light in the NNW sky ahead of me.  I just happened to stare long enough approximately 6-8 seconds to witness another much smaller light that appeared to be the exact same color as the larger light eminate from the larger one and slowly float to the earth in a straight line.  When the smaller light appeared to reach the ground the light in the sky just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression when i saw the light was an airplane but i remember thinking quickly the plane has dirt inside the light because of the odd color.  Then when the smaller light appeared out of the other i was quickly thinking that sparks were coming out of the plane and i was witnessing a plane malfuntion or crash.  Then when the second object never flickered and went to the earth at the same slow speed and as soon as it seemed to reach earth the object in the sky simply went out, i knew i was seeing something unordinary.  So i pulled off the side of the road and stopped to look for a plane or helicopter.  I stared at that part of the sky for anything flying and seen absolutely nothing.  The background was nothing but sky with a few high level clouds.  I hope to talk to any representative who wishes to hear this account in person.  THIS IS NOT A HOAX.  follow ups will be granted and wishfully expected.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object flew from south-west pretty slow and low altitude without flashing and it was totally silent.  There was no trail after it. It started changing direction so it finally seemed heading south-east.  (About 90 degrees change)  At the same time the object pulled up high altitude so it vanished behind clouds.  The clouds were very high and thin because of cold weather, -9C (15.8F).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many observers present there in the cemetery because it was Christmas eve and people leaving candles to the tombs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture of the UFO with my canon digital camera.  Because the object was far away and it was dark it just seems to be an orange spot in the picture but it is real.  This was definitely not an airplane nor a helicopter.<n>

I&#39;ve taken photos of UFOs near Ely Cathedral, Cambridge, England.  I was there for the Xmas Eve Carol Service.  The photos were part of a steetlamp experiment that was inspired by Miceal Ledwith and Klaus Heinneman&#39;s book The Orb Project.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fascinated by Miceal&#39;s theory on Orbs as fluorescing beings and had similar observations myself.  I wanted to take the experiment into a different direction - that of shooting straight into fluorescing streetlamps.  I have been astounded by some of the results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the biggest discovery was before I shot the photos.  I was aiming the camera at the streetlamp when I saw the UFO materialise.  I didn&#39;t even have my finger on the button to activate the infra-red or flash. Like looking at the UFO in a live movie, I noticed something interesting.  If I tilted the camera left or right, up or down very slightly, perhaps no more than 5 to 10 degrees, the Orbs came into view or vanished, or demonstrated a partial materialisation as can be seen in the selection of photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFOs were perfectly still! If I moved the camera slightly left or right, I got the phenomena I&#39;ve documented above.  When I moved the camera back to its original angle, they were there again in clear view.  I know it sounds unbelievable, but the photos I shot are the proof.<n>

We were expecting a storm and the sky to the Northwest of where I was traveling was very grey.  Set against the grey sky, I saw two oval shaped objects.   What really caught my eye was the way they seemed to be pulsating with light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were cigar or oval shaped.  They looked to be Southwest of Mount Baldy.  The objects were parallel to each other with the lower one slightly to the right, or East of the other.  The whole sighting lasted just over a minute.  Both objects seemed to light up and then fade, repeatedly.  They looked to be pulsing with light.  Each pulse probably took a few seconds to complete, from getting bright to fading back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the objects and looking for somewhere to pull over, and perhaps snap a picture, the objects just disappeared.  They brightened and faded and then they were just gone.<n>

From lights that can only be seen with a pair of binoculars coming head on towards each other at extreme altitude, (approx. 80,000ft.)   only to have one disappear as they meet, to flashes of light that just appear and then disappear just as fast. These strange sightings have captured my attention that I keep watching nightly for them. Unfortunately they happen too fast to photograph and are too far away to zoom in on.

North Shields, North Tyneside, England.   21:20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home when an incredibly bright object flew over my head from approximately East North East to West South West.   It was incredibly fast.   It left a solid tail light behind which remained behind it.   At first I thought it was a “shooting star” but as I stared at it I realized that it was not like any “shooting star” I had ever seen.   It flew horizontally.    It came to an abrupt halt and remained stationary.    It was circular and flat (like a hockey puck) and incredibly brilliant and fast.   There was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then another object appeared sort of slowly.  It was much higher up and much much bigger.    It was odd shaped – seemed to be angular and outlined by pin prick lights.   The centre of this object was in darkness.    The pin prick lights got a little brighter and then the object hovered.     Again there was no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects hovered for several seconds and then the brilliant “hockey puck” just vanished which took me by surprise and then I realized the other object had also vanished.   The thought occurred to me afterwards that this was a rendezvous and the “Mother” ship had come for the reconnaissance craft.     Does this sort of thing happen?  The sky was black at the time with no stars visible.   The weather was cold and dry.   This was a residential built up area and as I walked home I saw few cars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am retired, have lived in many places, travelled to many countries and camped in remote areas, and this is the first time I have ever encountered anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 15 miles from a small International Airport so I am used to seeing planes flying overhead or coming into land, both in daylight and in darkness.     There is absolutely no way either one of these objects could have been any aircraft I have ever seen. I am also used to seeing Royal Air Force Jets fly at low level and at high speed as their base is in Northumberland (about 50 miles from me.)<n>

It was so unusual and SO LOW in the sky that it appeared you could touch them, i.e. they were reachable somehow at the treetop line.  These lights could NOT be ignored.  Anyone who saw them would have stopped in wonder.  THIS WAS NOT A PLANE OR A BALLOON OR A STAR.  These lights were each BIG and the formation stretched out about the distance of a couple football fields, I would say.  They were NOT spotlights.  There was no trail or wake of light or aura.  We, ALL FOUR of us, saw the exact same thing and actually turned the car around to park to get a better look.  The lights were hovering at the 8, 10, 12, 2, and 4 o’clock positions and appeared to be part of a whole, but there was no “body” or “craft” perceptible.  They seemed to have been there awhile, because they were still where we had first noticed them and not moving.  We stayed and watched them, discussing it for about 5 minutes (What to do?  Was this a UFO?), when “it” suddenly “seemed” to move very slowly over a field beyond us not far from its original location but out in the open.  “It” was no longer above the trees but at the same height or a little higher.  It was very difficult to calculate distance from the ground because the lights were so big, they seemed very close.  They seemed to be in the “air” near the ground not “high enough up in the sky” where a plane would fly.  We drove that way in the car, as it was on our way home, and continued to look as we drove by it.  We could not see anything but those lights (white) in the same formation.  Then it literally vanished in less than a second.  No noise was! heard, no perceptible movement in its departure.  We thought to report it, but my husband said “everything is explainable” so we didn’t want to appear foolish.  Others MUST have seen this, though no other cars were on the road where we were at the time.  We laughed about it and our 11 year old said it might be Santa.  We left it at that, but it has been bothering me and thought I should report it.  It was just very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Slowly moving to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Long Description of Sighting Report It was dark and clear below 2000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving east on Hwy 37, past Skaggs Island, about 3-5 miles west of Vallejo, I saw two bright, white lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, they appeared to be two landing lights from a larger airplane. I didn&#39;t pay too much attention to them, I just noted that it looked like an airplane, going in the same general direction as a &#34;right downwind&#34; for runway 6 at Napa Airport (KAPC). If it was a private jet in the pattern, they&#39;d be at ~1500 ft - and that&#39;s about what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did start to notice that the &#34;airplane&#34; seemed to be &#34;downwind&#34; longer than normal, as it didn&#39;t turn right, to base, as it should have done - so, I started watching it more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was a helicopter? But, a helicopter doesn&#39;t have widely spaced &#34;landing lights&#34;. Maybe it was a helicopter with an advertising grid below, with 2 large lights? It seemed odd to me - and since I&#39;d never seen a helicopter with a lighted advertising display, that would have to been pointed towards me so that the &#34;directional&#34; landing lights would stay a brightly white, from my viewpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, oddly, the two lights, that were level, seemed to bank and turn left (to my right, as it had seemed to be heading towards me).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was odd, is that the two lights, didn&#39;t change in intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Landing lights&#34;, are &#34;directional&#34;. If they aren&#39;t pointed at you, they, basically, go out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a licensed pilot with quite a bit of night flying experience - and being based up north of San Francisco Airport, you can watch the landing lights of the passenger jets take off at night and watch them wink out as the jet makes it&#39;s turn after takeoff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, when this &#34;thing&#39;s&#34; right side light seemed to drop, and it seemed to turn &#34;left&#34; (my right), back south(ish) towards central Vallejo, it really stood out that the 2 lights didn&#39;t change in intensity at all. That would infer a non-directional light - and that wouldn&#39;t be on an airplane - as a non-directional light that bright, would blind the pilot&#39;s vision. Then, as it seemed to still be at about 1000-1500 ft, I saw a string of 7-8 dimmer lights tying the two bright light together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was odd, and different from my first impression, was that the right side bright light stayed ~30 degrees lower than the upper left light (as if &#34;it&#34; was still banking) - but, the two lights stayed offset and the pair of bright lights (and the 7-8 dimmer lights connecting them) began obviously traveling east, at, I&#39;d guess, at 40-50 mph. (as in def not 10-20 and def not 60-70) It wasn&#39;t turning anymore, it was traveling east over Hwy 80 up the Auto Mall &#34;valley&#34; - still with the two lights offset in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d been watching it over the Napa River Bridge, through Vallejo (on 37), past 6 Flags Amusement park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of it while taking the 37 / 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. I caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - Then I couldn&#39;t see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the first offramp and doubled back on Admiral Callaghan, I couldn&#39;t see it, but caught a momentary glimpse of a lighted spot 1000 to 1500 ft up on the valley ridge, right about at the Target store shopping center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d guess that it was 80% to 90% of the way to the top of the hills (I could see the outline of the ridgeline). The lighted spot was reflected light, and I couldn&#39;t see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft wide up near the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when I got to the top of Admiral Callaghan, I couldn&#39;t see the light on the hill anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went down to Auto Mall Parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In recreating my initial view, what I first had thought was &#34;downwind&#34; on Rwy 6 at KAPC, was wrong. The lights were over the northern edges of the town of Vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the Napa / Solono county borders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside. No smoke, no flicker, no pulsation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 4th, at about 6pm, I called the FAA tower at KAPC and asked the controller if they had had any other sighting reports on the 23rd. He didn&#39;t, and he checked with the controller on duty that night, and he didn&#39;t see anything, either. The lights would have been to the south of the tower, behind the controller&#39;s visual operating area (runways are north of the tower).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of observation, about 10 - 12 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone else describes a similar sighting, feel free to contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Fourth Floor of Valley Fair Mall where the food court doors are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the fourth floor of Valley Fair mall in the early morning and was watching the usual government chemtrail&#39;s killing us on a daily basis, that&#39;s when I noticed a small orb or sphere that could maybe fit a single person in it. It was about 200 to 300 yards away I have more than perfect 20/20 vision I can see perfect far and close. I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer. It then did a sudden sharp turn and seemed to slowly and leisurely fly toward the Mount Hamilton area and disappeared. The orb was silver and smooth I could not see any widows, lights, markings, or contrails coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a string of lights hovering ESE.  It was three white lights, well above the trees, but too low, I believe, to be a typical aircraft.  I slowed down to get a better look, I was the only car on the road, but there were cars on the Turnpike below me.  The lights hovered for about a minute in one spot, then slowly moved NNE, vaguely following the line of the Turnpike.  The lights rocked slightly as they moved.  I watched the lights until they disappeared below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looks like a strange aeroplane, i think it&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  At first i ddn&#39;t trust him, but he kept convincing me and the other that he didn&#39;t tell a lie.  I tried to trust him and looked at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What i saw is the strangest aeroplane that i&#39;ve ever seen.  That aeroplane was flying in low altitude, but i couldn&#39;t hear it&#39;s sound at all.  It was so strange, because usually if i saw an aeroplane, it would make a noise although it flew at a high altitude.  That aeroplane was glowing some colorful light around it&#39;s bottom surface  And the most strange thing is that mysterious aeroplane flew in a random pattern of movement, sometime it move forward, sometime in circle movement, sometime it just stop and stand for at least 5 seconds.  Unfortunattelly, my N95 camera couldn&#39;t give a best shot, so i deleted all the photo take i have taken<n>

I thought it might be a plane but wondered how high a plane would have to be to look like a star.  I lost sight of it for 2 minutes behind some clouds.  As the clouds moved I could see it again moving South.  Again I thought it must be a flight pattern but I don’t know.  I saw only a white light.  No red or flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were traveling to Sacramento, California to then fly back to Raleigh, North Carolina.  The purpose of our travel to Elko was to see our long lost friend from elementary school. When traveling back we took a stop in Reno, Nevada.  From there we spent the night at a motel, Motel 8, and then, in the morning, upon departure, we saw, what we thought to be, a UFO. There was a bright light, it then turned into a turquoise color and seemed to disappear.  We then heard heavy winds, from inside the car, and then we saw lots of dust and a dim light. I believe we saw some kind of creature approaching us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I, were shocked when we saw it and panicked on whether we should go back to Elko or continue into California.

The person sitting next to me said that it had multiple different lights on it. We can explain this sighting other than it must have been UFO. We have never seen anything like that. It couldn&#39;t be an airplane because it moved very fast and in a strange motions. This would be impossible for any aircraft to move like this.

At first I thought it was an aircraft except that the orange glow was more like a spent firework, there was no sound and no navigation lights. My next thought was that it was the ISS or a satellite. The ISS was ruled out by its appearance and the lateness of the hour and its angular movement appeared to be too fast for a satellite as well as being too large and the wrong colour. I was still trying to decide what the object was when another one appeared, exactly on the same course as the second (and, as far as I can tell, the first).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this occasion I went out of my garden gate into the adjacent road in order to keep the object in sight for longer. The night sky was completely clear and cloudless and there was complete silence. The object continued on a dead straight course towards the east and gradually faded from view as it became more distant. I waited for several minutes but did not see any further unusual airborne activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 63 years of age, in good physical health and on the occasion of the sightings, totally sober. I have been employed as a pilot since the age of 18, first as a fast-jet pilot in the RAF and later as a captain with a British airline.  I estimate that the height of the objects was between 1000ft and 5000ft mainly because my first sighting in the car would not have been possible had they been very much higher or lower (assuming they were on the same course). They could have been conventional aircraft except that they were totally silent and also displaying no anti-collision or navigation lights, just a dull orange glow. The speed is very difficult to judge without knowing the height and size but if they had been at 3000ft they would have been travelling at around 250-350 kts.<n>

While I was sitting in a chair on my patio the dog looked up, and I did also.  Flying overhead at a tremendous speed was a brilliant, white ball of light about the circumference of a hula hoop.  A basketball size would not be quite large enough.  It had come from the West over my house flying East at the same height of the wispy clouds above me.  I do not know how high that was.  In seconds it disappeared into the distance.  It was a clean, concise ball of light.  No vapor, or tail, or distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had disappeared, to my right in the sky was a small plane that was flying higher than the ball of light did.

I am on the flight path of planes heading north from Bergstrom/Austin Airport, and I watch them often from my patio, and my dog is used to looking up at them.

Over motorway<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday 20th December 2008, at approx. 18:00 my husband and I were travelling along the A11 motorway just past Le Mans in France, when I looked out of the window and saw what apeared to be a weird cloud formation (fog like) travelling at the same speed as our vehicle (80mph). Then all of a sudden a circle of lights, about 10, with an inner circle of lights, crossed in front of our vehicle, from left to right and then back again. At this point my husband who was driving also witnessed this. Although no solid body of a ship could be seen the formation and movements of the lights would be as if they were part of a solid moving object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights indicated an object that would have been the size of 4 lanes of the motorway, they came across the motorway low flying, stopped, rotated and shot off  at considerable speed, until they could no longer be seen. I thought this would be the end of our encounter, when suddenly the lights were back, crossed in front of us right to left,  rotated and shot off, again disapearing from sight. They returned again and I could see them from the left hand window of our vehicle, slightly lagging behind. The whole incident lasted about 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera was not handy, so I did not get a photograph. I did not want to take my eyes off of the lights for one minute. I should have written every detail down at the time but did not. I counted the outer ring of lights, sure that I would never forget how many there were, I am fairly sure there were 10 but it is amazing how even when something truly amazing happens if you don’t write it down imediately, you doubt yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were dull and smoking which is why when they were side on apeared cloud like. My husband and I were travelling to Switzerland where we were on holiday for 3 weeks. I have suffered from a nervous skin condition ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are nearly 50 years old. My husband is an accountant and not the sort of person who imagines things. Niether of us had been drinking, or taking any form of medication and although we wear glasses for driving, know that what we saw that day we will probably never witness again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The West Los Angeles area.  I was driving in the 10th freeway going westbound.  It was 4:55 p.m., when I was exiting the freeway on N. Bundy Dr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was getting to the end of the exit, I saw what appeared to be a red fireball in the sky traveling Westbound.  I told my brother to look at it, too. I was not sure if I was right, at first I thought it was an airplane and he said no, than he assured that in fact it was a red fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got off on Bundy Dr., my car was facing North of Bundy Dr. and I stopped. My brother, son and I looked West of Bundy Dr. to keep seeing the object. I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but somehow the picture did not come out. Maybe the clarity of the daylight prevented that. I can&#39;t explain that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept on driving Northbound on Bundy Dr. for another 1-2 min. and finally pulled over to the side of the road and kept looking at this object. As the object was traveling west, it kept getting bigger and traveling at a faster pace. The object dived at a fast speed. After it dived we were not able to see it anymore, due to the fact that there were buildings blocking our view. According to the direction this object was traveling, we assumed it must have landed in the sea. We really don&#39;t know this for a fact.  I did not notice if other people pulled over, but I was more curious and worried to find out what this object was.  I really paid no attention to my surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw this object for approximately 10-15 min. We decided to go home and called 911, just to report it and find out if other people had called.<n>

I had to make a trip out to my tool shed for some materials. On exiting I looked up into a beautiful blue partly cloudy sky only to see dozens, I would say at least 75 to 100 metallic orbs headed from due east to due west. These orbs were quite easy to see so I had no need to run into the house for my binoculars. Rather than flying in formation they were spread out but in reference to each were fairly close in the group which was quite a many orbs. Following behind broken away from the group was about 15-20 more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had about a minute to examine these orbs as they went from about 60 degrees East to about 70 degrees West before they either went into or over  clouds . Their size was about the size of a BB held in your hand. They were all the same size and description. Their speed was as if they were on a Sunday drive and there was absolutely no noise. We are in the inbound path for Tampa International Airport and I could not help but notice that there was no action for a good while. There was very little wind and the temp was about 78º. The orbs didn’t reflect very much light, that is to say that my vision was not hampered by glare, each was clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able so see them so well that I could tell that these objects were round orbs gliding smoothly through the skies, not birds, as I said, I could see them clearly. Neither were they planes or ultra-lights or swamp gas. They were a mass of silent running genuine UFO. I shook for about thirty minutes after the sighting and waited for about an hour before calling the report in. I wanted to get my thoughts together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They were not moving like a plane, but side to side and vertically up and down. They were also morphing. Then out of no where, there was a sudden bright amber light that formed a triangle with the other 2 objects. This one was moving the same way but much faster. It seemed to get closer and closer to us. It almost seemed to be following us out of the hills. Once we got to the bottom of the hills, it disappeared. On the way back home, we noticed an amber light on our right side bouncing up and down, and left and right, but not moving anywhere. Shortly after watching that light 2 government planes(low profile planes, very secretive like, one strobe light per plane)were headed towards the light. The light just disappeared, but reappeared on our left side(many many miles apart) in like a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Judging by the speed and brightness it was close, but it made no sound.  It traveled from one horizon to the other in about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  I’ve never seen a ufo before.  Maybe it was just a plane, but if it was, I don’t believe it’s any plane the public is aware of. Plus, the light was constant.  It never blinked or fluttered.

I first noticed in the southeast corner ahead of our truck a odd yellow light. It came on and then dimmed maybe 5 seconds later, I pointed this first light out to Rachel, simply cause it was kind of weird looking. She missed the first light but then a second light came on to the left of the first yellow light, this one again faded. We both were laughing and wondering what it could be as a third yellow light came to the right of the first one, and again faded. This was right around 6PM, probably no latter than 6:15. After the third light went out nothing happened for maybe a minuet, we were now all watching the sky, Dana who what sitting in the back seat drivers side, then noticed a blue flashing light. This light resembled a tower light, but was high in the sky, right after that, Dana noticed that there were actually three blue flashing lights that were all moving in unison, spread out a huge distance, maybe the size of a foot ball field or so, if you would have connected the “dots”/lights it would have made a triangle. These blue lights, I should specify were rather small, large enough to see, but not nearly as large as the yellow lights. The lights moved across the highway, sill in front of us a ways but coming in our general direction, moving diagonally across the highway. Once the lights crossed the highway Rachel could no longer really watch, she was still driving, (we totally should have pulled over) still watching the lights, now on the other side of the highway there was suddenly a really bright yellow light, same color and warm tone of the other yellow lights, but much much brighter. This light stayed on for maybe 10 or 15 seconds, then went out. I freaked out at this point, screamed “BIG yellow light” at this point none of us were really concerned or worried, but incredibly intrigued. The blue flashing lights that made up th! e large triangle shape were still flashing in unison. Maybe two minuets after the large light came on suddenly many yellow lights came on, and an object rotated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note: I’m an art student and part of out schooling is learning how to draw and render space/depth of objects, and how objects really are shaped three dimensionally even if you can’t see the whole object. As this object rotated, the yellow lights that were on the side of it rotated in the way a triangle would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this object with the yellow lights that rotated was in the middle of the three flashing blue lights. The inner triangle rotated for maybe 10 seconds. At this point I was amazed and maybe scared, excited, it was a weird emotion. We continued driving, now that the yellow lights went out, the blue ones were still present and flashing for another few minuets. Along this part of the highway there were a lot of trees in the way, so I couldn’t tell if any other yellow lights went on or what happened exactly at this point, but when there was a break in the trees we could still see the blue lights, for maybe another five minuets. The whole event happened between Hancock and Coloma and lasted anywhere from 10 to 15 minuets. We pulled over in Westfield to see if anything was still going on, and we couldn’t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was something absolutely remarkable. It was weird and I know most people that hear it that weren’t in the car, and didn’t see it themselves probably wont believe it. I am so happy I was three other people, so I don’t sound completely crazy. This thing was so huge and didn’t make a sound, it moved gracefully, just weird. I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed something like this. Whatever “this” may be. I definitely have some thoughts on the matter.<n>

It looked as if something was entering the Earth’s atmosphere. It was a bright green “streak” and it disappeared from my view behind some trees and buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to drive down the road (and be amazed by what I saw) I noticed a black object in the sky coming from the direction of where I lost sight of the “green streak”. The black object continued to move in a westward direction. I arrived at a stoplight and kept watching as the black object slowly moved across the sky towards the west until I could no longer see it behind trees and buildings. When the object was straight ahead of my view, it looked to be a blackish/grayish color with a little red at the back of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are a couple of things that I am unsure of: It may have had something hanging from the bottom of it with a ball shape in the middle of the hanging “line”. I was really trying to get a good look at it, but unfortunately was still driving a car and couldn&#39;t focus on it that well. It may have even been moving to the side left to right-right to left a little, just the front of the object (from my view it seemed like it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home, I rushed inside to write down all that had just happened. My little sister suggested that it may have been a balloon, but I do not believe that a balloon could move across the sky the way that this object did. We went outside to see if we could find any trace of it but couldn&#39;t. The only thing that we noticed was towards the west we saw a stream of smoke which looked like the remnants of an airplane passing through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, on the News, there were people reporting sightings of fireballs in the sky and there was a photo of a stream of smoke which was left behind by the “fireball”. It was reported that it was probably a bolide or fireball from a meteor shower. The streak that I saw did not leave a trail of smoke behind it and a later did see the trail of smoke but it was to the west/southwest direction.<n>

It moved in a straight line at high speed.

It was about the size of what the moon looks like and was turquoise blue. It came out of no where and did what seemed to be a slight decrease in speed before speeding away in a slightly different direction. It  went across the horizon from South to North and speed away at an abnormally fast speed. I immediately jumped up from my bed and placed my head against the open window. It was gone though. It had left so fast across the sky. I remember thinking, &#34;well it traveled as fast as an meteorite, but it was just way too big and way too low.&#34; I don&#39;t know what this phenomena was, but I know what it wasn&#39;t and it wasn&#39;t a meteorite and it wasn&#39;t any man made machine that I am familiar with.<n>

The object looked like a tiny spark in the sky, it began moving fast through the sky, it moved to fast to be an aeroplane, as we could see other planes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We palled the car over, because we couldn’t believe how fast it got across the other side of the sky and it was a big gap from were we fist spotted it. As we was looking at it, it got a lot smaller and you could barely see it. It then started to flash, you could not see no object or light, but tiny little flashes flickering in the sky, and then it was gone, it all lasted about ten minutes.<n>

It was on December 17, 2008, on my way home from Marshall, Missouri when I first noticed the strange lights. I was driving North on 65 hwy in the direction towards home.  Not yet out of town, by our local radio station, KMMO, I saw a small red light resembling a planet approx. a mile above the KMMO station.  It was moving in small circles, slowly getting lower to the ground, closer to the hwy and dangerously close to my car.  The light changed in color to a yellow green and white, and a possible shape took forward as a string of lights appeared in a disc shape resembling a Frisbee but I saw only the lights. It was raining quite hard this night. The object got closer to the hwy and my car. When it was no more than three car lengths in front of my vehicle and going no more than 20 mph, I slammed on my brakes, afraid of hitting the object, though all I saw were its vast lights. No more than a few feet from the ground and getting within a car length of my car, I started to panic and dig into my coat pocket for my cell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called home and described to my Dad exactly what I was witnessing. By this time, the object had stayed this car length from my car and took up both lanes of the hwy spanning at least 30 feet in length but no more than a couple of feet in height. I was close to my gravel road, country road 425, a right turn from the hwy about 7 miles from town. Hesitant, I turned. The object was out of sight for a moment and I was relieved. My car died and I reached for my cell once again. My cell appeared dead. I turned the key and my car started. The lights came into view again to my left on the gravel road but at least 50 feet out in the fields. Appearing to be intrigued by my vehicle the lights moved as my car moved but remained in the field. At the second turn, the lights still in view, my car died again. The object moved closer, at least a car length, to the left of my car, and though it was raining and I had my windshield wipers as fast as they would go to keep my vision from being obstructed by the rain, it appeared the rain had stopped. I looked in front of me and saw the lights from the church on our gravel road. It was still pouring, if not raining harder. The closer the object got, no rain fell on my windshield. I started my vehicle again and looked to my left. The object had distanced itself from me but continued to follow along side my car. A mile and a half on the gravel road, the object stopped in an empty field to my left at least 100 ft. from the gravel road. The field where the lights settled a few feet from the ground often floods in rain and those crops are lost in the summer. My car dies again but starts easily a third time. I continue to drive home but the object did not follow but remained stationary in the field,  a good 30-35 ft of lights, parallel to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still in view a good mile through my rearview but seemed to not move. Over the railroad tracks my car died again. I find the constant dying in relation with the encounter strange, since I had my car only a month and it was fairly new: an 07’. I made it home, the object, I assumed still in that field. I ran to the house, falling a few times in my frightened hurry, to my dad on the computer in our dining room. I gave him a brief summary and suggested we drive down to the object in a different vehicle. My dad was not in a huge hurry. We left a half hour later. Not to my surprise, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call the Sherriff&#39;s Dept. to report the incident. The dispatcher said they&#39;d send someone out to investigate, but no one came to question me. My family later learned that a number of individuals had reported seeing odd lights near Marshall on the same evening.<n>

Not looking at any particular area of the sky.   Out of the corner of my eye a flashing white light caught my eye.  I looked up and saw nothing, I proceed to look at other things.  Again a flash caught my eye, again I looked up and saw nothing again.  This happened again, I thought I was just getting a glare off of my glasses.  This time I stared at the area where I saw the light flash.  This time I saw the flash.  I thought it was just a high flying airplane.  I stared at the area for approximately  3 minutes and the light flashed at intervals of approximately  one every 15 sec..  This light was  stationary , it did not move.  It was not much brighter or larger than a distant star.  I fixed it’s position with a star  to determine if it was moving and just so high that it appeared to be stationary.  It did not change position.  After about three minutes the light grew dimmer and dimmer with each flash until it was no longer visible.  This dimming lasted about the duration of 3 flashes.  As it grew dimmer it stayed in it’s original position The light was observed in the southern sky from my  position, high above the horizon.  There was no sound associated with this light.  The sky was cloudless, 100% clear.  A commercial jet flew through my line of sight at the time of the flashing light and  it’s lights were much, much brighter, and much larger.   The jet seemed to be at a normal cruising altitude, the flashing light seemed to be much, much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Thought the UFO was going to crash into an airplane. Star-like UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/16/2010 9:00 PM I noticed strange star-like lights in the Eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started with a star-like UFO. My husband and I both decided that it wasn&#39;t an airplane. It was Much brighter and larger. It also didn&#39;t seem to move. It was twinkling with white, red, and blue lights. My husband got bored and went inside. I continued to watch the light for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another one rise in the Eastern sky to the left of the first one. It rose just above the tree lines. It moved to the left, then it moved right. The UFO stayed put after that. They both seemed to keep the path of the night sky and stayed all night. They were too close to be stars though. The light twinkling was profoundly artificial in nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind that I am also seeing airplanes ever few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time later, I saw two craft with bright red flashing lights North and South bound on the horizon. The lights from these crafts were larger than airplane lights, but not as bright as the &#34;star-like&#34; lights. They headed straight for one another and leveled off one above the other. The two craft then turned East and flew until disappearing in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 15 minutes of the two aircraft meeting up, I see a big bright red light not flashing. It had a hot white center. This UFO was descending rapidly from the atmosphere. At exactly the same time an airplane was bound North East. I gasped as their points intersected. I thought there was going to be a crash. There wasn&#39;t though. The red UFO leveled off at the horizon and headed East until disappearing from distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had called my mother at the beginning of the sightings. She stayed on the phone with me through out the near crash. During all of this activity, my phone started getting static. It became difficult to talk. The static went away after the red UFO went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a shooting star during the excitement and fear of the potential crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very active last night. It is the first time that I have ever seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that point I ran outside to see what was going on. They were all looking up into the sky and pointing.  I witnessed what appeared to be a triangle hovering out in the distance that did not appear to look like any kind of craft I have ever seen before. Judging from the distance out it had to be really large. It had a white light that was circling around the top corner of the triangular shaped object. The rest of the craft or object was bright red in color and looked to have many lights on it all of which were red except the white one that was circling it. My neighbors said they watched it come across the horizon for about ten to fifteen minutes before it stopped and  hovered where if was.  As we were looking at the object it released a white lighted globe like thing that fell to earth.  We all screamed and kind of waited for an explosion or something to  happen but we could not see anything.   About 2 minutes after that it released another one that went from white to red as it dropped, then  its red lights all went dark from the outmost corners to the center, as it became one small white light and disappeared into the horizon. I grew up in Lancaster Ca. and being near Edwards Air Force base had seen some strange goings on sometimes, but I have never witnessed anything that strange or unexplained in my life. It made the pit of my stomach sink several times watching it.<n>

I then snapped about 3 pictures, all my neighbors were in shock due to we were just explaning the same situation the night before. the weather was partly cloudy and these objects were below any of the clouds.

Very large obtuse scalene triangle shape. The triangle’s appearance is like a black line drawn across the clouds.  I can see through the center. It is at a 40 degree angle to the 1st UFO (around the same altitude).  Very difficult to see because grey clouds are moving through the center and obscuring parts of the lines.  It has no lights.  It would be invisible at night but light from the 1st UFO made it possible to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details:   A large cloud lights up from top to bottom like a lighting flash but stays lit. The bottom of the cloud is violently boiling.  Like an upside down pot of boiling water.  The first UFO appears out of the boiling  cloud and stops.  I have a flashlight and tell my spouse, &#34;Lets signal it!.&#34;  I was trying to be funny.  I flash the light 3 times and the first UFO flashes back 3 times and starts to circle the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife panics, grabs my arm and we run  back to the house.  My flashlight can barely light the ground.  I don’t know how the UFO could have seen it’s light from that altitude or why it would care enough to reply.   We are both absolutely sure the object was interacting with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the triangle after the 1st UFO appeared.  This object also circled the field but kept the same distance from the 1st object.   This UFO is the largest object I have ever seen in the sky.<n>

It is very shaky but you can see the lights.  As I did this a third light seem to come from a northerly direction and join them.  It was like a triangle shape.  They then all together moved south and out of our sight.  The video I have is only about 14 secs and was shot at 18:09.  You can hear quite clearly in the film as I film 2 my wife shouts &#34;theres another one&#34;.

I awakened for an unknown reason while sleeping in my bed on the upstairs floor of a 3 level unit. The blinds are the same as the lower level, and the light comes through them well. So, there was a good amount of light in my room. I was still trying to come to a full awake state. My arms and legs were disabled, but I could move my mouth and see with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sleeping on my right side of my body in a half fetal position. The being was standing at the side of my bed, facing me, at about the halfway point of my mattress. It was staring at me. I stared back at it, and I was a bit frightened by the appearance of this being: especially due to it being at my bedside as I woke. I attempted to move my arms and legs, but to no avail. This angered me. I then proceeded to show my teeth in a fierce manner to this being. I guess I did this because it was my only method left of self defense. I was very unfortable not being able to move my arms and legs. This being disappeared right in front of my eyes. One second it was in front of me, the next it was gone. No movement. Just gone!  The being was brown in color, but unlike the previous contact being. This being had a human-like appearance in bodily form (legs, arms, round head, etc.), but looked nothing like a human in any other way. It had a dark brown color to it. It almost appeared to have a slimy texture to it (outward skin). Further, although I can not completely recall: I think the being could change the coloring of itself slightly. I am not saying brown to blue, I mean dark brown to light brown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared for a few days after this. I had issues of not wanting to fall asleep. It seems that this is the time they appear, and catch me off-guard. I would much prefer if I was walking in a field, and saw them 30 feet in front of me. Then, we would be on a bit more of a fair playing field!  Whatever is going on, I know that they are here now! I know they can do things that I can not do, whether it is some type of technology that enables them to disappear or it is biological.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were in formation and equidistant from one another. They were flickering like what I would call afterburners on a jet from behind but there was nothing there. The only thing you could see is the four lights and they stayed exactly the same as it traversed from North to South right over us here. I watched thinking maybe I was looking at some birds that were reflecting the early morning sun, but then I saw a bird fly by and it looked totally different. These lights went South for about 20 seconds, not really fast but at a steady rate until they just poofed out of existence. I am absolutely certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon. It was four lights attached to something that was apparently invisible. Yesterday here in Denver Colorado it was a record cold day and I was actually wondering if maybe it was something we have built with some kind of new stealth technology but because of how cold it was out the exhaust was unable to be hidden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last comment is that whatever I saw was close enough to me for me to notice that is made absolutely NO SOUND. I am going to watch with my camera in hand when I go outside from now on just in case I see it again I can photograph it for analysis. Oh, and another thing, I usually do not go outside at that time so maybe I had not ever seen it before because of the timing so I am going to go out at the same time again for a while to see if I can catch it.

I was at combat outpost carver, in salman pak, 20 miles south of baghdad. I was on guard at ecp 1 with a half dozen ugandon soldiers from a company called EDOT. We sat and watched the very same lights that were seen over norway on december 9th, 2009. I called it up on the radio and got told it was probably an illumination round. I have seen hundreds of those and this was not the case. It was the very same thing in the pictures coming out of norway. I just saw those pics on the foxnews web site and it made chills go up my spine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was approximately 20-30 miles outside of Baker, CA when a saw a bright flash of sun burnt orange to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the base of the mountain range to my left was a single orange rectangular object.  From my vantage point in my car the object was about a thumb length high and two thumb lengths long.  It moved along the ground at an incredible speed, and in a straight line leaving a slight trail of orange light, when it suddenly paused and turned into a sphere.  Only the mountain range and ground were in my field of vision, with no obstructions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still orange it then took off again as a rectangular object (as previously described), and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened in about 10 seconds.<n>

Our vessel was coming into a pier on the Seattle waterfront. I was a crew member who had to set my lines (to tie up the vessel) on the stern (back of the boat), and we were about 10 minutes out  from the pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the boat was large I could not communicate or see the captain or the mate &gt;&gt;(who was getting lines ready at the front of the boat). &lt;&lt; I got my lines ready and was anticipating going home soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I had to stay at the stern, I just waited and looked around.  I looked west across Elliott Bay, across the Puget Sound and to the Olympic Mountains. ( the Olympics are about 40-50 miles west of Seattle) It was a cold beautiful night, lots of stars and a few clouds at the base of the Olympics. At the southern part of the mountain range I saw a shooting star falling hard and fast from the sky . I thought “cool” I’m going to make a wish! The star started to intensify getting brighter. I began to think to myself “WOW, that thing is going to smash into the mountains and there’s going to be a huge flash” But as  it came down, it stopped abruptly halfway down the mountain range, turned a glowing red and shot horizontally northward. The red light never blinked or changed color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved so fast that I could not believe what I was seeing!? It moved faster than anything I have ever seen. As it moved, it illuminated the cloud formations nestled along the lower side of the mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it disappeared at what I could say was Hurricane Ridge, Port Angles area ( I know it disappeared northwesterly  of the Olympics.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very bright, far brighter than the other stars but what I thought was odd was that there was fairly thick cloud cover that night and when the clouds thickened, it blotted out all the neighboring celestial bodies but not this star.  As I watched perpelexed it rapidly crossed the sky from East to West in a very rapid motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and got my girlfriend and her digital camera.  We watched the light for about ten other minutes. It changed it&#39;s postion several times.  It lowered it&#39;s altitude and then would slowly raise back, it also slowly floated back and forth across the sky. Then a plane flew by and it dimmed itself rapidly, when the plane past it grew very bright.  I thought this was caused by the cloud cover but at that moment it was in a clear patch of sky.  It did this several times and them it dimmed itself and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up watching planes and helicopters and I know that&#39;s not what this was,  I don&#39;t know what this was but it behaved differently than anything that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

As I walked into my backyard I was looking at the long contrails extending north to south across the deep blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon noticed a lower flying aircraft flying from the northeast to the southwest. As I watched the aircraft I soon noticed a small white object following close behind it. Stunned at first, I starred at the object trying to figure out what this object could be. After a few seconds of observation I noticed the object was white in color and disk or orb like in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I watched the white disk it started swinging back and forth behind the airplane in a left to right type fashion. I wondered at first if I was seeing a big white bird, I quickly realized this was definitely not the case. As I watched the object swing left to right it all a sudden dove or dropped straight down and flew underneath the airplane for a few seconds, it then swung just under the plane to the left side and amazingly completely circled the airplane and then again trailed behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing, it was at this point I thought to myself, do I have time to run inside and grab my camera. I hesitated at first thinking the object would be gone by the time I got back. Than I thought, I have to try because know one will believe me if I don&#39;t get a picture-so off I went running. I grabbed the camera, ran back outside and was just able to take a short video as the object disappeared over Haymarket toward the Bull Run mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to consider other explanations for this object but have been mostly unable to do so. The only possibility could be a in flight refuel for the air combats that are deployed to protect Washington DC airspace. I don&#39;t think this is much of a possibility since the aircraft the object was following was not military but a passenger plane. The white disk I saw was also not a conventional military aircraft. There wasn&#39;t any wings visible on the craft and the craft was more disk/orb like in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report this sighting to you in hopes that someone else in my area may have also seen this remarkable ariel display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Thank You.<n>

I slowed down to see why everyone was stopping and looked up to find 3 orange glowing orbs moving slowly across the sky.  I quickly pull over to the side of the road to watch.  The 3 orbs continue to move across the sky, hover in place then move again, as they get closer to the moon they begin to ascend until they are no longer visible.  I look behind me to the area of the sky where they originated from and 3 more orbs come into view and do the same thing.  Some dart in different directions but converge back with the others and ascend out of view.  This happened 4 or 5 times and in total I saw around 15 objects in the sky over a period of about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred on the same night as a meteor shower and while this event was happening I was also seeing an occasional shooting star which was beautiful but looked nothing like what I was seeing.<n>

On the way home to my residence in El Sobrante @ approximately 1120pm my wife and I witnessed a luminous flash of blue light mixed with reddish crystal like sparks.  There was absolutely no sound, however we did have our car stereo playing but the volume was low enough to hear any significant sound impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter is somewhat hard to explain because I have never seen anything like it, not even in movies.  It lasted only 2 seconds as we were driving.  My wife was driving, the incident occurred to the left side of the road somewhere between Orinda and El Sobrante, on Camino Pablo Rd..   In this area there is nothing but a single two way road with a bunch of trees that spreads for many acres of land. To the right is a lake/reservoir.  If you google &#34;San Pablo Reservoir,&#34; and click on images, this will give you clue as to the area we encountered this strange luminous lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we compared notes, my wife seen the same pattern of light as I did,   However, she also seen that it came straight down, into the hills.  It wasn’t like a flash in the sky, it was almost like fireworks with the flames descending. The distance from our vehicle to the sighting was roughly 300 feet.  We ruled out the possibility of fireworks because if it were fireworks we would have heard them. With the amount of light produced, if it were fireworks I would have heard it with my stereo all the way up.  Finally, this may have been some weird weather phenomenon, however I have been living in this area for 19 years, I have never seen anything like it. Everthing was normal, senses in tact, time ok, just the vision of the encounter will remain in my head forever.<n>

When i first saw it my first insticnt was that it was like maybe  firework but i quickly realized that it could not be because fireworks go up, then i thought maybe it was some sort of missle but i dont think that i would not have seem something as bright as that coming from higher up in the sky because i just saw it pop out of nowhere. then i started to think. after around 30 seconds i said &#34;wait hold on.. did u guys see that???&#34; and immediatelly my girlfriend said &#34;yeah, what was it?&#34; then i said &#34;i dont know what did you see&#34;  and according to her she saw a bright white line coming from the sky diagonally but she says she only saw it with her perifiral vision. i assume that it was a bright dot that was moving so fast that it seemed like a line coming down diaginally in a perfecly straight line. i knew that it could not be lightning because when i got out of the car i looked up at the sky and saw that it was a very clear night without a cloud in sight. also it could not have been lightning becuase it was way to bright. and also lightning comes down straight to the ground  but this came down diagonally  and in a straight line. I know that it was not a shooting star either becuase i have seen many and this was way brighter and bigger than a star and faster. after that we were all pretty s! cared an d confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The light looked white, and was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes to make sure it was not moving. Then i went inside my house to get my girlfriend to come take a look at it also. It was very cold so we went back inside and I checked on it again about 15 minutes after I first seen it. It was still there but it was getting pretty cloudy and the light was getting dimmer, I am not sure if it was the clouds making it dimmer. But when i went to look if it was still there about 30 minutes after i first seen it, it was not there. But it was really cloudy by then, so i think maybe the clouds was hiding it. The reason i find this light to be so interesting is because this is not the first light I seen like this. Sorry my computer does not have Microsoft word any more. Around this time of year, last year I seen a light just like this one, only this one was close and i knew exactly where it was. I lived by a Mountain i use to run up all the time, it has those towers with red lights that blink at night. One night around 3 a.m. at night i went outside to have a smoke, and right above those towers there was a huge bight white light. I say its huge because it looked way closer then this last one I seen, but i did not think &#34;UFO&#34; at that time. But I knew that there is no reason a light like that should be there at that time of night. It took me about 10 minutes to finish my smoke, but i watched a little longer to see if it would move. By then I knew this was not normal and wanted to go grab my cell phone to get it on camera, so i could show my girlfriend and others. So I went inside my house to get it all the way down stairs, and went back out and it was still there. I was able to get it on video, I could of went on forever but i can only send 15 seconds of a clip to my girlfriend that lived in Minnesota at the time. I sent it to her, but the light was very smal! l on my cell phone cam and did not look like anything i was looking at. Now since I watch UFO Hunters I know these type of lights are while known, and would like to know what it is i am seeing. I wish I knew what I know now or i could of simply called 911 and drove over to that light and got really close to it. The one that i just now seen looked pretty far away and I did not want to drive in the ice we got out here. This one I don&#39;t really know what it could have been since it looked so far away, I am thinking maybe a planet may have been really close, but I don&#39;t know. The other light I seen was a &#34;UFO&#34; for sure. But I will keep watching maybe I will be lucky and see a light like my first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?

I was looking out the back seat window and was sitting behind the driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to notice something just out of the corner of my eye and turned to look at it more fully.  At first I thought I was seeing some sort of reflection in the window, so I adjusted the way I was sitting.  It didn’t change.  It was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds in total before it disappeared.  It was a silver/chrome colored, highly reflective/metallic, circular shaped object in the sky.  It was moving completely parallel to the ground at a decent rate of speed, since it seemed to be keeping up with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear to be a traditional air craft since it was the wrong shape, there were no additional lights, it was flying too low considering there was no airport near us, and it was completely silent.  I noticed no additional noises of any sort and my experiences with airplanes and helicopters when they are close by has lead me to believe they are normally quite loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just when I had determined that this might not be something normal, the object reached a patch of trees and vanished.  I say it vanished because the trees were completely bare.  So even if the object had simply gone behind the trees, I should have been able to see some of it between the branches.  But I saw none of it; it was just gone as soon as it touched the first branch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright, clear, afternoon and while there was a breeze I wouldn’t say it was particularly strong.  It couldn’t have been a balloon of any kind since those tend to sort of bob up and down in an irregular path when they are pushed in the wind.  This would have been additionally true with the different lanes of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that it was few (2-3) hundred feet away from us and might be three feet in diameter if it had been up close.<n>

Rachel, age 30, saw a very large shooting star to the West, then a brightly lit &#34;cloud&#34; above the same area to the West of our location at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon.  She pointed to the cloud and followed it heading North.  The full moon was out, the cloud ceiling was low and it was windy.  The scattered clouds were moving very fast. It was easy to see the sky, stars, moon, and clouds. At that point, at approximately 11:40 PM, Maria and I both saw a large black round disk-shaped object that appeared to be on it side (top or bottom facing us).  The size was larger than a dessert plate held at arm&#39;s length. It was moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest along the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and moving slower than the clouds, which were clipping along at a fast pace. It was very windy.  The full moon shone brightly and I assume that is the only reason we could see the object.  There were no visible lights on the object. Maria, age 32, saw this at the same time I did, but Rachel did not, even though she was looking in the same area.  After a few seconds, the object changed to a gray color, then just vanished.   I then said outloud  &#34;We want to see evidence of any persons not of this world&#34; and all of us looked in the same direction where the black object had been and I was pointing.  Right after I said this a shooting star appeared in that same spot.  Then we saw lots of shooting stars all around the sky (probably a meteor shower).  Rachel left for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maria got in her Suburban to leave, but I noticed a bunch of tiny twinkling lights above the center of the hood of her vehicle appear for 2 seconds, then they disappeared.  I was looking at this area trying to figure out what the lights were when I noticed a reflection of a rectangular light that came on then blinked off on her hood.  Maria got out of the car and the light appeared again.  I soon figured out that it was blinking on and off every 25 seconds, so we knew it had to be something mechanical.  Being square was odd, though.  So she turned off her car and I turned off all the lights in and outside the house in order to see if we could identify the source of the light.  It continued to blink on and off, being an amber color, white, or blue at different times.  There were two spots close together where the lights appeared.  We could not locate the source. We tried blocking the lights out with our hands, and checked the trees moving in the wind that might be blocking or unblocking lights.  The one light continued to blink off and on at regular intervals of 25 seconds. The only reflection of light on the hood that we could identify was the moon, which was in a different location from the blinking lights.  Then I realized something and said &#34;OMG&#34; - and Maria finished my sentence with &#34;It&#39;s something we can&#39;t see and it&#39;s above us.&#34;  I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which I had charged up the night before and it went dead after 3 seconds.  Maria got her Sony digital camera out of the car and video-taped and took photos of the car and in the sky above us. Note: The photos came out very dark and smudgy. I got the night vision monocular out but could see nothing.  I then saw a tiny orb appear inside Maria&#39;s vehicle, then disappear.  I fully expected to see a ship hoovering right above us!  We could feel the presence of something. Then, 45 minutes after starting, the lights stopped at approximately 12:35 AM.  Since this date, strange things have been happening around my house and my psychic abiliti! es have improved, almost to the point of being annoying.  I see a golden glow around all living things, and this is rather distracting.  Also see details in energy fields around humans.  Received a vision on the morning of Dec 25 with symbols I did not recognize but later found out that they are the Mayan numbering system. There is more, but I don&#39;t have room to put it all down here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She asked me to come look at this.  I looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. She pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row.  There were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. The lights just kept coming and coming. There had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. They were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. The lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. To us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. It was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. I’ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. Once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when I had first joined her outside. Then it hit me, Orion, the constellation of Orion, the belt!  That night I showed her the constellation of Orion in the sky; I asked her if anything looked familiar? Without hesitation she pointed to the three stars of Orion’s belt. I printed out a picture of Orion and held it up over my head, as strange as this might be, I feel that the fleet of lights was moving in the formation of the constellation Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone ever seen, or have there ever been any reported sightings like this?<n>

None of us were drinking or are currently on any medication. At about 6:40 we had just finished taking pictures of the moon (it was supposed to be very close to the earth that night resulting in it being very large and orange in color.) We had finished taking pictures so the camera was put away back in its bag and we resumed our fishing. On that night (December 12 in accordance to the National Weather Association) at 6:46 PM the temperature was 46.4 degrees F and the wind was at a top speed of 6.9 MPH coming in out of the west to the north west. We looked out down the beach to the north east where I saw a small orangish redish blink of light. A few minutes later it blinked way over to our right towards the south west. Again a few minutes later it blinked straight out in front of us to the south and we could see that it was 5 or 6 lights that looked sort of like strobe lights. It was blinking a redish orange color and was a very lazy blink. It was not fast or slow but a very lazy light up and dim back down. It was also dead silent and was obviously hovering because as it would blink it was stationary and not flying by like an airliner. This blinking went on for several more minutes revealing a new location every time it would blink which would be several miles away from where it had blinked the first time. It blinked one last time to the south west and disappeared. Immediately after it disappeared a U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter flew out over the water where the UFO had been. It flew back and forth very briefly and then returned inland. Although I am a believer in UFOs and life on other planets besides our own my father is a skeptic and doesn&#39;t truly believe in UFOs. We can both agree that was we saw out there was real and no hallucination on our part. It was no weather balloon or a plane either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She stays very close to the airport, so I am completely used to seeing airplanes flying close overhead and am quite familiar with what an airplane looks like, how they fly, how fast, etc.  I was driving along a road called Airport Dr. where planes normally fly over the road to land on the landing strip nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what at first I assumed to be a plane about to land considering it was quite low to the ground.  At first I was worried, because although it still had a good stretch to go before landing, it was lower to the ground than the planes I normally see preparing to land.  I watched it as I drove along, waiting for it to fly overhead to it&#39;s assumed destination (the landing strip).  However, it never flew overhead.  There were still a couple other cars on the road at that time.  Then as I continued to drive, eventually I was alone on the roadway, which is when I began to panic, because that&#39;s when I realized that the craft seemed to be following me (although not completely obviously).  It was dark, so I couldn&#39;t see anything but it&#39;s lights, which where 3 white lights in what looked like a triangular formation.  I started to freak out when I realized that the way it was flying was not anything a plane could be capable of.  It was following alongside the road, too close overhead to be a plane but not close enough to get a really good look.   It was also slightly behind me and to the left, so I had to keep turning my head back to see it, than to the road again.  I turned on to Marine Dr. where it continued to follow me.   At this point, I was scared ((deleted)) and going at least 20-30 mph over the speed limit, nearly vearing off the road several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally after what seemed like forever, but considering the distance I will guess was probably around 5 minutes or less, the lights/craft seemed to separate slighty as it sped off very quickly.  As it did this I noticed at least one, possibly more, red light(s) as a glanced as it sped off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically the most frightening experience I have ever had, and I never want anything like that to happen to me ever again.<n>

FROM NOWHERE, there appeared in the sky what looked like a gaggle of geese formed in a V, traveling west to east VERY fast, no engine sounds, no bird sounds.   Hard to describe - like individual puffs of smoke semi-connected to one another.   It&#39;s length took up 1/3 the span of the sky, it&#39;s width between the two points of the V was enormous.  If this were actually a gaggle of geese there would easily have been 75 to 100 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this formation flew across the sky it seemed to lose its length at the widest points of the V and then it DISAPPEARED.

The lights were visible through his back patio door, which faces east with about 15 miles of visibility into the horizon.  The object was hovering about 1.5 miles off of the ground and was about 3 miles away.  It was over a residential neighborhood.  Initially, I thought that it was a reflection of Christmas lights through the patio door from a neighbor’s house across the street.  We opened the patio door and observed the object, which emitted no sound and what looked like white lights coming in towards the object.  The object changed shape from a distorted diamond shape, to oval, to circular, to arms of light outstretching from the middle to one giant ball of bright light.  We witnessed colors such as blue, green, amber, red, purple, and almost every color of the rainbow coming from the object.  The light patterns were completely erratic and random with no steady pattern.  The image maintained position for about 15 minutes but changed shapes and colors frequently.  As earlier stated, there were white balls of light that looked like they were being sucked towards the object and at that moment, above our heads, a comet shot in the direction towards the object.  This comet was low and extremely bright, and unlike any I have ever seen.  We went into the house and turned out all of the lights and watched the object change formations.  Then, it just started disappearing into the east, like it was being sucked up into a vacuum tube.  The momentum seemed very quick, and within a second, it was gone.  We sat there in amazement, trying to figure out what we just saw.  As we were watching the sky, the object came back in the same sucking type motion back towards the west.  The patterns, such as color and shapes, remained the same erratic pattern as before, but the object was higher into the sky.  It stayed for only about 7 minutes this time, and then disappeared in the s! ame fash ion as before.  After disappearing the second time, the object did not return.  We continued to watch the sky until 2400, but the object never returned.  We recorded about 22 seconds of poor quality footage on a nikon camera with video options, but could not zoom in.  On the recording, you can see multi colored and moving lights in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD))<n>

It is my belief that the object was low in the sky relative to aircraft flying at altitude.

They appeared to be in the atmosphere (not in space) - high up, at the altitude of high altitude jetliners or military patrols, but not as high as satellites (the brightness varied a little for each one through time as if they were passing thru mists -- yet, as I said, it was a clear cold night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There appeared to be a very dim glowing blur between the objects.<n>

My bedroom window was open and I happened to glance outside and when I did I noticed a bright flickering red and and orange light outside in the night time sky.  It caught my attention and I immediatly told my 8 year old son who was in bed with me to look outside the window.  He saw it and said it looked like a blowing up star but I tried to tell him that it was not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside on my balcony and watched the mysterious light.  It was flickering red and orange and I noticed a moving aircraft near it, possibly a helicopter or small jet.  What really caught my attention was the fact that the object I was looking at did not move at all.  If it was a aircraft, it would have moved either to the right or left or something but this light was just in the sky with no movement.  I watched it for about 1 minute outside and then it just faded away!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was north of the base and looked close to the coast if I had to estimate its location.  It was close enough that I could see the two distinct colors of red and orange but far enough away that I could not see any type of shape to the object except that it reminded me of a planet or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know how long it had been in the sky, like I said I happened to glance out my window and when I noticed it something felt differant about it so I had to take a closer look and I did and it faded away......<n>

I was fueling my car with everyone else under the gas staition canopy roof.  I was standing at the edge of the canopy and with the fuel running I jumped over quick to look at the paper headline in the box then went back to tend the fueling and on the way back something caught my eye high up in the sky.  I had to look again to see if it was moving at all.  It was. It was drifting slowly in my direction and now it looked closer to the Earth  Then when I first noticed it about 20 seconds ago.  It looked fairly small. 2-5 feet across.  About 200-300 feet up.  The object made no sounds.  It was drifting in the wind direction basically but not completely.  It was if the wind was not affecting it.  It moved much slower than the winds which were fairly heavy this day.  The sky was cloudless as the wind had blown everything away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked at first like a flying wing.  But it had more than one wing.  It had wings which changed shape, position and in number about once or twice a second not in a mechanical way but almost in a random way.  The wings also were colored in sections and these sections continually changed like a prism changes in the sunlight.  They would also stay one color in the wing and then a new wing shape and direction sprouted and a new color came up.  Sometimes there would be two or more stripes of color in the same wing until the new shape came in.  When this object was the closest to me I could see a streaky gray plasma type cloud hanging from it like a tail.  The bottom of it came to a point and there was movement in it like a swirling effect from bottom to top.  As it passed overhead the plasma tail became invisible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object left my view as it passed over the rain canopy I was fueling my car under.  This event up till now has taken about 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had paid with a credit card so I didn&#39;t have to go in and pay.  I pulled the car around and out from under the canopy and stuck my head out the window to see it again and it was still up there drifting away and now looked slightly higher again.  The plasma tail was visible again.  It was still heading slowly in the same direction but still seemed to wander slightly unaffected by the wind speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for another 20-30 seconds before it left my sight.<n>

It was a bright blue day not a cloud in the sky. I Was Talking To My Friend On The Phone Lying On My Bed. my bed is against the window running parallel with it.  It was like 10:30 am Sunday morning December seventh 2008. I Happened To Look To My Right Out The Window which is west towards Dunnellon or the golf of Mexico. I Noticed Three Round White Circles That Were Stationary. It Looked Like They Were In A Triangle Formation. Kind of Like The Blue Angles in the air shows. At First My Mind Didn&#39;t Register What I Was Seeing. I Kind of Thought Are Those Stars In The Day Sky? They Were Stationary For About Another Three Or Four Seconds And Then All At Once They Started Pulsating. It Was Like They Were Mirrors Flashing and reflecting The Sun big and Bright And Then small dull White Circles again. It Seemed Like Every Time They Would Stop flashing Big And Bright They Would Shrink Or Implode On Themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Friends Daughter Who Is 13 Happened To Be Over At The Time. She Was On The Computer In The Living Room, So I Excitedly Screamed Come Here Quick, Quick, I Think I See A UFO!!! Well, She Didn&#39;t Run Fast Enough And When She Came To The Window They All Disappeared. I Got Really Mad At Her at first For Not Coming Fast Enough And Missing It. She Kind of Gave Me This Face Like &#39;&#39;whatever&#39;&#39;, so I Told Her To Keep Looking Just In Case And All Of The Sudden They Reappeared. This Time They Got Huge, And Then really, really small again Pulsating And Weaving In And Out Of Each Other. It Was Kind of Like There Was An Imaginary Person Juggling Them In The Sky. I Couldn&#39;t Tell If They Were Changing Size because They Were Actually Changing Size, Or If They Just Were Getting Closer And Moving Further Away At High Speeds. Then They All Went Different erratic Directions But Continued To Pulsate. It was like they were playing a game of tag with one another. This lasted for about five or six minutes until they disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching just in case. Well sure enough, two to three seconds later they came back but this time there were only two of them. They were a lot bigger and brighter this time and were flying erratically again. Like it was some kind of a game. There was also a commercial jet going north to south in they sky at the same time that was pretty close. The whole reason I even noticed the plane amongst all the chaos was I thought &#39;&#39;Man, I wonder if the people in the jet can see this also?&#39;&#39; It seemed two be so close to it. Well the craft that was closest to the plane seemed to wait stationary again until the plane passed it by like three or four inches in the sky. as soon as it got just enough away from the plane to build up momentum it shot straight across the sky back in the direction of the plane it let pass. faster then I have seen any other thing fly in my life, but comparable to a fast shooting star. I started screaming oh my god it&#39;s going to hit the back of the plane. Right when it was about to collide with the tail of the plane &#39;&#39;which it had no room for error because I couldn&#39;t really see the sky any more between either object.&#39;&#39; it went straight up at a perfect lateral angle, Excelerated so fast, and then both objects disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Know keep in mind I am still on the phone at this time my friend on the line who was almost deff from all the screaming, and the thirteen year old was historical and  in tears. She keep screaming I want to go home know I want my mom know, know, know! I just keep saying I&#39;m so glad I am not the only one who saw it! So I decided to call the local law enforcement being this thing almost hit a plane. But they had not much to say but &#34;It could have been an air show being held today.  My response was &#34;is it a costume for a plane to chase down a commercial jet at an air show?&#34; Especially after 911 right? I lived like not even a Quarter of a mile away from the Dunnellon air port and they fly trick planes all the time. I know they have strict regulations and air spaces. As close as I lived to the air port at the time they were not even allowed two do there tricks over my property. I also living in Florida have seen all kinds of planes, jets, helicopters army air craft of all sorts. again nothing has ever moved like that. Not that speed, not that shape, not that erratic. Not until today. All I can think is UFO. I hope this brings comfort to anyone who saw the same thing.<n>

I&#39;m walking down the driveway and my dog stopped in his tracks and pointed with his nose that he sees something. I look, because we have large wild animals (brown bear, mountain lions,) ect. An aircraft of sorts flew over a peak from the west. Imagine a 747 with a 727 attached tail to nose, like a plane being refueled. now imagine it snaking through the sky. It turned north and went over another mountain, never stopping its banking. Approximate height 30,000 ft. I then saw 4 contrails across the sky. me and my helper were discussing  how they looked like they came from the outer atmosphere when another aircraft entered the atmosphere before our eyes! This one looked it was from the movie star wars. It flew much closer, and in the same direction as the contrails. It had 4 HUGE engines with a ball capsule on a stick in front and it was going many thousands MPH. Hitting the atmosphere so hard it knocked it sideways! We were waiting for the obvious sonic boom, guess what no noise!<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way the weekend before we did hear a sonic boom.

Occasionally, the pattern broke off in to what appeared to be random movements and then returned to the pattern.  At one point 2 additional identical light shapes appeared in the sky, joined the criss cross pattern and disappeared shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the lights were visible in the sky to the south and east of me, but at one point moved north and west for a brief time, continuing in the same pattern. But then returned to the south and east of me and remained there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was partly cloudy that night, and the lights stayed behind the cloud cover.  So when I first saw them, I thought they might be the kind of spotlights that you see in the sky at big events.  But these were different because there was no beam of light from the ground that you usually see with those. And they were moving exponentially faster than the typical spotlight in the sky display.  They were also not ciruclar like the spotlights usually are.  When the 2 light shapes were moving through the sky, they would occasionally change direction, appearing to basically turn on a dime at incredibly high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it and am at a loss for what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This is a routine procedure I perform in cold weather to keep the water circulating to prevent freezing (in lieu of winterizing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After switching on the motor, I noticed in the western night sky a very bright light slowly moving eastward. Since we live about 20 minutes from a regional airport, I at first didn’t think this was unusual. However as I watched it’s motion, I noticed it had no blinking aircraft lights. As I continued to stare, it suddenly halted movement and then began to move backwards. Eventually it stopped completely and became fixed (now appearing as the brightest “star” in the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I ran inside to get my video camera and to notify my two young children of what I had seen.  When we came back outside the object was still there, but was now accompanied by a second star-like light (albeit less bright) off to the lower right.  I began to record as best as I could through the backyard tree limbs which somewhat blocked my view.  Eventually the cold weather forced us indoors, where I continued to film through my upstairs screened-in porch area.  For the next half hour or so my children and I watched in amazement as the two objects alternately moved closer to each other, then moved apart.  In addition they would continually fade in and out, at times becoming completely dark (appearing to us to disappear completely), then suddenly reappearing in full brightness.  At times the second object would become brighter than the first.  Eventually the objects went dark permanently.<n>

Can you at least get back to me and tell me if they reported it?  I would greatly appreciate it.   At first I thought maybe I was seeing another lift off from Vandenberg airforce base south or here about 35-40 miles.  But after 2-3 seconds I knew it wasn&#39;t since there was no &#34;trail&#34; of thrust rockets.  And sice the base is due south of my house, it couldn&#39;t have ben a lilft off because it was going from left to right, east to west, between the cresent moon and venus ( or jupiter).  Also. it was going on a downward angle from my vantage point about 15 degrees I would guess.  All I can say is that it was a fireball of sorts, orangish in color, not blue or white.  And, it was going relatively slowly compared to a shooting star.  In the few seconds I saw it, it had moved accross the sky about 8-10 inches at arms length.  I don&#39;t know how many degrees that would be.  All I can say is that if you stetch your arm out and point to the sky,move your index finger about 10&#34; and that&#39;s about how far I saw it travel.  The size is also hard to judge or determine.  Again, if you hold your arm out like before and make about a quarter inch gap between your index finger and thumb, that would be about how big it was.  It was &#34;on fire&#34; and flickered then disappeared, not much of a trail.  I thought  afterwards that maybe I saw a plane crashing, God forbid!<n>

It appeared to be a fireball type of craft, changing  Altitude dramatically.  I turned East onto a side road to get a better look and took another right and was now headed in a southerly direction. The object appeared again to my left, and seemed to move parallel with me for about 20 seconds. It then proceeded to gain altitude and I lost sight of it behind some trees. The craft appeared to be spherical with a sort of fire flicker to it.  I saw and chased the craft for several minutes and was never able to identify anything distinguishing it from a plane or helicopter. There were no colored lights, no blinking lights, and it changed altitude too fast for anything terrestrial. The object also did not make a sound from what I could tell.<n>

Large, long, hotdog shaped object seemed to float around right in the path of incoming airliners headed for MIA.  The long, cylindrical object was red or orange, maybe 100 feet long, and seemed to &#34;float&#34; instead of hover.  A 777 flew right past the object on its landing pattern, and therefore I was able to scale the object with a 200 ft long aircraft.  It also had a slight bend in it, lending to the notion that it was &#39;hot dog shaped&#39;.  (It sounds funny, but ut us true!

Rate of speed was such that the object took 15 minutes to travel from a point directly above me to a point @ 45 deg. N-NW where I lost sight of it due to haze in the atmosphere and wispy clouds moving in (very quickly the sky changed from nice and clear to grayish and scattered clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds came in from W-NW moving E-SE. I don&#39;t know if the wind at higher altitudes ever travels in opposite/different directions than the wind at lower altitudes. If it does, then the object could have been a balloon(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was traveling against the wind then I don&#39;t know what it could&#39;ve been. I&#39;ve never seen a satellite travel from SE to NW, but maybe there&#39;s one that does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did manage to snap one photo but it only adds confusion since the object in the photo appears to be four orange lights arranged like a + (plus sign) but so tightly packed that the general shape is circular.  I don&#39;t know if this is what it really looked like or if this is some &#34;digital camera anomaly&#34; or a result of being improperly focused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I just wanted to put it on record in case anybody else saw it. Not a real big deal. Just a flying (silent) object that I could not identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS. I did notice that when my camera was struggling to focus just before I pressed the button fully to snap the picture, the image in the viewfinder did all kinds of funny stuff, it showed a faint crescent shape that expanded and then a flash of light and then as it shifted the focus out toward infinity I just snapped it because I didnt think it was going to ever find it.

The craft was  gloss black in color and was floating in a counter clockwise direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft approached my location I was able to observe the underside. The crafts underside was a yellowish color with what appeared to be a dome like structure underneath which appeared to have a blue and grayish mist-like appearance and was similar to a flourecent glow.  The craft did not make any sound and was approximately 1000-1500 feet above my location.  The craft appeared to have a rectangular to cigar shape apperance and appeared to be about the size of a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions for that day was clear blue skies and no clouds.

I plane at that altitude makes quite a racket(lots of noise). It had (I saw) 4 lights two yellow ones (normal) and two blue ones. The way it was maneuvering told me that it is not a plane, although it could have been(unlike any I have seen before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quite exhilarating, mostly cause of the movement. I said to my friend: &#34;hey look at that plane&#34;. Cause it was a specific craft and I wanted to hear him agree with me that it is a plane so that I don&#39;t trick myself into thinking I&#39;m seeing something else. He replied: &#34;dude that&#39;s not a plane it&#39;s a space ship&#34;. I stick with my story that it was a UFO and not a space ship. It could have been a plane or a space ship but I had no evidence of either. Only thing I saw was something I&#39;ve never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it disappear behind the buildings(about 30 meters tall the buildings) and then I turned right into the street where I was to drop my friend off. At this point my car is going parallel with the craft, but I do not see it. I ask my friend where it is and he replies there it is in front of us. It appeared as if it had gone straight following a course it took just before it disappeared behind the buildings. Now I saw it in front of us at the same altitude and with the distance being aproximatelly 100-200 meters, flying off. I could still see the lights, 4 of them in a row and a half sphere like shape of the craft, but I couldn&#39;t make out the front and what I saw of the craft was dark and unilluminated. First thing I saw was 4 lights under the craft, but after it flew away slowly I saw 4 lights at the back of it and in a straight line. Hard to describe. The flight movements were kinda like that of a fighter jet, but it was done slowly it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking marijuana all the time before then, actually for 7 hours straight, I think it&#39;s important to note. But I do that from time to time and I have never hallucinated about UFO&#39;s and I think I was not this time. Since details are of the essence I thought I&#39;d be dead honest with my report, since what I saw was accompanied with feelings I&#39;ve never felt before.<n>

It was straight out from my front porch low in the sky, just above the power lines.  It moves slowly, stopping then moving again, to the east.  I went to grab my cell phone; The Orange light was still there when I came back but it had stopped moving.  As I watched it and tried to turn on my phone (battery dead) it just disappeared as I watched.  This was a perfectly clear night.  I could see the star Sirius and the Big Dipper, very clearly.  The Orange light was brighter than the stars, but just a little dimmer than Sirius.  The Orange light was visible for about two minutes.  Then I saw a second Orange light much higher in the sky, coming from the northwest and moving in the direction where the first Orange light had vanished.  These two lights were unmistakably the same color orange, as I had seen on December 2, 2008.  The Orange light went to about the same area where the first one disappeared, and then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did, accompanied by our third roommate and a neighbor.  What we first saw was not immediately striking, approximately 6 to 8 lights in the sky.  These lights were just above the horizon as we were looking in a South-Southeast direction.  As minutes passed, however, 3 or 4 of the lights began to grow in intensity. The colors of these lights also seemed to change.  At times the lights would fade almost to dark, and at others the lights would almost shine in unison as the objects came closer together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately rushed to get our telescope.  After waiting a few minutes for the intensity of the lights to come back, I focused the telescope on the light.  What I saw amazed me.  In the telescope the light was distinctly recognizable as a triangle shape, almost like a chip, with color changing light traveling around the perimeter in a sort of cycling manner.  All three other individuals looked through the telescope and affirmed the same details; triangle, color-changing cycling lights. After a duration of about 30 minutes, the sky went dark.  It might be important to note that throughout the sighting, the additional lights were recognizable as the strobes of aircraft.  A sound was only present when many of the planes heading in the direction of the intensifying lights passed over our house.<n>

Only lights on was backdoor light.  Dogs were running around yard as usual.  What drew my attention to object I witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stay distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg.  She sat down and was looking up over the roof of house.  I looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something.  She kept looking, so then I looked up to see what she was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I believed I saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating.  But then reality hit me.  It was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when I focused on it, I then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape.  It was close enough that I could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home.  The overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground.  I was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern.  There weren’t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. The right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried to that height.  I also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so I could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was apparent, the side wasn’t a smooth surface.  I say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades.  This to me could have been either two assumptions:  1.  The surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2.  the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. This is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar.  The light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled at my wife, who was inside.  When she came out, the object had only moved ¼ of our block down the street.  I tried to have her follow my arm movement to look down the length of it to be able to see it.  By the time she was in sync with my movement the craft had gained some altitude and was moving away.  The rear of the craft seemed sort of blunt, not the shape appendage you would expect from a tails of an airplane.  It then moved away out of sight, not at an accelerated rate but at a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is journalism.  I’ve spent over 6 years on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and 6 years on Navy Air Stations, documenting Navy fighters and bombers in flight.  I also was piloting Cessna 150 and 172 aircraft years ago when I started pilot training, so I’m used to aircraft design, determining what you visually see before me in order to navigate and anything associated with flight.  And being a photo journalist I’m very good when it comes to attention to detail.  I wasn’t mentally rattled and didn’t lose my composure but the event left me with allot of questions.   A male friend of my wife at her work, who lives in north Dallas County saw something similar, same design, but with more than one object just a few months ago.<n>

It was difficult to determine if the object was providing its own source of light or was merely reflecting sunlight as it seemed to emit a &#34;welding-arc&#34; type of brightness. The shape was cylindrical and it appeared to be in an &#34;upright&#34; position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truck I was riding in was stopped behind a schoolbus picking up students. I observed the object remain stationary in the sky for a couple of seconds, then watched as it dropped at a 45 degree angle at a phenomenal rate of speed and simply disappeared from sight. There were no objects to obscure my line of vision as I observed this. The object for all intents and purposes vanished from sight. The driver of our vehicle, to my delight, also witnessed the event and expressed his surprise as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be extremely difficult to not have noticed the object as its illumination was quite vivid. There were no interior lights on in the vehicle and as we were stopped for a schoolbus (as were other vehicles), no chance of another vehicle&#39;s movement reflected on our windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As someone with an interest in unusual phenomena, and trained to look for rational explanations before declaring anything to be beyond that - this was pretty breath taking. A true UFO.<n>

Riding across a long stretch of road, I was looking at some early morning stars. However, I realized there was only one star, and it wasn&#39;t before long I realized that it wasn&#39;t a star. It was an object which was reflecting the sun, above the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that this object was not far away, paralleling the bus. I noticed two white lights on the lower half of the object. When the bus came to a stop, to pick up another student, I was shocked about what I had seen. I thought the object would keep coasting along, but, it stopped along with the bus, and began to merge forward, toward the bus. When the bus picked up again, the object stopped moving toward the bus, and continued to parallel it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> his went on for about three minutes, and because no one else seemed to notice the object, I kept to myself. I made an attempt to get a picture of it with the camera on my phone, (a two Megapixel camera, built in) but this bright object failed to show up on my screen, or in snapshots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on the bus ride I had noticed more lights. But I realized that these were street lights or building lights behind me. So I made an attempt to debunk what I saw earlier, but I had no such luck. These lights not only reflected and moved the opposite way of the bus, they were too low of a reflection on the window. Anything higher would have been blocked out by the bus roof, or the window sills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the object before had distinct two lights on its lower half, and was chrome/metallic.<n>

We left the inside of the bar to go outside and get some fresh air.  It was freezing out, and we were the only two people on the deck outside at the time.  I looked up at the sky to try and find O&#39;Ryan&#39;s Belt like I always do and noticed three glowing orange/red lights in the shape of a triangle.  It was above a thin layer of whispy clouds.  It was dark so I could not see  the actual shape of the object, but the lights led me to believe it was triangular.  Before I could say anything, the object moved very quickly across to the right and then curved straight up into the sky before it disappeared.  My friend and I looked at each other - he had seen it too - and both said at the same time: &#34;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside to tell our friends but they were skeptical.

There were no other cars on the road.  I saw a light that was steady and not blinking.   It was just a plain white light. It looked like a bright star.  It was moving low to the ground and moving slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a helicopter and just kept watching it because it stuck out in the air over the open fields.  Then it started moving very fast in one direction and then back in the same direction it just came from.  When I say fast I mean very fast.  It did not accellerate it was instantly moving fast. It did this for about half a minute going back and forth in the sky.  Then it stopped moving for a few seconds all together and was stationary in the sky.  Then it started to move slowly around again like when I first spotted the light.  I then proceeded to pull over and tried to get a video of it on my phone.  When I was trying to get any kind of picture resolution on my phone it just shot into space so fast and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To someone reading this it might seem like a helicopter is actually what I saw looking for something or someone.   But there is no way a helicopter could move the way this light was moving.  I would not pull over to look at a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly called my girlfriend and told her what I had just seen and she said I was crazy.  I know that what I saw was a ufo there is nothing manmade that could do what I saw this thing do.  I never believed in ufos until that night and now im a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I tried to follow it with my car because I couldn’t believe my eyes, I and wanted to make sure of what I was seeing. My daughter kept saying “mom, mom, do you see what I see?

We watched it for nearly 25 seconds as it arced across the early evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green portion of the object was clear as in a green traffic light.  Under that was a cradle-type of object of n white lightn which the green object rested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no aircraft or watercrsft visible at that time and it had no tail, so we eliminated a flare as the cause.  It neither spun nor blinked at all.simply moved smoothly across the evening sky and over the treetops across the bay to our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A puzzling experience, but very pretty scene.  Could it have been a light or illusion  I wonder?  The two observers are female ages 63 and 64 who have lived in this area for 30 yrs and 60 years r respectfully. we both watch the skies regularly  as we both  have great  views  of the water and sky here near the coast  thank you very much for having this site.<n>

My husband teaches elementary school, I am a writer.  Our town sits at the south foot of a 75-foot mesa in Southeast Oregon, and we often see jetliners and their contrails bisecting our skyway.  On this evening we observed a smooth silver oval object flying silently along the top of the mesa.  It moved at a rate slower than a weather satellite or a commercial jet, and left no contrail. We had been looking at the planet Jupiter to the southwest, and commented that this object was larger than that, with a brighter magnitude.  We watched, thinking at first it was a meteor.  But the object traveled horizontally and left no tail. It traveled along the mesa top approximately 300 feet at a steady rate and then vanished, disappeared into a cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then remembered a sighting of a similar object on Thursday morning, January 17th, &#39;08, at 0730.  This object was also a silver oval, and descended at a similar rate of speed behind another mesa to the south of our town.  When I first observed this object it was approximately 300 feet above the horizon, shining like a star, but with smooth margins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it descended at a slow rate behind the southern mesa, taking about ten minutes to go behind the rim.  I thought it was an odd meteor, dismissed the sight, and went about the day.  At 0830 I was sitting at my kitchen table when I saw the silver object rising again from the same spot, ascend to the same altitude, and vanish from sight, disappear.  The sky was cloudless; there was no wind at that time.<n>

I was between Spalding Rd. and Holcomb Bridge Rd around 2 pm.  I saw a large rectangular object about 50 x 100 ft. in length and width but no discernible thickness and was maybe 2-300 ft. in the air.  It was difficult to determine its speed (since I am not familiar with the speeds of flying objects) but I would guess around 100 mph. The object was very white in color. It was traveling East to West and would have been somewhere above Peachtree Corners Circle (maybe a little further North of that). I watched it for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared behind some trees that blocked my line of sight.  As I moved further South on the road I kept looking for it but I never saw the object again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the 1st time I believe to have seen a UFO.  Around 1963-65 I was at the construction site of Durham Memorial Baptist Church on Freedom Drive in Charlotte N.C.  Further West on Freedom Drive (maybe 2-3 miles) I saw a large cigar shaped object (definitely not a blimp) hovering in the air for 10-15 minutes. It was many feet above the ground, but at that distance it was impossible to tell how high.  It was much, much longer than a blimp and had short stubby wings.  It had an iridescent glow that varied in color - pink, blue, red, green - the colors were undulating (mixing, washing back and forth over the object).  I was with several other people at the time but only remember one of them, my Father.  He is 89 now and his mind is not what it used to be and does not remember the incident.<n>

Around 04:45 this morning, I let the dog out in the backyard and saw this very bright star. That was my original thought, that it was just a very bright star. It somehow grabbed my attention, obviously, or I would not be writing this. This is a small town and very dark at night to where you can always see stars in the night sky, any given night, so that is normal, and yes some “stars” appear to flicker as this had seemed to do but in retrospect to the others around it from a “distance” appeared as looking as a star. It appeared to look that far away, so I thought. So I just could not stop watching it...and then, I could not believe what I was seeing. It began moving up and to the right REAL slow, I mean REAL slow and a trail of white light came from behind it and in its appearance it still remained as to look as a star would as it moved up and to the right. I was thinking to myself, I hear no chopper blades, so it can not be a chopper. I was trying to equate logic to what I was seeing while watching it. The fact that it was moving that slow is what really shocked me about it. So I had to see what this thing was, It was cold as I stood there from inside with the back door open, and had no shirt on and ran to the couch to put it on. Why is this important, well because of this I did not see it “turn” towards the direction of my house and then when I came back it was flying over the house at a slow speed. A speed to me that if a plane was moving that slow it would not have the propulsion to really fly. It was in the shape of a triangle. It made no noise whatsoever and it was so smooth as it was moving. It was like a bird, slow and just gliding through the sky. There was a BRIGHT white light on the left of the triangle, in the middle there was a small BRIGHT white light which blinked only white in sequence and on the right there was a HUGE flashing BRITE white light. And then as it passed over I ran to the front of the House to watch it out the big bay w! indow an d I saw it fly off into the distance through the darkened clouds and it was gone. Then I recorded my description in audio on my cell phone, and then I went outside into the backyard again replaying what I had just seen. Then I hear and see a small plane off in the distance about the same height this triangle was and I was thankful, because I could hear it, I saw the red light blinking light on it and I could analytically without question differentiate the attributes of both the triangle craft and the plane. There was no red blinking light on the triangle craft and as I stated before NO noise. I am still in a shock status here and I am hoping that someone else here in this area saw this thing and can confirm it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shalom<n>

They were quite large and were yellow-orange, reminiscent of the color of a candle flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were evenly spaced with the two outer squares tapering off slightly as if the panel of lights created one round object.

Out of my windshield a bright object caught my eye.  It was nearly overhead.  I carefully pulled over because it was a steep embankment on the side of the road and there was a car on my tail. I was pretty excited because I knew it wasn’t an object we normally see in the sky at night. I told my wife, “look, a UFO!” I rolled the window down and sat on the door looking up. There was a low, fog layer, with the base about 300 feet above our head. The object was directly beneath it. It was also lighting up the fog above it. If I stick my hand out arms length, I would say it was about a nickel size in diameter. It was round and had a brilliant amber color. There were bright, LED looking lights, glittering throughout it. I couldn’t tell exactly where the lights were oriented on it, but they were brilliant. There was no sound and it was moving very, very, slowly S.E. to N.W. I watched it for about 30 seconds. At arms length it moved just a few inches in the sky. The car behind us pulled up next to our car and asked if we were OK. I said, “We are fine. We are looking at that light”. I pointed up to the object and saw that it was rising/fading into the base of the fog layer. The person in the car said, “Oh” and just took off. We watched it for just 15-30 seconds longer and the light disappeared in the clouds/fog. There was no sound from it. My wife and I are both well eduacated and have encountered several credible U.F.O.’s in the past, one in this area, one 20 miles away, and two in Eastern Oregon. We are always looking up for the next one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Please e-mail me back on this.

It was silent, about 6-8 feet from where our mattress was, and about 3 feet in length.  It looked like several small orbs clustered together on a sort of plate, with several tentacles hanging down.  It just hung there for several seconds, then glided silently into the other room.

I saw one spherical shiny silver or white looking object in the sky heading East about one inch from object a plane with a contrail, this plane was heading East far above the object.  I looked away for about 45 seconds, and then looked back and it was gone.  It looked like it was above central Tucson -  I was longside the public golf course on Silverbell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for this object for about 4 minutes and kept searching for a plane or the morning balloons (people hire them for rides in the mornings-because our winds are less here in the mornings, and less planes to contend with because we have an airport).<n>

It was almost 12:30 at night when I was walking back to my apartment complex. I was walking through the grass in the front of the apartments that had a gate where u could get back in.  Anyways I was just about to the gate when I saw a very bright blue light out of the cirbir of my eye. I looked up at the sky and there was this blue oval looking object.  The object was I would have to say less than a half mile in the sky. It was there and gone as soon as I looked up at it. It appeared to be moving downward into a field right across the street. I was very scared of the fact that it moved so quickly and seemed to vanish before getting to the ground. There was no noise at all from the object. I would have to say I was less than 300 yards away from it as well.  As soon as I saw it vanish I felt chills.  The area where the object was has a lot of dear that roam around at night. I didn&#39;t see any dear in sight. It&#39;s about an hour after I have witnessed the unidenitifief object.  I still don&#39;t see any deer, and they are always coming into the field around this time from across the street where I spores the object.  Anyways like I said I looked up saw a blue oval looking object and as fast as I saw it, the thing shot downwards and appeared to vanish all within about 2 seconds.  That&#39;s as much information as I&#39;m available to give about what I&#39;ve seen.  It&#39;s late and I&#39;m shooken up about it.  I hope my information helps.<n>

It was a color like I’ve never seen before, kind of like a candle flame.  The light was moving east and was south of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at the store at Springdale and Bolsa Streets.  I watched the light move slowly east for about a minute.  (I REALLY wish I took a picture of it now)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the store for about five minutes.  When I came out the light had moved west and was almost overhead.  It was an overcast night so the clouds reflected the orange glow.  I’m guessing that the clouds were about 1500 feet up that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a slight wind out of the south, the light did not seem to be affected by the wind as it moved east then west, it stopped and moved slowly, there was no sound.  I drove home for about 3 minutes and when I parked my car and got out I could still see the light.  It was still moving west and was lower in the sky since I had moved about a mile north of it.  I went inside my house and changed out of my clothes.  About 5 minutes later I went outside looking south and the light was still moving west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light from my front porch for about 2 minutes then it moved up really fast and disappeared into the overcast cloud layer.<n>

It was no larger than a single story house and couldn&#39;t have been more than 12 feet tall, it was saucer shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The U.F.O. had a flat bottom with walls roughly 3 feet and then a steadily rising roof, finally coming to a point when it rose up like scoop of ice cream.  It had very few lights on the outside of it, but it appeared to glow white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer was circling lower and lower like a bird until it dipped below the tree line out of my sight.  I got out of work about ten minutes later and walked down the rail road tracks to investigate but found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was only in my sight for roughly 30 seconds at exactly 9:05pm.  At the same time my relatives less than a mile down the road from my work saw bright lights outside the living room window, they assumed it was a police helicopter but now recall that they did not hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to land, and I did not see it take off again.<n>

My 16-year old daughter was in the car with me. She noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the North Star. I looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. I then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. The light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. As we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to her, &#34;Must be an airplane.&#34; As we neared even closer, I wondered out loud to her, &#34;But airplanes don&#39;t hover.&#34; The lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. We could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. The lights were not moving at all, other than blinking. It seemed odd and also apparent to me, that at my snail pace of 30mph, I was actually &#34;catching up&#34; with whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my daughter that we would find out what it was in a few seconds, because we&#39;re going to pass right under it. The object was still hovering in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. We passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph.  As we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light.  One light was green.  One light was red. I believe, but can&#39;t be positive, that the third light was white.  Directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights.  We passed under in absolute shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed it, we both turned to each other and shouted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;That was a UFO!&#34; My daughter said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly pulled into a side street and turned my car around, in an attempt to catch back up to the object.  By the time I had pulled in, backed up and turned around the object was almost gone from sight. It was now moving at a ridiculous speed away from us.  I sped up, but within seconds the lights were completely gone from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had my daughter not been in the car with me and witnessed what I had seen, I would have thought I had lost my mind.<n>

It was moving very slow to the north towards Chicago.  It was a triangle shape with bright red lights at each tip.  I pulled over to the side of the road to get a better look, and I could see distinctly a triangle shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t hear any noises, so I know for sure this wasn&#39;t an airplane, and I have seen this object once before a couple months ago in the exact same area.  This time, it was closer to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get a couple pictures of it on my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two, the object dissapeared in the sky.

The lights were red and the object was moving very fast then it stopped abruptly. I parked my car on the side of the and grabbed my phone to take a pictures of it as i took out my phone it started to move again then it disappeared I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. Then two days later I saw a similar object but the lights were green this object was moving extremely fast to fast to be a plane and like the other disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was paying attention to the sky at that moment because I was admiring Venus and another planet.  My husband and I noticed as the objects got closer to us that the lights were definitely not an airplane or helicopter. The lights were apart but moved together and then after they passed us became perpendicular to one another.  I watched them until we got off the 136th street exit and then they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My camera says 4:10 pm but I know that is not accurate.  My best guess is that it was around 7pm but could have been later.  I walked out onto the front porch to plug in the Christmas lights and looked up at the moon when I noticed to very bright white lights to the left of the moon.  They were brighter than the stars around them and looked like lights on airplanes as they approach the airport (which is near our house) or even like low flying helicopters.  The only difference is that they did not budge at all and they were not accompanied by the red and blue flashing lights that are visible on aircraft (especially on aircraft that are flying directly at you - which these would have had to have been because of the visibility of thier &#34;headlights&#34; - let me stress again that they did not seem to be moving at all).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my seventeen year old daughter out to look at them and then called out my husband who stated that they were probably planets.  The only problem with his theory is that they seemed to be very similar in brightness and size which doesn&#39;t bode well for the planet theory.  And frankly, they were just too bright.  I&#39;ve veiwed planets before while taking astronomy in college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband went back inside to watch tv and my daughter and I snapped a couple of pictures with my camera but gave up after feeling like we couldn&#39;t get a successful shot.  We went inside, reluctantly accepting my husband&#39;s planet theory.  When I went back out several hours later to unplug the Christmas lights the &#34;planets&#34; were not visible anywhere in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I was watching a UFO show on television and decided to go ahead and report my sighting.

I thought it had something to do with Jupiter and Venus lining up, but I could see that to the southwest. I could see the object most of the way home but lost it once I turned off the interstate. About 15 minutes later, I was turning down the street where I live and the object was still in the sky but had changed intensity (it looked more like a streetlight hanging over the treeline at this point). I have no idea what it could have been, but I know it wasn&#39;t a planet/star that I&#39;m familiar with. This is the third sighting I&#39;ve had in about as many weeks, and the other two objects remind me of this one, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was about 17:18 and just past dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was an orange/peach color.  It appeared quickly, as my mother stated, &#34;What is that?  It wasn’t there a second ago.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be ‘descending’ in a slight spiral but nearly straight line.  It grew larger as if descending toward the earth, paused for a few seconds then began to ascend with a slight arc to its path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it ‘ascended’ it grew smaller and faded from sight.  It did not move as commonly know aircraft move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed no sounds, nor contrails.  We did not see any flashing lights, it was of consistent coloring.  I want to make it clear the object did not appear to be as far from earth as the moon, I am simply using the moon as a reference to the direction (southern) and angle we were looking.<n>

We were standing on his front porch looking out smoking a cigarette looking at Oakland from his house.  At first I thought it was a radio tower or a building that we had never saw.  But the light remained motionless for a couple minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to slowly rise and glide through the sky.  Then it began to turn and come our way.  At that time I thought it was a helicopter because the shape was elongated from the side view with a white light near the front and a red flashing light near the back of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it made its way closer to use and I saw what appeared to be the underside of the rectangular oval object and there were two white lights in towards the middle of the object and four red lights symmetrically aligned on the edges of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The saucer at that point was no more than a couple hundred feet away from us and in the air gliding without making any noise what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sprinted down the street to follow where it was going but the terrain eventually made it impossible to see where it was going.<n>

It was something I had never seen and was very odd looking.  I saw it out of an upstairs bedroom window. The object stopped moving and appeared to be an oval shaped pale blue light through the clouds. I then ran down the stairs to my front yard and noticed that it remained still, with a coloring like the moon through thin clouds, it was a little cloudy that night.I then returned into my, went back to my bederoom window with binoculars to watch the still unmoving object.  I noticed that it had a lot of lights flashing in different colors it now appeared to be more disked or saucer shaped with lots of lights.  I saw a plane pass right in front of it from my view.  The object  was very large and i&#39;m sure it was at a much higher altitude than the plane.  I called my daughter on the phone and told her about the sighting.  My daughter lives a short distance away, about a couple of miles from me.  She looked out of an upstairs patio, and was able to see it along with her husband.  As i continued watching, it began to slowly move toward the north west,then stopped.  There were at least 6 rows of about 10 red lights flashing alternating from the left side of the craft to the right side of the craft very rapidly for abou 5 minutes.The flashing red lights gave way to rows of pale green lights in the center of the craft for about 2 minutes. The ofject then reverted to a pale blue and slowly moved toward the north west.It was not a plane, blimp or helicopter, it no sound. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen something that I could not find an explanation for.I am a registerd nurse, I do not have a back ground in physics, science or astronomy.

It turns out that I misunderstood his earlier statement.  The event began just south of my house and in the clouds, so not high at all.  The object was very large.  I asked about the thumb nail test and he said much larger than the thumb, rather huge by comparison.  It was blue. there were no lights on the object.  It disgorged four other lights.  These lights he said then dived at one another and almost seemed to play.  The large object circled and passed over the house.

No sound was heard it was too high but was moving many times faster than an aircraft and seemed to waver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could be asteroid glancing off but very plain to see and several others spoke of it next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spend time watching meteors etc and this was by far the most amazing sighting nothing like a meteor i had seen before<n>

I was walking around in my back yard and looked up at the sky. It was a very clear night I saw 3 circled bright lights that moved in a clockwise  motion.  Less then 2 seconds they turned counter clockwise.  Then the 2 end ones came together with the one infront then shot straight up and left.  About the same angel.  This is how they looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did shift and change positions .  So the full duration was about 10 mins.  The other witness was my best friend. So there where 2 witness.<n>

Told me to go outside and look by the moon at the lights.  Told her it was the stars.  She said, no that there were two lights located at the bottom of the cresent of the moon.  That initially it was one light but seperated into two.  I went outside and looked and could see two lights located just to the bottom and left of the moon.  This lasted about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter are near Moon.  PD))<n>

I was standing in my yard watching the event with Jupiter, Venus, and the moon when from the SE horizon came a bright white light as bright as the north star.  It moved all the way from the edge of my view of the horizon, overhead, then to the WNW horizon edge.  It looked like a shooting star, but had little-to-no tail.  No sound was heard, and for an hour afterwords there were no other sightings of anything unusual.<n>

An enormous green and orange fire ball entered the sky right in front of me. It appeared to be traveling down towards the earth. The object burned much longer than any meteor that I have ever seen. The fireball was orange in the middle, burned with a green glow, and had a long green tail. After falling and burning for several seconds, there was a large green flash then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
