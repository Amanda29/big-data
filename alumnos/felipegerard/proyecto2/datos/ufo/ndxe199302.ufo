2/26/93 05:00|New York City|NY|Light|1.5-2 seconds|Bright White High Speed Light over Newark New Jersey/New York Harbor/Staten Island Area|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65595.html|1|ndxe199302| Bright White High Speed Light over Newark New Jersey/New York Harbor/Staten Island Area<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed an event in the early part of 1993. I was in Manhattan, NYC, but the UFO(Light) flew over NJ and NY.  It was winter and around late February. I don’t have the exact date, although I called Newark Airport and also left a message at a UFO Reporting 1-800 number, when it happened, and I don’t know if this was NUFORC, but I haven’t seen a similar event on your site. I’ve decided to send my account just for the record although it’s 15.5 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this from my then 31st story window on West42nd at 10th Ave. Manhattan looking SSW down the Hudson River past what was the World Trade Center.  It was in the early morning hours at about 5AM. I was awake early studying for an exam. The morning light was just beginning to break (pre-sunrise) and the sky was overcast with a very high, thin layer of clouds. Visibility was good as I could see a few planes taking off and landing in the distance (11 miles) at Newark airport as per usual. Although the planes were like dots in the distance I could see their flashing lights and was very used to observing the speed and altitude, at which they flew, which by the way, appears to be very slow and very low from the 42nd St. vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was gazing out of the window I noticed a very bright white dash of light moving above the higher thin layer of clouds. It was shining through from above the clouds and came from the West near the area of the NJ/NY Statue of Liberty Harbor. It may have been further south at Newark airport, but was difficult to gauge at that high altitude.  Based on the distance and how quickly it traversed the sky from WEST to EAST (in about 1.5-2 seconds), I estimate it was traveling at the speed of about 10+ miles per second, as it shot EAST across the sky from Jersey, over Staten Island towards the Verrazano Bridge/Atlantic Ocean (an air distance of about 15+ miles) and disappeared out of my range of view. It’s also difficult to accurately estimate the length of this light sliver, because I was far away and I only saw a light and not an object. I’ve taken into account the possibility of window reflections, but since I saw the slight fluctuations in the shape of the light from behind the clouds, as it traveled above and across the thin cloud cover, I’ve eliminated that possibility. I am an artist and do pay close attention to these details. Also there were no light beams or spotlights visible from the ground below either, and as it was still somewhat dark, I think I would have noticed. I saw something out of the ordinary and unidentifiable, at least to my knowledge.  This was definitely not a commercial aircraft above the clouds as it was going way too fast and the light it emitted was so much brighter than anything I’ve ever seen from that distance. Anyway this is my report, given in as much detail as I can recall.  Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/25/93 23:30|Chico|CA|Triangle|20 seconds|Three silver/grey triangle crafts, at very high altitude, no sound, no lights. Chico Ca. 1992/93|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29485.html|2|ndxe199302| Three silver/grey triangle crafts, at very high altitude, no sound, no lights. Chico Ca. 1992/93<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending Chico State University in 1992/93. I was a Junior living on campus in Shasta Hall. I had just arrived at a party one cold night and did not really know many people there. I went outside to the backyard where I stood on a wooden deck. As I was looking up to the very clear, cold, and starlit sky; I saw a faint object out of the corner of my vision. As I looked up and towards my left I saw 3 grey/silver triangle objects exact in size flying in a line, one in front of the other. These objects had no sound, and no lights. They seemed to be in exact distance from each other.They also appeared to be very high in altitude My sighting lasted about 20 seconds before the crafts moved across the sky and then out of sight, behind a large oak tree. Something very strange happend as I was viewing these objects. Everything seemed to go silent as I watched them fly over me. As I remember everything went silent as I viewed them. After they moved out of sight all the party noise(music, laughing, people talking) returned in an instant. I was astonished! No one else had witnessed what I just saw. I felt amazed, confused and a little scared. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. Later that night as I walked home to my dorm I could not stop thinking about what I saw that night. When I got to my dorm, I went to my friend&#39;s room, woke her, and told her what I had witnessed. Since that night I have only told a few people about my expierience until now. I will remember that night for the rest of my life. I often still think about what I saw that night,  10 years ago. I have many questions, about this unique moment, I just don&#39;t know who has the real answeres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

2/15/93 01:30|Zimmerman|MN|Light|10 seconds|very long row of red lights above gravel pit horizon|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53399.html|6|ndxe199302| very long row of red lights above gravel pit horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t be very specific as it&#39;s been many years, however, somethings are ingrained in my memory.  Honestly, I&#39;m not really sure of the time of year, but it seems like it was winter, no cloud cover, clear night sky.  I was coming home from work as a bartender..no, I had not been drinking. I&#39;m guessing at the time, somewhere between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. as the bar closed at one, and I was usually out of the building by 1:30-1:45 headed south towards Elk River, which was where I was living at the time. There is a large gravel pit that I passed by each night on my way home, and this night, as I approached I saw, briefly, what looked like along the ridge at the top of the pit, was a line of red lights.  My first thought was that it was a line of semi trucks parked along the ridge. But what I saw was at least the entire length of the ridge of the pit, and I can&#39;t say now if it was one long light, or many lights, but whatever it was was just above the ridge, directly above treeline.  Then, it was gone, the row of lights just went down, below the ridge..at least that&#39;s how it seemed. No one end moved faster than the other, there was no angles..it just droped below the horizon of the ridge and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove by a few days later, daylight hours, to get an idea of what the ridge looked like during the day, if there was a road along the ridge, what, exactly was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no road along the ridge where the lights were.  There was a road that led to an area near the ridge, but nothing at the ridge.  To be fair, it was even difficult at the time to estimate the size, or length of what I saw that night, but going back to look at it in the daylight I&#39;d have to say bigger than a football field in length, much bigger.  I didn&#39;t see anything besides the lights..no shadows of any kind, nothing to indicate that there was anything but lights, although I know that&#39;s not likely.  Looking at the &#39;Characteristics of The object&#34; section in this web form, I will select &#39;There were lights in the object&#39; only because that&#39;s all I saw..I didn&#39;t actually see an object..just lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2/15/93|Mississippi (rural; location unspecified)|MS|Sphere|~5 minutes|squat spheroid ufo with fanlike underside structure and evenly spaced lights around equator of object|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48138.html|7|ndxe199302| squat spheroid ufo with fanlike underside structure and evenly spaced lights around equator of object<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving through Mississippi on a two lane state road southbound. It was late at night...I don&#39;t know how late...but probably after midnight. The road was through a pine forest. We were travelling toward sea level and as a consequence the plane of the land ahead of us was visible for a few miles to the horizon (we could see the tops of the trees for a ways ahead due to the downward slow incline of the land). About near the horizon, I see this lighted object. I first think that it must be an airplane. This is for a good minute or two. As we approached it however, I realized that the object was not moving and that it was shaped like a squat spheroid and had lights evenly spaced around its equator. I then assumed that it must be a water tower. As we got closer it became apparent that the thing was hovering right on the left hand side of the road about 3-5 feet above the trees. It was no more than 30-50 feet away from the car at the closest point. The lights on it were bright white and were shining downward. I guess it must have been 30-50 feet in diameter. On the underside of the object, there was a fanlike rotor structure composed of many thin metallic looking fan blades. There were so many blades that you could not see a gap between them...but it my also have been that they were spinning too fast, so maybe there were fewer blades and it was more of an optical illusion do to the spinning. There was a slight fog around and above the trees, and the convection of the fan was sucking the fog into the object. I was filled with a very definitive fear and hightened anxiety like I have never felt before. I pointed at the object and could only say, &#34;look, a UFO!&#34; and kept driving. All 4 passengers in my car verified a short while later at a diner that we saw what we saw. I still know one of the people today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Please believe me, I know the following will sound crazy but I swear it this is the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the date because it was my daughter&#39;s first birthday, our guests had left and my husband was on the balcony/patio of our 3rd floor apartment.  I had changed and was about to exit the bedroom onto the balcony to join him and I noticed as I looked in the direction of the bay (west) a huge dramatic cloud formation and suddenly before I knew what was happening, I heard myself saying, “Look at that cloud, there is a UFO inside it.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both a little shocked to hear me say this, I do not know what possessed me, but sure enough no sooner had I said than the cloud parted and I just recall seeing it closer and there were I think like 6-sided lights all over it, in various colors, like green, red blue, blinking and changing colors.  I could not make out a shape to the “craft” as the oddest part was that it seemed to be cloaked or something, with different parts being exposed and concealed like a clocking cloud moving around it?!  Neither of us knew what to think – could not prcess what we were seeing other than it was extraordinary!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we must have said something like the aliens are here and with that my husband jumped up on the railing and hung on the roof eaves as it passed over our heads (!!!) and he shouted, “Take me!  I immediately shouted “Over my dead body!”  -  (which we joked about for years after!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved overhead it seemed HUGE like a football field or something but we never saw anything but these cloaked lights and that it was huge.  And silent, completely noiseless!  I knew to check time, had heard stories about missing time, we we did not miss time, but I do not recall how it disappeared maybe disappeared over roof to other side of bldg. out of sight, but then almost simultaneously, we noticed there were federal agents suddenly swarming on the apartment complex, battering down a door on a ground floor apartment (they had ATF on their shirts) and they carried out boxes of stuff and disappeared after an hour, or so, maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea if this was connected but it seemed awfully coincidental these 2 extraordinary events happening at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband died in a car crash 8 years ago, I wish we had told this earlier, but I wanted to record it in case anyone else has seen anything comparable.<n>

I was a triangled shape and had three yellow lights in each angle. It was moving at a great speed and it looked as it was moving parallel with our car. When the car turned to go south on Houston rd. the object just disappeared into the night sky without a trace. The object was about 9 and 1/2 feet on each angle. After I saw the object I was stunned and surprised. I did not tell anyone else in the car what I saw becuase i did not want to be ridiculed and taunted becauseI was young at the time. I believe what I saw was of un-earthly orgin because I have never seen anything like that before. I am also not the type of person to lie or make things up. I am a strait A student and am at the top of my class too. People always can trust me. I know what I saw and it is not made up!<n>

It didn&#39;t move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue &#34;sparkles&#34; dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting. Witnesses were myself, a high school library director, my husband, an industrial chemist, and my 15-yr-old son.<n>
2/9/93 02:00|Lake Stevens|WA|Egg|45 seconds|Multiple sightings of an egg-shaped craft.|2/20/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117394.html|11|ndxe199302| Multiple sightings of an egg-shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to submit separate reports, so that they sort by the date of occurrence.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi!  My name is ((name deleted)).  I Prefer people know my first name.  My UFO encounter consists not of one but 5 different encounters which I believe to be of the same or similar type craft.  I would like to share my story if I would be allowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first encounter was when I was 4 years old in Lake Stevens, Washington, in the year 1993. I do not remember the encounter but my mom does.  She, myself, my brother and grandma all witnessed a UFO that night around 10:00 pm at our house.  I was in the living room.  My mom said she looked out of the kitchen window because she noticed a bright light and she said it looked like two car headlights coming towards her, except in the sky above the treeline.  All of a sudden the house filled with blinding white light which lasted for a few seconds.  The power to the house flickered just before the light came.  She stepped onto the porch and she said she saw 1 bright ball of light roughly 200-250 feet in the air above our house.  According to her the size of the craft was at least 3 times the size of our house. It hovered motionless for about 10 seconds before taking off in the blink of an eye in a zigzag pattern.  North to south over the treeline.  It took but a second before it was gone.  The UFO did not make a sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel I must add that I had nightmares of 4-5 foot grey beings with big almond shaped eyes when I was around 3 or 4 years old doing things to me like operating or performing surgery on me. Long before I even knew what aliens were or what they looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second encounter that I had I was living in the same house and I was 6 years old. Around the same time as last time if my memory is correct, the house again filled with a brilliant blinding light which lasted  about 5 seconds.  I remember the light did not hurt my eyes but made visibility very bad.  I could however see my window next to my front door just fine and I ran towards the window to see what was up there and I saw a bright white oval or egg shaped craft just above my house at again around 200 feet in the air.  I would say the craft was at least twice the size of our house.  I wouldn&#39;t say the UFO was massive but was quite large in size.  I stepped onto my porch only to see it take off in a zigzag pattern at thousands of miles an hour or so it seemed. It was gone in the blink of an eye. A small detail I can add to that is that it seemed like it disappeared and reappeared about a 100 feet away every time and stopped for just a moment before taking off again. The event! occurred over the span of roughly 35-40 seconds.  Again, the event was soon followed by strange dreams of grey beings however being so young I didn&#39;t understand that they were not normal dreams. Still to this day I can remember every dream I had of those beings like it was yesterday.  They may be just dreams.  That&#39;s all I can say about them but strange quin-cadences nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My third encounter I will briefly explain because it is almost exactly the same as the previous two. I was living in the same house.  I was 7 years old in 1996. my house filled with light which lasted a few moments.  I stepped onto the porch immediately already knowing what it was.  I however did notice that the craft wasn&#39;t as bright as before and I noticed it was made out of a shiny, reflective metal.  It took off in a zigzag again and it was gone.  The power also flickered again just before the light struck like the previous two times and the UFO did not make a peep.  Me, my mom and grandma all saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth encounter was again in lake Stevens. I was 11 or 12. I can&#39;t remember however It was not at my house.  I was in the back seat of my moms Volvo. We were traveling on a trestle going from the city of Everett to Lake Stevens, Washington.  It&#39;s basically a long free way bridge.  We were near the end of the trestle coming to a large hill going into lake Stevens.  I Noticed to our left a large glowing ball of light traveling slowly towards us.  When I noticed it it was about 500 feet or more out and about 300-400 feet off the ground or more. All of a sudden it was upon us. Just a 100 feet or less above our car. It was matching our speed which was 50 miles an hour. It followed us for only a few seconds before it hit our car with a bright beam of light which filled our car with light but did not blind my mom who was driving. It did not hit any other cars near us with this light. At least not that I can remember.  My mom said WOW!, LOOK AT THAT DREW!. She actually pulled over. S! he asked me to grab the camera out of the back seat of the car but I struggled to get the case open for just a few moments before the craft which was still hovering over us distracted my attention and gave up and gave her the case. She never got the case open in time.  The craft actually started descending on us slowly as we were parked.  The craft hovered over our car for about 10 seconds before taking off to the right of us in a mind-boggling speed in a zig-zag pattern.  It traveled in that direction for about 2 seconds and got almost a mile away from us before shooting straight up into space.  It again didn&#39;t make a sound.  People had also parked on the side of the trestle next to us.  I didn&#39;t notice if anyone was  videotaping it but I remember my mom said for a moment she thought the craft was gonna land on us it got so close and one of the other onlookers had mentioned the same thing. The craft was egg-shaped except was a little more elongated than an egg. It was clearly ma! de out of a very reflective metal and when the craft was hover! ing abov e us the light seemed to dim but I could tell that the light was emanating from inside the craft. We could have probably fit 10  Volvo&#39;s in the craft and still had room to spare. I did not have any strange dreams before or after that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 5th encounter is the most profound thing that has ever happened to me, even still to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Oregon at the time. I was 15 years of age. I was living with my mom, brother and sister and my moms boyfriend at the time. The house resided on a large steep hill about 15 minutes out of town. The driveway up the hill took about 3 minutes to drive up. The house was primarily surrounded by thick forest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 2:00 A.M. I was sitting on my couch in my living room playing halo 2 on my x box 360 alone. My mom was in her room on her PC and her boyfriend was up late working downstairs in the basement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden my x box and TV shut off. The power remained going to the rest of my house. It was just my x box and TV that shut off. For a moment I was confused and angry but for just a moment because immediately after that I noticed a bright light through my window to my left just above my couch. I then peeled the curtain back and saw a bright ball of light just outside my window. It didn&#39;t immediately click in my head what it was but just a moment after I peeled the curtain back the house filled with a brilliant white light. The light this time was so bright that I could not see my hands when I held them in front of my face. The light lasted for about 15 seconds. As soon as I saw the craft I screamed out”MOM THE UFO IS BACK” and started running to her room and then the light hit the house. I froze. I could not see anything but light. I yelled out”MOM,The house is filled with light! “Can u see” I asked and she said no. I then realized that the windows were still visible! . Everything in the house was white except my windows. So I walked towards the window and as soon as I got to the window and peeked through it the light stopped, so I stepped out onto my back patio. What I then saw after that I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a glowing metal craft. It was again the same shape as before. Light was strobing through the craft in all colors of the spectrum. Like what oil would look like with sunlight reflecting off of it. It appeared almost as if the light was some sort of force-field around it. The craft remained metal in appearance however the light pulsing through it was also notable. The craft was easily 3 times the size of our house or at least it appeared to be fairly large.  About half the length of a football field or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just hovered there above our back patio for about 20 or so seconds. My moms boyfriend had stepped out onto the patio with us for a moment before he ran back inside to get the camera. My mom had turned her head for just a moment to yell out” hurry up or your going to miss out”. During that time I my eyes remained fixed on the object. As the craft hovered there, I witnessed a window open up. A part of the craft had become completely transparent. The “window” quickly moved from the right side of the craft to the left before the window went away and the craft became solid again. What I saw during that short period of time, or what I thought I saw were a dozen or more white or grey skinned beings with arms all held out like they were holding hands and were all looking right at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then flew up 50 or so feet slowly and then took off at light speed and I&#39;ll explain why I use the term “light speed”. The craft traveled in a zig zag pattern like before. Except this time when it moved, it left images of itself behind following all the way back to its original position. I&#39;ll try my best to explain this. The craft would disappear and then immediately reappear a few hundred or so feet away leaving behind hundreds of translucent mirror images of itself. and when it reappeared the craft would then catch up with itself. Like the main bad guy from the movie,chronicles of riddick. How the guy could seemingly jump out of his body,travel a little ways and then his body would then catch up with his ...soul or whatever. My apologies for the bad analogy but I find it very hard to describe what I saw. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life nor have I heard of anything like that before.  What I saw that craft do didn&#39;t just defy physics, it defied reality.! The craft seemed to move almost as if the light couldn&#39;t keep up with it. In my opinion anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My moms boyfriend made it out with the camera but by time he got the camera turned on the craft was already gone. The light the UFO emitted into the house filled every room in our 3 story house. The door to my moms room was closed and her window drapes were down and yet her room became filled with the light too. My moms boyfriend that was working in the basement at the time had no possible means of light to get in there. Basement stairs were shut, there were no windows and the only light that should have been in the basement should have been from his lamp however the basement too became filled with this bright light. Don&#39;t ask me how but that&#39;s what he said to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also another detail to add to this strange event is my x box. I was playing my game before this event took place and my TV and x box shut off on me. Well, when I got back into the living room I noticed my box and TV were on and not only that but my progress had remained in the game. I even died and re-spawned somehow during the x box being” turned off”. I find it funny though because in halo, you play as a space marine guy who kills aliens.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t a game they found amusing.  I don&#39;t know.   Before I end this story I must add that a few weeks after that event I had a very weird dream. Several actually but one  in particular  worth noting(in my opinion). In my dream I woke up and walked into my living room. My living room was pitch black however a bright light was shining through the windows behind me. And in the corner of my living room the light had shined on something. I stepped a little closer to see what it was and it moved slowly into the light. It was a 4 to ! 5 foot being with a elongated skull and big almond-shaped eyes. It was wearing a silver or metallic-looking suit that was skin tight. It had one blue stripe running down its right arm and a white line around its waist almost like a belt or a seal you would see on a spacesuit except thin like a string. It also had a blue patch on the middle of its chest with a weird symbol on it. I distinctly remember having an overwhelming feeling rush over me. The emotion was love. I felt like a heart-warming sensation come over me and I suddenly got the feeling like this being was very happy or it was very happy to see me. No fear came over me. Just an overwhelming feeling that I remember to this day. It also felt like this being was very fond of me. It just looked at me for a few moments and then I don&#39;t remember the rest of the dream and I woke up with my pants soaked. Not sure why. Maybe I sweat in my sleep. I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not claiming I was abducted by aliens. I&#39;m just noting strange quin-cadences. I have researched UFO&#39;s and witness testimony&#39;s and anything UFO related honestly and I have yet to hear of any case quite like mine. I&#39;m posting this to you all in hopes that someone else will read this and post they&#39;re story like mine. Perhaps I&#39;m not the only one with these specific kinds of experiences. I know I&#39;m supposed to only submit one UFO sighting at a time but I didn&#39;t have a sighting to report, I had a story to tell. my apologies for the lack of visual evidence. I carry my camera on me at all times at the ready now, just in case.<n>
2/6/93 21:55|Meadowdale|WA|Sphere|4-5minutes|Hundreds of spheres moving West to East.|5/2/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28577.html|12|ndxe199302| Hundreds of spheres moving West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out walking on a secluded beach between Mukilteo and Edmonds, Washington State. Late in the evening as I some times do. On this night I was admiring the full moon which was almost straight up a little south and a little east.  There was a few fluffy small clouds out and as I was looking at the moon one formed a tunnel around the moon.  I was thinking that this was really cool looking and watched this for a while as there was little wind and the formation stayed that way for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while I started to look around at the stars in the sky, looking for the familiar formations like &#34;The Big Dipper&#34;, &#34;Orion&#34;, &#34;Cassiopeia&#34;, and such. I caught a glimpse of what at first I thought was a satellite. I then noticed that there was more than one point of light. I was looking to the north and just slightly to the west. What I witnessed was astounding as there was at least a couple of hundred points of light moving  across the sky in a row a bout 30 or so wide and 75 to 80 long. When I say long I mean they were moving from the west to the east and lined up north/south. As they moved I noticed that as a row move forward the ones in front would stop then the next row would pass the front row and become the row in front. Then after it moved about 10 widths of their selves(the points of light)they would stop and the next row would follow in the same fashion. Then when a row that had stopped was behind all the rest it would start moving again until it was in the front of the procession. Then it would stop again. This gave the whole cloud of objects the look of a sparkling translucent tube rolling through the heavens. When I say that the sphere were lined up, I want to be clear here, that they were not organized straight lines. It was more like a heard of animals like cows moving a cross a field of grass. the ones in front stop to eat and the rest move pasted and as they get to the front they stop to eat the fresh grass. Then as the heard moves along the ones that were in front that stop to eat are passed the start moving to keep up with the heard. Anyway the hill finally blocked the view after about 4 or five minutes. It was cool but I thought no one would believe me, or care about little light, and they where not even fly saucers. But I recently viewed &#34;The Secret NASA Tapes&#34;,&#34;The Smoking Gun Evidence.&#34; and thought hey that’s what I saw only years before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  He describes himself as someone with considerable technical training and experience.  PD))<n>

There are 6 manned towers. The 6 officers, including myself, passed the time by talking via 49mhz radio. Toward the east, someone&#39;s attention was caught by a very bright light a few feet above the horizon. It looked like landing lights on the front of a 747 heading toward us. A few remarks were made and subject was changed. Apx 15mins later one of the guys mentioned that the lights were still there but were closer. We commented on how it should have been way gone by now (since we believed it to be a commercial jet.) We watched it for another 15 mins and could see that it was moving very slowly, like a helo. The night sky was crystal clear and moon-less. No city lights or anything to dim the view at the sky. The craft got close enough that we could see 5 lights, each one as if on the corner of a pentagon. The craft came directly overhead, no sound at all. We thought it possible to be 5 helos in formation, but found it wierd that we did not hear them. When it passed over, we saw it to be one craft. We could not see anything between the lights and did not realize it was a single craft until it blocked the view of stars as it passed over. We could not tell how high it was but agreed that it was as large as a jumbo jet and flying at an altitude that private planes usually fly. We watched for another 20-30 mins until it was out of view. The the lights on the rear of the craft looked exactly like the front. Bright white lights. No flashing lights. No exhaust. No sound. We had quite a topic for discussion for a while after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Don&#39;t remember the exact time but it was early twilight so probably between 6 and 6:30 PM(?),<n> <n><n> <n><n> the sun was below the horizon, no glare remaining, just a gradated deepening evening blue.  We were heading west on Ponce De Leon toward Midtown and I was a passenger in the car, front seat.  I was not on any medication, nor had I had any alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright white light appearing to hover near a Midtown skyscraper eventually caught my attention, about a mile distant.  Don&#39;t remember the light&#39;s  approximate elevation as far as stories go but it was to the right (north) of the skyscraper, several stories lower than the skyscraper&#39;s height but above any other buildings in the vicinity.  We were on a hill going toward Midtown and I was looking pretty much straight ahead at the light, not having to peer up into the sky.  I watched the light without thinking anything about it, then began to think about it and imagined it was the bright beam of a helicopter.  As I watched it struck me that it wasn&#39;t appearing to move.  By now I was curious because you expect the beam of a helicopter to waver as the vehicle moves and to grow brighter as it progresses, and imagining it a helicopter I had begun to watch for this as it hadn&#39;t happened yet.  I was still expecting it to be a helicopter, and so had  mentioned nothing to the driver  about it, when suddenly the light ascended at an incredible rate of speed into the sky, to the north, at about a 45 to 55 degree angle. Before you could snap your fingers it was gone, that fast, from what seemed an absolutely stationary position in the sky.  No trail.  No sound. There appeared to be no acceleration.    The amount of time I spent watching the light before it zipped off may have been as little as 30 seconds, probably no longer than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2/1/93 03:30|Randolph|NJ|Flash|3 sec's|A STRANGE DARK BLUE HEAVY DENCE FLASH, my lungs felt very warm and I became light headed and my face was flush|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20544.html|16|ndxe199302| A STRANGE DARK BLUE HEAVY DENCE FLASH, my lungs felt very warm and I became light headed and my face was flush<n> <n><n> <n><n> A STRANGE DARK BLUE HEAVY DENCE FLASH!!!!!! I was trying to make extra money on one snowy season by shoveling sidewalks and mailboxes while my brother was plowing driveways. The snow was coming down heavy with low visibility and it was very cold night with wet shoes and pants, I was shoveling for approx. 4 hours around 3:30 am (&#34;I was not tired or was I drinking&#34;)It seemed that the clouds were low with 2 feet of snow and it was very, very quite in this area of this middle class neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what the elevation is up in Randolph NJ but the area is wooded and hills. As I was shoveling a Dark Blue flash emitted from the sky (not a beam or a laser type, no rolling thunder, rain, or lighting.) Just a surrounding Dark Blue heavy dence flash. I was standing and bending over. The best I can describe it seem to lit the whole area. As far that I can tell and trying to remember it lasted approx. 3 sec&#39;s. Now I felt startled, and a signigifiant change in temperture. It felt that my heart has stopped. (more like a scared feeling) I felt a warm feeling and I started to cough,(coughing fit lasted for approx. 5-10 Minutes.) I remember then my area of inside my lungs felt very warm and I became light headed and my face was flush(lasted about 4 minutes.) I&#39;m not saying it was a UFO or whatever! But It scared the day lights out of me, and my brother saw it too but he was in the truck. He did not experience what I have felt. I can&#39;t explain it.<n>
