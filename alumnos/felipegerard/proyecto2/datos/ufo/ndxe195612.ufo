12/1/56 23:00|Columbus|OH|Formation|3-4 minutes|A "V"  shape set of lights either on one large, silent aircraft, or 5 different aircraft flying in formation. No noise heard.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98356.html|1|ndxe195612| A &#34;V&#34;  shape set of lights either on one large, silent aircraft, or 5 different aircraft flying in formation.  No noise heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were crossing a field on our way home in the winter of 1958.  ((sic.  1955-1957.  Please see addendum below.))  There was a thin layer of low clouds that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something in the sky caught our attention.  We looked up and saw about 5 lights above the cloud layer in a &#34;V&#34; shape flying south to north.  I thought they must have been military aircraft flying exceptionally high since we could not hear any noise, but the lights seemed to be just above the cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see the glow of the lights through the cloud layer.  They were all white lights.  I thought it was probably military aircraft for about 55 years until I recently watched a UFO program on one of the cable channels.  They showed a few amateur photos and artist&#39;s renditions of what many people have seen in central Ohio for years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw that night was similar to what many folks in Ohio reportedly have been seeing for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1958 is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to add an addendum to my last report.  After I sent the last report, I thought hard about the sighting.  I concluded that we saw the lights between 1955-1957.  Also, there could have been 7 lights shaped in a &#34;V&#34; or just 5 lights.  I also remember thinking it was one of the air force&#39;s old flying-wing aircraft.  But I was really puzzled that it made absolutely no sound.  If it was an air force aircraft, the lights were low enough that it should have definitely made an noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
