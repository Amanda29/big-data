We were in the area of upson st. and the traffic was stopped.  when i looked out of the window i saw alot of people standding in the litchfield farms parking lot looking up in the sky; when i looked up i saw an immense object, i couldn&#39;t see the beginning or end of it.  it was black and if i remember had red lights on the bottom of it, mabie it had other lights too but this thing appeared to be very dense and although i didn&#39;t hear any noise i recall a vibration.  my friend was afraid so we contiued toward waterbury as we went up wollcott mountain in the area of central high school i looked back and could see this thing from above and it covered the west end of town it was as big as a mall.  once we got to waterbury and met our friends i told them what had happened.  the next part is hard to explain but we were riding around the block and the same events would repeat themselves (ex. the same car would pull out in the same spot, the same man with a suitcase would cross at the same red light) i think we rode around the block 3 or 4 times before someone else took the wheel and broke this pattern.  if anyone else saw this thing or had anything unusual happen to them at this time i would really like to know about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was coming toward the pool when I noticed 3 lights above the pool that didn&#39;t look familiar to me.  I figured that when I got closer I would be able to see what they were.  As I kept getting closer they started moving off to the right.  I noticed that there were a lot of dogs barking very wildly at the time.  As it went off to the right it also began coming in my direction.  At this point all I saw were 3 lights because it was so dark out.  I started to walk into a field off to my right in order to get closer to it and it began to go off to tward me.  It was very low in the sky and I could see it lean toward me.  I was no more than about 200 feet from it.  As it leaned toward me I could see a disc schilloette(sp) around it.  I then got scared and stopped in my tracks.  It then slowly went back away from me and floated out of sight.  I went to the house of a girl I knew in the neighborhood and told her about the incident.  She said that about the same time their german shepard dog started barking very wildly for no apparent reason.  At the time I had been reading some UFO books and remembered that many times when a UFO was present, dogs would start barking wildly, possibly due to some ultra sound that humans could not hear and dogs could.<n>

I still don&#39;t know why but we were stopped on a main road.  When someone noticed a very large disc shaped object hovering just above the trees, directly above us.  I was in the rear of the van where there are no seats so I opened the rear door of the van and simply got out and looked straight up at the object.  It was at least two football feilds wide, completely round, it was motionless, with bright multi-colored lights that ran around the rim of the craft.  The other kids in the van with me got out and were staring at it along with me.  We could not believe what we were seeing.  The adult that was driving the van was yelling continuously &#34;get back in the van.&#34;  Because we were on a main road with traffic in front and behind us.  I noticed some of the other drivers were also out of their vehicles looking at this object.  The only thing I can compare it to, is the mothership in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  What is really weird is when we got back to the school no one spoke of what we had just seen.  It is as if it never happened.  To this day I have no memory of any of us ever getting back into the van.  My only memory is of just being back at the school that night.  I will never forget that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was visiting a friend, {I could probably now locate} in Lago Vista, Tx. His father sold land at this resort community on lake Travis near Austin, Tx. We had gone to visit a couple of permanent residents They were brothers about our age. We stepped outside, &amp; I forget who first noticed. But maybe looking toward the East at approx. 75 to 85 degrees from horizon, we saw 15 to 25 objects at first star like in appearance, also seemed to be at the same distance to us as the stars. Upon closer examination these objects were moving, side to side{appox, 40 degrees either way} &amp; up and down. Their movement seemed nice &amp; fluid sometimes in a flying wing then changing direction &amp; slowly fitting back into a flying wing. They did not seem to be flying very fast but if our perceptions of distance were anywhere near accurate they had to be going astronomically fast. Their changing directions often, yet staying in a certain grid seemed to make no sense either. One of the brothers went in to get their parents, they came out &amp; watched with us, and to the best of my recollection we all described seeing the same thing. I think one of the parents went in to call some sort of authority. We watched for quite a while 30 minutes maybe more, honestly do not remember if they stopped or we went on to something else as this was very strange, but not threatening in anyway. I did not keep track of the Brothers or their parents, but their parent were solid middle class or better judging by their house and area of residence. I have told very few people about this maybe a few ex-wives, but I did run into that old friend about 10 years ago. Seems like his car had broke down or maybe mine but we spent some time together. &amp; we did after a bit of time sort of go over this incident we shared, He also said he had not told to many people. I am just now reporting this as before a day or 2 ago had no idea who to report to. Hope this helps in your research, also hope someday I find out what it was.<n>

We were all college students at the time. I happened to look up outside the car window and noticed a huge black &#34;boomerang&#34; shaped object slowly gliding across the sky. It was directly overhead. It had several lights spaced out along its leading edge. There was no sound from the object at all. I would estimate that it&#39;s height above ground was about 1000 feet. I excitedly pointed out this observance to my friends in the car and they also saw it. It was headed in a general direction from west to east. The drive-in was located about 7-8 miles east of the Albany International Airport, about 2 miles south of the U.S. Army&#39;s Watervliet Arsenal, and 1 mile north of Albany.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident happened 35 years ago so the exact date is not known.

10/7/71 01:00|Kitchener (Canada)|ON|Disk|45 min|A very bright , horizontal elliptical disk aprox. the length of a yardstick held at arms length, hovered one hundred feet  away.|7/13/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44811.html|10|ndxe197110| A very bright , horizontal elliptical disk aprox. the length of a yardstick held at arms length, hovered one hundred feet  away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I describe the sighting, I would like to say this is my first public acknowledgement of what I have seen and I do so out of frustration with the smarmy attitude our governments have about the subject of UFOs and to encourage others who have experienced the same to speak out loudly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading the &#39;CANADIAN,TEXAS,JANUARY 15, 1993 STATE TROOPERS&#39; report, I was struck by his sense of awe and resignation to the fact that his reality had just been assaulted with the blunt force of indisputable, emperical evidence that we are not alone. This is a feeling that is shared by millions of human beings around the world, including myself, who do not place a &#39;belief&#39; in UFOs on a wish and a prayer or some peculiar fuzzy lights in the sky; but on heart stopping, nerve stunning, in-your-face, up-close and personal &#39;I am HERE, I am BIG and you are very, very small&#39; close encounters with these things. And I&#39;m madder&#39;n hell that this situation goes on every day without any advisement from our so called &#39;by the people for the people&#39; governments whose biggest fear next to real democracy is that we find out in fact they do not nor ever had a clue about what these things are or where they come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS when these things appear, do we greet them with a smile and a handshake or should we run like hell away from them! I think our governments know at least as much to describe the various objects, tell us what the present state of affairs is concerning UFOs, and what is the nature of the contact environment for human interaction with each type; so we can at least act neighborly without putting ourselves into harms way. If these things are dangerous and out to get us, can we pop off a few rounds when they get into our crosshairs?  I think it&#39;s time humanity had a million-man-march on capitols around the world to force the truth out from between those lying teeth of politicians responsible for holding back the truth. This is a new millenium and it&#39;s time for a new world order alright but not the stilted, contrived, patrician &#39;we know better than you&#39; models we now have. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of doing things went out with the buggy whips that remained in the last century; and are as bizarre and artificial as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that cry out for answers and change in our society, that require a different attitude from human behaviour away from competition and greed. The UFO issue may hold a very significant dimension to the problems our world faces today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For starters, who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? I have had three unforgetable events involving UFOs and I will describe them in three separate reports dated; Oct.07, 1971 - Nov.15, 1987 - March 12, 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On approximately October 7, 1971 at 1 AM my wife and I were travelling south east on county road #17 just past Conestoga and approaching Kitchener, Ontario(Canada) city limits. It was a clear moonless night but when we saw a peculiar object hovering above the treetops to our left about 1000 feet away, we considered it to be an interesting effect the moon was causing, reflecting off the top of a silo to look like a flying saucer. As we proceeded along the road I continued to glance over my shoulder expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However I discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape, it was getting bigger and brighter.I craned my neck this way and that looking for the moon that I thought might be causing this but didn&#39;t find it. I asked my wife to look out her side of the car to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! When I asked her to look over her left shoulder and describe what she saw across the field she confirmed, it was a disk shape and bright as moonlight. I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the doorknob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was our movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of science fiction and peculiar stories from history books. I never put much credence in the few current reports I had read and didn&#39;t really know what to think about them, the jury was still out. So I got out of my car and stood very still, bracing myself against it to to be sure of my bearing. Well the disk kept moving very slowly from a WNW direction skirting the top of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now  its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me it needed closer inspection. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away where I expected to come as close as I could, considering its trajectory and speed, and the distance I would have to cover in the time I had before it would pass us. This involved a possible encounter with a barnyard dog, in the dark, because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incident, over a fence then into the field which was fallow with weeds and short scrub. I ran towards the predetermined point in the field ahead, keeping my eyes on the prize and soon realised it had changed course and was coming towards me. Our paths met quicker  than I expectd and was caught by surprise. Now looking due north, my head canted way back so sharply as to cause me to realise this thing was REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop NOW. It was as long as a yardstick held horizontaly in your hand at arms length. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground  and one hundred feet away from me. &#34;Come on down here and talk to me!&#34; I shouted up to it. It just hovered there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sound. Just a horizontal, elliptical disk shining like the moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights moving up the highway about a mile away so I ran back to the road, flagged the car down, pointed to the UFO and said &#34;Look!&#34; At that moment it went from five inches across at arms length, moved up and away to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible flyins or radar evidence. Nothing was reported that night. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me of encounters they had that were very similar to ours. My wife and I are not sure if there was any time loss but I do recall her remaining in the car terrified. She on the other hand recalls getting out of the car, this being our only point of disagreement with the whole incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After a night class my buddy and I went for a walk around the block and on the way back we stopped walking, I don&#39;t know why we stopped walking and was confused because we wanted to get back to the dorm. I looked at my friend and he looked at me and I said well lets go, and he said ok lets go, and we just kinda walked around in a circle and once again I said lets go and he said ok lets go but we couldn&#39;t go!  it was really wierd, we were seemingly stuck in a 8 ft circle of side walk and we were very suprised, now we were two big guys I an ex hockey player and my buddy a football player, believe me we could run through a freaking brick wall but we couldnt walk on and then at the EXACT SAME INSTANT (like we were allowed to now see) we both got scared and felt the hair stand on end and looked up across the street above a 3rd story bank building at a perfect flying saucer, it was white on top and the bottom was red &amp; blue  I estimate the size to be a 150 ft in length and it was close enough if I had a rock I could have hit it. No noise. It just hung there and then zig zagged away &amp; going straight up faster than anything human can.  Now, we can walk and now could HEAR...cars going by in the street and right next to us was a shopping center and could hear the shoppers rolling their carts to their cars etc.  all this time we were in like a cone of silence and didn&#39;t even notice it till the sounds came at us  again.  We both deceided right then and there not to tell anyone but when we got back to the dorm which was on top of a small hill overlooking the bank building we went into the top floor where students would congreate and guess what everybody was talking about the flying saucer they saw, we still kept our mouths shut though, but I dont know why, I feel that I was kinda asahamed at my powerless position.  and ny buddy and I would never talk about it.  No drugs No drink.  Just studies (Tough engineering college in Pasadena!)  I swear its true and when! I ever hear stories about people being abducted by aliens I know what it feels like to be powerless and I didn&#39;t freaking like it one bit and I&#39;m really PISSED OFF still about this whole incident 35 years later!!?  What am I a freaking bug being looked at and controlled?  No other incidents to report.  Glad to get this off my chest finally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
