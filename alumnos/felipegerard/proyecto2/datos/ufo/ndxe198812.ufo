We were traveling on a paved road which for the most part was free of traffic. We passed maybe one car before the incident. The night sky was clear of clouds and spotted with stars. I do not recall the moon cycle at the time, but I believe it was a sliver. It all began when we were just having a conversation about the evenings visit and dinner. I was just admiring the stars out the mini vans window when I noticed something catch my eye. It was postioned to my right of the vehicle in the sky. The object was spherical and a deep blue color. At first I thought it was a plane light but i&#39;d never seen a plane light that dark before. I quickly told my dad who glanced over as did the whole family. The object remained almost even with our vehicle. In this I mean it never traveled out of our line of sight. My dad slowed a little and my mom put down her window to make sure it wasnt a relection. After viewing the object for a couple of minutes it was my mother who stated that she something on the drivers side of the vehicle this time. In the night sky on the opposite sid eof the road was a similar object but this one was dark red. The light from these vehicles didnt pulse, didnt blink, but were constant the whole time. It was at this time that I felt a sense of awe and unbelief. Both objects kept up the same distance and speed with each other. It appeared that each was just smoothly traveling as we were. After taking in both objects, for some reason I leaned forward to look up higher and was stuned by what I saw. I pointed out an off white spherical shape positioned above the road. This would put the lights in a triangular formation. After watching them for about 3 minutes the red and blue lights lifted even with the white light. The two outside lights began to draw in towards the white light and they appeared to change position on the opposite side of the road. After this the lights then d! rew closer so they were almost side by side. They then increased thier traveling speed and quickly flew off into the night sky. It was also at that time that we came into an area with a large number of trees that obscured the objects departure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

After the incident my watch was 15 minutes slow, I had 1:16 and they had 1:31 and they were both ahead of me on the side of the road,having pulled off to decide what to do. The very big african american guy who drove for ((deleted)) Truck Lines, began screaming and crying and he left in a hurry. But myself and the ((deleted)) Transportation driver talked about it for awhile, we saw no craft, remember no aliens per say, I remembered a few years later that there were owls in the road.(?)I apparently became a different person, got divorced. I have new memories. How can they make a whole truck disappear? Where did I go? Why was our watches different? I checked, the ones in the truck were slow 15 minutes too!his trucks clock was 15 fast as was the Wiley driver. 15 minutes were lost, that is sure, but how could the whole truck be gone? I am doubting that there were owls, I don&#39;t understand. Something happened to me then, I can speak spanish, I never took one class in spanish in my life, so help me GOD! I don&#39;t know any spanish speaking people.I would like some answers please, it has been 11 years, and still that day effects my life. I can&#39;t remember much about the owls, I can&#39;t understand how come I remember all those owls, I wanted to talk to them , I was thinking that they were beautiful owls, they were brown, big owls. I get irritated when I think about this, and I cannot stop that from happening, I have tried. I want to understand what happened, I know that I will not find out what happened to me, but I think that you can help me<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving Mexico with a load of Brocholli and I had waited all day to get shaved ice blown into the trailor in Nogalas, NM. I went north to I-10 and began the easterly trek. I was stopped at the exit scale in Texas, as I had run out of hours and was forced to shut-down for 8 hours, it was 3:20 or so PM, I logged that I left the scale at 3:15 on 12/22/88, and went east toward Wilmington, N.C.I stopped at a truckstop and took a shower, and ate. In the dinner I met two other drivers that were headed east, and wanting to get home for chistmas in S.C., we could help each other. We left the Truck stop and about an hour later the ((deleted)) drivers had to switch so in that I was in the rear, when they stopped, I passed them and became the middle truck, as the 1st one, Z((deleted)) Transportation truck, kept going. I was about a half mile behind the first truck and by the time the one that stopped got going we had slowed down  to about 30 miles an hour, waiting. Zero went over a hill in front of me and instantaniously , I heard them both holering for me on the radio, &#34;where are you?&#34; &#34;where are you?&#34; I said that I was right here and then found out that they were both ahead of me on the side of the road, and I pulled over when I got to them. They said that it had been 30 minutes since I last talked, and it had been only a minute or so. I looked at my watch and said that it was 1:16 and they said that it was 1:31 and we checked my truck, which was the same as my watch, and we checked both of their watches and the clocks in their trucks and they were the same and then the Big guy starts crying and runs off and the other driver and I were talking about it for awhile, and we left and then things started to happen to me, all bad. I got divorced, went to jail for a week had to leave my friends and just bad stuff. Until I had a vasectomy, and then I got my life back, no more problems, new house, new career, great family. Can you shed some light on this? I know I can&#39;t find out what happened exactly, but I am hoping tha! t you ca n help me fill in the numerous blanks. thank you. ((name deleted))<n>

At the time of the sighting, I was a California Highway Patrol Officer for 6 years and very good at detail and observation.  A friens and I were driving fron San Jose, CA. to Mazatlan, Mexico over Christmas holidays in Dec. 1988.  It was approximately 3:55 a.m. when my friend kept insisting that I look out the driver&#39;s window (he was driving, I was in the passenger&#39;s seat).  I was busy talking and kept ignoring his request.  Finally, just to shut him up, I looked out his window.  What I saw made me scream in excitement, not fear.  I told him to immediately pull off the road so I could have a better look.  I sat on the hood of the car for the next 2 hours writing down my observations.  We thought, at first, that what we were looking at was a freak act of nature where a star was unusually close to the earth.  It looked like a partical star at first except that it was 3/4 the size of the full moon that was out that night.  Also, when we were driving, my friend told me that this object he was looking at did not seem to be left in the distance as we were driving, but rather keeping parallel to us.  It was hugh!  If the stars in the sky could be compared to a golf ball, this ufo was the size of a  over-sized basketball!  At first, it was just this white light being eminated from it&#39;s center.  There was no solidness to it, just lights being refracted.  The &#34;star&#34;  slowly floated in several directions ( I wrote it all down as to it&#39;s positions) with no rhymm or reason.  Then it changed colors and a red light appeared in the center of this &#34;star&#34; horizontally and vertically (like a cross), in it&#39;s center.  It still continued to &#34;float&#34; from left to right and up and down.  The object continued to change color as the points of the light continued to grow and shrink with a blue color. (It looked like a starburst that was growing and shinking.  At this time, I still thought that it was some unusual astronomical  disturbances until this &#34;star&#34; suddenly &#34;ZOOMED&#34; in closer to us! .At this time, I became fearful and jumped into the car.  this &#34;star&#34; &#34;ZOMED back and forth without any visible  signs of movement!  My best analogy would be this,  it looked like the opening and closing of a camera lens, (like the aperature of a camera opening and closing.  It was as if this &#34;star&#34; &#34;Zoomed&#34; in on us to take a better look!  Ithe &#34;star&#34; continued to change colors from white with red, to white with red, to white with red and blue.  It contiued to slowly float in various directions and changing shapes.  As the sun was rising,  the other stars in the sky disappeared except for this one.  It was the only object in the sky as the sun rose.  The lights disappeared as the sun was rising and I expected the object to disappear.  Instead, a thin, long silver/gray line in the sky remained.  There was no longer lights, but rather a very bright or very big object remained.  As the sun was high in the sky, this &#34;star&#34; slowly drifted higher and higher into the sky until just a pinpoint was visible.  It slowly disappeared. As we arrived in Mazatlan, I quickly bought the newspapers to read of the incident.  No article was written re: a U.F.O that night.  THIS WAS NOT A WEATHER BALLOON OR ANY OTHER MILITARY OR GOVERNMENTAL EXPERIMENT.NOTHING ON THIS EARTH COULD POSSIBLY MOVE AND &#34;ZOOM&#34; AS THIS &#34;STAR DID!<n>

It was a clear night, no cloud cover. My middle brother and I were sittimg on the left hand side of the airplane just behind the wing area. I first noticed what appeared to be a rocket with a short fire trail coming from the left and from behind us. I immediately got my brother&#39;s attention and as the rocket got closer to us it became larger and the fire trail behind it grew longer. After watching this happen for about a minute the rocket was approaching towards us faster and faster. After watching this for 20 seconds we both got our father&#39;s attention who was sitting a few isles in front of us on the other side of the plane. He got out of his seat and came over and we showed him the rocket. He then called my mom, my youngest brother, and a family friend of ours to come over to our side of the plane and look out the window in order to see this object too. By the time they all got out of their seats and saw the object, approximately 45 seconds of time had elapsed since the beginning when I first saw it. By this time the rocket appeared much larger and was located just a hundred feet from the end of the wing. Instantaneously, the rocket fizzled out and changed shape into a &#34;typical flying saucer.&#34; The saucer remained just off the end of the wing tip and then several white lights appeared in the middle of the craft; they looked similar to small windows. The craft then expelled a bunch of white sparkling lights and fire trails (simliar to sparklers) and then emitted all kinds of different colored lights that flew in all directions. Then the craft  literally disinegrated before our eyes and vanished, but I should note that it streaked away from the airplane while it vanished. The whole sequence of events lasted over a minute. Furthermore, we immediately questioned the flight attendants about it and one or two of them said! they sa w the craft too. Shortly thereafter they inquired the pilots about the event. They told us that the pilots responded to them by saying that they had personally not seen the craft or the event, but that they were contact by 2 or 3 other commercial aircraft flying nearby who reported they saw an unidentified aircraft flying close to our airplane. They wanted to know what was going on. Our pilots said they never saw the object(s).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

On my left, I saw a large (1/2 football field) sized triangular object with solid white lights going along the side.  The object was motionless above the trees  beside the road.  There was no sound.  I pulled off onto the emergency lane and stopped.  Noted that perhaps 4-5 other cars had slowed/stopped also.  Kept watching this object until it just disappeared.  One moment, it was there and the next, it was gone.<n>

In the developing twilight, we missed a trail marker and had to finish our descent in the dark.  Fortunately, the weather station has a red beacon over it, so we were able to home in on it.  Less fortunate was that we had to hike over about a mile or two of what Hawaiians call &#34;ah ah,&#34; the very loose, jagged clinkly lava.  This required a great deal of effort on our parts as we held hands and snaked our way across the lava field towards the beacon at the weather station.  One of us would get a firm footing to support the other while the other would then move forward.  Not fast progress, but we were able to keep our feet for the most part. It was during one of our many rests that I noticed these little whitish lights dancing around Mauna Kea.  It was clear, beautiful night with a few small clouds around the summit of Mauna Kea and one very large cloud directly above the summit.  The moon had not yet risen. I was suffering a bit of altitude sickness and was wondering if these dancing lights around Mauna Kea were a manifestation of that.  After watching these lights dart about the top of the mountain across the island for a while, I turned to my wife who it turns out was watching them, too. We tried to figure out what they might be.  There is an observatory atop Mauna Kea and we thought the lights might be a reflection in the clouds of descending vehicle headlights.  That didn&#39;t make sense as the lights would zip and dart very fast not only across the face of the mountain, but beyond its extents as well.  Then the lights would just as suddenly stop and hover.  Vehicle lights would behave in a more consistant pattern. We wondered if they were some kind of laser projection as we could see occasional beams of light from the moving lights to the large cloud above the summit of Mauna Kea.  Since the beams would initiate at either the lights or in the cloud and then terminate at the other, not going beyond, we reasoned we were watching some type of transmission. We listened closely, as it is very quiet on a large mountain at night, and could detect no sound which ruled out helicopters.  We would have heard them loud and clear.  Besides, the lights could move much faster than I have ever seen any aircraft move.  They were a most unique phenomenon in that they would dart swiftly from place to place about the mountain and then hover. We continued our descent of Mauna Loa and would stop to watch the dancing lights when we took our rests for the next 3 - 4 hours.  At one point I suggested to my wife that we attempt to signal the craft to see if we could get a ride down to our car.  Needless to say, whe was not particularly enthusiastic about this idea, so we continued snaking our way down the mountain. When we arrived at our car at about 02:00, the lights were still there darting about and hovering.  We drove down the mountain to Hilo and fell exhaustedly into bed.  The next day we both got massages and related the story to our masseuses.  They both commented that many people have had strange sightings up on the mountain.<n>
