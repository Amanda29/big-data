11/15/66 19:40|Huntington Beach|CA|Circle|10 seconds|Ring of blue lights approx 200 in diameter slowly flying cross night sky at 500 feet in 1966|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88636.html|4|ndxe196611| Ring of blue lights approx 200 in diameter slowly flying cross night sky at 500 feet in 1966<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some background on me in 1966:  This happened in 1966 when I was 10 years old.  My father was a professional pilot and owns his own small plane so I grew up around aircraft and airports.  Also, nearby our home was a spot called Mile Square where the Marine pilots practiced in Helicopters prior to deployment to Vietnam so I can say I saw all kinds of Hellos daily.  Living in Southern California, Fountain Valley, if you didn’t see the Good Year Blimp at least once a week  It was only because you never look up.  I am now 55 and retired from a fulfilling career in aviation and have seen a lot of things but nothing like what I saw when I was 10 and I would like to share this long kept sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Event: It was early November 1966 a Friday night my parents are out to dinner and my big sister wants me to ride to the store with her, I check the time it’s 7:20 pm, I tell her sure but we need to be back in time for a TV show I want to watch at 8, ok.  We leave and arrive at  Savon Drug Store on Brookhurst and Adams in Huntington Bch. Ca.  As we are pulling into the parking area its dark out and they have one of these old WWII Spotlights with its own generator on a trailer sweeping the night sky back and forth.  My Sister parks the car 2 isles back from the front door and I start to sweat the time, it’s now 7:40 and my show starts at 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get out of the car and start to walk to the front door of Savon and for some reason I decide I want to turn around and see if the spot light is shining on anything and what I saw was nothing less than amazing!  just outside of the beam in the sky was this large circle of blue lights coming our way and very low and slow.  I jumped up and down and quote yelled “LOOK AT THAT THING, LOOK AT IT!”  I just could not believe I was actually seeing what I was seeing,  I glanced to my Sister and she was just walking away and a few other people maybe 7 of them nearby were just walking ahead looking straight forward, I yelled out again, now the lights were right beside me, I guess it was at about 500 feet altitude and about 200 feet across in size judging from how big the parking lot is and how low it was over it.  I was just at its port edge now as it slowly and quietly cruised by at what I estimated to be maybe 40mph. One last scream to the people and my sister “LOOK AT THIS THING!” and no one was in my area anyway now only me.  As it was passing beside me I heard this very low low continues metallic gong sound, it lasted about 5 seconds then the craft was gone from sight and weird now I could hear the spot light generator running again. My sister was waiting for me at the front door and I ran up to her and said did you see it? Di! d you look at it? and she said look at what?  I said the UFO li! ghts! ev erybody around was staring at us now and my sister promptly told me to quit embarrassing her. SO I hushed up at least until we got back into the car and then I gave her the full description of what a once in a lifetime sight she missed and it went like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of the Craft:  Now my view of the craft was from the ground looking up so I can only describe the bottom of it as it went by and it went by very slow maybe 40mph and altitude of approximately 500 feet  and the port edge was almost directly above me as it passed by from my right to left (or headed East). The craft was a round circle of evenly spaced blue lights; maybe 24 to 30 of them which made it look to be about 200 feet across in size. As it came closer I noticed 2 pairs of red lights 180 degrees across from each other slowly rotating just outside of the blue lights counter clockwise at maybe 30 rpm. I was looking hard to see or hear a helicopter or blimp that thing was hanging from but there wasn’t and it was completely stable. As it came directly in front of me it was only then that I could see there was a body to this thing, it was extremely hard to see even with the blue lights around it. The color was a charcoal black thinly streaked by a storm cloud gray color. The center/middle b! ottom came down in a concave arc maybe 20 feet across and possibly 20 feet lower than the blue lights on the edge.  At this point I was fascinated by the clarity and beauty of the blue lights, they were so bright yet they gave out no glow and projected no beam, they appeared to be behind faceted lenses.  Then there was the pair of 2 red lights rotating. They appeared to be on white colored very short winglets or tabs and were rotating just outside the blue lights and slightly higher and brighter. Other than color they were the same size and brilliance as the blue lights, I estimate the diameter of all the lights to be 2-3 feet.  Then as it came beside me there was the barely audible metallic gong sound humming and lasted till it disappeared from my sight beyond the roof tops.  And that is what I saw and heard as clear as clear is, it was a fascinating  sight that I can still visualize like it happen last week, must be true what is said about how some things can make a  lasting ! impressions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Confirmation! I will tell you that weekend around my family was not a highlight for me.  When I got up Saturday morning everyone had heard my story from my sister and were ready to have fun with me and did, all except my Dad, he just gave me a one eyebrow raised high expression when I told him about it. So I learned real quick this was a sighting that I would not share with many.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s now Monday and my sister comes home from her job around 5:20 pm.  She comes up to me with a serious look and tells me she heard something at work I might be interested in knowing? I feel a setup coming on but say sure!  She tells me her coworker told her of a story her Dad and Brother shared when they returned home late Sunday excited with this story of what they saw while they were out camping.  They describe the exact same thing I saw to a Tee! but my sister says that’s not the only interesting thing,  they were camping  in a remote area of the mountains that is located about 300 miles from where I was when I saw it, she said they had checked their time and they saw it at 7:50, 9 minutes after I saw it 300 miles away !   YES!  I did ask my sister if she was just trying to make me feel better and making this up.  She said absolutely not!  And for the next 45 years she never doubted this sighting again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hindsight from 45 years later:  I’m really amazed that this craft was able to cruse right over the most densely populated area of Southern California and it didn’t make headlines but it was very stealth.  The shape lends itself to electronic stealth, and if the blue lights were not on I never would have noticed it because the color blended into the night sky so well. I think the lights were on to facilitate some type scanning process.  Then the sound it made was very quiet and low pitch almost like the metallic body of the craft was resonating from giant magnets vibrating at a low frequency inside of it. And the fact that as this all was going on I remember everything else being so quite except for my yelling that I heard, I think it had a way of doing noise cancellation so most likely no one could have heard me yell. When it disappeared over the rooftop that is when I could hear the generator for the spot light running again and street traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting in November 1966 is approximate.

I<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying to McAllen, TX, from Houston a little after 22:00.  Weather completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object completely different from others drew my attention.It was oval in shape and yellowish in color.  It was at my altitude-7,500&#39;   It stood still in the air.   Not getting larger or smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eased my nose slightly to the right to line him up to see better for a min.  He made a square turn to my left and stopped again.  I lined him up again.  Same thing again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three times this happened.  He didn&#39;t like me in his face even a little bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was perhaps 2 maybe 3 miles in front of me.  Always making square turns.  And standing perfectly still in the air.  At the end of the 4th maneuver he indicated that he was growing weary of this tag and go seek and he departed to the southeast at an angle of close to 70 to 80 degrees (very near straight up but not quite) and was gone out of sight in less than THREE SECONDS!  Straight line-no curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were NO clouds in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before or since.  And I don&#39;t care if you believe it or not.  I know what I saw.<n>

I was staring at the constellation Cassiopeia and then turned my attention behind me, to the south west, where a very bright star was...maybe Jupiter, not sure. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving from right to left..which would have been exactly in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, automatically i tried to see what it was and soon found a black, boomerang shaped object moving, very steadily across the sky. It had no lights and no visible features and disappeared out of sight, in a very weird kind of fading manner. It is like it flickered out. It was completely silent. The size is very hard to estimate. Since it was black I could not judge the distance or the size. My BEST estimate would be about the length of a football field from end to end. It was moving very straight. My best guess is that it would have been flying directly over the St Johns River, right on the eastern shore, moving southward. Im a few locks from the river, on University blvd W., between San Jose blvd and Powers avenue. A few days later, I went online to see if anything had ever been talked about. I googled &#34;boomerang ufo&#34; and got scared with what I found. This is EXACTLY what it looked like, except it was night time and much darker. The other thing, the most significant was this website: www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm I imagine it is a coincidence that I was staring at Cassiopaea just prior to this since I stare at constellations all the time and it was the only one visible in that direction at that time of night due to the trees on that side of my yard. But...it strikes me as odd, that I REMEMBER having been staring at that specific constellation and secondly of course, that the only time in my life I have ever seen anything like this (a UFO) was immediately upon turning away from looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, if you can, read what that website says about contact from the constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been agnostic but open to these things. I am a sane, normal, everyday person that never ever thought it would happen to me...as the story goes..as Ive heard people say. If you have questions, I would be happy to answer them. I could go on about the psychological nature of the experience, which in itself, was unique, but I will leave that open if you wish to ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im very glad this is possible to share. This is now a very real thing to me and my desire is great to see us learning what is happening.   here is a link to the page and it is the image top center - www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm<n>

I  was  with  a  freind  and  we  were  on  our  war  to  the  nearby  Mobil  gas  station  to  make  calls  to  our  girl  freinds.   There  was  only one  phone  in  the  house  those  days  and  it  was  centrally  located  where  everyone  could  hear  my  calls.    I  live  only  about  15  miles  from  Kennedy  Airport  (then  Idelwild  Airport).    It  was  not  unusual  to  hear  jets  flying  over.    While  walking  i  heard  what  i  thought  was  a  jet.   When  we  looked  up,  we  saw  what  appeared  to  be  a  group  of  stars.   They  were  identicle  to  stars.   There  was  approximately  15  to  20  of  them.   They  were  flying  easterly  and  were  almost  straight  overhead.    As  they  passed  by  i  noticed  that  the  sound  i  was  hearing  was  from  them.   The  sound  tracked  their  path.    After  they  passed  over,   they  all  of  a  sudden  made  a  right  turn  and  accelerated  straight  south  out  over the  ocean and  they  got  louder  as  they  left.    While  they  were  passing  overhead,  we  noticed  that  the  background  stars  went  right  through  them  without  blinking  off  and  on.    That&#39;s  how  i  knew  they  were  individual  objects.    When  i  say  they  made  a  right  turn,  what  i  mean  is,  they  made  a  right angle  or  square  turn  with  out  slowing  down.   In  fact,  they  immediately  accelerated  as  they  made  the  turn.    We  then  continued  on  our  way  to  the  phones  and  looked  up  the  Air  Force  in  the  phone  book.    We  told  someone  there  what  we  had  seen.   He  responded  &#34;Sorry  kid,  no  UFO&#39;s  scheduled  for  tonight&#34; .    We  knew  right  away  no  one  would  believe  us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Drove by familiar watertower; a red, flashing light caught my eye--to bright for the tower light--looked up and saw a two-tiered vessel--very clear because of low cloud over--big as a house, close, tipped slightly toward me.

The red, flashing light first caught my eye, outside line of vision.  It was VERY close--just above the water tower, clearly outlined against the low cloud cover: two tiers, one smaller on top with large, red, clearly defined lights revolving clock-wise; the bottom, larger tier, with same-size green (traffic-light &#34;go&#34;) lights, also revolving clockwise, but a little slower than the upper, red lights. As big as a house; no sound. As I watched, without blinking, it slowly moved in my direction, and after 1-2 minutes it disappeared--no sound, just poof--gone. It was about 02:00 at start; 02:10 when I arrived home about a mile away.<n>

She also recalled the arrival of &#34;military personnel&#34; at the school shortly after the landing.   The aircraft was still on the ground while soldiers patrolled the corridors (note: the school was a single story school with open-air corridors around a central courtyard.  Several classes - included Mrs. ((name deleted)) at the time - had wall-to-wall windows that looked over the field to the north).

I was telling coworkers about what I experienced when I was nine years old at my elementary school about my UFO sighting.  One of my coworkers went on your website and found where someone else had reported basically the same thing that I experienced.  This happened at school and from memory it was called Crestview Elementary School and was in Opa Locka, Florida.  This happened in 1966 from my recollection.  We were in school and all of a sudden our teacher told us to be very quiet and not get up from our seats.  It seemed like we were sitting there forever, when finally I began to see Military men with Air Force hats (caps) on walking around outside our classrooms.  They came from the Homestead Air Force Base.  I was told that later.  I remember that finally they allowed the kids who walked home or rode bikes home were allowed to leave the school.  As I was leaving I remember looking to the North by the playgrounds and looking up towards the street light and saw a shiny silver disk shaped saucer (ufo) by the street light.  I remember my mom asking me why I was home from school early and I told her to call the school that they sent us home early.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One block over from us lived the Science teacher who had her classroom in the portables in the playground.  My mom talked to her and she said that if you hear that something landed next to the portable that it was true.  She said that she was worried about her job so she wasnt suppossed to talk about it so that is why she told my mom that if she heard about something landing at school it was true but did not come right out and tell her that that is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to assure the person who reported this to you on 7/15/2004 if they are still looking for someone who remembers this incident, I do.  Just like they said, it seemed exciting to us, but I was scared also.  Probably because of the appearance of so many military men in our hallways at school.  I seem to think that something was printed in the paper about this being a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I agree with the other person who reported this incident to you about the military doesn&#39;t evacuate schools due to weather balloons and they would not seem worried as they seemed to be to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to be able to talk to this person who also reported this same incident to see if anything else strange like this has happened to them over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The reason I&#39;ve decided to actually contact someone about this is that I have had memories of this incident that have haunted me for over 40 years that I was never quite sure was real or a dream.  That is, until I mentioned it to my father almost 10 years ago (he died in 1996) and he said it really happened.  I wanted to investigate it then, but was sidetracked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then yesterday, my younger sister and I were discussing some childhood memories and she asked me, &#34;What was that about ufo&#39;s at our school?&#34;  I knew it was time to ask someone who could actually find information and probably others who remember this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened sometime between March 1966 and June 1967.  I was attending Opa Locka Elementary School in the northernmost part of Miami, Florida.  It was either the end of my 5th grade (66) or during the 6th grade (66-67).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the memory I have:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around noon, the police and alot of military (probably National Guard) came and evacuated the school.  There were alot of people standing around watching, but I just remember being escorted from the school because, (I saw this myself) 3 UFO&#39;s were hovering over the school yard.  It&#39;s funny that the actual UFO&#39;s are a blur to me, and the fact that we got to leave school early was the part that I remember being most excited about.  However, I remember seeing 3 objects, oblong but with 3 softly rounded sides shaped alot like a turnover, 1 long side with 2 shorter coming to a point in the center.  This was the shape from underneath not from the side.  They were metallic and very smooth and rounded.  I don&#39;t remember any sound coming from them.  There was one hovering over the Portable building, one over the woods just beside the school playgrounds, and one on the other side of the school.  I don&#39;t remember seeing that one, but for some reason, I know it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is there anyone out there that remembers this or has any information?  Pictures would be fabulous.  I can&#39;t imagine that it wasn&#39;t in the Miami Herald.  I have no way to find it myself.  I am also really curious to see how they explained this one.  If my memory is correct, they hovered there for most of the evening.  I don&#39;t know how long or anything about their departure.  I really don&#39;t remember them arriving.  Just seeing them there when were escorted from the school property.  And now that I know my sister also remembers, I want answers.  Please help if you can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The military doesn&#39;t evacuate schools due to weather balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
