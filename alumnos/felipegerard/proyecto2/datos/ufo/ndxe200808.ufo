She describes it as looking &#34;firey&#34; although I thought it looked more like a bright disc.  There did not appear to be any other structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about five minutes as it passed out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10 minutes later we observed either the same object, or an identical one, pass again from East to West and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the East Hampton Police Dept. and the U.S. Coast Guard; neither had any similar report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning we spoke to the motel manager; she said she had seen a similar object at about 8:00 PM that evening, and thought it was a hot-air balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe that is what it was, as you would have seen bursts of flame, and heard something, and why would a hot-air balloon be floating over the Atlantic Ocean at 11:00 PM?<n>

My wife was upstairs putting the children to bed and I was outside the house walking to our garage when I noticed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in an area where commercial airplanes are approaching for landing or taking off from our national airport on a regular basis, the airport is about 35km NW from my home. I know how to distinguish landing lights from an airplane from what I’ve seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange glowing flying object was approaching me from the west heading to the east, I was in the garden at that point in time. It was approaching at a velocity very similar of an airplane. The object followed its heading on a straight course to my observation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t see the object itself because it was surrounded by a blurred orange glow, but the shape appeared to be cross shaped. It’s difficult to estimate the size of the object and the distance from my observation point, the outline of the object  appeared to be the size of a medium size plane (Boeing 737).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimation is that I watched the object approaching for about 3 minutes, when I notice that the object turned its heading midflight. The “front” of the glowing object turned south and was hovering for 10 seconds before it took off almost vertically/slightly westwards with an incredible lift and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cloudless night and I could follow the object visually reaching a very high altitude as it appeared to be no bigger than a star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That maneuver took no longer than 10 seconds, I was still tracking the object as it was suddenly moving eastwards at incredible speed and following a curve of its parabolic flight path to match the curvature of the Earth!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The direction was North East from Union, NJ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the airplane for a few seconds, an extremely bright light appeared at a lower altitude than the plane and then shot off to the left in an arc leaving a slight trail of light behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This single point of light was very pure white and much larger in appearence (2 to 3 times its size) than the airplane which is why I assume it was at a lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent a good deal of time on my deck for the last 10 years and never observed anything like this. I was able to follow the object for approximately 5 seconds and then it disappeared.<n>

We were facing north towards the city of Cincinnati. At approximately 8:55 pm a fireball appeared overhead . If you have ever seen the movie Deep Impact, it looked similar to the comet that entered the atmosphere but much smaller. No sound could be heard associated with the fireball. The fireball traveled north towards Cincinnati at a fairly slow speed above the river. I thought a plane might be on fire. As the fireball got fairly close to Cincinnati, it stopped and turned into a horizontal line of 5 lights. Another light appeared below. (I am using stars to show the positions.) *   *   *   *   * * After a minute or so, the lights blinked out. Had it not been for the fireball that preceeded the lights, I would have thought the lights were fireworks. A single light appeared several times again around the Cincinnati area. Those lights may have been planes, I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I then saw another one following it which looked identical. We both decided it wasn&#39;t a plane since an acutal plane passed it and it didn&#39;t have the same color, and plus it was at least 2 or 3 times smaller than the 2 redish orange lights. Once the plane passed a third red light came out from behind the trees and there these &#34;fireball looking&#34; shapes were following each other in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later exclaimed how they almost looked like fire over a piece of paper flying through the sky. They appeared to move out of the South, and out Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend had told me it was even more strange when she saw the 3rd one because she was watching a thing on dateline that day about UFO&#39;s and how there was one case in Tinley Park, and those also formed a triangle pattern, and were pretty much an identical case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went home that night, and looked it up, I found the video: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24695796/?pg=14#DTL_10UFO The video on dateline about the Tinley Park triangle, and I have to say it&#39;s creepy to see the IDENTICAL image of these 3 orange balls of light flying through. Anywho, if you watch the video you&#39;ll get an Idea of what me, my girlfriend, my mom, my brother, and a ton of other random observers at the fair saw last night on the 31st.<n>

As the sunrays varied with the sunset so did the shapes of objects within the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other clouds surrounding the larger appeared strangely illuminated in bright iridescent colors.  Many other hikers stopped hiking and marveled at the objects within the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took many pictures of the event and was in the process of creating a panorama in Adobe CS2.  As the individual photographs were overlay semitransparent on each other to form the panorama, many more objects were then reveled in greater detailed clearly identifying them as possible UFOs.  It now became apparent that the large clouds concealed one very large craft (approx 30 kilometers in diameter and many other smaller craft in the adjacent clouds.  There appeared to be a bright illuminating beam of light cast down to the ground with  another UFO object suspended within it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending several photographs by e-mail to Mr. Davenport to help document the event.

The object remained static for more than half an hour, then it started to move extremely slowly, and get a little closer. I then saw through the binoculars that it was a cane-shaped object spinning slowly around its own axis, with a frequency of about 1 minute. The object was visible with the naked eye, and was below mid-level clouds, so I estimate an altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. When closer it seemed to be composed of strings of spheres, but that could have been an optical artifact. I saw 3 airline planes fly in the general area. I took my eyes off it for a few seconds and lost contact; I scanned the sky for 10 minutes and could not find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was 2 sets of 3 lights in the back with a somewhat larger light in the front.  All the lights were moving together, although I couldn&#39;t tell if it was one large object.  If it was one object, IT WAS HUGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coworker said there was a low pitched noise but it wasn&#39;t loud like a jet or something.  I know these were not airplane lights, (I used to work avionics for a local airplane manufacturer).  These lights moved in a steady progression and we watched it until the lights faded to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw  what looked like a streak of light shoot from the object, which looked like a shooting star. These lights were not blurry but quite bright and crisp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear and I dont think the moon was out; so it was dark.<n>

It would zig-zag, do small loops and generally bounce around as if it had no mass.

I noticed a flashing light up about 20 degrees in the sky to the left of the big dipper.  Then to the right we noticed another flashing light coming towards and under the big dipper.  The two flashing lights that were approaching each other became brighter as they got closer to each other.  When they got to about 4 inches apart, as I saw them in the sky, they stopped (or dramatically slowed), became really bright, and began to do flash about randomly in a circle for about 5 seconds, in the space between where they stopped at and became bright at and each other.  After that, two lights traveled from that point roughly back the same way as they came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw the lights they were similar to the newer flashing lights of police cars that appear to randomly flash different colors yet there is a pattern if you look closer.  I saw the lights as being connected, but flashing at separate places on the object. I did not have my camera on me and did not want to go back to my tent to get it at this point.  After a few seconds we talked about what we had just seen.  I was cold and went to the tent for my camera, binoculars and more clothing.  When I got back I sat and watched the stars with my friend who was still there until it got too cold so I went back to my tent to sleep.<n>

It was likely just somewhere over the border in Canada when we first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After four or five seconds of tracking it and confirming with each other that we both saw the same thing, the amber light, to our utter shock, turned 45 to 50 degrees to the west and disappeared.

I photographed one ufo there Oct. 3rd. 2008, and reported it. In sept. Iwas looking that way, as I do every night, wondering if they will come back. These 2 Orange balls were rather far apart, so I zoomed in as before, and got a shot of them on 1 frame of my digital camera, they seem to alternate in flashing, once on the left then to the right. I&#39;ve got a good photo if you want one, I only watched them for awhile as it was cold outside that night.It was a clear night that evening and they were in the same spot as the one I photographed in may.You may think it odd that I could see 2 more there, but they were there, sure not the same one!!<n>

EST on August 30th,2008.  As he walked Eastward on West 57th Street, I was still on my porch he looked to the North and I seen him stop.  He than said to me what the heck is that.  I asked what he was talking about?  He said that up there in the sky pointing to the North.  I could not see what he was talking about from where I was standing on my porch.  I walked over to where he was atanding in the street and looked to the North where he was pointing to. There we stood and observed them,a cluster of sphere like objects all apparantly somehow hooked together.  They seem to change their overall shape and were seemingly moving towards or in a Northerly direction.  I could not detect any specific coloring although at one point I thought I may seen a red light just momentarly. The object really didn&#39;t take on any specific shape and as I said seemed to change it&#39;s overall shape.  We lost track of the object behind the trees.  I would say we observed them for a total of two to three minutes in all.  I  then went to get my vechicle so that I might just by chance get another view of it.  I was unsucessful in doing so and I returned home.<n>

At first, we were confounded as to why such an object was so high and would be flying in daylight. We then took out binoculars and discovered that all 5 of us could see the same thing and to make sure, we each went into seperate rooms and drew what we thought we had seen. In awe we discovered that we all had the same sketch. After we had finished drawing we returned outside and saw the same basic shape dart across the sky extremely high up at speeds unknown for known aircraft. We did not have the binoculars at this time and were unable to see if it was the same ufo as we had seen before. Roughly 30 minutes later we saw a helicopter at pitch black at night coming across in the same pattern the ufo had traveled. We thought this was very suspicious because helicopters rarely, if ever fly into or within 10 miles of where my house is. This my be irrelevent but is an extreme coincidence and could have been a mercy flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was higher than some black birds that were flying around, so we thought that it might&#39;ve been a black balloon that flew up really high.  Ignoring it, we turned away, but felt that it was still very odd so I kept looking back.  After a few seconds, I looked back up and saw the black object turn to bright white, like a flashing light (not like fire).  I told the other guy to look at it again and he said that he saw it as well.  It then proceeded to move very quickly and speed off and up.  Eventually, it was no longer visible.  Both of us agreed it was very odd.  I have never been a witness to a UFO or thought that I was before, but I can fathom no other explanation.  This is because of the odd shape and color change (and the fact that it went from pitch black to bright white flash of light) and change of speed (from stagnant to very fast) and its disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I drove south on route 481 from fulton toward clay.  It was a beautiful clear night with only a few very well defined clouds in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I get near the Phoenix exit there’s a bridge over the highway and I notice two bright headlights on the bridge but not moving. I look up and I see that it’s not a car and the lights are above the bridge in the air, way far off a few miles. But they are bigger and more intense than the headlights on cars coming in the opposite lane. And the lights aren’t moving so I thought it was some sort of tower I wasn’t close enough to see yet. The lights were white but tinged with that warm yellow light, not like the bluish headlights some cars have now. So I keep driving. I do not even think ufo-stuff because I just didn’t think about that kind of stuff (back then!!!). My eyes go back to it a few times and in the back of my mind I feel a nagging feeling because I grew up here and have lived here forever and I didn’t remember a tower there before or seeing lights like that. It’s still not dark out but it’s close to that time where it starts to get dark fast. As I get closer the lights don’t move at all. They’re very low in the sky so the trees along the highway block it momentarily here and there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes of driving I start being more distracted by it, because I’m not seeing any tower, and there’s absolutely no movement. I started to think it was a plane flying low, and that it was flying directly in my direction so it looked motionless, which I thought was cool. But as the highway slowly wound and turned, they were staying in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally have driven a few miles and felt as though I was getting close enough to see the tower or plane or whatever it was. I was a little bothered because I realized I was getting extremely close to it, and I could see a cell phone tower or something on the other side of it, and it was a lot smaller. At this point it was dark, but not full night. I wasn’t noticing any other air traffic at the time, but maybe I just wasn’t looking for it in all honesty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally came to a break in the woods (it’s farmy-kind of land) and looked behind me because there was light traffic in the oncoming lane, but none behind me, so I could slow down to about 40 from 65. At that point I passed the clearing on the left and saw that it was a plane that was so low and huge it looked like it was coming in for a landing, but it was hanging completely motionless in the sky, and the lights were very, very bright. As I passed, IT STARTED MOVING AND CAME OVER THE HIGHWAY AND DIRECTLY OVER MY CAR. I checked behind me and slowed to a crawl, stood up and put my face up against the windshield half-standing over my steering wheel. I had stopped breathing and was completely fascinated, and then scared. It took about six seconds to cross the highway over me and it’s only two lanes north and two lanes south. Someone could have jogged it about the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky and cloud above it were a medium gray purple, and I got a pretty good look at whatever this was. I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing because it was huge, but made no sound (I did have my windows up, but it was directly over my car). There were actually three huge lights, one in each corner, and this thing had no wings, it was shaped like a perfect equilateral triangle, black. (or I’m assuming it was black). In the center of this thing were some smaller red and bluish lights and all these weird panels and things. It was so foreign as to what I was expecting my eyes were having a hard time grasping that middle part. Nothing was blinking, no lights you see usually on helicopters and planes. When it crossed the road and got over the field, it banked to the left (south again) and CRUISED south. I sped up, and it was less than a mile to my exit and I was staying steady with it, I could kind of see it here and there through the trees. I got to the exit, there was a red light so I did down my window and leaned out and up over my roof of the car, then climbed back in because there were cars and I felt crazy. I watched to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over route 31 there are a million chain restaurants and walmarts and things like that. This thing crossed the highway and kept going south toward Syracuse. I turned right toward wegmans and tried to keep up and see it. When I got to another intersection red light I looked left and saw it further away, and it had stopped and was motionless in the sky again. The light turned green and I didn’t know what to do, so I just went and got my wife’s bread while in a stupor. On my way home, I didn’t see anything in the sky except three planes or helicopters way up in the sky in the same area flying around and around. I thought that was weird too. In all my life before or after I have never seen anything even closely resembling whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really thrown for a loop when I went home and searched “triangle ufo” and a million hits came up. I didn’t see anything online as clearly as the thing I saw, but the three lights –one at each corner, was right. I wanted to call the police or an airport just so they could tell me what it was but I never did because I felt ridiculous-I didn&#39;t see anything in newspapers or anything so I kind of shut up about it. Hope I find out what it was someday. I am very very nervous, however, about having my name released-Fulton is a small town.<n>

He was about 20 miles south of US Route 30.  An immense craft was visible in front of his vehicle.  He was unable to determine at what height the craft was flying, but he thought it might be somewhere near 150 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was emitting strong strobe-like flashes which gave him the ability to determine that its shape was similar to a wedge of cheese.  It was, according to him, certainly triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft came into view, he immediately slowed down from about 70 MPH to below 55 MPH, as did other cars on the interstate.  When the craft either flew over his car, or he drove under it, his radio went out for about three to four seconds, as did his GPU.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He slowed further and tried to site the craft again in his rear view mirrors, as well as over his shoulder, and was unable to see any strobe lights or craft.  According to my son, he said that people in other cars had clearly seen the same thing and were distraught.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please understand that my son is not usually accurate with regards to distances, so it is possible that he had traveled further (or shorter) than he told me he had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Two simply vanished and the remaining red lights then traveled out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this event we noticed two airplanes traveling across the sky and they looked nothing like the red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun reflected off of the airplanes making them shine white.<n>

She looked out just right after the power went out in the house. It was a still night, mild temp&#39;s, and no wind.  She saw a light in the which was bigger then a star moving around in a up and down, side way movement.  She knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane, since one had just past.  Her window faces south.  She called to her bother in the next room to come and look.  He witness the lite and it&#39;s movements, She got her camera, zoomed in as close as possible and captured the lite for a minute or so. The power came back on and the object was gone. The lite was white, looked like a star, so the shape looks to us like a circle.  They showed me the video in the morning and I could tell they were both a bit freaked out by it.  Com-Ed was called that night and they could not tell them what was the cause of the power outage.<n>

I point out to my mom, &#34;Hey, look, we can see Venus tonight!&#34;. She then says &#34;That&#39;s not Venus, it&#39;s blinking.&#34; I look closer to find out that it is, indeed blinking. It almost looks like a helicopter roughly a mile away. But when we (My mother and I) turned the corner, it was out of our view for, say, 10-13 seconds. We came up on my road and it looked like it was 200, give or take 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I told my mom, &#34;Hurry, speed up and find it, it looks close!&#34;. She drove forward, and it looked much closer than I&#39;d thought, and we could literally see it moving across the sky, 50-70 above the houses. We looked at it for around 20 seconds, and as if it saw us, it started to fly away, speeding up to around 50 miles an hour. Then next thing I know, it just completely zooms off out of sight of the sky within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of UFO:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w274/Mario8498/UFO.jpg<n>

She and I watched it for a while until it disappeared. The others we were with thought maybe it was a bird or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large and completely silent. No lights, just a dark shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t think about it much until tonight when the same girl who spotted it before and I were sitting at the park and I was looking at the stars and saw the same shadowy shape moving in the sky. The same as before, it moved south and kind of faded away. They kept coming and coming, sometimes lower and sometimes as high as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were close they were so big that I thought maybe it was a hang-glider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were closer they seemed to have some lighter colored spots on them, but I’m not positive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are exactly the same as some of the posted entries for Sandy during the summer of 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scared the hell out of me.<n>

It glowed orange with a slight flicker.  Then it went out and another one appeared to the left of it. Then another one appeared so there were two.  Both of them went out and one more appeared to the left of those. That one went out and another one appeared. Each of them only lasted maybe five to seven seconds before going out.  Then after a pause of about a minute another appeared MUCH closer to us (westward).  It was really bright orange and it was in the shape of a square. It lasted a few seconds and went out.  We watched for an hour but didn’t see anything more.  There some small clouds in the sky but no moon. We could see the airport search light and lighthouse but it wasn’t either of them and it was in the sky over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very fast, they were flying through and through the the clouds. Inverting over and over again. All three dis this a few times before they disappeared before they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In my neighborhood it is very dark with no city lights and on a clear night you can actually see the rim of the galaxy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in question was flying almost due north from south. The Big Dipper is easily seen from my front yard, as is the North Star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed said object from about 10deg south of vertical until it disappeared behind some trees at about 35 deg north. The object gave off light (white in color) and it did not waiver other than to dim somewhat as it went further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object crossed straight overhead I saw what looked like an aircraft strobe suddenly appear right next to it (within 1deg of arc). Aside from the strobe I could not see a craft. The strobe was regular (I saw at least 5 strobes) which allowed me to connect the dots so to speak enough so that I would gauge the craft separated from the other craft on a vector of approx. 5deg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A strobe might be used to help locate an aircraft flying at night and at high altitude for collision avoidance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find it interesting that a satellite would be tracking due north. What makes more sense to me is that I witnessed a spy craft. If an American spy plane were to travel from the eastern seaboard it might fly over the North Pole to shorten the distance to say Russia or maybe Georgia.<n>

I looked up and saw a small private plane, with flashing lights, in the sky flying North over my house. A strange light in front of the airplane caught my eye.  Then I noticed there were actually 3 dim lights underneath what appeared to be a black diamond shaped craft, but it had no flashing lights on it like all airplanes do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled for my fiance to come out and see it. The small airplane was following about 150-200 feet behind the strange object.  I was also talking on the phone with my friend who lives north of me.

There are so many that I gave up trying to count them (the number provided above is an estimate). Their movements can go in any direction: left, right, up, down, or diagonally. They look like fireflies in flight, with no discernible pattern to their movements. From my vantage point they look like tiny stars, however their light is visible even through a passing cloud -- which would not be the case if they were, indeed, stars. I suspect they are also out there during the daytime but I cannot be 100% sure. More recently I have noticed that they seem to be &#34;migrating&#34; east, thus moving away from my field of vision, which is directly north, over the Atlantic Ocean. My sister, aunt, and two nieces have also seen these &#34;dancing lights&#34;. When I first reported this phenomenon back in August I was hoping someone more knowledgeable and experienced would come see them, but no one did. Pity. They might be moving away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

While at her uncles house about 7:00 we decided to go outside to watch the sunset, not two minutes after walking out of the house I noticed a large circle shaped light in the sky just sitting in one place not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In amazement of what we were seeing I didn’t move I was scared if I left to get my camera it would be gone. About twenty minutes of watching this light a car pulled up beside us, a woman and young man get out asking if we were from Texas and if that light was always there I replied telling her that we are from the area but the light was very unusual and started to joke that it was a UFO, the woman commented to me that the light has been there all day but the people they have talked to blew it off saying it was a light over the prison, weather balloon or a plane on its way to Lubbock (nearby city).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The problem with these excuses is that it was not moving so it was no plane, there was nothing to hold the light that high above the prison, and of my knowledge we don’t even use weather balloons any more.  At that same moment I noticed that the light was getting smaller turning a red orange color, ten minutes of this and the light that was so big about thirty minutes earlier was just the size of a small star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It makes since to me that if it was a space craft the reason for it turning red and getting was that the ship was leaving the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very serious about what I saw this sighting needs to be documented.<n>

I would estimate they were about one or two mile off shore and about 750 to 1000 feet above sea level. They could have been higher. They stopped briefly only about 5 seconds and backed into the cloud cover, then some moved forward again out of the clouds, then I tried to take a picture but could not see them as they moved back into the clouds. Then about 5 lights moved forward outside the clouds and returned into the clouds. I tried to take a picture but they returned into the clouds. I waited with camera ready, not to miss the next oppertunity but they did not return. A man and a female stopped and he asked if I saw the lights and what did I think they were? I told them alien space crafts. He replied strange, and continued on. I waited for a while but the lights never came out of the heavy cloud cover. We continued to enjoy our evening walking on the boardwalk and later lost at the casino and then went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our position was on Missile Road between the north boundary of Wichita Falls and Burkburnett, Texas and 1-2 miles from the airfield at Sheppard Air Force Base which was east of us.  Looking up and to our west, we saw this object that I would estimate west-northwest, possibly 50 plus miles away and possibly near the altitude of 10,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:00 P.M., the sky was clear and it was getting near sunset so we were guessing the object could be deflecting sunlight but this object was exceptionally illuminated and large for any aircraft.   We went to a nearby Wal-Mart, shopped and came outside and the object was still there and a bit closer.   We went home and the object was still there but more to our immediate west.  As my wife went to get our binoculars, I talked to a neighbor to justify what we were seeing and we all agreed we were seeing something unusual.  At 8:00-8:15, I saw through my binocular what seemed to be a balloon shape object sourcing this amazing golden-white light.  Upon further looks, this object appeared to be diamond shaped with an exception of being elongated and flat on the bottom.  Taking an eye off of it for a few short moments, maybe a minute, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was nothing on the news about it, but I’m sure others had to see this fairly well populated town. I felt compelled to write about this was extraordinary sighting.  We’re retired Air Force, lived here for over 10 years, and are familiar with night and daytime air traffic in the area.  I do not know of an aircraft that could remain in a nearly static position for more than an one hour with the exception of slightly moving south,  be nearly diamond shaped, generating the intensity of this blinding light and then disappear immediately.<n>

They flew behind trees and out of sight. There were no distinct markings at all, just black and white color with smooth surface. Height was under 1000 feet, very low, from the ground about 2x the height of most average size tree&#39;s in the area and looked less than 1 mile away, so they were close enough to see details. My eye sight is better than most peoples and the sun was out and sky clear with only high clouds. They were likely planes, had no camera or time to use one if I had, I&#39;m hoping others saw this and can clear up what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Probably should not mention that sighting in this report)<n> <n><n> 7) Uncertain of altitude.

That was until tonight.  What I saw is the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I was standing behind my apartment and clearly saw something.  It was circular and was in a cylindrical tube of blue light.  The circular portion was yellow and very bright.  At first I thought it was a shooting star.  The only reason I believe otherwise is because whatever this was slowed down and then disappeared into some clouds.  I feel crazy writing this, but maybe there is some truth to sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/26/08 22:00|Warrensburg|MO|Light|1-2 minutes|Two blue-white blinking lights, considerable distance apart, silently hovering over the road.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65423.html|77|ndxe200808| Two blue-white blinking lights, considerable distance apart, silently hovering over the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I went on a drive after a bad night at work, and towards the end of our drive we were on east hwy BB, about a mile away from the intersection with hwy 13.  This is a road I take very often, countless times at night and during the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of nowhere we noticed lights above and in front of our car, I am unsure as to the width or elevation, that appeared to be two sets of lights set very far apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it to be some sort of tower I had somehow never noticed before, but there no other lights present.  I turned to my friend and asked her if she saw it too, and she seemed to be just as puzzled as me.  By this point, since we were alone on a country road, I began to slow my car down considerably... since I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we asked, is it two planes next to each other in the distance? If so, then the two planes were flying completely parallel to each other, as well as taking turns to blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pattern of the blinking was fantastic. There were two sets of bright blue-white lights that would alternate in a sort of pattern. The left would blink several times rapidly, then the right would do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no tail lights or anything besides these two sets. I thought perhaps, since I am a UFO believer but still skeptical of my sightings, that it was just a plane flying low. We do have an airport in Warrensburg, and we often see stealth fighters from the base nearby. Our music was playing loudly still (we were too stunned to do anything but stare) and so I turned it off completely to listen for an engine. All we could hear were crickets, not even a hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest things about the behavior of this craft, or set of lights, was that it stayed in the same position, but seemed to be gliding slowly above hwy 13. If a plane were flying that low, the distance between the lights would have changed as it flew away or towards us. It did NOT change. If it were a helicopter, we would have most certainly heard something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stranger still, as we watched the lights blink in succession, it seemed to suddenly rotate for a split second and blinked vertically over the road. As if, if it were a plane, the plane had turned completely sideways and the wingspan became vertical. And after the quick blinking it was back to normal. It seriously happened so rapidly that I wouldn&#39;t have seen it if I had blinked at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of driving toward the UFO, we came around a bend of trees to our left. The angle of the craft was so low, but still so large, that we lost it behind the trees. I kept my eyes on it through the treeline, saw a couple of blinks, and then it disappeared. We looked for towers, planes in the distance that were blinking similarly, anything. We could not find anything after driving around the bend of trees, nothing even to use as an excuse to ease how disturbed we were.<n>

This process repeated itself one more time in yet another location and then was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that the sighting was not in a pattern contestant with a modern day air plane since the flight pattern was not a straight line but rather back and forth in motion.   There was cloud cover but the object was flying under the clouds.

I am 16 years old from the UK, and I was with my brother at the time, and I would not go to the length of writing this description if I didn&#39;t believe it was something out of the ordinary. Obviously, as we were in the plane we couldn&#39;t view it for a very long time, maybe 5 minutes at the most, but it appeared almost stationary as our plane would be moving at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now I mentioned I was by Midway airport so there are planes landing often but they usually are moving slower and flying lower as they are about to land. The object i saw had no lights on its side like planes and made no sound,but was moving faster then a plane would at high altidude.

I did not believe it, she was just crazy, it was probably an airplane. So when she got home, my brother, his girlfriend, my sister, and I went outside to see this “UFO”. We all quickly realized that my sister was right, so we decided to take my brothers girlfriend home to Coxsackie. As we drove along I took out my phone and started to record it, that is until it stopped appearing on my phone, but was still in the sky, visible to the eye. We took pictures with my sisters camera and we watched it as we went to Coxsackie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to Coxsackie however, going through the pictures on the camera we realized it was no longer visible when it was clear that it was visible at the time the pictures were taken. After dropping my brothers girlfriend off, we pulled out of her drive way and I noticed a light going down and sideways to the right, after flipping out my sister said she saw it too, we sat there dazed. Suddenly we saw two more, less bright, “ball” looking like things come from this other thing. Which the light was extremely bright and white and it was going bigger and smaller, when it got small enough and not as bright you could see the shape, more like a cresant. I thought I had recorded this on my phone but it stopped recording before we saw four more of these “lights” getting dimmer and brighter. It had looked like in “War of the Worlds” (which was oddly enough filmed in Athens, NY) during the storm the “lights” were getting shot into the ground, that is what it resembled as these things were coming down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After realizeing there were more than one of them we headed home, my eleven year old sister extremely frantic, watched them the whole ride home. We passed the prison in Coxsackie where it was near/over then suddenly turned a corner and it was all the way on the other side of the road, ahead of us. As we neared Sleepy Hollow, which is in Athens, it started to fade, I snapped a few quick shots and it “disappeared”. Coxsackie/Athens is a very rural area, with a lot of farms and fields, woods, and water, which can be quiet creepy if you’re already freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived home my sister went online and talked to her friend, who said she and another friend of hers were outside of her house, in Sleepy Hollow, when they heard a very strange sound coming along Farm to Market Road, the very same road my sister had been driving on when she started to follow the UFO. After that her friend got a bad feeling and ran home, my sister hadn’t even told her friend about the UFO we saw or where we had seen it, making it odd and collaberating with this story. Although we didn’t hear any sound, we also didn’t listen for one. The sighting is extremely disturbing and scary for anyone to encounter, but it seemed as though the UFO was watching and following us.<n>

When the show was over we walked back to the truck. As I was throwing bits of ice on him something in the sky caught my eye, and at first I thought it was a shooting star so I glanced away for a second and when I looked back up I noticed that there were 4 dim lit lights on the underneath on what looked like a triangular craft. And the craft, which was completely black, had a fine silver line that looked to be the far edge of the wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought to myself that this would be some sort of an airplane but I noticed that there was no sound and no flashing blue/red lights. It was completely silent. My dad also asked about the space station or it being a satellite or something. No, it wasn’t because I noticed that as it passed by it covered up the stars as it was moving.  It didn’t seem to be that high like a plan either, I mean, it wasn’t touching the tops of trees or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So about a few seconds when I realized what I may be seeing I slapped my boyfriend on the shoulder and pointed to the sky. He saw the last 3 or 4 seconds of it but then as it got farther away it was gone.<n>

Our house is up on a hill so we can see well over the few rooftops below us that look to the South West sky towards Needham and Route 128/95 - it&#39;s all tree tops from the park looking towards the horizon. As we were eating I looked up to speak to my BF and a very bright light in the sky behind him caught my eye - it wasn&#39;t there a minute before. No other stars were out since the horizon was a pale yellow and the sky above shades of blue - it was just starting dusk - but not nearly dark yet and a very clear night. I pointed out the light and the two people saw it and agreed it was really bright  - and stationary in the sky. They were puzzled by it as was I. I said it&#39;s probably a planet but I&#39;ll watch it and see if it moves across the sky. I would estimate it was 20-30 degrees above the horizon. I observed it for about eight minutes without it moving in the slightest. I then went inside to grab something from the kitchen (maybe 15 seconds) and when I returned it was nowhere in sight... and it couldn&#39;t have possibly moved behind something since we were so high up and could see for miles around it - nothing would have obstructed the view. It just vanished. We didn&#39;t see it again. Other aircraft were visible and easily identifiable and nowhere near this light. No sound was heard but that&#39;s not surprising seeing how we felt it was miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all professional men and women. Ph.d., Actuary and an I.T. Director.

So I am reposting it here, in hopes that maybe someone else in the area saw something similar? and maybe got a pic ? I was too late for a pic of the object, but I did get a good shot of the Military style helicopter.. someone said it looked like a next gen.Cobra? Not sure myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know, this doesnt mean that what we saw today was &#39;ET&#39;, it just means that we are quite sure it wasnt an airplane, and it was far to low to be a satellite.. ( maybe new sats fly that low, but im not aware of them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> so it could have been ours (man-made), or who knows what.. but the fact the this &#34;military&#34; helicopter.. ( thats what im calling it, you can tell me what you think it is, i got a pic of the copter). .. but the fact that that came shortly after.. is interesting, though at the time, the two didnt even click....<n> <n><n> <n><n> we knew it wasnt the regular hospital choppers that fly over , but we were wondering why one of those would fly over. Not even thinking about the weird thing we saw a little while before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outback of my house, jamming a little on the Djembe and guitar, we were jamming for awhile, and after a bit, i just instantly got bored and stopped. My friend kept playing..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over to the south, at a cloud shaped i thought looked like the shape of the united states kind of...<n> <n><n> <n><n> and i got the thought to mess with my friend, and act all excited and say &#34;look dude a UFO&#34;, but i didnt get that out, instead i just looked straight up, maybe looking for more clouds or something,  and saw waht looked for a second like just a shiny metallic ball.. and looked for another sec to be sure, and said to him.. in these words... &#34; look dude, i was just going to mess with you about a ufo, and look..whats that?&#34;  he said, &#34;I dont see it?&#34; so i was pointing it out to him..... him still trying to find it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> by now, it was an elongated shape , a second or two after it appeared &#34;ball&#34; like to me, it got a little closer and looked elongated, so this was what i was trying to point out to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> a second or 2 later he saw it, and my first words were.. &#34; plane?&#34; I really didnt think it looked like a plane, but.. you know.... lol  He said, &#34;man, i dont think thats a plane&#34;, i said &#34; yeah it doesnt really look like it does it&#34;.... so we kept looking, as it flew north east... no noise to it like the planes that fly over constantly... just moved... not too fast...... but by the time he mentioned to go get my camera.. I ran in the house, and ran back out thru the front door where it was headed... and looked, couldnt see it.. i looked out back to phil, and said, where is it? you see it? he said yeah i lookin at it, hurry up... so.. i raann back to where he was... and i couldnt see squat, he tried pointing it out, but it was to far by then. haha, what a clown i am running around with a camera.. LOL  anyway...<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was silvery white, maybe about 10 times as high as when planes fly overhead when getting ready to land.... ( best i can describe height).. LOL, silly way to describe it i know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the &#34;body&#34; looked slightly &#39;thicker&#39; than a planes body..<n> <n><n> <n><n> it didnt have wings, (no wings ive ever seen,) it had what i want to say looked like... uhhmmm.... ?claws? .. not claws.... but, kind of like a surfboard fin, on each corner pointing inwards, 4 of them from what i could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> and down the middle of the &#34;body&#34; or tube or whatever one would call it, looked almost like a spiral... much thinner than the rest of the object.. not a defined spiral, but thats the best i can explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> my buddy said after a few minutes ~ &#34;maybe a sattelite?&#34; , i really dont think that could have been a sattelite. lol  he later stated he didnt either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had my camera outside from when i tried to get a shot of the other thing, and got a couple blurry ones of the chopper, but one decent one to, it was quite high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> this helicopter does not look civilian to me.. its not a medical chopper... what is it?  I dunno, now that i sit a couple hours later, seeing that weird thing and then the helicopter a little while later was weird/interesting. cool though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> hmmm.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heres the chopper pic not touched, and Ill asdd the blown up one in a few minutes, you guys might have something better to blow it up with, but ill do it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Helicopter pics added. Also a sketch I made of the object seen. Looking straight up at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,<n>

It emitted no distinguishable noise over the car&#39;s engine or through the car&#39;s glass windows. The object was also huge, probably the size of at least 2 3 story duplexes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read other reports of similar description around the St. Louis region, so I thought it would be dutiful for me to post this.

She said her daughter, 7 years old, woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning to use the bathroom.  When she returned to her room, she saw an object floating in the sky with red and blue lights.  She watched it fly around, get small in size, change its shape a few times and then finally fly away.  She then went to her mother&#39;s bedroom door and knocked on the door.  When her mother woke up and asked her what the problem was, the daughter told her mother what she had just seen.  The mother told her to go back to bed, that she must have been dreaming.  When my daughter told me, I asked if her daughter had been frightened by what she saw and she said she was a little scared but not overly frightened.  I then told her not to make a large fuss over the incident but maybe her daughter could draw a picture of what she had seen.

8/24/08 22:40|Rolling Meadows|IL|Fireball|20 minutes|2 Orange Fireball lights with random blinking pattern seen hovering 300 ft. above Woodfield Mall, Schaumburg Il|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65386.html|99|ndxe200808| 2 Orange Fireball lights with random blinking pattern seen hovering 300 ft. above Woodfield Mall, Schaumburg Il<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:40, I had just finished shopping at Meijer&#39;s (a 24 hour store). While standing in the parking lot next to my car I looked up into the sky to see if there were any storms approaching because while I was in the store, I heard a lot of low flying airplanes. (typical being that O&#39;Hare is close by, but still out of the ordinary on a clear night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise I noticed a fire in the sky. I almost called 911 because it looked like one of the floors in the Zurich buildings were on-fire. From the distance it resembled a flickering orange fire (no other colors present). There were airplanes in the sky coming and going, and this orange flickering looked like sparks from a random flame burning in the wind. My Wife was standing right next to me also in amazement. She was rushing me to get in the car but I insisted on watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in an instant the 2 lights turned about face and flew upwards and diagonal and nearly disappeared. At 22:45 I got in the car, and drove west down Golf road towards home, watching the sky as I could (being that I was the driver). As we passed Woodfield Mall, I saw the red blinking light atop the Zürich Towers, and verified that the second tower wasn&#39;t taller. I googled the Zürich Towers height and discovered both towers are 270ft tall. This means that what ever those lights were, they were definitely not one of the floors on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued home and at approx. 22:50, I noticed a fast moving military jet (had a different shape than a helicopter, nearly silent, and a distinct trail behind it). This jet was flying faster than any commercial planes would appear at its height in the sky. It had a distinct shape that reminded me of a fighter plane, however it too was silent. The Jet was capable of making quick rounded  arc turns. It appeared as if the Jet was scanning the sky (in the way it was traveling). The Jet headed in a direction south of Golf Road and appeared to be in the vicinity of where the fire lights would have been. Unfortunately we turned off and continued home and lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that Scott Air force base has a Peoria branch and it&#39;s about 50 miles south of Schaumburg. If a plane were to be dispatched, it would take approximately 5 minutes at 600mph to reach This area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Wife, had reminded me that there have been a lot of recent sightings in the area, so the first thing I thought to do was check the internet then report it here. This is the first time I have seen something like this in the sky. I&#39;ll admit I was a bit skeptic of UFOs because I have seen my share of military aircraft as a civilian. I attended a college in the early 90&#39;s that was located near Whitman Air-Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw no propulsion flames and only a slight thermal glow to its leading edge.  Still it crossed my visible horizon in under 10 seconds.  The craft appeared not overly large, on par with a small commercial jet and was flying at a relatively low altitude,  maybe 15,000 feet.  At about 2/3 of the way across my horizon, it slid over rapidly to its port side, maybe twice the width of the craft, but continued on its same course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Stationary for over forty five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday night at approximately 11:30 pm central time in Dyersburg Tenn. I noticed what I thought was a star off in the distance. The object was northwest of my location with distance unknown origin. It was low in the sky and what made me notice the object was the changing of colors. Red, white, yellow and a brilliant blue that sequenced in a rotary manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained in one position for over forty five minutes and never moved like a plane. It took the object over and hour to move away to the north west. The distance I can calculate from my position would put it in the range of 30 nautical miles over the state of Missouri in the boot heel region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The different array of lights the object had were flashing in different modes and alternated but a shape to the craft was never noted. I had no pictures or means to establish or document the event. I was hoping that someone else would report the incident to confirm what I had saw. There were commercial planes in the area and I would have thought that some of the airlines had made visual contact with the object off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could have been over the Kennett Missouri area but could have been much further away than that. This is the first incident I have ever witnessed and the occurrence has me baffled. Visibility Saturday night was 30 nautical miles and stars were out. The object at first appeared to be a star till I noticed that the flicker was different than a star. Upon viewing it through my binoculars, I noticed the object seemed to be rotating and had a light sequence not seen on any commercial air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had no means of confirming with airports in the area nor the local police. Though I think more people than I witnessed the event that night.<n>

The object was not shiny and had no light. it made no sound at all. it was about 3-4 centimeters in size relative to the stars and i could not tell if it was close (500 meters, etc) or if it was in outerspace and was very large. i was alone unfortunately and no one else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this.

We were on a hike at 10:45pm at the Southern end of Moorpark Ave, half way up the &#34;bench trail.&#34;  While looking North , a friend and I noticed a large meteor with a cobalt blue flare, which entered the atmosphere from East to West at about a 130 degree angle, one of the most large flares that I have ever witnessed. It seemed to burn out briefly however reignited at the same intensity, which caught our attn (since normally you would expect a meteor to burn out).  However while still approaching the horizon at a fast speed, we’re thinking it’s going to hit the ground, however the blue flare suddenly shifted horizontally (cardinal West) and faded to an faint orange dot (similar in size to viewing a satellite in orbit with the naked eye). Visibility was great since we were well removed from any city lights; the Milky Way was faintly visible, which for So Cal Suburbs is normally rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange dot then reversed completely 180 degrees then arced slowly counterclockwise to 0 degrees and rose in altitude quite a distance(for about 5-7 seconds). More amazingly is when we saw the same cobalt blue flare return (more oval shaped without the entry trail) and blink every second for a total of 24 blinks as it lowered to the horizon and behind a hill between our city and a neighboring community. It was difficult to gauge the distance of the object from us, but looked to be within the local vicinity, possibly as far as Fillmore, directly North.  Not knowing the actual size of this object, this could have been further North, as far as Bakersfield. The total event took all of 40-45 seconds, ending as it lowered behind the mountain range to the North.<n>

It then appeared over head, as if materializing, I saw no heat trail from entering the atmosphere, just a spot of light, and it was moving very fast. At first, and this happened quickly, there was only one, a green tubular shaped light. Then another slightly behind it. The second light stopped or appeared  behind the first, then the two slowly circled each other without changing orientation. That is to say they were still pointing east. They slowed to a stop and hovered for a moment side by side. They aligned  and moved east, slowly, maybe a hundred or so mph(?). And absolutely no sound. Coming or going. They were shaped like, and looked like, a fluorescent light bulb. They glowed like a black light but were green.  To say the least I was very excited. I couldn&#39;t tell how big or how high they were, I had nothing to reference from. Clear sky, no clouds no moon. But it was very clear that these were not any type of airplane or aircraft that I have ever seen. And moved like nothing I know of can. It looked like something you would see in a movie! Better, it was real!!<n>

Seemed to be behind a tree. Light rose out of tree line, went right to other side of hill, the light when  moving had a red glow and was blinking. Then the light came back and traveled down by our house, then vanished. No sounds were heard, no motors, no engines. There was some heavy winds just before we saw these lights. Then we saw 2 more lights, one was above the other. They sat for a while, blinking silvery lights, then one went in the same direction as the first. After a short time the other did the same thing. There are dogs on both sides on the hills. The dogs on the side where the lights were first seen barked and howled constantly. The dogs on the side where the lights went only barked when the lights passed by them. There was a soft glow where we first saw the lights. After the 4th light left the glow was gone and the dogs stopped barking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was only the one flash. The cloud was a fairly large one, appearing to cover approximately 1/10 of our front windshield&#39;s field of view. The &#34;aqua&#34; colored light lit the cloud uniformly. (No brighter spot/spots within the cloud) I did not see a streak in the sky like a meteorite, and there were no thunderstorms in the area, but it did appear to light the cloud from the inside and did not impact the other clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stopped ridding for a break and stretched out on a stump and looked up into the sky watching dragon flies. I spotted a round orange light quite high in the sky, well over 200ft because it was difficult to spot when I turned my head for a minute. I thought it may have been an air craft but it was hovering rather than moving across the sky. I realized it was a metallic object as the sunlight reflected off it, rather than a light. I watched for 15 minutes and it only seemed to get smaller as if it was moving out ward. It was still there when I left.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(The same direction that I had observed the “daylight star” a day earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:50 PM, again a very large and bright starlike object appears suddenly to the South West against the still clear blue sky.

I then attempted to get the attention of someone inside my home by knocking on the windows while trying to watch the object at the same time. (I did not want to take my eyes off the object just in case it faded away into thin air as it did the day before after observing it for 40 minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, I momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when I looked back up. I remained outside watching for another hour without ever seeing the very large and bright “daylight star” again. However, during this time frame all of the “normal stars” that I normally see each evening began to slowly and dimly appear starting around 8:15 PM. I did not notice any “normal stars” moving or disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what this very large bright starlike object is, but I am almost positive that it is not a star or a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Not ISS.

After about 15 minutes or so I spotted an extremely bright star close to the tree lines, and it appeared to be moving in an irregular way. Every once in a while it would brighten and dim, then flash red. We watched this “star” for about 45 minutes to an hour. Most of the time it would stay still, but about every couple of minutes it would move in different ways. Sometimes it would slowly move up in the sky. Sometimes it would slowly move down. At times it seemed to zig zag back and forth or move in a wave motion. And there were even times where it would make a small circle. After a while we just got sick of watching it and decided to drive home. There have been no other sightings since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a thin, high band of clouds somewhat obscuring the sun, and I noticed a &#39;rainbow effect&#39; by the disc of the sun, presumably due to ice crystals in the clouds.  I then noticed, about 50-55 degrees above the eastern horizon, what looked like a satellite, moving toward WSW in a slow, somewhat halting fashion. After about a minute it seemed to change course to due west. It did not increase or decrease in brightness, as a tumbling satellite reflecting sunlight would. Also, the sun was behind it.  I could not determine altitude using the clouds as a guide, because the object was away from the clouds, but it looked to be much higher than a normal aircraft.  There was no contrail or sound. I wish to emphasize that the object looked very much like a satellite that you see after sundown would.  I watched, craning my neck as far as possible until I had to get up and walk on the gravel driveway (in barefeet-ouch!) I took my eyes of the object for just a second, but could not find it again.  It would have been directly over my house.  I went inside, and it was exactly 0900 hours.  As a sidenote, my Dad was an aeronautical engineer for Boeing,  and I know a plane when I see one.  I am also an amateur astronomer, and this may well have been the ISS space station or a satellite of some sort, but the fact that it changed direction, was slow and halting and so bright makes me scratch my head and wonder what it was.  If I had to guess, I would say the object was round or slightly oblong. Also, I was wearing sunglasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a white trail behind it like shooting stars have but then it started to burn red instead of white.  Then suddenly it stopped for a second completely.  I couldn’t make out what it was.  It was just a red fire ball and then it bounced across the sky in a very erratic pattern this did not leave a trail.  It clearly wasn’t propulsion driven.  It was incredibly fast.  Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my friends and was so amazed by this however to my horror none of them witlessness it.  It was very disappointing to have been the only one to of seen this.  I have no clue as to what this was.  I see satellites all the time and shooting stars and of course airplanes.  This thing had astonishing speed and moved which ever way it wanted to.  It was amazing.<n>
8/22/08 23:00|Provo|UT|Chevron|1 hour|On 8/22/08 in Provo Utah we saw many chevron shaped groupings of rapidly moving clusters  of bright crafts.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65355.html|130|ndxe200808| On 8/22/08 in Provo Utah we saw many chevron shaped groupings of rapidly moving clusters  of bright crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 25 year old daughter and her 24 year old friend were at the park near Center and Geneva road in Provo, the one with the fort. As they were sitting there they saw a V shaped cluster of approximately 50 or more very bright lights move some what low across the sky at a very rapid speed. It moved like a school of fish, curving in unison, but then splitting apart at times. It  was coming from the north west and moving south east. Various other configurations of these groupings passed every few minutes. At times the lights would flare so brightly it was startling! She called me on the phone and told me to look outside to see if I could see anything, but we have a street lamp in front of our home and we couldn&#39;t. They came and picked us up and we went back to the park. I expected to see that it was a search light or something but then one large grouping flew overhead and it was undeniably something unlike anything I had ever seen or could explain. It was like a boomerang shape cluster of up to 50 objects all flying in formation very close together and they just kept coming every few minutes. They were not single file like airplanes would fly, but  grouped  densely together. We had brought our binoculars and  my 17 year old son was able to track one very brightly lit group. He saw individual crafts all clustered together, circular with dark violet lights circling around the outer edge. They were not all identical in shape and at one point they suddenly shot straight up in a deep purple blast. Most of the groupings were in a chevron pattern, but some were just small clusters. When the lights would flare it was stunning! Then they would fade to a dimness that made them unnoticeable unless you were looking at them already. They moved across the sky at an inhuman speed. We also watched multiple airplanes flying overhead and it made the speed of these objects even more stunning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired nurse and current business owner in partnership with my daughter. Her friend is a world traveler and has seen other sightings in his life. My 17 year old son is a skeptic, as I am and we both came along expecting to see something that was easily explainable. I don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s never have. I don&#39;t believe in anything I can&#39;t see and I even struggle with religion although I was raised in the Mormon faith and do still attend. I don&#39;t know what to do with this experience. I know I witnessed  a massive sighting of UFO&#39;s and I am scared!<n>
8/22/08 23:00|Chicago|IL|Light|1 hour|Multiple blinking orange orbs over downtown and north side of Chicago|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65352.html|131|ndxe200808| Multiple blinking orange orbs over downtown and north side of Chicago<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a downtown Chicago high-rise (in the River North neighborhood, immediately north of the Loop) above the 45th floor with a view to the west and northwest.  At 11pm on Friday, August 22, 2008 I went out on my balcony to get some air and saw in the distance approximately five blinking orange orbs in close formation hovering about 500 feet above the western side of the River North neighborhood (possibly a bt further west, above River West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very quickly the objects individually blinked on and off in a seemingly random manner, almost like a strobe light atop an emergency vehicle.  I thought at first they were the lights of an emergency helicopter (sometimes I see medical flights to rooftop helipads at hospitals on the north side), but the lights just hovered and blinked, moved slightly to the south, and faded out/stopped blinking.  While &#34;on&#34;, the light they gave off was an intense orange, the kind you might see at the working end of a blow torch.  Really pure, really bright and intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for several minutes wondering what I had seen.  Twice in the past year, I have seen individual unexplained objects above downtown Chicago and the western suburbs (one of which I reported to NUFORC), and I expected what I had just seen was also out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting for the lights to return to no avail, I returned to my apartment.  About half an hour later, through my window I noticed an individual blinking orange orb in a different location but near to where I had seen the original formation.  This orb was low to the ground, about at rooftop level.  It strobed for a few seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out on the balcony again and waited.  About a minute later, the light reappeared for 10 seconds or so and then faded out.  It occurred to me if the grouping of lights I had originally seen had broken up, I might see other individual orbs above the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out on the balcony for about half an hour (by now it was around midnight or maybe a little bit later).  During that time, I witnessed another very intense blinking orange orb above the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  This was not the signal light atop Children&#39;s Memorial Hospital on Lincoln (which was also clearly visible) but was east of it, closer to the park itself.  This light moved slightly east and west while I watched it, and blinked in a rapid, staccato manner in three volleys of about 15 seconds each, with gaps of perhaps 15 or 20 seconds between each volley.  The light was as intense as the others I had seen, and seemed weirdly bright given the distance from which I was viewing it.  I had the feeling something was being surveyed by the light at specific intervals.  After a couple of minutes, this light disappeared and did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw what may have been blinking orbs in two other locations, both much further to the northwest and closer to the horizon.  However, due to the distance, although those lights were blinking in the same odd manner, I can&#39;t be sure.  However, the formation of lights and the two individual orbs that I saw were identical in behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny part of the entire event, each time I saw the lights I thought, &#34;you&#39;re kidding, these can&#39;t be what I think they are,&#34; and then a few minutes later they would reappear doing the same things I doubted I had just seen them do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve lived in this high-rise for years and have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters come and go.  I have never, ever seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I looked through the NUFORC reports and found a similar report of orbs over Lake Michigan exhibiting similar behavior on AUgust 8th.  I get the feeling I just saw those same orbs, only this time over the city.  I can&#39;t be the only one to have seen these things tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was outside, in front of my house, talking to my friend. I was standing facing North West, my friend was facing East, and I happened to glance up at the sky. in the direction of the big dipper when I noticed something that appeared almost shadow like in the sky  moving at a high rate of speed. ( to describe what it was like is when you see a flock of geese flying in the night sky. or like what a comet looks like. It was about that transparent.) The object had no lights and was triangular or swept wing. Similar to the stealth bomber.  But I could see through it as it passed in front of the stars as if it was like a ghost. From my vantage point it completely covered the end two stars of the handle of the big dipper. The object made no sound whatsoever. It was moving from North to South. ( I watch the international space station quite often and this object did not appear to be getting any reflective light from the sun) This object  moved from North to South in two to three seconds. I do not know if it was in orbit or in the high atmosphere, or even ten thousand feet. I had no reference point. I turned my head from right to left as I followed it. And as fast as I could turn my head it was gone.  Could this have been something military?  That made no sound?  My friend did not have time to turn his head to see it.  This was the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n>

I was on the phone with my girlfriend as I watched what I originally thought was a plane “pulsate” its front lights as it flew in the direction of the ocean. As I got closer I realized that the object was not in fact moving but hovering just over the path of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I realized that I was not looking an airplane (due to the absence of the blue and red lights normally seen on the wings of the plane) and as the objects came into view I was able to make out three distinct lights forming a perfect triangle. The entire time I was just saying, “Oh my God, oh my God, what am I looking at?!”  This continued for about 3 minutes until the freeway began to bend in another direction of the lights, and at this point the other two lights began to pulsate in unison. I watched this go on as I made the left bend on the freeway, and the last I could see of the lights is that they began to change colors to a deep blue.  I did not stop because I was honestly too afraid to and still am shaken up by the whole experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other then myself I do not know the other observers because we were all on the freeway, I do know that others did notice the lights because traffic was beginning to slow down and people next to me were pointing. At this point of entrée I have not contacted my local news groups to put them on alert, but I will after summiting this UFO encounter description.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/22/08 19:15|Westlake|LA|Other|40 minutes|Disappearing daytime star-like object appeared and disappeared seven times during daylight hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter??  PD))|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65641.html|138|ndxe200808| Summary  The appearing/disappearing daytime star-like object appeared and disappeared seven times during daylight hours over a period of 12 days. Three sightings were followed by the appearance of military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 08/22/2008 (Friday)  While sky gazing at 7:15 PM , I noticed a very bright object in the sky due South of my residence in Westlake, LA at 45 degrees above the horizon. The object looked similar to a star, except it appeared to be about ten times larger and brighter than any star or planet that I have ever witnessed. It should be noted that sunset this evening was at 7:46 PM and normally stars would not start to appear until about 30 minutes after sunset. (This “star” was out about an hour early with the sun still shining brightly). I watched the object for several minutes and it appeared to be stationary. I then went into the house and got my binoculars to have a better look at it and still it appeared to look only like a extremely large and bright star.  I would say that the object appeared to be very high in the sky but not beyond the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:30 PM, I called my wife out of the house to witness the unusual day light “star”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the “star” until 7:55 PM (a total of 40 minutes) and to the eye it appeared stationary, but apparently it was slowly moving to the West as it was now clearly located directly South West (a 45 degree change in direction), but still 45 degrees above the horizon. At this point, the very bright clearly seen “star” got fuzzy and appeared to be starting to pull apart and quickly faded away against the cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after the “star” faded away, an Air Force B-52 flew directly over my house at a low altitude flying South Westerly and flew exactly past the last position of the large daylight “star” that had just faded away. I had called my wife back out of the house to witness that the “star” was now gone, as the B-52 aircraft passed overhead. It should be noted that this is first time that I have ever witnessed a B-52 in flight since leaving the military in 1982. I believe that the closest active military air base to my home in 200 miles to the North in Shreveport, LA and any military aircraft in our area is somewhat rare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained outside to document the time that readily recognized “normal” stars start to appear with the first dim star appearing at 8:00 PM and the second at 8:15 PM. The extremely large and bright daylight “star” that faded away against a clear sky never reappeared in the sky by the time I ended my watch at 10:00 PM last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (8/23/08) Saturday  At 7:40 PM, I returned to my backyard in Westlake, LA and started a through watch to the South and South West direction. (The same direction that I had observed the “daylight star” a day earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:50 PM, again a very large and bright starlike object appears suddenly to the South West against the still clear blue sky. (Sunset was at 7:46 PM and the sky was still very well lit up at this time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for a minute or so to make sure that it was indeed a stationary object. I then attempted to get the attention of someone inside my home by knocking on the windows while trying to watch the object at the same time. (I did not want to take my eyes off the object just in case it faded away into thin air as it did the day before after observing it for 40 minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, I momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when I looked back up. I remained outside watching for another hour without ever seeing the very large and bright “daylight star” again. However, during this time frame all of the “normal stars” that I normally see each evening began to slowly and dimly appear starting around 8:15 PM. I did not notice any “normal stars” moving or disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what this very large bright starlike object is, but I am almost positive that it is not a star or a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8/28/08 (Thursday)  19:35	Observed reappearance of daytime star-like object against a clear blue sky 45 degrees above the horizon SW of my residence in Westlake, Louisiana. Unlike the first two sightings of this object, this time the object was not extremely brilliant. I then observed the object through binoculars and it appeared to be metallic and chrome colored, shaped like a hamburger bum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:37	At this point, I phoned my son who was located 10-15 miles SW of my residence and presumably that much closer to the object and ask if he could sight the object. He easily located the object in the same relative position in the sky to him as it was located to myself. When asking my son if he saw the star, he stated that “the object was not a star as it was defiantly metallic, but he was unable to identify what it was”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:45	Shot six still photos of the object on a Sony digital camera. (Object appears in the photos as a round white object against a clear blue sky without showing the chrome color or a detailed shape due to the long distance of the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:47	While attempting to locate the object in the viewfinder of my video camera, my son called back and said that the object had disappeared. I looked back up to confirm that indeed the object was gone and no longer appeared against the clear blue sky. I continued to search the sky for 30 minutes without the object reappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 09/03/08 (Wednesday)  19:45	Reappearing star-like object appears high in the sky directly above my residence in Westlake, LA. Object remained stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:47	Called my son out of the house to watch the object while I laid flat on my back observing the object straight up in the sky with binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:50	Observed a much smaller yet very bright star-like object moving towards the original larger star-like object and then it stopped. At this point, I ask my son if he saw the second smaller object without binoculars and he stated that he did not. After about ten seconds, the smaller object moved toward the larger object again. As the smaller object met the larger object, the larger object appeared to become eclipsed by the smaller object and a corona of light could be seen around the larger object with the light at the center of the larger object blocked out. At the point that the larger object became eclipsed, my son stated that he could no longer see the object without binoculars. I continued to watch the “eclipse star” for a minute with binoculars and then it faded and appeared as faint light in three separate spots and then faded out completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:05	Observed a large twin engine turbo prop military type aircraft flying low directly over my residence located in a populated neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:12	Observed a large commercial airline flying low and banking a turn directly over my residence. (It should be noted that large aircraft are almost never observed flying low over my residence located in a populated neighborhood).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 09/04/2008 (Thursday)  19:40	Star-like object appears in the South, 70 degrees above the horizon as clouds begin to break at my residence in Westlake, LA.. The object could best be described as a normal star in appearance against the still blue sky in the background. Object appears in wrong part of sky to be a star and 20-30 minutes early for a normal star to appear. Observed object for 16 minutes with binoculars. During the time observed, the object changed from a pale star appearance to a yellow flattened  shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:56	Object begins to fade against a still clear cloudless portion of the sky and then appears as faded scattered light in three separate locations in the sky before the object is completely undetectable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:06	What appears to be a fighter jet passes directly over my residence flying very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (It should be noted that military aircraft are seldom seen in this area over a residential neighborhood, nor are low flying aircraft of any type with the exception of an infrequent Piper or crop duster during the daylight hours).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:16	What appears to be the same fighter jet makes another very low pass over my residence for a second time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20:30	Ended sky surveillance without star-like object returning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter??

There were some chemtrail clouds drifting south. The sphere moved very slowly towards me in over the downtown Reno metropolitan area. It took up a position over McCarren Blvd. and remained motionless for approx. 5 mins. It then moved closer to my position on a straight course but ever so slowly. At first I thought it was a balloon but it maintained its course on a straight trajectory. It stopped over the northern Sparks area and held position. It seemed to emminate its own white luminious light source. It appeared under intelligent control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly off to my left appeared a diamond [mother-of-pearl] shaped craft. It seemed to have dimensional structure to its outer shape. I glissened and gleamed various beautiful colors in the late afternoon sunlight.  One moment it seemed to look like a triangle then would alter its dimensional features appearing more diamond shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved with the same slow movemnt as the first sphere which was also visible at the same time the diamond was overhead. The diamond moved forward ever so slowly then took up position over the University of Reno. It remained stationary for 6-7 mins then began a very slow path floating back and forth slightly. It then began it final course 90 degs to it previous path heading west. It was the same altitude as the clouds [chemtrail clouds] which were blowing east in the wind. But the diamond was moving AGAINST the wind as it advance head-on past the clouds. I watched it till it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took approx 25-30 mins.  The first sphere also was now undetectable by vision. It was also gone.<n>

Strange morphing UFO with brilliant translucent colors<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 4:45am on Aug 22, 2008 I walked outside to check on my animals. As I was looking for my cats, I noticed a flashing object in the sky. It was a round looking object, which I initially assumed a star or planet. But as I continued to watch it, I was fascinated by the flashy colors it was emitting. It seems every color in the rainbow was flashing, right before my eyes. I quickly ran inside my home, and grabbed my camera. Unfortunately, I do not really know how to use this fancy pro camera, and recorded it with the setting to &#34;auto&#34;. This caused the object to focus in and out. Altogether there is about 25 minutes of footage. my 19 year old son also witnessed this object while walking home from work (we live on base housing). The very last section was a video I shot of the moon (I was trying to compare the moon to what I had just seen).  The degree angle can be pretty easy to identify because I used a reference point of a house with the object I was filming. I know that there are strange happenings at Fort Huachuca, AZ (Blue Beam Project...etc) and their base is but a few hours to the east of me, which coincidentally points in the same direction of where the object was hovering. I cannot determine how far out this object was. I first thought it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I consider myself to be an experienced aircraft spotter having been involved with aviation for close to fifteen years. On the night in question, I was sitting on my back porch, it faces southeast, I sit out there at night sometimes and watch air traffic line up coming from the south with their landing lights fully on, flying north in direction. These are usually flights that are going to be landing into Dallas Love Field, in this instance there was what looked to be two aircraft in line probably about five to six miles in trail, the strange thing about it all, was the aircraft bringing up the rear was closing the distance way faster than it should have been, so I turned my attention to the lead aircraft or what I thought was an aircraft. This was a very unusual light, I couldn’t tell at first but as it got closer I could tell this object was not an aircraft and they were not landing lights, it was the shape of an orb or sphere and orange in color, there is a navigational aid or VOR station that aircraft on this route use, its about three miles south of my home. Once an aircraft intercepts this station they turn northwest, the object in question seemed to stop in midair in the area of this turn point, it appeared the trailing aircraft had to make an early turn to avoid the object, once the trailing aircraft was parallel with object, the object just disappeared right in front of my eyes. I’ve seen some strange things in skies over the years that can’t explain, but this one tops them all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had showed my sister and she looked at and said huh I’m not sure, she then looks in other places of the sky and said &#34;there&#39;s no moon.&#34; I had said that’s really strange. My sister then had a phone call and went inside, while I stayed out there for a little while more. The strange object was many shapes, it was first circular, then it had spread out in a long faddish way and started to move and split into to two parts, with one larger part and one smaller part that were not even. Then the smaller part then started to move west and fade little by little, with nothing but a very foggiest orange color in the sky after this occurred for about 3 minutes total. With not one sound insight when  occuring.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were viewing this from a darkened backyard in the city. The intensity was moderate to faint on a night when the sky was exceptionally clear and the moon had not yet risen. The speed and distance appeared similar to the several satellites that passed over during the same time period (+ or – 30 minutes). The usual west to east parade of passenger jet aircraft was also easily visible during this time. The configuration of this relatively tight formation did not change noticeably during the viewing period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spacing and colour led us to think that this may have been fragments of a satellite or a meteorite that had split up during entry into the earth’s atmosphere. The speed however, was slower than would have been expected from such an event.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were many stars that night and then I noticed an object with red and green flashing lights. The lights were all flashing at the same time and the object was moving across the sky fast. At first I thought it was a plan but it was moving too fast and in a different motion than a plane. As I was watching another object looking the same shot up and circled around the other one. The objects were high in the sky because a plane did fly below both the objects at a regular speed and was going straight. The objects looked like they were playing with each other and appeared to be triagular in shape although it was hard to tell. I watched the objects for a long time because it was nothing I had ever seen before. It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I as well as my wife and a neighbor were sitting on our neighbors porch as the sun was setting. We were talking about various things when I spotted a light in the sky. It was reddish orange at first sighting and fairly bright. It was stationary to the naked eye and no other visible objects or distinct lights around it. At first I though it was Jupiter and continued to watch for a minute. I then realized that it was to close to the zenith to be Jupiter and began to think it could be Mars but I was not sure due to my not seeing a star chart in about a year and wasn’t sure if Mars was visible yet. So I proceeded to my apartment next door and went upstairs to put my telescope on our porch and try to view it. As time went on the object dimmed very slowly. It was about 8:30 EDST when I got my scope out and had the object in my viewfinder. I then viewed it through my main eyepiece. What I saw looked almost exactly like Mars in size, shape, hue, and reflectivity. It appeared to have an atmosphere/clouds. The object had the orange/ red color but was not emitting the light on its own. As I stared I though what I saw next was caused by my eyes playing tricks on me. I saw a tiny point of white light orbiting the main object extremely fast in a teardrop shape around the object. If the main object were the point of a teardrop than the tiny point of light was moving in a clockwise motion as viewed through the scope. The point of light moved out towards the 10 O’clock  position of the main object and went out approximately 5-8 lengths of the main object in the teardrop fashion. It concluded 1 rotation at about the 1 to 2 O’clock range of the main object. One rotation was approximately 2 and ½ seconds. I started shouting to my wife, who was still downstairs on our neighbors porch, to come up to my scope quickly because I am seeing something amazingly not natural. It is now about 8:35 EDST and she is up with me. Whilst she was coming up though, I continued to view the object throu! gh my sc ope and noticed something amazing. I saw some form of a tether/ tractor  beam that appeared to be connecting the small point of light with the main object. The tether appeared to be the same hue of the main object, reddish/ orange, but it was very faint but defiantly there. My wife looked through my scope and saw what I saw, the point orbiting the main object, minus the tether due to her wearing glasses.  I looked back one more time and stared for about 1 minute than began to adjust my scope, as I hadn’t attached either tension springs.  I attached one tension spring to the left side of the scope. When I finished that I got out a 1.25” 9mm lens and tried to find the object again. I couldn’t so I put on the 2” eyepiece again and found it rather quickly but what I saw surprised me once again. The object had turned blue. It still looked the same as before with all the same features but it was just blue.  Also the small object orbiting had disappeared and so was the tether/ tractor beam. It is now about 8:40 and our neighbor is now up with us and looked through the eyepiece. He saw the blue object and was disappointed that it wasn’t something waving at him. Well I watched it for a few more minutes  and then decided to try the higher power lens. I put the lens in and noticed right away that I had forgot to take the moon filter off and so I quick took it off. It was now about 8:43. Once I put the eyepiece back in I lost sight of the object.  I immediately ran inside and began typing this for accuracy of time/description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the best I can do without have the right questions asked. Feel free to contact me for anything more that I may have no added in as I didn’t know the info was needed.<n>

I thought at first it was a plane, but there were no lights blinking on it like there were on a plane over the nearby Marin Headlands.  it seemed to be made of metal, or something that reflects, and the bottom of it was like the bottom of a bowl, reflecting the light of the sun beneath it.  The top of it was like a smaller, upside-bowl, and although it appeared to be solid, it seemed to be invisible except where the sunlight was reflecting off of it, like I was seeing the outline of a bubble in the light.  My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach. I watched it from 7:30 to 8:08 pm, when the fog rolled in, and it disappeared. Several other people on the beach also witnessed it and took pictures with their cell phones.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/21/08 18:50|Denver|CO|Disk|1-2 minutes|Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65335.html|152|ndxe200808| Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn&#39;t pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object&#39;s distance from the ground couldn&#39;t have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path; to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.<n>

It also looked like it may have been jumping around a bit. It was emitting red and blue and white lights. After a while it slowly started to move to the right, and then up.

I live in a rural area and on this night the sky was very clear. I noticed a white light in the sky that I assumed was a plane. When first noticed it was moving in a straight line but upon focusing on the light I noticed it was moving in an erratic pattern. After watching the light dance around in the sky for about 5 minutes I called my brother outside to watch it with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed within my sight for at least 25 minutes and it was at about the same altitude as a plane but did not have the colored signaling lights as planes do. The light would hover in one spot for a while then it would shoot forward very fast. It would also go from right to left and in circles not moving much from its original position.<n>

There are large windows that extend across the entire south wall of my room.  I rolled over to face the south and look out the window.  About forty yards away, floating in my backyard, was a ball of light.  It was about the size of a large globe.  The light was a bright, pure, white.  Before I could hardly register what I was seeing, the light zoomed directly at me with incredible speed. Astonishingly, the globe was silent, and did not seem to disturb the night air.  For a split second I was face to face with this thing.  I jumped because I thought it was going to hit me.  Then it veered off quickly to the right and moved rapidly around the side of my house and was gone.  I tried to run into the other room to see if I could still see it, but I never saw it again.  This incident was the weirdest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.  I did not believe in UFOs.  I sill don&#39;t know what to make of what I saw.

I was very shocked, but then I saw two more coming from the same area going the same direction, following each other. Then another light shows up out of nowhere on the right side, moving towards the other two lights. They met and the new light began leading the way going Southeast downwards towards Earth.

I paused to look up to see if I could see any shooting stars, as I read this past week was active for shooting stars.  After looking up and scanning the sky for a few moments, it took a few seconds for me to realize that I was seeing something very large was passing over the neighborhood.  It did not have lights, was comepletely silent, moving slowly from north to south.  I was able to make out the widened triange shape as my eyes adjusted to the dark, and as it blocked out the stars as it traveled.  It seemed to be at the level of a low flying airplane. and seemed as wide as a house.  It appeared to have lighter and darker areas in on the bottom of it, but not illuminated.  I only got a quick glimpse of it as I was in town, with too much lamplight, trees, and houses. I am surprised I could see it at all, as it had no lights.  I know though that I saw something, because it blocked out the stars, and blocked out a red flashing light from an airplane flying very high in the sky.  Not a cloud, not a bird, though my mind&#39;s first split seconds impression was a gliding bird, or a kite until I realized it was way too large and was triangular shaped. I live north of Ft. Hood, and wondered also if it is some kind of military stealth craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointing up, yelling.. “Look, look look” trying to bring to the attention of my son and wife. Just then the object seem to get bigger and brighter but only for a second or so. Now the object still seemly moving from north to south but now it’s traveling out bound and the point of light fade to nothing… all this with a 5 to 10 second time frame.  I believe that the bigger and bright image I witnessed would be the results of a firing of a engine of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife did not seem any thing and my 11-year-old son said that he did see it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was evening/dawn and no clouds in the sky. It looked like some kind of bolt or beam. Not sure. The whole thing was very bright and looked reflective and shiny.

From Saratoga, WY we went North  to I-80, and then East back to Laramie, WY and this picture was taken at about mile marker 255 on I-80 going east and only to look at the wind generators and take picture of them.  Only upon downloading our pictures from the camera to the computer did we discover the round formations in the picture and we would like your opinions of what you think it might be.<n>

Then we looked around where we sighted the first one initially and others began to appear. There were two that were above what we initially thought was a triangle formation. The two above the others were moving up and down but seemed to be stationed in the same location. All began to flicker and we witnessed one in particular move horizontally, flash then flicker out. We then witnessed three form a vertical line on the right side of the triangle formation. We were astounded because there appeared to be many more than we originally thought. We   got weirded out and left the area. Amazing spectacle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

D.C. I awoke about 3:30am because I had to go to the bathroom but didn&#39;t get up immediately. As I lay there, I was on my left side facing a large double window a few feet away. As I lay there a large triangular craft passed over the roof of my unit passing over the roof of the the units directly across the courtyard from where I was and then I lost sight of it. I would estimate the altitude of this craft to be no more than five-hundred feet and it was traveling in a north-easterly direction. It was moving slowly and I estimated the speed to be in the neighborhood of thirty-five miles per hour, give or take. I didn&#39;t make any sound that I could detect. I would estimate the size of the craft to be about three-hundred feet on a side; maybe a little larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this happened in the middle of the night, the sky does not get really dark here because of all the lighting in the area so I saw the craft fairly well. It appeared to be flat-black against the lighter sky and there were low intensity lights at the points of the triangle. There were no visible windows that I could see but I only had a view of the bottom of the craft. The best way I can describe the movement is that it appeared to just slide effortlessly across the sky rather than fly as would a conventional aircraft. I told one other person who lives in the community about the incident but I could tell I wasn&#39;t believed so I kept it to myself. I would have reported the incident to a Government agency but I know how that would go so I didn&#39;t bother. I can state that this craft did not depend on air moving over the surface to keep it airborne because it was traveling far too slow for that to be a factor. I can also state that whatever technology this craft possessed was far advanced to anything that I am aware that this country or any other country currently employs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

There appeared to be a &#34;star&#34; directly NE at about 50 degrees above the horizon. There were multiple &#34;explosions?&#34; surrounding the &#34;star&#34; at random. From the eyes&#39; view they seemed to be anywhere from directly next to it, to 3&#34; beyond it in any direction. The &#34;star&#34; would move in small amounts no more than 1cm from the eyes&#39; view during the &#34;expolosions&#34; The explosions would look like another bright star that quickly appeared and disappeared. At one point I saw &#34;projectiles&#34; (2) shaped like chevrons come from the star toward a target that i could not see. I also witnessed multiple other flashes come from the star that looked like shooting stars. The event has seemed to calm down now. I awoke my wife who also confirmed this event and described the movement of the star as a small orbital pattern and also witnessed multiple &#34;expolsions&#34;<n>

We were at a house in the country, about 4-5 miles from Mt. Pulaski. We were outside getting in the car when we noticed a very bright light in the sky over the Mt. Pulaski area.  It was brighter than a star and the light dimmed and got brighter repeatedly.  It was round or disk shaped and appeared to be rotating.  The craft would also zig-zag back and forth.  It did not have any blinking lights like a plane has and at times seemed to just hover.  I am a 23 year old female who lives at home and takes dental classes.  My friend is a C.N.A. who works in a nursing home.  She is 26.  We have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out the window, and I saw three sets of what looked like headlights floating by, as though they were in a convoy. They were not bright, and caused no reflection or light movement inside the room, as a car&#39;s headlights would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each orb-shaped light had a haze around it, but I couldn&#39;t make out an actual object. They moved in pairs, one pair behind the other, moving towards my house, hence my description of &#34;headlights.&#34; I saw them for about 10 seconds, as they passed in front of my house and out of sight of me. They moved fairly slowly, my best guess being that they were traveling about as fast as a car moving at about 15-20mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The burnt orange orbs appeared to be about the size of tennis balls from where I saw them, and they were just above the tree line along the road that passes in front of my house, about 120 yards in distance from my house,but they did not seem to get larger as they moved towards my house. I have no idea what they were or what they could have been, hence &#34;unidentified flying object.&#34; Just an odd occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, except that it was strange, until my neighbor asked later in the morning if I saw anything that was odd at about that time earlier in the morning. Apparently, they saw it also, but wouldn&#39;t say what they saw or fully admit to seeing anything (that is why I said I was the only witness).<n> <n><n> <n><n> her story ends here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am a 13 year old and i was not certainly dreaming or faking this because i went to my kitchen to drink soda and i was pretty amazed what could it be ???i know it is not normal but to show you what i looked at here is what it looked like<n>

At first I thought it was a tower of some sort, but it was different than anything I have ever seen. It looked like some type of rectangular craft that had two bright lights pointing in what seemed to be the front of the craft. The beams of the lights seemed to go out for many many feet although I couldn’t be sure from the ground. Their were two lights on the bottom that were the same, pointing to the ground. The craft didn’t seem to be moving at all, and when we stopped at a stop sign, we saw that it was floating just above the treetops, and not moving. When we turned and got a look at what I believe was the back, we saw five to ten lights as bright as the others, but with no beams. We rolled the windows down and heard nothing. A plane or helicopter would have made some type of noise, and this was like nothing we had ever seen before. I am convinced what we saw was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They had more than an airplane would have.  It looked like two flying side by side.  They came from out of the west (from near Easton, PA) headed east towards Phillipsburg, NJ.  They flew 5 miles or so easterly and then turned over Alpha, NJ.  They flew along route 78 and then made a right turn headed west.  It looked like they were following route 78 between PA and NJ.  They flew over Williams Township, PA.  After talking to my son (who lives in Easton, PA), he also saw them flying, they had lights and looked to be two crafts together.  As he watched, they appeared to make a right turn to head east again.  All through observing the lights, I heard no noises at all.  There were no engine or propulsion noises whatsoever.  Because I was in the Air Force, I am familiar with the noises of aircraft engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to make a big loop at least four times.  After the fourth time, when they came east over NJ, they turned south and then seemed to leave<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a bit but they didn’t come back.  I would like to note that all through my observations, the crafts flew slowly, much more slowly than would an airplane or jet or other aircraft.  They were about as high as a pipercub or helicopter would fly, however, the craft were neither of these.  It almost seemed as though they were looking for something along route 78 or following 78.<n>

Within seconds of seeing this get brighter it started to pull away and dim.  It pulled all the way back and disappeared.  At first i though it might be a shooting star but it didn&#39;t fall from the sky and didn&#39;t have any tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

This blue light did not flash, but was continuous in color. It was traveling at a speed that we have never seen a plane or a helicopter travel at. The light traveled across the sky at such a speed that it disappeared into the distance so quickly that we were unable to see it any longer (there were no clouds in the direction the blue light was). We have a good deal of knowledge and experience in astronomy as well as physics - this was definitely not a meteor, a star, or a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked to the west and saw about six lights hovering vertically in the sky.  The object looked to be very low in the sky, and very large.  It was probably a couple hundred feet long.  We pulled over and watched it, as we were watching it, it started to slowly turn revealing the underneath of the object.  The sky was a dark blue which allowed us to see that it was black and triangular shaped.  We turned down a side street to try and follow it, as we followed the object the six lights were still visible.  About 15 seconds later the lights began to shut off one by one.  As the lights began dimming, the object also seemed to fly away at a rapid speed.  We tried to watch it for as long as possible but it completely disappeared within the next 5 seconds. I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A UFO.<n>

There was a total of six of us horseback riding in the area of Beaver Lake located in Avon, Colorado on August 19th, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were five guests and one guide who left the Beaver Creek Stables at approximately 09:45 hours and rode up to Beaver Lake.

After eating a box lunch and fishing for trout in the Beaver Lake, we mounted up and started headed back down the mountain to the stables around 13:15 hours.  The skies were bright blue and sunny.  The ride was uneventful with nothing out of the ordinary seen or heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home and reviewing the digital photographs, I found two photographs that show a very distinct disk or saucer shaped object just above one of the mountains.  The images were taken with a Nikon D80 high-resolution camera.

I was looking out the window, and I saw three sets of what looked like headlights floating by, as though they were in a convoy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not bright, and caused no reflection or light movement inside the room, as a car&#39;s headlights would do.  Each orb-shaped light had a haze around it, but I couldn&#39;t make out an actual object.  They moved in pairs, one pair behind the other, moving towards my house, hence my description of &#34;headlights.&#34;  I saw them for about 10 seconds, as they passed in front of my house and out of sight of me.  They moved fairly slowly, my best guess being that they were traveling about as fast a car moving at about 15-20mph.  The burnt orange orbs appeared to be about the size of tennis balls from where I saw them, and they were just above the tree line along the road that passes in front of my house, about 120 yards in distance from my house,but they did not seem to get larger as they moved towards my house.  I have no idea what they were or what they could have been, hence &#34;unidentified flying object.&#34;  Just an odd occurrence.  I honestly didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, except that it was strange, until my neighbor asked later in the morning if I saw anything that was odd at about that time earlier in the morning.  Apparently, they saw it also, but wouldn&#39;t say what they saw or fully admit to seeing anything (that is why I said I was the only witness).<n>

The light then got very bright and sped west into the night sky.

8/18/08 21:00|Fremantle (Australia)||Fireball|5 seconds|I was driving alone on a street which was quite dim in that area next to a golf course and a rural grass area overlooked but no lights|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65267.html|188|ndxe200808| I was driving alone on a street which was quite dim in that area next to a golf course and a rural grass area overlooked but no lights from either side and it was early spring(it gets dark by 6-7pm). There was a car in front of me but I am certain it did not slow down or had any light changes that might have caused my seeing during the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving about 60km/h in an inclined road but not significant enough for any object i saw on my right to descend from the sky about 1 metre relative to me on my driver&#39;s window side in about 1 second. My first guess was that it might have been just a plane landing close to me, but there was no airport around that area and there should have been sound if it was, none was heard and it was not windy tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the second time i looked, it was actually a burning &#34;fireball-like&#34; object descending so quickly in the air and very far away from me that i figured it was travelling at a very swift speed, descending 90 degrees down from the horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In within 2-3 seconds of watching the descend when i realised the incident was rather inhuman the object stopped in the air for about 1 second as if it knew i was watching, and the fire burned brighter as if it&#39;s engine fired up and propelled towards exactly were i was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the fire was dimmer( something like how a jet plane gets its propulsion force from the burning of fuel but seemed like rocket&#39;s engines used in mid-air) i saw an object that looked like the back of a jet plane, but without the top wing which i assumed to be a flat surfaced object with 2 wings and the hole that produced fire was relatively about 70% of that UFO&#39;s size. Right after the fire was put out, there was absolutely nothing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these happened in within 5 seconds or less and i actually stopped accelerating(not brake) but not accelerating to look over that object. There was no illusion or reflection, because I am a smoker and i had my window down but i was not smoking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to me it just travelled in an unbelievable speed like breaking the speed of light as soon as i realised that object was not normal. That however, might have been coincidence, but the acceleration it had was definitely not and no sound was produced, not even change in wind, nothing around me changed or moved that was ideal before.<n>

It was far away and traveling West to East rather quickly. It looked to be just slightly smaller than a dime at the distance it was. At first I thought it must be a plane but as I focused on it a few things struck me as odd. 1) it was moving quite fast 2) it was INTENSELY SHINNY 3) it looked flat and round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After only a few seconds it just disappeared. It was not as if it shot upward or down or anything like that it just was gone. I kept watching the sky to see if maybe it had turned or something but there was nothing and then about 3-5 seconds after it disappeared a huge black helicopter came into view from the West slightly closer and continued to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing took place in a matter of 10 seconds or so about 11:55 AM Monday, August 18, 2008  In my line of work I am always on the road at various times of day and night. I have always been one to watch the sky. I have seen many shooting stars, a satellite and glowing greenish meteor during a fall meteor shower. What I saw today was quite strange. It reminded me of a round mirror in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a grayish oval object hovering above the trees.  I watched it go down behind the tree line and then rise again several times.  I took pictures of it with my cell phone, but the object was too far away.  I tried to enlarge them, but the object is just blurred out. I am in a 3 story building and the object was about the same height, maybe a bit higher.  I could also swear that it seemed to be changing shape.  Started out pretty big, appeared to decrease in size, flatten out, and even looked to change into a diamond shape sort of.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 20 miles away.  I am at work, so I had to do an xray.  When I came back it was gone and has not returned since.  I had one of my skeptical work mates look at it, and all she could say was that it had to be tethered to something.  It was raining here this morning with a slight breeze.  If it was a balloon, it was pretty big and grayish, not your typical bright balloon that you would associate with a promotion of some sort.  I really don&#39;t know what this was, but I felt compelled to report it.  Thank You<n>

We were visiting in a loft of their garage and my friends boyfriend left to go use the restroom. When he came back he quietly and calmly said to come over and look out the window. Stating &#34;look who&#39;s crazy now&#34;, being he had told me about seeing these things constantly since he was young. Nearly every day from how he made it out. When I came to the window I saw a light pattern that was strange moving in the sky. At this point I must admit I was a skeptic at best, but I do have an open mind and find his stories interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a light pattern just above the tree line, moving a lot like a plane. But then it stopped, and started sinking behind the trees. Most strange thing was, when my friends significant other said something like &#34;see, just above the tree line&#34;, it stopped and sank as if it were reacting to his voice. I walked around and kept watching for about 15 minutes to see if it were still there, which a little light was still visible, but it was just behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I find most interesting about this is that on this day, Indiana had several earthquakes, which is very uncommon. On top of that, I&#39;ve heard that Indianapolis airport shut down due to a &#34;unidentified flying object&#34; sighted by the tower. I just tonight tried to find an article related to this but didn&#39;t have much success. Granted it was a mediocre search in the grand view of real research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But that is getting me away from my story. We return to the loft to go about our conversation and he is telling me that its a totally common event for him. And goes into story after story about his encounters. Most disturbing was when he was telling me that a lot of times people missed these things because as he put it &#34;they tend to make false noises, like helicopter, planes or jets to throw you off&#34;. That is when I felt like I was in a movie. Not 3 seconds after he got done with the word &#34;jet&#34; I hear just that. Like clockwork. He, not being phased by this at all mentioned that &#34;they&#34; very well might be out there again.We pop our heads out the window and we see just that. Two this time. I go running outside to see the show and there it is again. He the mentions that the one we saw earlier was right on top of the building we were in when he saw it, at this time comparing notes with each other, and finding out that it moved when I came up. And there they sat, above the tree line, maybe 125 feet high, and they just sink right below it, like a cat trying to catch a rodent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing that I recall seeing was right before they left all together the second one that appeared made an amazingly bright flash, a lot like the one on a camera and off of it shot a little orb that went into a crazy free spin through the sky that didn&#39;t seem to have any real pattern to it. And then they were all gone. That was the last thing I sighted this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have one new recent sighting which is to follow in my next report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was at a friend&#39;s house who has wide open fields out back (he lives on the edge of town) when i noticed an object in the sky.  i figured not to high up maybe 1,500-2000 feet in the air, so i tried to write it off as a stationary object light a light tower or something.  Then i noticed it moved. It was round and had one white,yellow,red,blue light on it which appeared to be rotating around it in the center. (the object itself may have been rotating or just the lights i&#39;m not positive) but anyway i figured oh well and went to sleep. The next day went by normal i was at my friends again but there was no light this time. The next day went by and around 10pm you figure when all lights should be on that are stationary or you&#39;d see a star already there was nothing in the sky at my friends field. I walked home around to notice that this object was now over his field again. (i live about two long blocks away and can see the airspace over his field from a big gap in the treeline) and there the object is. Floating and blinking. i wrote it off and slept again. The next night i was in newburg spending the night at a local hospital with my girlfriend who was ill. Again around 11 at night the same object appeared in the sky and about 500ft higher then i and about 800yards out the object floated (note that i was on a top floor and facing the complete opposite direction of walden. It was a very cloudy night which made me notice it. it was far to cloudy to see stars that night so it had to be below the clouds. An airplane showed in the horizon and the object disappeared only to reappear after the plane was gone. the object reappeared and disappeared in the corner of the horizon floating in and out of the clouds. i fell asleep. The next day i had left my friends house(mentioned before) and we checked the lot behind his house before i left (it was around 10:30pm) we all agreed there was no light no nothing there. But on my walk home just as i was walking d! own my r oad the object had appeared, and alot closer this time just over the line of trees across my road it moved or rather how i would put slicked it&#39;s way through the air virtually silent in all ways. Well i&#39;m not going to lie here. i&#39;ll admidt it. I ran as fast as i could to try and get inside my home it creeped me out. Now i&#39;m not exactly slow and the object was going somewhat slow when it flew over me i ran and by the time i got to my door i looked back to see it in the gapped treeline again. Hovering in my friends field. me and my brother had checked on it ever half hour and we saw it gonig in small circles and move up and down and left and right. again around the same time. I had forgot to mention until now that also during the week at one point all my friends were outside my friends house (the field owner) and we witnessed two of the same objects i had describes flying extremely close and not to low and not to high virtually soundless zipping across the sky. my girlfriend had researched what i saw and came to here so that&#39;s why i&#39;m here she pointed out a case in kingston on the 8th of august that sounds very similar to the object i&#39;ve seen so i made my report here. I plan to further investigate this. i plan to go out in the field at night on my own with a camera of some sort so i can get really close to this hovering object. I hope to provide more proof.<n>

At first I thought a plane, but I was startled enough to call my friend outside to see and he told me what I feared , that it was a ufo. The craft was hovering and slowly moving south , toward the airport. From my point of view I could see the red lights of a water tower stand still as this object moved in the background, from one side of it to the other, like it was moving further and further away the whole time strobing the length of the craft sort of giving it a shape it happened this way until about 8:08p.m. when it moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 25 min. later I saw two planes flying in formation which is weird because I never see that sort of thing, except for at an air  show, or on T.V. and the thing about those planes that caught my eye was that they strobed at the same time and stayed at the same altitude, flying the same length apart for what looked like the whole city .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night about 9:15 p.m. I was returning home from dropping off my friend, driving east on N.W. 30th street crossing N.

At first i thought it was an ultralite but it appeared to be over 1500 ft in air and i think ultra lites are allowed to fly 500 ft and below and definitely not allowed to fly over airspace like the bush airport. It was hard to see clearly due to clouds and the distance but it slowed down and seem to turn back to the southeast. the speed was not very fast.

Maybe someone has a rational answer for what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear as can be but very high in the sky above the highway I saw a formation of white dots.  There were eight dots with a line down the center, four on each side, exactly the way a domino with 8 dots would be set up.  Never losing form it slowly moved through the sky leaving a chemtrail looking trail of white dots behind it.  Round white dots evenly spaced making four perfect lines of dots behind it.  The older dots had dissapated leaving just a cloudy white ribbon for miles and the newer made ones stayed as dots for quite some time.  The formation didn&#39;t move in a straight line, it slowly turned and twisted a bit and went in and out from a cloud all the while the trail of dots were evenly spit from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how long it lasted.  I watched it for a few minutes until I had finally driven past it.  I don&#39;t know how many other drivers saw it, it was very visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture with my phone while driving but it didn&#39;t come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very curious if anyone has any idea what that was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible skywriting, we believe.

You could see as this thing moved up and down that it was moving slowly,but every time we lost in behind tree&#39;s,it would appear again very very far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could see that this was definitely not a plane or helicopter and there was no way a blimp could get so far away from us so quickly as we were doing about 75mph.It was a blueish colored object that at times would look more round,but over all looked like a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it for at least 15 minutes until we turned off on to the Garden State Parkway and then lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were trying to really figure out what this was and were actually joking at first with our kids that it was a UFO.The joking soon turned to puzzlement as we could not,and still cannot determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wondering if anyone else in the NJ area spotted this?<n>

It was going South in the horizon and slightly up, as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this for maybe 5-7 minutes or so, discussing what it could be (it had no blinking lights to suggest it was a plane or helicopter of any kind.) when suddenly we see this BRIGHT white flash where the orange light was (which caused me to flinch; it was startling) then just a few seconds later a sonic boom.

Upon looking in the sky, I witnessed an odd sight and alerted my two friends. When they looked up, all of us witnessed together several white, round type craft/vapor craft? passing overhead. This sight was highly unusual as the objects/vaporous crafts were traveling in a formation shaped as a rectangle. We were amazed and shocked at what we were seeing, they appeared to be moving in sequence &amp; in synch with each other, not that far spaced from one another. As we continued to watch them travel into a cloud, we seen them reappear out the other end of the cloud and continue traveling off into the horizon. There were multiple craft, possibly considered a fleet. There was a long white craft at the bottom of cloud, that we couldnt see too well. The white fleet seemed to change position as they were further away &amp; a second set was seen as well. After this, they apparently seemed to be lesser craft in the distance &amp; then we lost sight of them. There were 98 + craft seen and counted &amp; these objects did not make any noise at any time. It was truly unexpected and unbelievable all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night outside, millions of stars in the sky. Not a cloud in sight. It was warm (about 800 outside) at 11:30pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had pulled over to look at all the stars and see if we could see a UFO or anything else in the sky. While there, we had seen approximately 3 objects that were very unusual. When someone would spot something in the sky (way up there) that was moving, I would shine my flashlight on it so everyone could see the object and follow it with there eyes. The 3 objects in question would be flying along (as one solid white light) then just disappear as we were tracking it with our eyes. There was no explanation for this. Where did it go? One minute it was there and the next it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 30-45 minutes. In that time frame we saw the flight path of the airplanes to our immediate north and to our immediate south. Very few planes (3) flew by us. The planes to our North were so far north that we could barely make them out. The planes to our South we could clearly tell that they were planes because they had lights on the crafts and we could hear the noise as they flew by us. No mistaking them for anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45minutes we were talking about leaving when I spotted this solid bright white light (way up there) in the Southern sky. I told everyone to look (shining my flashlight up at the object) when all of a sudden the object turned toward us and shot a beam of light at us (as if acknowledging that it saw our light) then it simply turned and shot West into the night sky and simply disappeared right before our eyes just like the previous 3 objects we had seen earlier. The beam of light was as wide as the object itself. It was no search light from a helicopter or any other aircraft that I know of. Besides, it simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it turned and shot the beam of light at us, I screamed and stared to dart back into the vehicle because I was afraid that it would come down out of the sky and do something to us. The other 2 people with me simply froze. We didn’t know what to say to each other afterward or even believe what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have a hard time believing it to this day.<n>

It looked like it was on fire because of the orange-red so we assummed that it was a meteor.  There was no tail.  It never varied it&#39;s speed.  It was flying against the flight patterns of O&#39;Hare Airport.  It was following the path of planes very high overhead going cross country, but it was much lower.  There were no navigation lights in the front or back of the object.  A little while later we saw a satelite and it had a totally different shape and color.  The other interesting part of this is we were able to hear airplanes (the engines) all around us and farther away that the object that passed almost directly over us.  The object that passed over us had no sound what-so-ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There were no stars visible and the sky was a blue color at the time. As I was nearing the object it seemed to be moving to my left then back to the right and then to the left again. When I got close to the object you could almost make out a shape to it but not certain on the exact shape.  When I was about to pass under the light it suddenly just disappeared, and I could not spot it again in the sky.

At about 12:30 am, on August 16th, it was a very foggy night, myself and my boyfriend witnessed this object moving very sporadically in and out of the fog, the fog would cover over the object making it much dimmer, after which the object would swerve very quickly back and forth in what seemed to us as a 2-3 ft area and emerge at the bottom of the fog and brightened. At one moment in time an airplane flew overhead the object did not move, almost as if it were disguising itself as star. After watching this object for about an hour, I went to get binoculars, when I turned back the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Towards the end of the intermission we noticed a strange strobing light, but concluded it was simply our eyes appearing to make a star “twinkle”.  Once the second movie began the bright star caught each of our eyes several times.  With my peripheral vision, I witnessed this “star” moving slowly to the right and found this very odd because it did not appear to be a plane.  I commented to my fiancé about this and he dismissed my claims.  Shortly later we both realized that this object had moved much closer to us and was approaching at a high altitude to the right of our view.  We kept our eyes fixed on the object as it moved closer to us and eventually, right over our heads.  By this time we had gained a new perspective on this object.  What we could now see was that it had a triangular shape.  With a light in each of its three corners and two red lights on it’s back.  At the point of the object was a blinking white light.  The lighting in the sky at dusk and the position of our car made it so I could lie across the back seat and watch this object glide overhead.  I never let my vision falter as I watched the object continue across the sky and out of view.  About 20 minutes later this object returned from the direction that it came and continued from a slight left of our vehicle, to its original rightward position.  It was much higher this time and for a good period later hovered above the hills in the distance.  No sound except for a dull humming could be heard when this object passed overhead.  We were both genuinely stunned to witness such a thing.  There was also at least one other triangular craft with a similar light pattern in the distance.  We could not see the details of this one as closely, but it appeared to be of a similar build.  At one point an object passed much lower than the others and more in front of our view from the car.  We coul! d not se e the lights on this craft as easily, as it appeared to have a fog light effect.  What made this sighting interesting was the shape of this particular craft, very similar to that of a stingray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned home we each drew a picture of what we had personally seen.  Our pictures have very similar details and when I got on the internet and searched for a place to report this, I read a few articles from the past few months and saw something about a wave of reports this summer in Pennsylvania.  I am not surprised; Pennsylvania has been a hotbed of UFO sightings since the early 1960’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking through binoculars, there were several points of light that seemed to be pulsating around a circular object.  It looked kind of like a ferris wheel.  There seemed to be a few of these across the sky, and the lights were more green or orange than regular stars.  The main craft moved back and forth across the sky very quickly, without making any noise.  Sometimes it would leave for a few hours, only to return to the same point across the lake from our cottage.  The other objects also moved around the sky, but seemed farther away.  This happened three nights in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It slowly began to increase in size to a perfect white circle to about 2-3 times the size of a pea held at arms length.  It then stopped increasing in size and then blinked out.   Several seconds later I thought I saw a very faint dot move rapidly south from the position where I first saw this light.  This couldn’t be a meter as no trial or sparks or other colors were seen with this light, it was a white perfect circle.  There were no other lights seen attached to it suggesting aircraft running lights or tail lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It took place at Salem County, New Jersey. It took place at my house. My home is on a dead-end street and surrounded by woods. It was about 9 or 10 o’clock at night. I took my dog out to go to the bathroom. Roughly after a minute when I was outside I looked into the sky which I noticed an object flying really low.  The object was a greenish metallic, right triangle. It was roughly 50-75 feet above my head and made no noise. It flew over my head and into the woods away from me at a very slow speed. The object had white and yellow lights that formed at each point. Also I noticed the object had a very intricate design under it as it flew by. When I saw the object instantly a feeling of deep fear and concern came over me. All I could do was look.

I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver’s side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no<n> <n><n> &#34;halo&#34; or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I’m not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm’s length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.<n>

I had just left the town of Perrysburg heading east on Rte. 795 when I happened to glance up at the sky, as it was a full moon out and a storm had just passed. I was checking to see if there were any more dark clouds when all of a sudden, off in the direction of the northeast, I saw what I originally thought was a cluster of three stars, placed close together in a straight line. This had piqued my curiosity because I had never seen anything like that before. I continued to drive, periodically glancing up at the sky and noticing that the object did not move. It remained in my field of vision for about 6 miles until I turned off the highway onto an exit ramp. I continued to look at the object through the rearview mirror as I was now heading south down a country road. As I pulled into the subdivision that I lived in, I happened to look back to the northeast- but instead of the three star-like objects, there appeared a large object, shaped almost like a blimp, with five or six white lights making the outline of the object and three red lights in the center of the white ones. I followed the object as it moved east to west at what I would guess to say would be about 50 miles per hour had it been traveling on the ground. I lost sight of the object as it passed over the nearby train yard on the other side of the road, as my view of the sky to the west is obscured by the trains and a grove of trees nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object hovers silently over Caesar&#39;s mountain which is located close to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Caesar Mountain is 3,323 feet above sea level, and the glowing object is suspended well above the summit the majority of the time it is visible.  At times the object will dip below the tree-line, then reappear minutes later high up over the mountain and in a completely different location from where it disappeared!  We&#39;ve tried to use binoculars to get a closer look, but can&#39;t distinguish a shape. The binoculars do, however, sharply bring the intensity of the lights into focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights on the object will glow a brilliant white, then dim.  It also has a brilliant blue haze within the white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were alarmed this morning when the light &#34;winked out&#34; and suddenly disppeared after hovering high over the mountain for almost 30 minutes, then abruptly became visible miles away over a ridge.  It briefly shined intensely, and discharged what looked like a beam of light from underneath the object.  It actually (briefly)illuminated the trees beneath! It then shot off with a remarkable acceleration of speed and disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve tried to find a rational explanation for this object.  It&#39;s most definitely not a star, and we&#39;ve also ruled out headlights from vehicles on Lobelia road as the binoculars proved that the object is far above the treeline most of the time.  The object is silent and there is no audible aircraft noise from rotor blades or engines, so we&#39;re positively sure that it&#39;s not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport in Lewisburg, WV which is located about 30 miles away in Greenbrier County.  The aircraft traffic that utilizes that particular field consists of small jets and prop aircraft.  The noise they make is audible when they fly over our area.  Caesars Mountain is quite close to our home, less than three miles away, so it stands to reason that we would be able to hear any noise the object emitted-if it were a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, the conventional aircraft traffic flying over our area has visible flashing red and green running lights.  The object we witnessed does not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet, we suspect.  PD))<n>

There was an aurora borealis that night. It had been unseasonably warm and so around 1 in the morning a thick fog started rolling in. There is a patch of woods behind the restaurant about 100 feet across the rear parking lot that goes back about 75-100 feet to houses and apartments. I started to hear a strange buzzing and brought it to my friends attention, we then saw 3 dim lights that appeared to be attached to an object  starting from top left in a diagonal line to bottom right and moved from left to right.  The bottom of the object was about 4 feet above the ground and the top of it was about 12-15 feet above the ground.  It looked as though it were ghosting through the trees as it was in the thick of them about 20 feet from the edge of the parking lot.  We stood dumbfounded as it moved through the woods until it disappeared and the thick fog with it.  I w! as excited and said &amp;quot;holy &amp;@!? Did you guys see that?  It was a UFO!&amp;quot; 4 of the group were speechless but the looks on their faces said i was crazy and the 2 others who were preparing to enter the marines laughed and agreed that it was a helicopter.  The topic was quickly dropped and they resumed having fun.  I am convinced to this day it was not a helicopter as at that distance it would have been very loud and it was about as loud as the traffic going by on the road in front of the restaurant and a helicopter can&#39;t fly in the woods below the tree line.  Also the fact that it stopped us dead in the middle of what we were doing to stand still and silent as we watched.  I am a very curious individual, when I see something unknown I like to investigate yet I stood still and did nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was traveling through the area of Addison, Pennsylvania.  As I was approaching a turn I looked up in the sky and noticed something, as did my passenger.  We both saw it and commented on it at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I slowed the car down to get a better look at it I noticed that it was in the shape of a disc. It had a faint orange glow to it and was not moving. As I continued to stare it began to fade, which my passenger also noted. It went from a faint orange color and continued to fade until neither I, nor my passenger could see it. At this point I was nearing a heavily wooded area and was not able to see it either way. After I passed the area I continued to look for anything in the sky, anywhere, that would have held any similarity to what I had seen, but could find nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident lasted no longer than ten seconds tops. One thing I might mention, although it may have no impact on anyone’s opinions, is that my passenger is extremely cynical when it comes to these sort of things and has never believed in them. But even they felt convinced that what we had seen was something very out of the ordinary. I truly believe it was a UFO.<n>

At first the wife said it was a plane but the lights were to bright and it was moving way to fast for a plane. So i just thought it was a satalite, because it was moving as fast as one, but 10 times brighter. So i watched it for about 10 seconds or so  and i took my eyes of off of it for maybe 2 seconds to tell my wife something and i looked up and it was gone. We panned the sky and the overly bright light was gone and we couldn&#39;t figure out how it could just disappear so fast. So i basically said anything that can move that fast it could be only one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light made the area as clear as day and than he saw a red circular shape object the size of an excercise ball appear in the sky. The object made no sounds and than proceeded to descend into the illuminated tree zone. From there he ran to get my Grandmother and when they returned everything was restored to its natural state.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had two sets of orange lights and two sets of yellow lights, it was dark so I couldn&#39;t see the body just the lights. Normally I would have thought that this was a plane but it seemed to come out of nowhere and was traveling extremely fast at high altitude. I am a former U.S. Air Force Senior Airmen and I know planes very well; I&#39;ve been an avid aeronautics fans since I was very young and can tell the difference between an F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat from very far away, (Subtle differences that the uninitiated wouldn&#39;t be able to discern).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate this object appeared fairly brightly at first and then within seconds faded away while traveling at a high rate of speed even though it was very high up in the sky. The array of lights was such that it basically to on a sort of rectangle shape but that is solely based on the light configuration as I could not see the body since it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often work outside my backyard at night and I&#39;m always looking at the sky while lying on my back doing sit ups and resting often for at least 45 minutes a night. I&#39;m very used to seeing satellites and shooting stars as well as all sorts of aircraft. This object was either an extremely large and fast top secret U.S. military aircraft with astonishing flight characteristics or an advanced vehicle from somewhere beyond our planet. Those are the only two possibilities in my mind. I&#39;m curious if anyone else saw it but probably not due to it&#39;s extremely short duration in view, (Around 4 seconds tops).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers<n>

It was a white color with a long tail that was following it then  smaller different colored balls shooting off of it.  So I initially thought it may have been a firework, then suddenly it began making vertical circles and followed into a zigzag motion.  Seeing this I decided to pullover and take a better look because I was on my motorcycle.  The portion of highway I was on is raised so I had a good view over looking the buildings below easily.  When I pulled over the tail stopped and know it was a pulsating red object that was also turning white and was still shooting off balls that were colored green, purple and red they were shooting off in three&#39;s and from those balls a couple other even smaller balls were shooting off.  Then a guy in my class pulled over wondering in front of me so I pulled up to him and asked him if he saw what was looking at?  He actually pulled over to see if I needed help.  So I pointed out the light to him which was only pulsating bye now which at first he had trouble identifying at first because of airplanes in the sky. Then we  watched the light move west in a zig zagging motion along with an up and down movement with figure eights and swoops.  After about five minutes we were going to leave and it pulsated real bright and I pointed it just in time to see it drop to the ground and the sky lit up like a bomb was dropped and where it lit up a smoke flume rose into the air.  After the explosion which looked like it was about  4 or 5 miles away directly south  southeast of chicago.  The object rose back into the air dimly light at flew in a northwest direction quickly.  Then I left to go home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/14/08 20:12|El Paso|TX|Teardrop|4 to 7 minutes|Two objects in sky over El Paso, Texas|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65227.html|242|ndxe200808| Two objects in sky over El Paso, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO sighting El Paso, Texas August 14, 2008 @ approximately 8:12 PM MST<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8:12 pm MST, I and my step-son were heading north on Vista Del Sol Road in east El Paso, Texas on August 14, 2008. I looked up into the sky as I was driving and saw two objects about a half a mile in front of me land distance. I was just coming to the intersection of Vista Del Sol Rd. and Lomaland Rd. to a red light. It was dusk (almost dark) and their was a large thunderstorm coming in from the north. I watched the objects as I was stopped at the stop light. There were two dark (blackish/dark gray) objects floating (best description) across the sky. They stayed the same distance a part as they traveled. They were moving sort of towards the thunderstorm, perpendicular to Vista Del Sol. There movement reminded me of the gyrocopter from the movie the Road Warrior. But they were not gyrocopters I don’t think. Their size in relation to their altitude in the sky ruled that out as did their staying the same distance from each other. They sort of looked like they were being towed by something that wasn’t there and they were just floating behind. They had no lights and made no sound that I could hear. They didn’t appear to be moving that fast. I can not say how high in the sky they were but they didn’t appear to be to high. As if a balloon at the edge of your sight or a low flying helicopter or plane but not low enough to see detail.. They appeared to be sort of (aerodynamic motorcycle not German WW II) helmet shaped with some sort of “foundation” that protruded around the base. They had other protrusions but it was dark so you couldn’t make out any detail. It was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned right on to Lomaland so I could continue observing them. They appeared to start moving at a faster pace as they were getting nearer to the thunderstorm. This is based on the speed they were going at the stop light and where they were in the sky as I proceeded up Lomaland. I wanted to see if other folks thought they were UFOs so I pulled into the first apartment complex on the right. A young man about 14years old was there in the parking lot and I pointed at them and said “Do you see those UFOs?” He looked up into the sky and his jaw immediately dropped. He turned and ran towards the apartments yelling at his companion that there were UFOs. I drove another 10 or 15 feet into the apartment complex because I saw another guy looking right up at them. I said to him, “You see those UFOs right?” and he said, “Yes I do. I wish I had a camera.” I explained quickly that I wish I had my cell phone with me. I pulled up another twenty feet and by this time the objects were moving directly towards the thunderstorm. The thunderstorm was at least 20 miles off to the north. On the other side of El Paso International Airport. Within seconds one disappeared into the storm and then the other. I came home directly after the incident and as I was driving I didn’t see anything unusual in the sky. I did see  two planes or copters over the airport as I could see their lights blinking. The whole incident lasted maybe 4 to 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 44 year old white male. I am a wildlife biologist. I have a Bachelors degree and will complete my Masters this Winter.

The sun was setting and so it was illuminated more so. The sun was east to the read area. The area was pretty large and was a solid block of red. I tried to look for it when I arrived in Sheffield but the sun had set too much.  There were also about 30 aeroplane trials nearby in criss cross patterns, many more than usual. I wondered whether it was the plant nirubu<n>

At first the object looked like a white bird very high in the sky.  As I watched it move at a steady pace in a straight line from east to west, I could clearly see that the object was rotating in a counter-clockwise direction.  It appeared to be spinning across the sky.  The rate of rotation and movement remained constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a few clounds in the sky and the object was below the cloud level.  I watched it pass under a cloud that was close to directly overhead.  I observed the object for a few minutes, until it was too far away to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no detectable sound.  I don&#39;t know what this was, but it was clearly not a bird or a plane.  For a moment I thought it was a plastic grocery bag being blown very high, but when it got closer I could clearly see that it was rotating at a steady pace.  It looked like it was rectangular shaped, spinning about its center at about one revolution per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was at about a 70 degree angle at about 11 o&#39;clock or slightly to the left. I was up on a hill overlooking a small flood plain and watched it until it crossed over the horizon passing through the first hint of dawn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have reported this sooner but mistakenly thought that I had found an explanation. Since it went on a straight path and did none of the spectacular maneuvers UFOs are famous for I thought it might be an unusually bright satellite. Research showed that a certain kind could be as bright as Venus and decided that that was the most likely explanation. I have, however, since read that this type, the name of which presently escapes me, will only briefly appear that large and that it will quickly resume appearing the size of a normal satellite once it flashes. Since this one retained is brightness and size for the duration I think I may well have spotted a genuine UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

It was so low to the overpass we were approaching that it looked like it was going to land there.  I could not make out any distinct shape of the craft.  I thought it was a plane at first because of blinking white and red lights like those normally seen on a plane, but the way it was moving seemed inconsistent the capabilities of a normal airplane.  It seemed to disappear for a moment then we saw it over the fields to our right.  The fields were full of trees (what I assume were nut trees) of similar shape and size.  Suddenly the field lit up and it seemed that the craft was down amongst the trees.  It got dark again and we then saw the craft behind us.  It circled around again to the overpass, and although most of the time the craft was dark, there were three lights that turned on for a few moments and then were extinguished.  I continued to watch for the craft out the rear car window....saw the blinking lights for about 30 seconds then got out of range.  In hindsight, we should have stopped the car for a better look, but we were on a long drive from Phoenix and anxious to get home.  We did not hear any sound coming from the craft, however our car windows were rolled up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Although it was dark, it was easy to identify that these were well defined shapes, which moved with percision and stopped very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hovered over head approximately 100 feet up for approximately 3 minutes accompanied by a light humming sound with a vibrating sensation.  A bright and warm beam of light then moved up and down my body as if examining me for approximately 30 seconds. One craft then left at a slow rate of climb and stopped at a point higher in the sky. At this pouint a large gush of hot wind/air poured down on me and another craft left the area flying out of sight. The final craft came lower to my area within about 35-50 feet of my head, sat there for about a minute or two then slowly rose to the position of the first craft - they both then departed the sky at a high rate of climb, so fast it created a blur in my vision. Upon my return home, I began suffereing from intense heade aches and joint sorness. After trip to the urgent care center, they discovered multiple small burn type injurins to the top of my head and shoulders. After telling them of my experience, they referred me to my primary care physician and did not take me serious. I have had a very hard time sleeping ever since this happened, but also find that I only sleep a few hours a night and am not tired at all - or hungry. I am baffled and terrified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the big dipper to the North when I noticed a small orange dot moving slowly across the sky just below the bottom star of the big dipper ( I think it&#39;s called &#34;Pollux&#34;. I thought it was an airplane at first, then I noticed that it wasn&#39;t blinking. I watched it more closely because I then though it might be a satellite or the International Space Station. Suddenly, the orange dot moved extremely quickly up several degrees, down about double the distance, back up the same distance as the previous move, then down at an angle right near the star Pollux and it blinked out. It was gone. This is my first experience seeing something like this. I am submitting this report because I would like to know if anyone else reported anything similar at the same date/time/location.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the left lane and there were other cars and trucks around us.  I noticed that this object with 3 beams of lights looked like it was coming towards the highway and I thought that it might be a plane in trouble, needed to land on the highway.  Instead it stopped coming closer to the highway and was about 50 yards away, hovering in the middle of nowhere.  After it hovered I thought it might be a truck stopped on an overpass but we couldn’t see any hill or anything because it was dark.  Then it started to swoop downwards and closer to the highway again, I realized that it was in fact NOT a truck on an overpass and that there wasn’t even a hill there, it had been stopped, hovering for about 10 seconds and it looked like it’s light was searching for something.  It appeared to be 20 feet across and had three round, white lights evenly spread about searching only on the ground.  We were traveling in the car around 80-90 mph and witnessed it go into an orchard where it appeared to hover between trees with its lights shining out towards the highway.  When we passed it, it was still in the grove and we didn’t see it fly away.  In total we saw it for about 2 minutes before we passed it on the highway.  I could not actually see a body of an aircraft or whatever it was, I could only make out three distinct lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Account 2:My daughter (age 19) and I (age 54) were driving north on Interstate 5 near the farming district in Ca. last Wednesday evening when we saw 3 bright highlights, ahead of us, but off to the side of the highway.  The lights were bright and blinding and we wondered if a plane was trying to make an emergency landing on the highway.  But that didn’t make sense since I’ve never seen 3 lights placed so closely together on a plane.  As we continued driving I thought it might be a tractor intending to cross an overpass since the lights were a bit higher than the horizon.  Suddenly the lights stopped moving and just hovered in one place, then it flew towards the highway and then counter clockwise away from the interstate.  It headed north in an open area as if it were going to land on a runway but it didn’t.  The lights illuminated a field which I thought had grass on it.  I think I saw a small red light on the right side of the wings, I’m not sure if I really saw a wing though, I’m assuming it’s a wing.  The lights were so bright I never could see what the lights were attached to but there did go across in a fairly straight line horizontal to the ground.  As we drove by the highlights were about 100yds or one football length away from our speeding car and hovered over an orchard of trees.  I couldn’t tell if it landed on the ground or just hovered about the tree line next to the highway.  Nor could I identify the shape of what supported the three bright highlights .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am intelligent enough to differentiate between all standard aircraft (i.e. commercial jets, helicopters, Cessna’s), satellites, and explainable natural phenomena (i.e. meteor showers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am writing this report at this time is because I listen to the radio show “Coast to Coast AM” with George Noory. Mr. Peter Davenport was a guest on the late evening of June 20th 2012. He stated to a caller during the show that it was his Christmas wish that everyone with a legitimate story turn in a report regardless of when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a warm evening approximately four years ago my friend, girlfriend, and I were in my backyard enjoying the evening and talking. I noticed and pointed out a solid red light that I determined was moving abnormally fast for any standard aircraft that I have witnessed. As soon as both my friend and girlfriend both noticed the object that I was pointing out, the object instantly switched trajectory from a “southeast to northwest” line of flight to a vertical ascension which was very quick. When this happened everybody cried out “whoaaaa” because it was so startling. All of a sudden the light came to a complete stop in its ascension. We all confirmed with each other that we were witnessing the same thing.  As one could imagine we were very excited! The object started a violently fast descension straight toward the ground and disappeared well before it would have impacted the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I happened to look up and was amazed to see an object in the sky with a short comet like tail. I was surprised as it seemed unusual. So I ran inside to get my monocular. I came back and observed it with the monocular. It seemed to be disc shaped, but was still too far away to make it out clearly. But since it looked more disc shaped than jet shaped, I ran back in and got my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixal. I keep it set on fine to get the highest resolution I can. I took about five still shots of which two show it pretty clearly. The object definitely appears disc shaped when you zoom in on the image. I then switched to video mode and filmed it for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was starting to set and my settings must not have been so good. I am not able to see the object on the video because the sky appears too bright. I don’t know how to adjust the brightness on a video unless you go in frame by frame. I know I can try to go in and freeze a frame and adjust it, but have not tried that yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling from the NE to the SW so it was traveling somewhat in the direction of the setting sun. As I was filming it a helicopter flew by, much closer in range. I don’t know if they noticed this other object in the sky. I also heard the helicopter very well and yet I heard no sound from the object, although it seemed to be flying around the same height that most jets seem to fly. I can always here them in my location  The object and its short comet like tail were very bright; almost hot white, with a tinge of yellow. I watched and filmed it until it disappeared behind the tree line in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports witness submits in five days from Cross Roads, TX.

It appeared to be cylindrical in shape and dark, gray maybe or a dull metallic color; it was relatively well offset by the colors of the evening sky so it was plainly visible to the naked eye.  It seemed to be fairly large and distant; it stayed completely stationary for some time.  After I first noticed it I didn’t point it out until I realized that it had not moved at all for close to 30 sec.  I pointed it out to my 4 friends who all saw I but we could not decided what it was, the general consensus seemed to be that it might be a kite of some sort but to me it seemed too high in the sky and large, also the area of the sky it was in did not see like a place where anyone would fly a kite of any sort.  I pulled out my cell phone to take a picture the clouds behind the object could be seen on the screen the but object did not appear despite that fact that as I mentioned before it was plainly visible to the naked eye, a fact that I pointed out to my friends, and all of my group saw it.  If I recall I also heard someone in another group we passed mention noticing it.  The object remained stationary for several minutes thereafter until it moved slightly down and to the right and from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was perhaps 30 to 40 degrees in the sky to the WNW, generally in the area of the sky between the Washington monument and the White House but probably more distant.  It particularly struck me as odd because this is not a residential area, and as far as I know restricted air space, also this is the area of the sky were aircraft approach Regan National airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object became evident when I was observ|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65657.html|263|ndxe200808| I observed an object in the north-easterly skies at approximately 4:30 pm on this Saturday. The object became evident when I was observing a private aircraft moving in a northwesterly direction; at the same time an airliner was above it moving in the same general direction towards San Francisco or Oakland airports. As the two aircraft moved and separated I noticed a third &#39;aircraft&#39; behind and higher then either of the two I had been observing. Under clear blue skies what I thought was another jetliner was in full view and it was not moving and made no noise. It seemed odd that the craft could be so still and yet with the sun in the western skies it was clearly reflecting light as you would see in an aluminum like jet or airplane. I focused on the craft, with the naked eye, and I continued to observe it and clearly saw it was not moving. I deduced it could not possibly be a star because it was too early in the afternoon. I called to my wife to witness this but she declined, but I was able to hail my daughter. Unfortunately, she has a serious eye condition and could not see the object so I told her to bring down my binoculars which she did. With the binoculars I could see the object with more clarity and it appeared oval in shape and the bright aluminum-like reflection seemed to also show a red band? Without the aid of a tripod to steady the binoculars I was pressed to get a clear image. The object remained steady and did not move and I used a reference point to make this observation. I kept watching the object and then told my daughter to get my video cam-corder but she could not find it. After about 5 minutes I had to rest my eyes and had a hard time re-acquiring the object but I did and watched for a few minutes more with the binoculars now resting on the top of a camera tripod - my binoculars have no tripod attach point. Frustrated that no one else was there to witness this I hollered to my wife; as I was waiting for her - having taken my eyes off the object - I turned back to the are! a where the object was and could not locate it. After a few moments I was able to see it for one last time. Now it seemed to have moved away since it seemed much smaller than when I first saw it. By the time my wife came down I lost sight of the object and did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add that in the general direction of the sighting you will find Travis AF base. From my backyard I will often see military aircraft on occasion; however, my military background and understanding of aircraft lead me to believe this was not a typical aircraft. It was too high and was absolutely still - no movement - and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college educated person (B.A. San Jose State University - 1978)and majored in photo-journalism and am an x-military having served 3 years in the U.S. Army-Europe (1972-75)artillery unit 3/16 FA 8th Infantry Division. This is an honest statement of the event I witnessed on this date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J. Rodriguez -<n>

It was around 1 o&#39;clock in the morning, we were cooking hot dogs over a fire pit and enjoying ourselves. I noticed a bright, yellow, disk shaped light flying through the night sky, it was about 10 or 20 miles away and about 10,000 to 25,000 feet high. As soon as i saw it i told my friend &#34;Look&#34; and i pointed towards the night sky. We observed this thing fly through the air, it didn&#39;t turn or make any erratic maneuvers, it maintained a straight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw it it didn&#39;t make any noise, it went straight and seemingly changed to a blue color or emitted a bright blue light and soon after that happened it dropped an object. So there is this bright yellow light flying across the dark horizon and there is a blinking smaller yellow light under it thats falling towards the earth. By this time the object was emitting a sound similar to maybe a sonic boom or a passenger jet flying overhead. The object continued to fly across the horizon while the smaller blinking object continued to lose altitude, the objects grew farther and farther apart. The loud, jet engine like sound we heard faded away and the smaller blinking object kind of faded away in some fog that was very far from our location. The original, larger light kept flying until it became to faint to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pretty foggy that night, we saw everything happen after the fog cleared up around us but the objects seemed to disappear into the foggy night that surrounded the city of Nipomo, it left a smoke trail behind it. Please keep in mind that it was extremely hard to determine how high and how far this object was. It seemed like it was almost flying above Nipomo but I&#39;m not positive about that. I&#39;m pretty skeptical that this object is a UFO. I think this object is man made, perhaps a rocket of some kind going in to space, or maybe a satellite reentering earths atmosphere. I don&#39;t know what it is but it scared the hell out of us. An explanation would be great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -If you are investigating this and you have any questions/comments/explanations please contact me via email. Also, I began filming the object after it dropped a smaller object, if you would like to see some footage of the object contact me via email<n>

At this time, I was scanning the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of an early meteor. I didn’t see anything yet, however I did see a bright light in the sky the was obviously moving to the east, to my 10 o’clock position, and it looked like it was over my neighbors house. I at first thought it was a satellite, so I ignored it, however after 5 minutes, it was still there, moving ever so slowly. When I really watched it for a good 30 seconds, I realized this object was actually moving in circles, zigzags, quick lines from side to side, and small hooks. Confused at what I was seeing, I laid there staring at this thing. When I saw it move about 5 inches across the sky directly over my house in 2, VERY fast back to back streaks, I alerted others inside the house. Myself and 3 others continued to watch this star-like object move for as long as we could lay out there. I believe it’s still there, and it is now 12:35 AM. I doesn’t really change its quadrant of the sky, it just moves rapidly, in hooks, and side to side motions, gradually, then faster, then slower again as it ends its maneuver. It appears to just look like a star, but due to its obvious, rapid, in-human like movements, it is clearly not. I also saw a very dim star move towards it, then dissapear as it came next to it. It appeared to leave a faint red-ish trail a microfiber long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What he described as happening was that out of the corner of his eye he caught what he thought was a meteor or a bright shooting star that just simply stopped above the house (so to speak).  He said that he looked at it for less than a minute trying to figure out what he just saw, when what appeared to be a star in the same area moved in a circle.  My brother then called me, so I went outside and looked but failed to see what he was (mind you I live only about a mile away from him).  At this point I drove over to his house and had him point out what I was looking for.  The &#34;star&#34; didn&#39;t move for about 5 minutes, and after ridiculing him for getting me out of bed, the &#34;star&#34; moved EXACTLY like he said, as well as what was described in the other report this is pertaining to. We watched it for roughly an hour just occasionally moving in a circle, side to side, or in that kind of hook shape that was mentioned in the other report.  It never even occurred to me to report the event because we all felt like we were a little crazy or just seeing things.  It honestly just looked like your average star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/12/08 20:00|Chandler/Gilbert/Mesa|AZ|Unknown|1 hour +|Bright Lights in vertical formation with top craft moving as another came up from below to get in formation.|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65200.html|274|ndxe200808| Bright Lights in vertical formation with top craft moving as another came up from below to get in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 12, 2008 approximately 8PM in Chandler, AZ  I walked out front to smoke a cigarette when I noticed 2 bright lights on the West horizon in a vertical line just hovering. I chalked it up at first just to be 2 planes coming this way in some sort of flight pattern creating an optical illusion. However, my husband walked out to smoke a cigarette and said &#34;Come here and look at this&#34;. Just over the tree lines where I had seen the 2, were now 4 bright lights all in a vertical formation. I tried to logically evaluate what I was seeing but logic soon flew out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched these very bright lights, which were much larger than what you see on jets, the top one in formation dimmed the bright light and red and blue lights began flashing on it as it began to pull away from the vertical line moving in a Northeast direction. The craft that was moving was very low to the ground, lower than I see any jets in this area fly and the sound was different than jets. It made a noise but there was no &#34;rumble&#34; if that makes sense like a jet makes, it was rather quiet no more noisy than perhaps a car makes. The lights undernderneath and behind it were unfamiliar to us as well. As we kept watching, we then realized that this was a pattern that kept taking place. As the top one would begin to pull away from formation, another would &#34;appear&#34; to come up from beneath and get in this vertical line. We watched this trying to reason what was going on but it just wasn&#39;t making sense to us. If it had been planes in a flight pattern, logic would reason that the lights would be of different size and radiance if they were lined up behind each other. These lights looked like huge bright balls of light. My husband and I when we first saw them giggled and said &#34;Oh no, someone else is playing a hoax with flares and balloons&#34;, however, as the top one moved away, we clearly saw the craft and it&#39;s flight pattern. Whatever they were, whoever they were, they were definitely craft. I lost count after watching 6 of these follow this pattern. &#34;That&#39;s 6&#34; I said to my husband, and then just quit counting at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began getting very nervous as we kept watching this take place as it appeared they began lining up in a perimeter around an area. I could see them on the horizon from the back yard, clearly to the north, clearly to the east and cleary to the west, the trees were blocking my southern view. However, as they followed this flight pattern, they appeared to be randomly stopping out on the horizon, not moving at all. Just hovering. Some we could follow moving following a rather large circle pattern on the perimeter. The red and blue lights flashing on them looked different than jets and some seemed to only have a steady red glow.This has to be one of the most bizarre things I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes of watching this, 3 helicopters appeared in the area and there was 1 helicopter that actually kept a distance from the line of lights, but was flying what appeared to be from an &#34;observing distance&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for approximately an hour with these things all over the sky. I kept thinking, someone else surely has to see this. We came in to turn on the news around 9Pm thinking that what might be happening would definitely make the news, we watched all the way through the 10PM news, but no mention. I began checking here last night to see if anyone else had reported anything, but soon realized this isn&#39;t kept in real time, so thought I&#39;d check back this morning and there&#39;d be a plethora of reports, so far nothing. This truly rattled me last night, I had knots in my stomach because what we were seeing was so bizarre. This went on for over an hour. There was not a single jet in the sky during this, just the balls of light and crafts and a few helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen this, or has an explanation as to what was going on, please post it here.My husband and I walk out front and sit on our porch nearly every evening and have never witnessed anything like this in the past. We&#39;ll definitely be watching again this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was no doubt as large if not larger than a football field.  I don&#39;t know what the date was I&#39;m just guessing.  It&#39;s been a while.

8/11/08 23:30|Corvallis|OR|Diamond|2 minutes|i was chased by a UFO in the 2nd sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Hoax??  PD))|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65182.html|280|ndxe200808| In the first sighting i could essentially draw you a picture of the craft and i was chased by a UFO in the 2nd sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being extremely frightened over this 2nd UFO encounter in the past 2 weeks I had to mention these recent events to someone, just so it could be known.  The date today is the 11th of August, 2008.  This was actually my 2nd UFO encounter in about the past week and a half.  I would first like to talk about my first encounter which happened about 1 and a half weeks ago.  It was about 9:45 PM and I had been at my friend’s house across town.  I started to head back home which was about a 15 minute drive.  On the way home I noticed 2 large lights about 60 to 80 feet hovering in the air, lights almost touching each other.  As I began to drive towards the lights I actually began to joke to myself that this might be a UFO.  I continued on highland drive and when I got to the Amort’s farming fields I clearly saw this object floating soundless in the air.  Other cars drove extremely slow past this object, as if to wonder what was sitting up in the air.  The strange thing was of the 3 or 4 cars I saw pass this object, no one stopped or got out of their car, but each car drove past this thing at about 5mph to catch a glimpse.  As I drove past this object I could clearly see the shape and color of this unknown craft.  It was diamond shaped with 4 bright lights on each corner.  The crazy thing was you could see these lights from so far away but when you got up the craft the lights appeared pretty small.  Also when I looked into this light it didn’t hurt my eyes as a regular light would.  As I rolled down the street almost directly under this craft I rolled down my window and heard no noise, at all.  Please tell me what can float 80 feet off the ground and not make noise.  The lights on the bottom of the craft are what created enough light to view the craft.  The bottom of the diamond was some sort of black material.  After passing the craft on the long street of highland I was only about 2 minutes away from my house and I wanted to get my brother and a video camera as proof to this sighting.  Unfo! rtunatel y when I arrived home he was gone and 10 minutes later when I returned the object had vanished.  When I got back home my parents were now there and I decided to tell them about this strange event.  On the way home they had seen this object in the Amort’s farming fields just like I had.  I figured out that they passed by this same object about 5 minutes after I had.  My parent’s first impression of the object was it was not normal and was a UFO.  They believed as they passed the object it began to move forward slowly but they never saw it disappear quickly.  The funny thing about this is that my family and I decided not to report this; I decided to report it after what happened to me, tonight, the night of August 11th.  I was over at one of my brother’s friend’s houses and it was about 11:15 PM.  I was tired and decided to head back to my house.  I was almost to my street when I noticed a weird light hovering, in place, a good distance behind the Warlow’s farming fields.  I decided that because of my recent sighting nearly 2 weeks ago, that I would park in their driveway and watch this red light.  I noticed that the object began to hover straight up into the air at a pretty fast pace.  The object reached a height of probably about 200 to 300 feet and began to move fast towards my vehicle.  At this point I was pretty much scared shit less and pulled back as fast I could and made a fast dash towards my house.  The object hovered parallel with my vehicle but essentially right above me.  I remember as I made the sharp turn onto my street I glanced out my window and up into the sky and there it was right above me, following me but still at an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet.  I could clearly see the lights on the UFO and the brightness of the moon made everything pretty visible.  It was high enough up that I couldn’t quite make out the shape but it moved quickly.  At this point I was freaked out of my mind and my adrenaline was running.  The object proceeded to follow me up my street until I made it to a lar! ge pass of overhanging trees.  I live out in the forest and there are a lot of trees that hang over my street, it creates some good cover from the skies.  As I reached this pass of overhanging trees before my house I was continuously looking in the air to see if the UFO was still present.  When I got to my house I was so scarred I didn’t even get out of my car.  I locked the doors and called my mom to open the front door of my house, so I could run in with no delays.  This event scared me to the point of reporting both these UFO incidents event though I had been contemplating revealing the first incident.  The thing about this 2nd one is that I was out by myself witnessing all of this.  My lights were shined out towards the UFO which probably got its attention because after about a minute or 2 it headed straight towards me.  I really thought this unknown craft was trying to do something the way it responded to me showing up and witnessing it out in the Warlow field.  The craft had 3 lights, 1 red and 2 white (bright).  This may sound like a plane or something but this was not, I know for a fact.  It made no sound, flew 200 to 300 feet above the ground almost directly above my car, the craft essentially engaged me and I ran.  In my mind I really believed it was trying to abduct me and luckily I was about 1 minute from my house and I went about 50 to 60 mph on a 25 mph street to escape this thing that was tailing me.  I strongly have believed in aliens before these events but I feel unsafe out here.  This is the 2nd UFO I have seen and unfortunately I have to pictures or videos to prove it, just the fact that my parents saw the first sighting and they strongly believe there was no possibility it was from this planet.  I’m now carrying a video camera in my car and will update this site if I capture or see anything else.  I hope my word and others will soon unveil the alien presence on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S:  I just wrote this right after my 2nd incident with a UFO as seen above in my script<n>

I continued looking out the window wondering why these two helicopters were following. after about 10 minutes on a road called colonial the copters moved in closer to the road so i started slowing my car down to get a closer look at these helicopters, when it happened. A white-blue electrical pulsating on and off in no particular pattern flew directly over my car and towards the helicopter that was on my left hand side. The object then headed towards the helicopter, flew right up to it stopped still in the air, dropped straight down and then began flying along a treeline on the side of the road, at this point both helicopters then began following it. What is the craziest about this is that the object was so low to the ground only about 150 yards high when it passed over my vehicle, the only noise i heard was from the helicopters. The object would not have been visible if it didnt begin the pulsating. it was almost as if it was teasing the helicoptors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

I and a friend were positioned facing north looking out over the lake. light rain, cool temperature for early part of August.  With the naked eye, I confirmed with my friend that there were lights out on the lake (28 miles across) as seen first with the naked eye.  Then I asked my friend if he had a pair of binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars it was determined at first that a small boat appeared on fire.  This first bright light was furthest East in its proximity.  Then, on closer inspection I noticed and confirmed with my friend that what we were witnessing was NOT a little boat on fire, but fire balls descending extremely slow from the underside of this low slung storm cloud.  No identifiable sounds were heard in the vacinity. No helicopters, scrambled jets nor weather planes.  The story here is eiree as the fireballs continued to fall from the sky and as the first one went down behind the horizon, another one immediately appeared and began to fall.  This happened for a period of an hour to 90 minutes.  I was a little concerned, not knowing what was happening and decided to leave the neighborhood where this sighting was occurring-- a quiet neighborhood that lines the shore of Lake Erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing at least thirteen of these fireballs, I left the area (my friend lives in the house overlooking the lake and was concerned as well, but not as much as I was.) I hoped that the local news had picked up on this story, but no one has ever reported any similar sightings at the same location, nor did I feel compelled to inform the Lawrence Park police.  I did not want to bring attention to the quiet little neighborhood, plus it was raining and the folks all seemed to be sleeping and not witnessing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too bad, this is definitely one for the books.  I wished that I had had a powerful video camera to capture this phenomenon.<n>

At this time (10:45pm) I can see a few blinking lights (red, blue, green) moving slowly across the sky.

The object was kinda to our backs and appeared to be at about 2,000&#39;-3,000&#39;AGL moving rather slow from north to south. I had a pair of binoculars so I used them to get a closer view. What I saw when viewed through the binoculars was a &#34;bell&#34; shaped object with the ball of light coming out from the bottom center. At this point I passed the binoculars to my wife who witnessed the same thing. At this point the object then took a eastward heading and began to climb at a rather rapid pace. Also note that when the object was viewed through the binoculars there were no strobe lights or any other significant aircraft markings. When the object went east it was virtually passing right above us. My wife had the binoculars at that point in time. She stated that the object then went straight up with a little side to side movement. Within a couple of seconds the object had left the atmosphere and was out of sight. My knowledge of aircraft is quite extensive as I am a student pilot, served as an aircrew member with the US Air Force and have worked as an air base firefighter. My wife is currently in school to become an R.N.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happened to look more straight up towards twelve oclock, i then saw what i could describe as  &#34; short fat number two pencil rounded not sharpened at both ends&#34; it was pure white colored(bright white) , i just caught glimpse berfore it went into first cloud, as it went over second cloud it lit up cloud like lightening, but only for a split second. it made no noise, had no trail like a shooting star, and looked like it was moving in a straight line ( not arched up or moving downward, perfect like an arrow ) biggest thing is how fast  i first saw until it was gone with no noise whatsoever and how straight with no trail front or rear!!  someone else over eastern connecticut shoreline had to see it that night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<n>

They were hovering fairly high and then started to rotate around each other in a very uniform way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a few minutes I watched and asked my friend to verify that she saw these objects as well. She did indeed see the same objects I believe were UFOs. They continued to rotate around each other as I watched. Slowly one headed south, the other four objects kept rotating and sure enough one by one followed the first object south.<n>

I don&#39;t know what the nearest town was but I was somewhere near the center of the state. I noticed an incredibly large craft rising up out of a field to my right out the passenger side window. At first I thought it was a military jet performing a vertical take off but as I turned my head to get a better look I could see it was it was not a jet and was about the size of a large commercial airliner or slightly bigger. It was a dark gray color and had some bright white lights on it. I didn&#39;t notice any windows but I could see that the exterior of the craft was not smooth and aerodynamic like you would see on an airplane or jet, it was more like looking at a factory with it&#39;s many components and and pipes connecting them together. It was difficult to tell the shape because of the angle but as it got higher I could see that it had dimensions to it before view was blocked by the roof of the car. I alerted my wife to it and asked her what it was, she couldn&#39;t identify it either. She watched it till it was out of her view and over the top of the car. I tried to get another look as it passed over the car to the the drivers side but it was traveling to fast at that point and could not make out any further detail before it disappeared out of sight. At no point did we hear any sound from the craft and the event ended as quickly as it began, lasting about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Stayed north east the whole time for at least two hours. Just strange for something to be there that long in the same spot...and the fact that it keeps changing colors. Saw it a few days ago for the first time in the same exact place for about 3 hours. It is now back. wish it was closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was facing east north east, I have light pollution in the sky to the south east and trees to the west that determine where I watch. At 2:15 I was getting up to refresh my coffee, standing and turning south my attention was caught by a bright light through the trees at about 30* off the horizon. I knew immediately what it was, my wife and I had seen something similar in early June in the southeast, only at a much greater distance. This time I could plainly see a three lighted object that looked like a standing triangle. The lights were blinking/trading places, and were amber/white and red. It was swinging like a pendulum and played hide and seek behind the trees. I ran in to get a witness, my 13 year old was my choice for his good eyes. After sufficiently freaking him out he went back to bed and I jumped in the car to go get a better look. It seems as if it knew I was watching,  as I was driving down CR 124 it was moving away from me at a great speed. When I stopped at the top of a large hill it was of to the west and much farther away. Continuing to watch all I could think was “what are they doing, surveying, taking inventory?” One minute it would swing north and south the next it would shoot straight up only to settle down to where it was. By 3:00 it was very far away to the west or much dimmer. I wrote it off in June thinking it was a star and temperature  inversion, but now I have no doubt what it was, and my jaw is still on the floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The first thing we noticed was a really bright light moving at a distance. It soon became clear ,as the light became brighter and more clearly defined that it was coming towards us. There seemed to be what appeared to be several &#34;headlights&#34; on it, from a distance. As the craft neared us we saw that what we were seeing were very bright lights placed at each corner of a triangle. There was also a red flashing light on the middle underneath side. It was flying as low as most helicopters I have seen and going at a great speed. We could clearly see the underneath side of it, there were no markings or numbers and it was silver in color. The craft was quite large and made absolutely NO noise. It was flying with the &#34;base&#34; of the triangle going forward. The craft flew directly over us and was witnessed by four adults. I have no idea what the craft was, but I cannot explain what we saw in the sky Monday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One thing you should know is that our house is located about 20 min from the Wilkes-Barre Scranton airport.  I have seen the flight paths of many aircrafts and know what airports planes are coming from just by knowing the direction they are flying from.  I also notice that with all aircraft there are blinking lights on the ends of the wing tips.  Now with this said I noticed an orange orb of light coming from a completely different way altogether.  At first I heard a low rumble and was anticipating this aircraft maybe to be military. I was actually excited as military aircraft is rare over this area.  As the object grew closer i knew that it was not military what so ever.  It travelled for 25 seconds slowly in my direction and this is where it got weird. The orb reversed in the direction it came and literally darted out of site in a split second towards the stars!!!!!!!  The disturbing thing to me was the speed it reversed as it was coming so slowly towards my direction in the beginning.  I have been baffled by what I have seen and also about the United Kingdoms tabloids today, as the UK has reported a spectacular 150 sitings this year alone!  There have been more in PA recently too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking lights on this object, it was if it was just a ball of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were in the north woods of Wisconsin and the sky was very clear and black. The moon had just set about ½ hour previously. We were both familiar with the usual bright stars in the sky, but then I pointed out two very bright stars in the western sky that were in very close proximity to one another. It was unusual because they hadn’t been seen before. As we watched the stars they began to move upward in the sky and then away from the earth. The bottom star disappeared sooner. We basically watched two bright stars move quickly up and away until they faded completely—all in the span of 1-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Were the wings would be both sides were dark, and the body seemed to be grayish.There were no lights on it and made no sound. I ran across the street to get my cousins and when we came out and looked up it was gone......For once in my life i know what i saw and is what not a plane or any thing iv ever seen before.<n>

I had gone to see my grandparents in San Diego.  I am unsure of the date, but it was either the day or the day after my birthday. (August 9th, possibly 10th) I was looking outside the window as we were driving down the highway.  In the car was my mother, I and 3 girls that were friends and worked for my mother since we own a farm.  The time was anywhere between 9PM and 12AM.  I noticed a few white dots moving in the sky, but my eyes quickly adjusted. It was fairly large, possibly 120 yards in diameter and black, triangle shaped.  It had three lights on the bottom. I forget if there was one in the middle.  I assume it was a variation of the TR-B3 after researching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It spun horizontally while gliding in all directions.  I believe it spun from right to left.  It would glide low along the fields about 200 yards to our right and than rise and fly over the highway.  It was a busy night and there was traffic on this highway out in the middle of nowhere.  As it flew overhead I could make out the shadow of it blocking out the stars as it was a clear night.  It repeated the same manuevers and the traffic began to clear up after about 20 minutes.  At that time it sped off in the direction we were going, west along the highway.  We were pointing towards beale airforce base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the way home from Six Flags Magic Mountain, so I estimate the sighting between there and Sacramento.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been fascinated with UFOs since I was 8, the fleeting wish when I blew out my candles was always to spot a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I realized that it was not birds but a uniform shape. By this time I had stopped running and was standing still when that object passed over head at a height of approximately 60 to 70 feet it moved west to east at a reasonable speed(I would estimate it at a speed of  15 to 30 mph)  and it was completely silent. It was crescent shaped and what I thought was a flock of birds was actually a reflection of ground lights on the object. After it passed to the east I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am an amateur astronomer with a good head on my shoulders. I was just about to go inside and was standing on my porch. I happened to be looking eastward and observed an orange object travel at remarkable speed from North to South. At first I thought it to be a meteor but I remembered that it was contained within the clouds as I saw it passing thru them. I thought this to be strange since the clouds were around 1000-2000 feet. That meant to me that it might have been something else. The object was silent and no other aircraft were observed in the area at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were on S.Kingshighway about a mile north of Chippewa.  It was very small and I could barely see it but my friend saw it as well.  It never moved.  Not one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds, black and white, moving behind it at a slow speed.  But the shape never moved.  It stayed there for a long time.  I thought it must be a weather balloon.  However, it never moved.  As I said, the clouds were moving but the black shape never moved.  It appeared very small, since it must have been below the clouds in the atmosphere.  It was tall and skinny.  I watched it for about 30 minutes.  I did take a picture with my cell phone, however it was so tiny, I don&#39;t believe it showed up. I moved to another location about 100 yards away and could still see it.  I finally had to go, but I couldn&#39;t find it again when I got home.  It freaked me out a bit, so I started looking on the news sites and didn&#39;t find anything about it.  Dont&#39; know... just felt I should tell someone.<n>

I was sitting on my deck watching the lake activity and sky, looking north. A friend of mine was there as we had played golf that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an object moving across the sky from west to east at a distance and speed consistent with conventional aircraft I see regularly. I watched the object for about 15 seconds when it stopped, then began moving again for a couple of seconds, then stopped, dropped in altitude and stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped inside and got my binoculars. My friend had gone inside to get a drink at the same time. I held the binoculars against the porch column to steady the view. The object looked like a pearl in shape and color. The sky was blue with wispy white clouds behind the object. It appeared to be moving closer as it got larger and clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been watching it for three to four minutes when my friend came back on to the deck. The object had not moved other than to appear closer. I pointed it out and asked him to look through the binoculars and give me his opinion. In the time it took me to step around the porch column and my friend to raise the binoculars, approximately three seconds, the object disappeared. It took us about five seconds to relocate it in the sky about two miles to the east and getting smaller in appearance through the binoculars until it disappeared into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stay there during the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyday I get up at 2:00am and go to my gym in Lake Stevens, WA. From there I proceed to work which is up in the hills and woods about 12 miles from town  (Monroe). Normally I have about an hour to catch a nap before actually working, I usually pull off to the side of the road a couple of miles from the work site as its in a secured area and the gates are close and locked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular morning I just arrived at my normal dozing spot and saw what resembled a satellite, though somewhat lower appearing. It was moving slow like a satellite does so I watched it for about a minute when a much brighter light appeared over the tree line (easiest way to describe it was imagine the North star the brightest you’ve seen it) it and the ‘satellite’ moved towards one another and they both stopped, right next to each other for about 30 seconds. Then the satellite went back from the way it came!  I was already thinking to myself wow this is interesting. At this point for the sheer hell of it I flashed my lights 3 times. The UFO started directly towards me! It got to what I guess to be about 2 hundred yards (maybe closer) and stopped. I had my windows down and there was absolutely no noise whatsoever. It sat there for about 15 seconds so I flashed it again. Then it was like it leaped up very fast but only a short distance and continued away from me over the wood line in the direction the ‘satellite’ had gone, at a slow speed compared to what I saw when it leaped straight up..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not make out any shape of any type of craft that might have been there, but the light honestly resembled a bright star.  I got the impression that what I was looking at couldn’t be any bigger than my Ford Ranger pick-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the light was a bright white. It was really bright but seemed to be almost contained somehow. I don’t know, hard to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, that is what I saw. I went back the next morning hoping to see something else. Nothing occurred.<n>

Four of us were outside  having a conversation when all of a sudden in the sky  three of us saw an enormous and extremely  bright light or object appear in the sky out of no where. By the time I told my friend to turn around the object was shooting off very quickly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never personally seen anything like this.  This object made no noise and  when it shot off  it was extremely fast like nothing that I’ve seen before. My wife tried to say it was a shooting star but  this object was moving upward from my point of reference. My wife is more skeptical of what she saw and tries to explain it away but my friends wife and I saw it very well, and could not dismiss it as being a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It would at times seem to vary in position (minimally) up and down and from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it through binoculars and when I focused in it appeared to be bright white light and have occasional red and green colors.  When I focused out it took on different shapes and showed the appearance of multiple lights that changed color. At 1:40 it appears to have increased in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We drove around Big Lake, Elk River, and the Princeton areas and ended up coming back home through Orrock through the wildlife refuge on County 9 hooking up with Cty 5 to Big Lake.  When we turned south on Cty 5 a bright light caught my attention to the W moving very fast to the SE at about 40º up from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing peaked my interest in what I thought was a low flying jet was that there were no blinking lights on the outside of the wings or tail. There were also no steady lights on the wings, tail or body of the object, just one VERY bright light. This was also was moving at what I would estimate to be 2x the speed of a normal jet. As it reached true south of our vehicle it seemed to take a slight arching movement towards the ENE. Just as this started, I noticed the light growing dimmer. What was happening was that it was moving higher in the sky.  In about 3 seconds it went from 3-4x as bright as a jet to finally vanishing. Right before it finally vanished there was a bright flash and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the sky for  a few more minutes when there was another flash and the object came back. At this point it was only the brightness of a normal satellite. When the object flew through a grouping of stars I had been watching for reference that were shaped in a triangle, one of the “stars” broke from this constant formation and started following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I had been trying to get my wife to pull over so we could watch it and possibly turn around and follow it. She had pretty much freaked out and had kept her eyes on the road the whole time and expressed she did not want to see it and was not going to be following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had 2 other sightings before this and have not reported them. I heard Mr. Davenport on Binnall of America today and finally decided that this is the one I remember the most and made the most impact on me.<n>

On one particular night, as I watched for the International Space Station to go over, I noticed a flash of light near the cup on the Big Dipper.  This flash caught my attention even though it was not in the area I was looking directly at.  I turned my attention to that area of the sky, and approximately 10 seconds later I saw another flash.  I continued to watch and about 10 seconds later saw a flash about the same distance from the second flash as the two &#34;cup&#34; stars (away from the handle) are apart from each other.  The flash was the same as a strobe light on an aircraft, but about 5 times brighter.   Where a strobe on an aircraft flashes about every two to three seconds, these were a good 10 seconds apart, and were not in a straight line.   About 10 minutes later I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed the same flash just under the constellation, with another flash about 10 seconds later about the same distance apart as the second and third one near the Big Dipper.  A bit later I was looking to the east, and noticed a flash only about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon, which was a bit brighter than the others.  All these flashes were extremely short duration, as in an aircraft strobe light, but much farther apart and not in a straight line, and appeared to be at very high altitude, or in space.  As I watched the sky over the next two weeks I saw the same type of flash on every second or third night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it may be meteorites coming straight at me but thought about it and ruled that out as that would probably be a rarity indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one night I did see what appeared to be a satellite, moving in a straight line getting gradually brighter, and then fading out, southbound over Washington and Oregon states.  On one particular night I saw what appeared identical to the Space Station (very bright), but it was moving southbound over Montana and was visible 30 minutes before the Space Station was to appear from the west.  I waited the 30 minutes and saw the Space Station when it was predicted to come over from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this past Monday night (6/8/09) I went out to the back yard in Spirit Lake, Idaho (just north of Coeurd’Alene) about 10:30 PM and was looking at the sky.  I thought I saw a flash just under the Big Dipper, but wasn’t sure because I wasn’t looking exactly at that part of the sky again, so I turned my attention to that section of the sky and sure enough about ten seconds later saw the same bright flash as I had seen almost a year ago.  I saw three flashes that formed a triangle near the cup of the Dipper.  These flashes were not spread over an area, as if being generated by a large light source, say for example the Aurora Borealis, but were from a PINPOINT in the sky.  It would be as if a person was in the sky with an extremely bright flashlight and pointed it at me and turned it on and then off within a tenth of a second, or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights did not form any logical trajectory but seemed to be random.  I have a feeling that if I were to go out again over the next ten or 12 nights I would see them again every second or third night, or possibly every night if I continued to look for two or three hours.  I have seen satellites go over so I know what they look like.  Obviously I know what aircraft look like at night.  Maybe there is a military operation going on and they set their strobe for every ten seconds, or so, to keep track of each other, which would explain the non-straight line flashes.  But with the use of radar I would think this would not be necessary, unless it is some type of stealth aircraft.   I am 51 years old and being a pilot I like to look to the sky (I am interested in Astronomy also) and have never seen this type of thing until the summer of 2008, which makes a person wonder why these sightings started to manifest themselves to me, as if there is something going on that had not occurred in my past years.  There are more satellites and space junk up there than ever before, but that doesn’t seem to answer the question as to why the flashes would be relatively close to one another in both position and time.<n>

But they must have each been at least 30 stories high. And the columns were really spread out..there must have been at least a few hundred meters in between each one.

It was inclining at a very slow speed.  After about 30 seconds of it&#39;s presence, I ran into the house and got everyone outside to view what I was seeing.  Moments later it started declining, and resembled a plane on fire going down.  It split into 4 pieces which appeared the same size, and the fire disappeared.  You could see dim red lights which led us to believe that an airplane had exploded.  A few seconds later, the remaining pieces flared back up and started weaving in and out of each other in a horizontal fashion.  They slowly dropped towards the skyline, but the whole sighting lasted about 3.5 - 4 minutes.  We all came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, and from my experience in astronomy, definitely not a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I ran back to the house and told my sister, niece, and her boyfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all watching the lights and they were moving away from us up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then to the right of us there was another one.

We both spotted a solid white light moving very quickly high in the night sky in a straight line, I followed the light for a few moments thinking it was an airplane and impressed with its speed.  However, after a few moments as the light passed in front of a star it disappeared.   I kept searching for a moment or so for it to reappear, it didn’t.  I went inside to tell my partner only to find out he had been watching it also and also thought it had been odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went outside to look at the sky on the front side of the house and saw another high, fast moving white light in a similar area of the night sky though this object appeared to be moving in a slight zig zag pattern in a different direction and it also disappeared into the night sky after a few moments.  This time we also saw an airplane considerably lower in the sky with the blinking red lights on the wings and it was moving 1\10 the speed of the previous objects we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went online this morning to search for other posts hoping that someone else may have seen what we had and I ran across this site so I thought I would share my story in hopes someone else had shared the same experience.<n>

Slowly moving &amp; then sped up &amp; vanished<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were outside on Saturday, August 9, 2008 at our home in Spring, TX. We were looking at the moon when we noticed another object in the sky. It was a circular ball of light, very bright like the moon. There were no strobe lights on the object and there was no sound, so we knew that it wasn’t a regular air craft. It was moving in a south eastern direction. It moved like a satellite but was clearly in our atmosphere. It was traveling at a lower distance than the air craft in the area usually do.  It seemed to glide in the sky, then it sped up.  We watched it through the trees and over the houses.  The light suddenly got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely.  We could not identify what it was. W e do live near IAH Bush Airport. A jet came from the opposite direction a few minutes after the object disappeared which was easily identifiable due to the strobe lights and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

For a number of years now I have seen either a single star like object in the daytime very high up hovering in the sky or I have seen a formation of these same objects.  On one occasion I was with two other individuals and pointed them out and they saw them and we watched them move and hover in ways that no traditional aircraft operate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing this now because this past weekend on two consecutive days (August 9th and 10th) I saw a single silver star like object motionless in the daytime sky. Both days were perfect weather wise with very clear visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August the 9th in the afternoon at about 4 PM PST I noticed a silver colored point of light hovering in Eastern Sky perhaps 50 to 55 degrees from the horizon. I thought it might be a plane moving away from me and the sun was reflecting on it at an odd angle. But it just hung there with what I thought was perhaps a vibrating like movement. My wife was standing with me holding our 3 month old as we were preparing to go on a walk and she saw it as well. After about 3 to 5 minutes we couldn’t see it anymore. It appeared to just fade away but not like an object moving off – it either faded out or turned in such a way that the sun wasn’t hitting it. I think it important to note that the light may have been the sun reflecting off the object but while the object appeared very small and far away it was star like and obviously bright enough to been seen by the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day on the 10th at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon I again took the baby outside to sit on our front porch swing which faces east. I had this odd feeling that I would see the object again and when I looked up between two nearby trees there it was again in the sky. The object was higher this time but brighter and closer to my position. It began to slowly drift a bit from North to South and I knew in a moment it would be obscured by the leaves of one of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I don’t know why but I tried, perhaps foolishly, to meditate on the object and make a &#34;connection,&#34; but it just kept drifting very, very slowly south. It was not a balloon, plane or helicopter and again the sky was perfectly clear and visibility was excellent. It would soon be out of my view so I slowly got up and went to see it from the front yard but when I looked up again it was gone. I searched the sky but to no avail. The entire encounter again lasted maybe five minutes but certainly less than ten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing to you because I have seen these objects in the sky in LA before. They are not traditional aircraft. In the past I have seen them in formation and have seen them do patterns and maneuvers that, in my opinion, can not be easily explained. I have seen them with others present so I know I’m not just imagining things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could these be the US military aerial Predator drones? I was thinking perhaps they are tested out from a nearby base. Wouldn’t they hover at high altitude? Could I just be seeing a satellite in geosynchronous orbit?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The plane was flying in a north-west direction and then I saw four spheres flying the opposite direction, in a v-formation. When they crossed paths with the plane, they stayed and hovered in that spot. It looked like they were “dancing” around. Then they paired up, and kept “dancing,” but in pairs of two (side by side). They were overhead and then began to fly away from us, in pairs, in a northbound direction. It took about 30 seconds to be out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> statement 2: When my cousin saw the four objects in the sky, I looked for them. They were barely visible but once you found them they were very obvious. At first they looked liked balloons but then they stayed in one spot and moved into pairs. They were moving very oddly and then moved away from us, into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and she sounded to us to be sincere, in making her sighting report.

The object at first appeared stationary at an altitude of approximately 4000 feet. Then the object began dropping flare like objects that were falling directly towards the ground. It appeared as if it were an object that was on fire and breaking apart. Similar to an aircraft and/or a spacecraft re-entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. However, the object began changing directions moving at a slow speed. Then object then developed a comet like tail but much shorter in length than a normal comet. The object resembled a fireball but it never appeared to lose altitude. It remained at the same height and speed. The object flew directly towards the West approaching the Mississippi River and then turned to a Southerly direction. It would make very sharp turns, in fact, the turning radius was such that the object appeared to almost cross paths with it&#39;s on fiery tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would drop flare like objects intermittently similar to a military aircraft dispersing flares. Again having the appearance of an object on fire and breaking apart but the object continued flying at the apparent same speed and altitude. It made several complete circles and then reversed it&#39;s original course of due west and began traveling back toward my direction at an Easterly heading. The object had no visible navigation lights. No blinking lights or anything indicating that it were any form of a known aircraft. The fireball object continued in the Easterly direction directly over the city of Baton Rouge and then slowly headed South until it disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was clearly visible to anyone in Baton Rouge looking up. I noticed that other vehicles traveling on I-12 were reducing their speed as I was perhaps because they were gazing at the object. I had my cell phone with me and attempted to take a picture but was afraid of being involved in an accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record: This is my fourth experience at witnessing something very unusual in the night sky. The other incidents were the typical bright objects traveling at a huge rate of speed and then sharply changing directions. However, this recent incident is different. I&#39;m very skeptical of it being any &#34;U.F.O.&#34; because of the flare like objects dropping from it. But it confuses me as the how the object appeared to remain intact, never losing altitude or speed and flying off into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final note: here is a link to a &#34;UFO Map&#34; where you can other testimonials of people who have witnessed the same object over Baton Rouge.   http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Baton+Rouge   Peter Duffield<n>

8/8/08 22:00|North Bay (Canada)|ON|Other|1 hour|Hi: My report is not an eyewitness report but an oddity I found on the net. To begin with, I am a skeptic to ufos being extraterestrial|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65407.html|342|ndxe200808| Hi: My report is not an eyewitness report but an oddity I found on the net. To begin with, I am a skeptic to ufos being extraterestrials, but still am interested in understanding this phenomenom, whatever it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read about the &#34;hollow earth&#34; hypothesis, which I took as being as ridiculous as the flat earth belief, eventhough it was believed by Columbus and Halley . I have read about both South and North Poles expeditions, some claiming such areas being entrances within the earth&#39;s inner world; about Admiral Byrd&#39;s secret diary. I enjoyed reading such stories as science fiction and nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day I while I was searching for world maps on the internet, I stumbled upon Google Earth. I downloaded the free version and was extremely impressed with the satelite shots. After zooming on Paris,France, I actually could see cars on the streets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One boring night,I started using Google earth to zoom focus some sites associated with fictional, mythical settings such as the Pyramids, and the sea bed floor within the area some claim Antlantis might be located...looking for some abnormalities or maybe signs of human hands.I believe I saw some interesting landmaks however, the imagination was maybe leading me to see things that aren&#39;t dimentionally correct...just in order to, well believe in the mythical side of Life. I was starting to feel like a child again, one who still believes in such things as Santa Claus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Alan Parson&#39;s song popped into my head....&#34;I am the eye in the sky, .........I am the maker of rules....... This made me think of the conspiracy theories....Freemasonry and the likes of the Illuminaties. The eye in the sky....satellites? within a triangle... meaning perhaps the process of triangulation?? Har har, however the symbol was much too old to even support the thought.One thing struck me though. The pyramid&#39;s view seemed to come directly from above, as if the satelite was directly above it,unlike the buildings I saw in other places such Paris. Google earth, I then thought, could actually mean &#34;go ogle earth&#34;...ogle being the term I heard used many times for the eye within the triangle....I was starting to enjoy myself in all of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said, let&#39;s take a look at the supposed hole in North Pole. And there it was....very impressive indeed. Although, true, this phenomenom certainly must be associated with the earth&#39;s magnetic field,however, the thought was proposed very long ago. Columbus thought the ocean water entered into the North Pole in order to exit the south...it does matches somewhat the Oceans currents. The image certainly seemed as if the ocean was indeed whirling in the earth itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, the South Pole. The sight was even more impressive. Inside the continent Antartica, there is an image of what seems to be a sphere, having colour close to something like another smaller earth. Again, this phenomenom is associated with the magnetic field since the same blurry image exist like that of the North Pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, what about the night sky? Nasa sent some signals (beatle&#39;s song Accross the Universe) to Polaris. I switched to the night sky setting and looked in the region of Polaris. Here is something I don&#39;t quite understand...the same phenomenom seen in the North Pole and South Pole exists....but why? The earth&#39;s magnetic field should not affect view of Polaris. I then turn to Octantis, the South Pole Star....same phenomenom again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turning back to Polaris, I zoomed all the much I can, and that particular blurry spherical region came into view as something quite different than that from a constellation of stars.... The stars seemed more like lights; the edge of the sphere when highly magnefied, looked very much like a metallic perimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the reason why I sent this e-mail.... to have another perspective, and maybe some answers. I would like it if someone else would take a look and get back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting share this with you Andre<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were on Padre Island fishing the canals off of Whitecap Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:00 P. M. when we noticed a bright light coming towards us out of the western clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be hovering or floating as it moved slightly side to side as it moved forward. There was absolutely no sound coming from it and we both waited to hear jet engines or a helicopter noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as we watched intenly a Navy trainer flew over head and seemed to fly directly towards the hovering light.  As we watched, the light or flying machine took evasive action and did a 90 degree maneuver flying straight up into the clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the light ascend into the deep blue space until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no ordinary flying machine, but I have no doubt it was some kind of advanced flying machine.<n>

A few seconds passed and the passenger in the car saw another bright light move diagonally from left to right and then disappear again. This also took place within a second. The light seen was bigger than a car headlight and much brighter. The Verizon tower was down all day long and no one from Verizon had any service, the weather was also noticeably different for this time of year.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before the sun went down when there was still light in the sky we saw 2 silver discs or &#34;tubes&#34; in the sky very high in the sky.  Not nearly as high as a satellite but still pretty high, nonetheless.  At first we only saw one &#34;tube&#34; close to the area were the moon was that evening.  Then my friend pointed out another one following it.  They were moving about as fast as an airplane I would say, but these did NOT have wings, did not have any lights and they did not make any sound.  They were just silver &#34;tubes&#34; in the sky and kept moving until they were completely out of sight.  We even called the McAllen International Airport to report this but the lady just told us that it could possibly be aircraft spraying for mosquitoes.  I told her these were not planes and she said that was all the info she could give me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I gor my chair, a bag of chips, and a coke and sat down and just stared. suddenly a bright light came from the sky. it was a little light. i looked at it curiosly. Then it started to go all wobbley. it moved in a puzzling format. Haze was all around it. I couldnt identify the shape because it was all haze. I went inside and i got my binoculars. Then I got out and i looked closley. i saw colors changing. at first i thought it was some type of aircraft but then suddenly it doubled it self. I called my dad out but as soon as he came it just sped away into hyperspace like youd see in a Star  Wars Movie.

It was shiny white/silver disc shape with a domed top. It was traveling from the northeast to the southwest, traveling at a leisurely pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it traveled from the tree line to the north across the sky in front of me until it almost reached the tree line to the south, at which time it turned around and traveled back to the northeast. So again I saw this object from many angles.  I was able to watch it for at least five minutes or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today there was also a small plane in another part of the sky a little lower than the object, but I was able to compare the two and see that this object was not a plane. It also appeared to be about the same size as the plane but with no wings, or tail, or rudder. The sky was clear except for a few cirrus clouds to the northeast. When the object turned going back in the direction that it had come from it passed behind the cirrus clouds, yet I was still able to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also could hear no sound and I could hear the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports witness submits in five days from Cross Roads, TX.

I looked up and saw two fighter planes flying very close together in a 10:00 direction behind me, they had already flown overhead before I heard them I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at about 12:00 direction something caught my eye, it was a silver, reflective orb or possibly egg shaped object that seemed to be undulating colors, possibly blue or purple. Then a large passenger jet entered my vision at approx. 7:00 direction. Although I had 3 other standard aircraft in view it was very difficult to determine size or distance of the fourth out-of-place flying object. It seemed to be flying at about the same altitude as the jets or perhaps a bit lower. The object moved so strangely (sort of curving or arced movements) that I ran inside to grab the digital camera. Of course the damn battery was recharging in the wall socket. Grabbed it anyway, loaded into camera, ran outside (it turned on), but when I aimed at object it was already getting too far away to see anything. I could still see with my eyes but couldn&#39;t train viewfinder on it, very frustrating. Camera only has 3x zoom. Lost sight of object after fiddling with camera further. Very interesting thing to see but disappointed I could not document - so all that remains is yet another anecdote. :(<n>

I work in a town southwest of Newberg called st.paul, about eight miles away. In st. paul, I saw what at first I thought was a low flying plane over Newberg. When it stopped moving I pointed it out to my friend, at the time it dropped or lowered three smaller red lights, all attached to some sort of line that was lit as well. When it had all of its weird red ball shaped lights( three of them) lowered, it was in the line shape of a banana. Then all at once it dropped curving like a feather does when dropped. We where driving and lost sight of it behind some trees as it descended, about five seconds later we where able to see the area it was hovering at, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I’ve always believed in ufo’s but was always a bit skeptical about them. But this put the icing on the cake for me. Please, if you have anymore reports of a similar object description seen , post them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon looking up at the clouds he happened to see two bright objects traveling from South to North.  He said they were rather flat in shape and looked about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He called others to come see this, consequently making it about six people that witnessed this.  The warehouseman said they watched these things for approximately two to three minutes and in that time the objects made a couple of strange maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling together one object appearing to follow the other seemed to get closer to each other then came to a sudden stop for maybe a second or two then continued towards a cloud then going behind the cloud.  The warehouseman said that all this time the objects were very bright as if they were giving off a reflection from the sun.  He described it like looking at the glimmer of a windshield when the sun hits it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the objects went behind the cloud they began to ascend together gradually disappearing from eyesight.<n>
8/8/08 05:00|Powder Springs|GA|Triangle|aprox 1 min|I saw an object with three red, flashing lights forming a triangle flying low over my neighborhood.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65133.html|357|ndxe200808| I saw an object with three red, flashing lights forming a triangle flying low over my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out walking the dog around 5-5:30 on Friday August 8, 2008, I believe. I know it was dark outside. I saw heard the sound of a jet plane passing far overhead and looked to see if I could find the plane. What I saw was three large red flashing lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, traveling much closer to the ground than most flying vehicles normally fly. The object came from behind some trees to the SW and flew, in a straight line and at a steady rate, to the NE, where it disappeared again behind trees. I could not see a form or a reflection because the sky was so dark, but I could not see other objects in the area between the lights. I cannot approximate how low the object was flying because it was so dark, but it is significantly lower than I have hitherto ever seen an object flying. I did not see the trees respond to its passing, so I assume it was well above them. I though the jet-sound was coming from this vehicle until I noticed a jet flying over the object when it was directly overhead. The jet-plane was very obviously a plane - an elongated triangle with colored lights on the short end and a white light at the peak – and was traveling ESE to WNW, which is the direction planes usually go over this area in, we being located very close to an airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am inclined to believe that the object was a plane of some sort, perhaps at an odd angle, but don’t know why it would be flying so low or in a direction so different from the norm. I did watch it cross the sky in the hopes of seeing the shape of the vehicle, thereby allowing me to have a better chance of identifying the vehicle, until it left the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a teacher with some training in psychology; I am trained to take a skeptic’s approach to everything. I grew up living just about next-door to an airport, and have always liked sky-gazing (very difficult near an airport) so am very familiar with what various plane-lights look like. My first action upon returning home was to type a description into a search engine to see if I could find what plane-signal would require lighting as described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked for other man-made flying vehicles which would have 3 lights arranged in a triangle along its belly. All I found were two pictures online of similar lights (I did not have a camera), but both were called UFOs. One was photographed in in Texas February 9, 2005, the other in Alabama in April 26, 2004.<n>
8/8/08 02:00|Hamilton|MI||3 hours?|I was with being helping them and saw the ship perfectly.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91433.html|358|ndxe200808| I was with being helping them and saw the ship perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a retired police officer. I retired in 2002.  My event occurred on September 8th or 9th 2008.  I say that because I don’t know when my event started but it was the night of the 8th 2008.  It was a warm clear evening, the rest of the family went off to bed but I wasn&#39;t tired so I stayed up to watch TV.  After a little while the next thing I know I’m standing out in our yard which is 2 acres and way out in the country.  We live near Holland, Michigan which is on Lake Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was standing there wondering how I got there I could see a small pin hole of light out ahead of me at about eye level.   As I looked at it the light got bigger and came right at me.  As it passed by it was like a wave of light and as it went past me it almost felt like it pushed me back a little.  Then I could feel the presents of someone behind me.  As I turned around there were three smaller gray beings with large black eyes.  Standing shoulder to shoulder.  They looked similar to what most call the grays. As I looked at them I wasn&#39;t alarmed or frightened at all.  I had the feeling that I knew them.  Then I could hear in my head,  &#34;We need your help.&#34;  I said OK.  The thing was the way they said it.  It was like they were saying it to someone they knew.  Plus, I answered as if I was talking to a neighbor or friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I can remember is I am standing in a different area of our property.  It’s like I can barely stand up I’m so tired.  I’m sweating as if I had been working or hot.  I can’t move but I can see a bright light at ground level that is behind me.  As I look up with my eyes I can see two craft that are identical.  The main body is a large round area that has dark red or burgundy lines that move around it.  They are very glossy.  The main body was dark.  Then there are two straight arms or beams that come out at about a 30 degree angle.  They are green in color.  Then two bright glowing spheres at the ends that pulsate white light.  It’s hard to say how far away they were because I don’t know how big they were but my guess is they were about 3 to 4 hundred feet above the ground and about the same distance apart.  Maybe 500 feet apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can notice something out of the corner of my eye.  So I try and turn my head. It like it’s glued in place. I try with everything I have and I can move it just enough to see two other men standing like I am about six feet away from me to my left.  They both look like I feel. I have never seen them before. I can’t see anything else.  It is so still out. Not a breath of wind or noise.  I can’t see anything but the ships.  The next thing I know I hear a rumbling and a big hole in the sky opens up! I could see blue sky with white clouds in it as if I were looking though a window.  Large clouds formed the outer circle of the hole and were turning in on themselves.  Like if you rolled up a news paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in the blink of an eye the first ship zipped into the hole followed almost instantly by the second one.  Then after the second ship went in there was like a clap of thunder and the hole closed up.  The next thing I know I’m sitting straight up on the couch with what has to be the biggest adrenalin rush I’m ever had.  I instantly get up, looked at the clock and it was a little after 5 am.  I grabbed a piece of paper and our kid’s crayons and started to draw what I had just seen.  The whole time it was like, &#34;What the Hell just happened?&#34;  It was real, as real as you’re sitting reading this right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later having had settled down as I sat trying to figure out what it all meant my wife came down getting ready for work.  I didn&#39;t say anything because I wasn&#39;t sure what to say.  She told me later on the phone that our eldest daughter who was eight at the time had come to sleep with her because she woke up and saw very bright lights flashing out of the top dormer window of our house.  She saw about 11 flashes before she got scared and went under the covers then she headed to mom.  Well, my jaw about hit the floor when she was saying this.  I hadn&#39;t said anything to anyone about what had happened to me at this point.  Was this some kind of conformation of what had happened?  An incidental independent conformation?  I talked to our daughter about it later and she told me about the same thing she told my wife.  She said it wasn&#39;t like lighting but like a really bright light blinking like a stop light kind of thing only slower.  Now, she is not afraid of thunder storms and we! like to watch them so a flashing light wouldn&#39;t have scared her but she said it was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well for the next week or so I was sick like I had the flu.  Tired, aching, and a bad headache which was weird because I never get headaches. I  filed a report with MUFON that day and sent the drawings I made.  Over the next week after I was feeling better we went to the hobby store because I had to make a model of the craft I saw. I didn&#39;t know what stuff I was looking for but looked until I had what I could use to make it.  I then took a picture of it so you could see what it looked like from my vantage point. I know its old school but I can’t do computer generation stuff.  Then I made a picture of the hole in the sky.  It’s weird but it was almost like in the movie Close encounters where he was always trying to make the mountain.  I told my wife what happened and she believes me but is also an &#34;I have to see it to believe it&#34; type.  I know to her it’s a way out there story but it is what it is.  I can only tell what happened to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Life got back to as normal as it can after something like this happens.  Over the years since I have photographed blue clouds over or near our house which both of our girls saw and last year I found a strange mark on the inside arch of one of my feet.  I also took a pic of it.  It was four pin holes that had scabs that made a perfect square with one right in the middle and one outside of the square.  I couldn&#39;t feel it at all and never would have seen it if not by chance.  It was gone in a day or two.  I now seem to have a better understanding of how everything is connected together.  Humans with nature and nature with the universe and so on.   It’s like we are all one.  I know it sounds weird and before this all happened I probably would have rolled my eyes at it.  But it did happen, we are NOT alone in this universe and we are all connected.  It was a life changing event to say the least.  It doesn&#39;t run my life but it’s always there.  Running though my head like an endless movie clip.<n>

We had been star gazing for a good 20 minutes vefore this happened, and we had seen a extrodinary 12 shooting stars in that time period.  I saw a UFO (kind of like the ones you see in the movies) moving at quite a fast speed coming from the northwest and exiting behind the trees in the southeast.  It had sort of a rythimic circular motion of lights around the outside of the saucer.  (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)  The noise it made was quite odd, sort of like water rushing through a tube.<n>
8/8/08 00:00|Eden|NY|Circle|15 MINUTES|Unusual bright zig-zagging lights in the Eden, North Collins NY sky.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65105.html|361|ndxe200808| Unusual bright zig-zagging lights in the Eden, North Collins NY sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While trying to get my humidity swollen porch door shut A bright white light in the sky caught my eye. It was a good distance away. It was probably twice the size of the largest star. The craft was hovering for a good 5 minutes in a erratic fashion. It was like it was struggling to stay in one place. I could see blue strobe type lights around the horizontal perimeter of the craft. Then near the bottom of the craft (about the lower third) of the craft, I could see orange/pink glowing.These did not strobe, but they did appear to increase and decrease in intensity. Next, a second craft appeared, and although difficult to see through the trees, appeared identical to the first craft. Suddenly, they began to speed up and for the next 5 minutes approx, they began zig-zagging up, down, with great acceleration. It was almost like they were chasing each other for fun. Next I heard a jet engine, but it wasn&#39;t coming from the crafts. A jet began flying toward them. Next, the 2 crafts appeared to merge into 1 craft. As the jet got closer, the single craft appeared to accelerate downward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The movement was not unlike an aircraft, straightline and not apparently faster than a conventional plane.  No sound.  What made this unlike anything I have seen before was the color (pink grapefruit flesh colored).  The conditions were very clear, star-filled sky with no lunar illumination (very dark sky and brilliant starlight--no haze or humidity).  The object was moving almost directly in an Easterly path, at a height that appeared to be 800 ft or less. I tried to go in the house, upstairs, and locate the object as it passed over a tree that was about to block my view from the backyard, but I never saw it again, even after returning to the yard. It was a bit fuzzy around the edges, as if it were a fire (almost reminded me of what a flare should look like).  No smoke visible.  No other aircraft visible at this time in the sky around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am providing this report only as a confirmation in the event others report the same or similar observations.

I was pulling into my driveway and noticed a light in the sky out my window. I originally thought it was a glare off my window. I rolled down the window and it was still there. The silo of the barn came between myself and the light. I parked, got out, and moved to get a better look. A cloud had come in front of the object and because there was no wind it stayed there. The light faded behind the cloud and eventually disappeared.  The object never appeared to move except when it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was one of very few clouds in the sky. The light was white and fairly bright. It was round in shape. It was not a plane; it was too big. I would guess around a sixth of the size of the moon.  I do not believe in aliens but I have never seen anything like it. I have never drank or done drugs.  I’m reporting this in case others saw the same thing.<n>

The light was oval in shape and appeared to illuminate the clouds in what could be best described as a rotating spotlight. When the light appeared away from us it would light up clouds in a circumference 15-20 time the size of the light in the center. The light then rotated slowly towards us and it was very bright, bright enough to cast very small shadows in the field from the trees. When facing us it appeared to veer left to right at minimal distances, but at very high speed. The light held my attention and never did disappear completely, nor did it do anything stranger than that of which I have described.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling pretty low, and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it just “blinked out,” for lack of a better term. It just seemed to disappear. Then, about a minute or so later, another light appeared, quite a bit higher up, and farther toward the southeast, it started moving toward the north east, and it also just disappeared as quickly as it appeared. Neither object had any sort of blinking whatsoever. And, neither object made a sound. However, about 3-4 minutes later we heard a loud jet, like a military jet fly over. We saw no lights on it, but we heard it go over. My husband is still outside looking, but I had to post this.

I think so.”  When we got to our destination and talked about it a bit more, she had mentioned seeing it floating in the air for about 15-20 seconds.

I observed it from tree line to tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it intensely and could see no wings or protrusions of any kind, and determined that it was a disc shape with a domed top. The sky was very clear and there was also a small plane in another part of the sky that I could look at for comparison.  It was a little higher in the sky than the plane, but appeared to be approximately the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This looked nothing like the plane. It was very shiny white/silver and as mentioned before no wings, or tail, or rudder.  It traveled from tree line to tree line, so I saw it from different angles. It went behind the trees and I could no longer see it. It made no sound and as before I could hear the plane<n>

But then I noticed it was moving into my direction at a rather slow pace, in a straight line.  I’d guess maybe 60 to 70 mph. This big white light never flashed or pulsed like you see on airplanes.  There were no red or green lights,  so I know it wasn’t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closer the object got I noticed it wasn’t making any sound.  It went over our house and still never heard a sound.  I went around to the other side of the house and saw it again moving south east.

I was looking at the stars and suddenly noticed a yellowish light which appeared to be heading down toward earth because as it moved it grew slightly larger.  My first thought was that it was a shooting star. It had no flashing beacon or tail.   As soon as the thought occurred about the shooting star, the light seemed to hesitate for a split second and wobble slightly.  It suddenly and I mean SUDDENLY changed course about 30 degrees and headed due west toward Los Angeles at an astonishing high rate of speed. I tried to follow it and dropped my soda can in the process but it I lost it behind a palm tree. It was just going too fast to follow.  Of course I do not know what it was, but I do know that it wasn&#39;t a shooting star because it changed direction. It wasn&#39;t an airplane or helicopter because there was no flashing beacon. It was not a satellite because it was going too fast and changed direction.  Commercial airlines fly over my house on a regular basis.  They fly over at about 10,000 feet altitude.  These jets are traveling about 300 to 400 miles per hour. If the light that I saw was at this same altitude, it was traveling easily in excess of 10,000 miles per hour.<n>

Directly overhead was one of the bright stars of the constellation Draco, the first star in my field of view bright enough to be visible. It was still too bright out for other stars to be visible. As I unwound and watched the sky, I thought I saw a flash or twinkle in the northern sky, almost due north, about 35 - 40 degrees up. Perhaps the sun glinting off a satellite, I thought, or maybe the navigation lights of a high-altitude jet aircraft crossing the country. Intrigued, I scanned for signs of an aircraft. About half a minute later, I saw it again, in exactly the same place. That ruled out a plane a satellite or, at least, the same plane or satellite, but what are the chances of two of either reaching that same spot within half a minute? Could be my eyes playing a trick on me, can&#39;t rule that out. Half a minute or so later, another flash or twinkle. A few minutes later, same thing. Always in exactly the same spot, near as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got distracted for awhile by some things in the yard and inside the house, but was back watching the sky a little before 10:00. By that time, it was dark enough that I could make out more stars. There was no star visible where I saw the twinkle. There would be a couple of stars in the constellation Camelopardalis that would be visible in that area most nights, but it&#39;s still too light out to see any stars around there at 10:00 at this time of year. Toward the northeast, one of the brighter stars of Cassiopeia was now visible. Further east, I saw a light aircraft with flashing navigation lights flying level, headed due west. I watched the small plane cruise through the sky, noticing that there was another small plane flying a parallel path to the south. I figured one of them, probably the slower and more southerly one, was Saskatoon&#39;s police patrol plane, which is out most nights. It looked like the more northerly plane could have been preparing for an approach to the airport. After a few moments it reached the part of the sky where I saw the strange twinkling earlier, so my eyes were now drawn back to that area. Suddenly there was another flash of light from the same spot as before, but this time it was much brighter. The shape was not like a twinkling star, but more like a line or thin cylinder or dumbbell kind of shape, consisting of two very bright twinkly points, shining momentarily like sparklers on a birthday cake, with a straight, thin bright or shiny line joining them. The two bright points were maybe two degrees apart, about the width of my little finger at arm&#39;s length. The phenomenon lasted only a fraction of a second, maybe an eighth to a quarter of a second at most, but long enough that it was unmistakable. It made me jump. I watched the sky for several minutes, but did not see any other twinkles or flashes. Frankly, I began feeling a little uneasy once the bright flash occurred, and I packed up my tea and lawn chair and came into the house by about 10:15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that whatever it was, was very high in the sky. I would be curious to know if anyone in a more northerly community had seen this, and how it would have looked from their vantage point.<n>

Later he was watching the footage after uploading it on his computer and he noticed something hovering over the city like a helicopter but then take with a speed and angle that we don&#39;t think could possibly be a helicopter or plane.  We have no idea what it was or even if perhaps it was a reflection or something but it sure looks like something that is flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m interested in seeing what any experts might think.  The incident happened on August 6th at around noon and like I said he was in the portland aerial tram looking down over downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for witnesses there were others in the tram but no one saw anything or had any reaction at the time.  We posted the video to youtube to see if anyone else saw anything that day so the link is below so you can see the footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdjOgVtd2uM<n>

PD))|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65049.html|386|ndxe200808| UFO to the North - bright starlike object just above the horizon that flashes colors from red to green.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I discovered the following UFO report by an investigator named, Delbert Anderson and involves an event in late- July 1991.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His Report below, completely describes the exact same thing that I have been encountering on more than one occasion(same time 1:00am)and in the exact location in the evening sky.  I, however, am not convinced they are stars or abnormal atmospheric conditions....... The UFO seems to still be there (long periods of time) and an airplane traveling tonight during my writing of this report, stayed at a very low altitude while crossing it&#39;s path.  Please have an investigative aircraft check into this?  Delbert Anderson Reported late- July 1991: Around 1 a.m. or so the witnesses indicated they were seeing a UFO to the North and there was a bright starlike object just above the horizon. We watched this object for awhile. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes the object got a little brighter. It seemed to flash colors from red to green to blue to white and so on especially when viewed through binoculars.... At approximately 1:30 a.m. the witnesses drew my attention to a bright starlike object over the western horizon. This object was also flashing colors and getting brighter, then dimmer, appearing to approach and recede... (Anderson)  Delbert determined that objects were the bright stars Capella and Antares<n>

Not knowing how lights could have more than one color I stopped and stared, and noticed that the craft was making a zigzag motion across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a minute or so, then suddenly it turned around and accelerated over the horizon in about 2-3 seconds.  At that point I knew it had to have been a UFO because nothing can move that fast.  I looked at my watch as it disappeared and it was exactly 11:32PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting characteristic about this is that when I saw the lights, there  seemed to be an aura or hue.  It was dark, so I could not clearly see the craft, but it seemed to have a metallic, or &#34;mother of pearl&#34; look and I could see the shape of the craft was round and appeared to be roughly the size of a dime.  Not knowing how large the craft was, it&#39;s hard to say how high up it was, but I estimate it was probably about 2 or 3 miles overhead.<n>

Now, this is right near the Deer Valley Airport, but what I saw was not an airplane. I saw a triangular shaped craft that was inky, inky, jet black with 3 lights.  It was very ink-black against the dark sky and one could differentiate the fact that it was a much darker black than the night sky. It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion. What was so strange is the lights of the triangle then began to stretch and the inky blackness of it dissipated and the 3 lights shot off quickly in separate directions. This was just northwest of the Deer Valley Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was just something reflecting lights like a cloud or something. But then I realized it wasn&#39;t a cloud, due to seeing other clouds in the area, plus I could see stars around this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was quite large, pear shape almost like a hot air balloon, but not quite. It had an orange glow. I could see stars in the same vicinity behind it so I knew there were no clouds covering the moon. It was bright. I saw the moon earlier this evening, about 30 minutes to an hour prior to this, and it was a crescent moon.  This object was much more rounded and large.  I looked down for a split second as I took a step forward to try and get a better look and the thing appeared as though it was just shrinking; As if it were floating straight away, with no sound what so ever. I could still see the stars, and as it got smaller (further away) more stars appeared behind it, and no clouds were in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, and I won&#39;t say it was a UFO, but it was definitely something weird floating in the sky that I could not explain. Very large, no sound, glowing orange and I watched the object &#34;shrink&#34; into nothing and completely disappear very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It confused me and the more I went outside and looked around at the sky to see other objects in the sky in relation to where this thing was, the less I can explain what I saw!  This is my report and is honest and accurate to the best of my knowledge<n>

The sky was clear. I saw a gray, diamond shape enter my view over the constellation Lacerta.  It hung in the air completely still for a few seconds(about three seconds).  Then it made two counter-clockwise loop da loops.  At the top of the second loop it hung still again for a few more seconds(about five seconds).  Next it dipped left into a clockwise loop. At the top of this loop it doubled in speed and rose up and to the left toward the constellation Hercules until it was out of view.  The ufo looked like a gray matte diamond.  I saw no lights, heat, or exhaust.  Its movements were smooth and playful like a fish in water.<n>

Very low in the sky. It looked sort of circular and bright yellow/white and as it dimmed it went into a diamond shape, top being the widest. It was still dusk and could still see the outline of trees and the sky was dark blue. The object was about 3 miles west of my location on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After driving down the road a bit I felt odd sensations but nothing too particular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

On the evening of August 5th at approximately 19:30 a friend and I were videotaping an approaching storm the lightning was really going off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often film these storms and go back through my footage to find cool still images of lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today was just another day just another storm...so I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening I uploaded my video and started going through it for my shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I Scanned through the video something caught my eye flying across the top right corner of my screen. I watched this thing go by over and over and determined it moved to fast to be a bird or a plane, then I discovered that prior to seeing this object, something appears from a cloud in the middle of the screen and zig zags what appears to be into the distance then it shoots off with incredible speed and you here this sound like a ricochet. I decided I needed to go through this footage and see if I had captured any other activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I wanted to see what the thing was that was flying across the screen. I zoomed up on the image and it appears to be several (3-4) oval disc shaped objects flying together. I captured the still images for the evidence file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started back at the begging of my footage to see if any other activity was present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost right away just after my camera was placed I discover 2 more UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both appeared in different locations on the screen at almost the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first appeared about 100 yards away very quickly flies up from behind a large pine tree across the street and flips then descends and appears to go directly behind my buddies truck which we are positioned in front of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other UFO appears way up in the clouds and is moving very fast through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I scanned my footage further I discover another object moving very fast along the horizon real low. It enters from the right as it reaches the left side of the screen in moves in a very fast circular pattern upwards the disappears into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further along in the footage an object is seen on the right side of the screen. It appears to be moving towards us the changes direction sharply and zig zags 2 times then flies quickly into the distance. I zoomed up on this to discover it was 3-4 disc shaped objects flying together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this a few minutes later into the footage we encounter the first UFOs we talked about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other strange thing appears. A red light appears on the windshield of my buddies truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has no reflection in the glass and is only visible for .02 of a second. When I zoom in and slowed the image down it looks very strange and has a pattern of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Duration of the event less than 6 min 22 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy and I saw nothing during the time we were videotaping only afterwards was anything discovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This concludes my report.<n>

It was completely silent, and had no jet wash.<n>

The 1st time I spotted it, it was flying low, triangle shape with a light on each corner, they were not blinking and a red and white light in the middle. I spotted it about 200-300 feet away from me, I was on a gravel road and I have a flashing yellow light on my truck. I turned it off and back on a few times and the UFO came and flew right over me, then it jetted off fast, I could not hear a motor running when it was overhead of me. I then looked to see where it was and it was turning and coming back to where I was, it did this several times would fly right over top of me then leave really fast. To tell you the truth I was kinda scared cause it seemed to be following me. I never told anyone cause I didn&#39;t want them to think I was nuts but I told my best friend the other day and he said I described the Black Triangle. He said he believed me since I was not into UFO&#39;s. ! Today, I took my digital camera with me and when I spotted it I tried to get a pic, but both times I could not get it, then it took off real fast. This time I stopped my truck and turned off my radio and I could hear a humming noise from the UFO. I always see it flying early morning around 5-6am flying from Fulton area towards Columbia mo. I don&#39;t understand why I see this almost daily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOLLOW UP: I contacted the witness via email.  After this report he said he stopped seeing it.

It was flying north to northwest. I looked again because normally the planes don&#39;t fly that direction . Planes   have red white and blue lights and only three.  It moved very slow and again what struck me as odd was there was no sound what so ever.  You could see the pattern of lights three on each side and 2 sets of 2 in between that.  It just slowly went on it&#39;s way but I didn&#39;t continue to watch so I am not sure what happened.  I have never seen anything like this object or its size which was possibly twice as large as a jet plane and it was flying at a higher altitude (not much higher) then the planes from lax..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On holiday, with a visit from our friends.  Standing outside I looked up and spotted an object moving faster than an aeroplane or satellite.  It looked like a object which was cloaked - like a large piece of the black sky with stars was moving but was visible because it passed over the real stars.  I pointed up, my two friends both looked up and saw the object.  We could hear a high pitched whirring sound aswell.  I don&#39;t want to sound mad, but the perfect description is like a piece of the sky was moving (from the Chicken Little movie).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this obviously caught our interest, myself, my husband and our two friends sat outside looking at the sky.  It was a clear, starry night.  We then witnessed an orange object come towards us, high in the sky.  It headed out to the coastline where it just vanished.  Not a sight of it - there were no clouds, the object just diminished into thin air.  We watched this on a further two occasions.<n>

It appeared to be travelling slower then any aircraft.  Also it wasn&#39;t following any set pattern for normal aircraft in area.<n>

They were in a diagonal line and I thought they were way too low to be airplanes, and nothing was blinking either.  They seemed to be hovering in place.  I drove home to get my family and we went back out there, but by the time we got back (10 minutes), they was nothing there.  Over the next week, I talked to 2 more people that saw the same thing on the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just get off the phone with him leave my house and i see 2 bright orange lights seperate from each other very small. Too small to be any aircraft but very noticable, very bright, orange almost.  There was no cloud cover, very nice day and night over davie, florida at the time. As i started gettin closer and getting a clearer view there was 6 perfectly aligned. I turn to my friends who seem to not believe what im saying as i get my phone out to call my friend outside, as i apporached his house and i shouted for him to leave the house which he did and after we arrived we stared at the lights just hovering barley even moving. they were heading west at low speeds but unbelievably perfectly following in line perfectly alligned the first 2 just dissapeard out of no where at this time a friend arrives and sees everyone staring and he said he saw them on the highway 595 heading west to the area 5minutes before. we watched as they all flew over the same area and dissapeard into nothing..just gone. The last 2 hung around though and the 2nd to last actully droped something. It was just like a fireball falling from it like it droped something off that fell to the earth. i am certain as i have 20/20 vison and have seen the same bright craft around the airport before. I also remember noticing at the time no aircraft flying around, i am certain the formation or UFO&#39;s had been spotted by goverment aircraft as there was a plane flying unusally low to the south west heading and trying to stay just in view and slowed down and they had to have been watching the aircraft. Im pretty sure you guys already had this report, this was clear as day<n>

Directly West of Broward Blvd &amp; Flamingo Road were a total of 7 lights in the sky.  4 lights were in a linear formation ahead of 3 lights in a triangular formation...then the 3 caught up w/ the 4.  One neighbor came out of his house.  He stated that he saw them when they were East of our neighborhood and there was no sound.  We only saw them when they were well West, out over the everglades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the lights for about 12 minutes until they were out of sight.  They were not flashing in any manner...just constant light eminating from each object.  It was very freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is also in the flight pattern of jets landing at FLL.  There is NO WAY at all that these lights were any type of plane.  Nothing blinking, absolutely NOT following what the planes do (they land to the East, these were going straight West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only have very poor video from my phone as I was not in front of my house when we saw the lights.<n>

My son said &#34;Dad look at that light there in the sky, see how bright it is and close that it is, just watch it, it will zig and zag even stop then disapear, I saw it the other night and my friends thought I was nuts&#34;.  We all sat on the edge of the hot-tub and watched this low light that was moving at a pretty fast pace then slowed to a stop, zigged and zagged, seemed to go south then back north then continued it&#39;s movement in the eastward sky.  Then just as my son said it simply disappeared.  My son said this same thing happened a few days before except it was in the Northern sky from our house moving West to East.  My sighting was in the Southern Sky moving West to East.  The funny thing about this was there no sound, just a bright, bright light.  No flashing lights like an airplane just an extremely bright light.  There was not a cloud in the sky to have it disappear as it did, but the funny thing was, it did everything that my son said would happen, from what he had experienced a few days before.  We are a very normal family and wouldn&#39;t report this for fun.  It was just something that none of us had ever witnessed before except my 22 year old son.  I know it was not a plane or anyway one that was common to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked up I saw light about the size of the stars around but it was more of a solid circle than the fuzzy stars. The Object was moving not too fast in my opinion at first, but moving  Slightly to the Southwest it picked up speed very rapidly and the Mostly white with a blue haze vanished or it almost seamed to give off a sigle Dim flash effect, like that of a old lightbulb going out.  I had looked at the time right before my wife asked me to look and the time it took was definatly not more that 6 seconds, I would say 4 seconds is the correct length of time. I know it hard to judge altitude but after observing other planes and even high flying jet fighters in the area, that the object appeared ither in the sub-atmosphere or farther out into space.  But there is not really and way of knowing it actuall distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There were some fast moving clouds overhead, but I could see stars clearly.  I looked directly overhead and noticed a light as bright and the same scale as Jupiter that was moving very slowly toward the south.  After about a minute, the object dimmed and changed direction to the east, then quickly got bright again.  It continued on toward the south and again dimmed and changed direction to the east.  I thought I saw an outline, a hard black edge, cover the stars, but just for a moment.  Then it got bright again and continued to about 2 degrees above the horizon where it faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a meteor, but it was moving too slowly, and there was no trail.  There is an aiport nearby, but there was no sound and no flashing lights on the object.  Except for the dimming, it was a constant light.

There was no moon and all my neighbors had all there outside lights off.  Standing in the darkness for a few moments, I noticed a bright light on the horizon coming through the canopy of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was a plane.  As a few moments passed my second thought was helicopter. There is a small airport as well as a hospital a few miles from here.  Still keeping an eye on this light as it traveled towards me through the foliage my suspicion rising every  passing second.  Still waiting to hear the sound of the engine  or the rotors  in a few more moments it will break the tree line into open sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The instant it broke into open sky I knew. This is something  amazing. A extremely bright twinkling light traveling on a straight flight path making not a peep. Moving slow and steady like a satellite but super  low.  At that instant I turned  and opened my screen door reached  in onto the kitchen counter and grabbed my  video camera. Turning back through the door I turned the camera on and started shooting. The object was directly over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Totally freaked out heart pounding hands shaking,  I tried to film this as best as I could.  It was still moving at the same speed same direction.  From directly over head across the neighborhood  to about 2 o’clock on the opposite horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden it dimmed slightly and shot off at a unbelievable rate of speed.  And that was it.  I was left standing in the darkness alone.<n>

As I was driving, I noticed a strangely bright light over to my right. Because I was driving and could not stay focused on it I casually mentioned it to my husband (knowing if it was just a plane he would quickly settle the subject as he is very pragmatic) He continued to watch it quietly so I kept trying to grab glimpses to see it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began a discussion of what it might be: a big star??? =No, too big and close, a satellite? =No it was not moving across the sky and again seemed too close and too big...a planet?= nodefinately too big ...a plane? =No it had no other colored lights and was not growing larger or smaller during the duration of the drive like a plane flying toward you might.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very calm and curious but both fully attentive. I pulled into the drive way and went to look where we had seen it before and it was not there but as I turned back to lock the doors of the car I realized it was now front and center above the tree line before me.Now,I was fully awake. We stood watching it for a bit. There was absolutely no sound. It appeared to be a reflectively bright metal, very roundish with a slight bluish tint. We both remained calm but my husband suggested we go inside and get a camera and binoculars. We turned to do so and saw a bluish light coming from our computer room=which would not be strange except that my husband turns things off obsessively (he is forever accidently locking me in and out of places or turning things like the TV off when I am in the bathroom) So I assure you the computer was turned off when we left for work that morning and no one was in the house all day =to our knowledge. Now we were both unsettled. We went inside quietly and brought out the camera and the binoculars. The object had moved only slightly in what I would liken to the movement that one experiences in an ocean tide...as if it were treading water and had to actively move a bit to stay in place. The camera with a telephoto lens could not pick up any details more than the naked eye but the binoculars gave me enough to reiterate that it appeared to be a craft of metal in the shape of a cylinder on end or a roundish object. I could not see any &#34;spinning&#34; or movement of the craft itself. Given the camera lens was not strong enough and the binoculars were =the distance to teh object might be estimated I would think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband suggested that we go inside. Both of us were on edge and when we went into the computer room. The computer was on and my husband asked if I smelled something. He thought it smelled like body odor but I felt it was more an electrical smell with biological undertones to it. The room next over also had a slightly strange scent. We then took a heavy metal flash light and walked the entire house from attic to basement and found nothing else disturbed and Thank God found nothing “unusual” in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not check on the light again as we both thought it best just to lock all of the doors and quietly go to bed and leave well enough alone.  Although I am as curious as most about UFOs and have pondered things I have seen in the sky before this was the first encounter that I have had that warrants any comment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are pretty average people. We are both employed in corporations and work hard. We have 4 children who were all out of town at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She called my attention to it and several other people rushed to observe the estimated 30-40 foot in diameter object as it wobbled but deliberately moved to our left (NNE) between Concourse K and L toward the main body of Terminal 3.  It took about 60 seconds to enter and exit our field of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its destinctive peripherial protrusions, like notches on a gear, were its primary identifying feature to me.  It was dull gray (my wife noticed orange/rust) with an undulating movement.  It traveled low under the cloud ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We laughed and moved closer to the windows and I told my wife to try for a phone camera shot but she couldn&#39;t manage it in time.  Another lady asked &#34;what in the world is such a big flying hubcap doing out there&#34;.  Others looked and turned their heads in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to the sighting there was very little aircraft activity in this wing of O&#39;hare.  There was a burst of aircraft activity after the object departed and a large storm moved in at 7:30 pm.  An aircraft appeared to be disabled during the 7:00-8:00 pm period.  Tornado warnings and high winds followed and passengers took shelter in the tunnels of O&#39;hare.  We finally departed on AA 1058 to Orlando from Gate K-15 at about midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 61 year old geologist with 30 years of international experience, an amateur astronomer, and IUFOC attendee for many years.<n>

I was just looking at the sky and the stars.  It was a very clear night and I saw several shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly (at 3.40am) two orange coloured lights/balls appeared in the sky above me, travelling southwards.  They were side by side and seemed to be dancing and playfully side stepping each other.  They travelled much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, though it was hard to gauge how high up they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were definitely not airplanes.  There were no trails, just round objects.

Staring at it because it was so bright white it amazed me because it elongated itself. So I then I opened the door and stuck my head calling for my daughters to come and see the UFO. My daughter was just as amazed as I was and as we were watching, this big bright light went behind the house and just disappeared. My daughter said that it was a shooting star but as at the angle it was coming down bright white as it was, it would have hit the ground exploding but there was no crash no big booming sound, it just vanished. After that my daughter called for her mom and sister and that is where my wife noticed if &amp; brought out her tri-pod and camera. This opjected moved from side to side very very fast and changing shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw my first star, made my wish, and continued looking around in the sky above me. [I don&#39;t have much visibility when it comes to seeing stars in the sky in any other direction other than UP, due to very tall oak trees in the neighborhood- unless I&#39;m standing at the end of the driveway].<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I walked towards the street to get a better view of the north star, which seemed especially bright. I stood there for about 1 minute, turned around to look down the other end of the street for a few seconds, and turned back. THAT IS WHEN out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very large glowing orange sphere southwest of the north star! I was able to focus in on it, but only with my eyes because I was afraid if I ran inside to grab a camera, that it would leave as quickly as it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary for about 5 seconds or so, and then seemed to &#34;dance&#34; or bobble in the air, up and down, for about 10 seconds before making about a 45 degree northwestern - western departure trail down the street. [I say this because I lost visibility due to the tall oak trees in the neighborhood, and wasn&#39;t able to run fast enough to follow exactly how it left and where it left to]. It was silent the entire time! I ran inside to tell my parter to come outside and help me look around for it, but it was too late. I feel so lucky to have seen what I did, but at the same time it almost seems too surreal. But I know what I saw... I hope someone else out there saw it too! And was able to snap a picture or videotape it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were airplanes in the air, both before and after the UFO sighting, however they were VERY high in the sky and appeared to be moving slowly in a straight path, blinking red and white lights- which was NOTHING like the UFO that I witnessed! It was NOT an airplane and it was NOT a helicopter!<n>

The light was a bright green color and the object seemed close due to the size of the light.The light was also solid (not flashing). I sat there watching it descend downwards at an angle fairly quickly. My first thought was it was a plane that lost control and was about to crash because of the high speed it was traveling downward,  so I ran to my window. I didn’t even reach my window when I saw one sudden burst of yellow/white light from the object  after watching it for about 10-15 seconds and than it was gone in a flash. I stared out my window for the next half hour  waiting to see if I could see this light again but there was no sign of it. I did see plenty of airplanes flying after this happened, however this was flying much closer to the ground. I&#39;ve always been skeptical about UFO&#39;s &amp; aliens, but now I definately am a believer!<n>

Out of nowhere we see a thin rectangular, lit-up white, object in the sky above the houses in the distance.  It was moving very, very fast (faster than any airplane or meteor) with an emerald green-ish light trail, and no sounds at all were emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it lit up the sky around it to a daylight and was gone in an instant.<n>

The size is hard to determine but if I were to put 75-100 stars together, it might approximate the size if it.  It was heading across the sky from east to west at approximately 10:00pm last night, Sunday night. It arked slightly, seeming to hesitate, as if to drop into the ocean, but then as if &#34;restarting&#34; it zoomed across the night sky, with a tail of lesser light trailing behind it. It took about 3 seconds for the whole thing and I was sure that there were reports of it but when I called the police station, no one had mentioned anything.  It was not a shooting star.<n>

We didn&#39;t see the ISS, but my wife saw a green fireball, which was trailing red-orange sparks, and a long white tail, with green and red mixed in. She said &#34;Look&#34;. My son and granddaughter looked up in time to see the object. It was traveling from east to west. It appeared about 60-70 degrees above the southern horizon. It lasted about 3 seconds. What was interesting, was that it was long enough, for my son and granddaughter to react, and observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I had gone inside to check on the internet, regarding the time of the ISS passage, and missed it. It was the first time the three had ever seen a fireball. The object looked like the size of a tennis ball, held at arms length, and the tail was as wide as the fireball was thick. The object eventually disappeared over our roof, as our deck is on the east side of our house. Therefore, we don&#39;t know if it continued to be  visible. However, my wife is sure it was visible for about 3 seconds, at least. What was strange, though, is that it seemed to travel parallel to the ground, not descending, as one would expect, if it were entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we all looked at each other asking if we just saw it.  IT was very weird.<n>

We often see and hear helicopters as we are in an urban area and just a few blocks from a major shock trauma center so there is much activity.  This night however as I sat on my deck I noticed to my left in the eastern sky what appeared to be a low helicopter heading west, the bright light on it however was larger than normal and was of a light green color which I’ve never seen in the three years of living here.  As it got closer to being overhead it appeared to be oval shaped and I realized there was absolutely NO NOISE, no engine sound, and no propeller sound.  All at once the light seemed to flash one time and go dark, completely dark, nothing, not a sound.  I mean it just went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  It was incredible.  And in the sky where the light had just been extinguished, there was nothing but clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anybody give me any explanation for this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

There were no sounds coming from the craft. A half moon neon bluish green shape was on the front of the craft. As it passed overhead you could see two brights lights on either side which could have been some sort of engine. It cleared the entire viewing span of the sky in less then 1 minute and appeared to be only a few hundred yards above the earth. I was not going to tell anyone this until I saw the same type of reports on this website. I can say for sure it was not a helicopter nor was it a plane. It was not like any aircraft I have yet to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the size of a large star but, as the object came closer overhead, it grew almost to the size of a full moon. It suddenly veered off towards the south and only a white tip, the size of a large star, was visible with the exception of a black rectangular shadow that seemed attached to the tip. There were small sparks/flames from the tip (like a firework}. It moved exceedingly rapidly.  It then vanished for a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, in its place appeared a huge, clearly defined horizontal teardrop shaped object--with 2 extending tips on each end at the middle - that was a brilliant orange. This object was the size of at least two (2) full moons not including the tips. The object was not moving.  Just as suddenly this entire object turned beautiful neon green. The shape did not change nor did object move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden there appeared, at the top middle and middle rear part of the object, what appeared to be cartoon lightening streaks. In other words these streaks were jagged, had width but were very small in comparison (approximately 3 - 4 regular stars in length). They were gold in color. They did not move nor did they glow. They did not seem like rays and their shape was clearly defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as suddenly the entire object completely disappeared without any trace. There was no noticeable sound at any time. This entire episode lasted approximately fifteen (15) minutes<n>

As it moved closer it slowly dimmed to an ember/amber color for 20 seconds and before it reached overhead and disappeared with no sound. that night i even saw many blinking jet liners and even a large meteor burning towards the earth like hot magnesium..no it didn&#39;t hit the ground ha ha. it lit up trees in front of me before i turned around and spotted the flaming rock, so that provided great references to the mysterious object i saw. it was not a plane and definitely not a meteor. ive seen this object four times in the past few months so its a common phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It travelled at about 400 ft in elevation in a N.E. direction where it joined another craft of same description. Where they joined was a much higher elevation(approx 3000 ft). The object(s) moved slightly faster than current wind speeds by my estimation but was obiously not a traditional aircraft. The first craft had no wings, or markings, it was very plain, shaped like two bowls joined together rim to rim, one bowl being shiny metallic, and the other being flat white or light grey. It seemed to rock gently back and forth as it met the other craft which &#34;waited&#34; for the first craft. Once joined(within 200 ft of each other)they proceeded N.N.E out of my sight behind trees. I do not claim to know what they were but give my word that my description is as accurate as I could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It started to the west of Sunriver out over the Cascades, moved to the South East over LaPine, then headed due North over Bend.  It was way up there.  I saw a jet flying which I guessed was at 30-36 thousand feet and this object was over twice as high.

My only belief that it is a UFO, is that is was traveling rather slowly, yet still fast, but I could notice a lack in speed. A week later, I had found out that a friend of mine was staying at his grandparents, and while on the couch sleeping, he suddenly woke up due to a bright green light in the sky. When I had seen the green ball, it wasn&#39;t that bright to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was unusual was that instead of the soft white light usually associated with meteorites this exhibited a brilliant white light with a slight golden hue and without the usual long streaking tail seen along with a typical meteor. Instead of a tail there were tongues of red flame flying out from behind. The fireball, to my left from my vantage point as I drove along, disappeared behind Badger Mountain and as it went behind the crest of the hill I could see the glow which then momentarily grew very intense and then collapsed which would indicate that it had exploded<n>

Upon uploading the pictures to the computer and as I viewed each picture there was a dramatic change in some and I also was able to catch a picture with a plane going by when it quickly moved as the plane flew by. The camera was in one place and not moved as I took each shot. Please<n>

I went outside on the back porch to smoke a cigarette. As usual I look at the stars (living outside the city of Jacksonville Florida I can really see the stars at night now) I noticed a flashing light. At first I thought nothing about it, because living near the Jacksonville International Airport, you can see aircraft flying over at any giving time. But I noticed that the lights were flashing too fast.  And then I noticed the movement of the &#34;lights.&#34;  They move up, and then down several times, and then left and right several times, in a fashion that a commercial, military, or private aircraft are not able to do. The movements were in 90 degree’s, at first the movements were in a box, then a cross.  I stood in the grass looking at the lights for a few minutes and they continued moving around as they just disappeared,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m am 36 years old and have worked in the aviation field and I have never seen anything like this<n>

This particular Saturday night I was standing on my porch which faces south. I was just about to go inside when I observed some sort of oval craft travelling North to South. The craft had no lights, but was a light color which made it just visible in the star light. It was pretty low, maybe 500 feet or so. It made no audible sound, was moving very fast and in a perfectly straight line with no visible variation in speed. It was about the size of a thumbnail held at arms length. As it was passing over my neighbors house I ran down to the street in hopes of visually re acquiring it, but it was already out of sight. At first I thought it may be a bird flying at night, but I don&#39;t know of any birds which fly  500 feet high at that speed, in a straight line at 10:40pm at such a size. Most birds are not oval either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this thing was passing over, the dogs in the general area began barking which lasted for about 2 minutes. After observing the sky for another 10 minutes or so, I went inside. We are currently dog sitting my Mother In Laws little dog which I found cowering in the corner of the living room. I have never seen her do that. It took several minutes to get her calmed and to stop shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing worth mentioning is that this craft, or whatever it was, took the exact trajectory as the first craft I witnessed back in March 08&#39;. My March 08 sightings (there was one and then 3 in a row a few nights later)were the first sightings I have had in my 45 years. I was somewhat of a skeptic until recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed that many professional people, including astronauts and pilots are beginning to come forward regarding their UFO experiences. This coupled with what I have seen to be a rash of sightings recently leads me to believe we may soon, and finally have conformation of what is really going on here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After the flash I saw a large, wide trail streaking towards the southwest.  The trail was yellowish in color, with green towards the leading edge.  After the flash and trail disappeared, there were two parallel gray streaks which lasted for several seconds.  It didn’t look like any meteor or fireball I have ever seen, maybe space debris re-entering?  It looked more like some type of exhaust trail or plume from a missile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the local paper and the internet for any other reports, all I could locate was the following entry in an astronomy message board. Maybe someone can identify what TV station the person is talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object crashed by Ca. border last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just heard on the news that an object was observed, looking much like a meteor, but changing directions, then hit the ground.

The sky was clear so I was able to see the shapes. There appeared to be no visible lights on the objects. The first one I saw was like the shape of a pointed roof top. It seemed to be smaller than the second one, Although they appeared to be at the same altitude. The second one was in the shape of a very large boomerang and both seemed to glide through the air without sound. They were both gray in color and flew in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a lover of the universe and always venture out at night to view the stars.

Their was a slight breeze so it was very comfortable (no bugs) and the temperature was nice (maybe 75 F), A MASSIVE heat lightning storm was constantly lighting up the eastward sky (towards Raleigh NC) from us in Fuquay Varina NC. No rain, no thunder. At 10:30PM (approx) my wife said &#34;ARE YOU SEEING THAT?&#34; We stopped in the street as we were walking and looked up and in the direction of the lightning (EAST), but between us the lightning was a single glowing silent bluish green round orb. Slowing accending and getting farther away. I had no watch, cel phone nor camera of any kind. We watched it accend and fade into the distance in about 60 seconds. It had a smooth SPLINE flight path but NOT EXACLTY straight. I moved like it could be a self-illuminated turquoise balloon. BUT it&#39;s size was much bigger than the regular basketball-sized party balloon. If you hold out your arm and look at your pinky fingernail. It was about that size in the sky. And we would guess a few thousand feet away at least. So I would estimate it to be at least the size of a van. Maybe 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a hot air balloon (but it was completely round and not pointed at the bottom like a hot air balloon). But a party balloon that size in the sky would only be a few houses away, maybe 200 feet. This thing was UP in the sky and getting higher and &#34;drifting&#34; away at a pretty good speed. It HAD to be bigger. It glowed a strange color. Not intense green color like a street light. More of a diffused turquoise color. I say it was more green and my wife says it was more blue. But we both agree it was turquoise. It was completely silent. Straight above us was a clear patch of sky with no clouds and bright white stars. It was not &#34;bright&#34; like Venus was that night. It was dimmer but still clearly defined against the sky. Possibly it was brighter at the center than the edges of the object but I can&#39;t say for certa! in. I&#39;ve never seen an object/light that color, especially in the sky before. It got so distant after a minute you could not see it anymore. There was a few neighbors (2 adult men) also looking in the object&#39;s direction standing in the street a few houses down (probably looking at the constant lightning which was beautiful) and I was gonna ask them if they saw the object but before I reached them they went inside. I don&#39;t know them so I did not ring their doorbell. The next day I asked a few neighbors I do know and they of course laughed and said no they didn&#39;t see anything the night before. Then I googled to see if anyone else saw the object and might be chatting about it, and found a wikipedia description of the same or similar turquoise object (the one I saw never grew a white comet-like tail) being spotted in nearby Charlotte a year or so before. So after telling my wife THAT, she said I should report it. I called the local police and they said ANYTHING having to do with the sky is the FAAs domain. So I called them and got an answering machine. I left a message. Then I left a message at my local newspaper. THEN I reported it on MUFON. Then I called 2 local tv stations and they said they had not had any reports about it. It&#39;s really bugging me. I really want to know what it was - and stangely AS I WAS WATCHING IT, I was already bummed out that I&#39;ll probably NEVER KNOW what I&#39;m looking even is. And although, I did not have a camera I&#39;m a graphic artist so I immediately made a composite (re-creation) photograph or what it looked like (using imagery from the web). I hope you can understand the experience we had and help discern what it might&#39;ve been. About 45 minutes later my wife saw a &#34;shooting star&#34; in the areaof sky as the round object. We stayed outside for about an hour after talking about it and hoping to see it again. But we never did. Now I keep a digital camera with me when I walk our neighborhood.<n>

I was going to wait for the vehicle to pass and then pull out behind it into traffic.  It took longer than expected to get past me so I went to look up again and that’s when I realized it wasn’t what I’d expected to be looking at.  It appeared to be about the size of 2 large pickup trucks in length, triangular shaped with 3 bright lights emitting to the front of the vehicle and it was a color best described as a darker-tint stainless steel.  There was 1 light on each side and one in the middle of the front.  It was approximately 2 to 2.5 inches in height (thickness) and was approximately 5 feet off of the roadway moving slower than the speed limit which was 35mph.  Very shortly after passing in front of me it completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were watching shooting stars and watching the sky as many of us find as an enjoyment before going to sleep. Right at 9:49, an bright light appeared in the southern sky (looked like landing lights at first), note the airport is closed to all operations after 8pm local time. All of our group was very surprised by this and thought it to be an aircraft in distress. As the object approached the airfield, it was traveling directly north, at an estimated 2,000 ft (aprox only, we cannot verify this), and crossed just to the west of the airfield, paralleling runway 18/36. As it got closer many of the group members took snap shots and video, which many are blurry etc but it was there. As the object came within viewing distance, the only visible part was a large flame. This flame was twice the size of Jupiter in the southern sky. It was moving fairly slow, less that 100kts as it moved over the airfield, and it resembled the flame of a hot air balloon, but was silent. We had the knowledge that hot air balloons do not fly at night and that they are easily heard from the ground, and also the flame never went out, like many times happens in a hot air balloon. This object moved to the north of the airfield, we aprox. Over top of the north 40 area, and it made a left 45 degree turn, and rapidly departed the area, not only gaining altitude, but it increased its lateral distance from us at a tremendous rate. All of the members of the group fly for a profession; (commercial and private pilots) were all in stun having never seen this before. This object lasted 3-4 minutes of duration as it moved over the area. We immediately notified the Chicago ARTCC for a possible aircraft in distress (they notified CAP) also, we contacted the UFO reporting hotline as this was a UFO (could be hot air balloon but it is not likely) there for w! e classi fied it as a UFO. Chicago ARTCC said they had nothing on radar and we also confirmed this with flightaware.com. This report is to reflect the phone call to the UFO reporting hotline, and shall supplement that. If any clarification is needed please contact me.

My attention was drawn by a very bright flash, like a photographic flash, to the southwest. When the flash dissipated, there was a glowing white object in the spot where the flash originated. The object looked like a large satellite, blinking on and off in an irregular pattern glowing brightly for about a second then dimming to complete darkness for one to several seconds. My first impression was that it was some type of satellite which was rotating and reflecting the sun, but I would imagine that the pattern of flashes would be at a more consistent interval. The object continued flashing on and off for about a minute. By connecting the locations where the object was glowing, it made a shallow ‘S’ shaped path, finally disappearing to the northwest. I checked the Heavens Above site for iridium flares and other objects which would account for this sighting, but I could not find anything for that time frame and location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since I already had my binoculars in my hand, I zoomed in on it up close it was squared off in the front like a bay windows yet rounded as it tapered off towards the back,it was totally silent did not make any wild manoeuvres, Stayed at constant speed, no lights or flashing lights at all, it just traveled a straight low line until I could no longer see it.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever.Left no smoke/com trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent, and oval in shape.I could see through membrane but the &#34;teardrop&#34; shaped craft was solid with defenent shape.I did not panic, felt no fear or anxiety, just intent on details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plus it was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading.It was not a plane for it had no wings and as close as it was I would have heard the engines, this craft was silent.I would guess the size -30x20x5&#39; towards the back. I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain..It was not a satellite, plane,swamp gas,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,or helicopter .I know the constellations,I have see MANY satellites and shooting stars, we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including stealth military aircraft.By its description It sounds like what a friend and his father saw about the first of June 08.The one they saw was flying at tree top level at a constant speed,with some manoeuvring and in the same area of the city.It also had that weird membrane, was teardop in shape the only difference was the craft they saw was emitting a reddish light and was much lower.I realize this is only anecdotal evidence, one mans story, but I will never forget it and from now I will have a camera along with my telescope and binoculars!<n>

Then we thought possibly a meteor, but did not see any explosion or fire from the landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to drive, we did a relative size comparison such as: bigger than my Honda CR-V  car tire, bigger than a merge sign, bigger than the small bushes lining the highway. From the distance that we saw the object, we agreed that it was approximately as big as a small car such as a Metro or similar. The shape was hard to determine due to the trail of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flames were coming up from the head and there was a short flame tail behind it. The color was bright white when we first saw it at approximately 1,000 feet up and then became a greenish color (which my passenger commented was the color of a hot object cooling down).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to locate any news reports of this incident on the internet, newspapers or local TV news websites.<n>
8/2/08 01:30|Oregon City|OR|Other|6 minutes|At 1:30am a very large craft approaches Portland, OR airport from the south and stops near Oregon City.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74919.html|475|ndxe200808| At 1:30am a very large craft approaches Portland, OR airport from the south and stops near Oregon City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, 2nd August 2008, my wife and I drove from home in Idaho to Oregon City to visit with my sister and brother-in-law. My sister has a trailer for camping and when we go to visit, the trailer parked beside the house, becomes our bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to bed and after a while I began having some sinus problems and got up to work on the problem. I decided it was time for some fresh air and stepped outside and was soon joined by my wife checking to see if I was ok. From the front door of the trailer we could see some stars but decided to move to the west end of the trailer where the view was better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear starry night, some light pollution since we were in a city, but because it was 1:30am all was quiet and the stars were plentiful. We saw an airplane off in the distance traveling northwest with the navigational strobe lights flashing and it soon ranged out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw another airplane approaching from the south with headlights on as planes do for night landings, and the Portland airport was about 16 miles due north. At first I had a feeling that the airplane was not quite &#34;right&#34; but did not think too much about it. As we watched it approach closer to us from the south, I thought &#34;those landing lights are really bright.&#34; Indeed, single lights could not be seen but the whole front of the plane facing us was lit up with very intense beams. As the plane moved through the sky it was eclipsing stars--as it came between us and a star the star of course would vanish, it then reappeared as the plane moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it happened. The very bright lights of the plane, in two second steps, began fading. Fade, fade, fade...step at a time until no lights were on.  All this while, and this was most interesting, the plane slowed to a stop.  When we first saw it the plane was at about a 15º angle above level and now it was nearly 60º above level and very close.  I estimated it was a thick tapezoid hovering less than 4 miles away over the Willamette River.  Even though the bright lights were out, a faded outline could be seen for more than a minute.  Once the headlights were completely out, we saw that there were no navigation lights flashing.  The plane had mostly vanished from the sky, at least no bright lights to say it was there.  Also, no stars were being eclipsed in any direction from where it stopped and turned off the lights.  About a minute after the lights were completely out, there was a quick small flash, smaller than the outline area of the plane, and then it actually vanished.  Actually vanished because the starlight it blocked now shown through and no star eclipses were in any direction from that point.  If my guess on distance is accurate, then the craft would have been at least 200 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plane? I don&#39;t think so.<n>

The sky was perfectly clear you could see every star. We had all of the outside lights off and were just sitting there talking when a bright light, almost like a ball of lightening, shined through the top of the trees. It was very bright, and scared us a lot. We ran to the end of the driveway, about 15 yards, only to find no kind of air craft such as an airplane or helicopter to be visible. It was almost as if someone took a picture of us from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it may have been lightning but considering there were NO clouds in the sky and we saw no other flashes of lightening we had decided we may have seen a ufo. Later, about five minutes after the burst of light, I was determined to see something else and I did. I saw a very quickly moving object, which looked almost like a shooting star fly over the top of us. I dont think it was a shooting star because it had two purple streaks of light coming from behind it as if it had wings and engines. The drawing from the sighting in Lexington, Kentucky on your home page looks very similar to what I saw, may have been the same thing.  My friend did not see this object, because by the time I could say &#34;look&#34;, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/2/08 00:30|Shellbrook (Canada)|SK|Circle|1 hour|Object, low in southwestern sky moves up and to the  west and begins flashing multicolored lights, appears to be rotating.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65125.html|477|ndxe200808| Object, low in southwestern sky moves up and to the  west and begins flashing multicolored lights, appears to be rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 2nd 2008, I was visiting my parents in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan for the weekend. It was after midnight and I went out onto the front step of the house for a cigarette before I went to bed. (The front step faces almost directly west with a clear line of sight due to base ball diamonds adjacent to my parents acreage.) While I smoked, I looked up into the clear, cloudless sky and I was amazed at how I could see so many stars. As I was scanning the South western part of the sky I saw a small object quite low, slightly above the horizon (it looked like a star) begin to move toward the west on a roughly 45 degree angle and it continued to move until it was almost directly west of my location on the stoop (this took just seconds)but high enough in the sky that I had to slightly tilt my head back. At this point the movement stopped and many bright colored lights, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, started to flash, as if the object was rotating. The colored flashes were intense and each color was distinguishable. I took out a small set of binoculars and I was able to get a slightly better view of the colored lights, I still could not exactly determine what it was, but it was definitely spinning at a crazy speed. There is a large radio antenna about a mile west of my parents home, and from my vantage point on the step this object was at least 4-5 times higher than the height of the tower, so this gave me some perspective, It must have been quite far away. I went inside and found my sixteen year old niece and asked her to come take a look, she came outside and ran back in the house after seeing the lights. I then I went inside and asked  my mother to get out of bed to take a look at this strange flashing object. She and I stood and watched it hover at the same location for several minutes. She went back to bed and I stayed outside for 15 to 20 more minutes and watched the amazing light show.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/2/08 00:30|Rockford/Loves Park|IL|Circle|1.5hrs|Strange colorful ball of light over Loves Park IL late at night|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64978.html|478|ndxe200808| Strange colorful ball of light over Loves Park IL late at night<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to be completely honest and explain my background on this matter before I tell this story.  Up until about a month ago, I like many people thought that when people say they saw a “UFO” that they were a little… weird…  Even though I saw something strange in the late 90’s, I thought it was explained by the news.  After watching a recent episode of Larry King, and seeing something mentioned about the Phoenix Lights (which I had no prior knowledge of because I did not watch TV in those days, yet it reminded me of what I had seen in the 90’s) I also thought of something that my best friend (who does his best to explain stories in truth and detail) told me a few years ago that he saw.  I was puzzled by the story about he and several other people at a stop light seeing a an oval metallic disc slightly larger than a car, with lights all around it silently hovering over the intersection only about 40ft up.   He said he stepped out of the car, and it tilted a bit and took off at a VERY high speed, still making no sound.  I figured he and his wife had some sort of temporary insanity.  I found the Phoenix lights DVD on ebay, and purchased it.  I asked my friend about that story again, and told me again.  He said he never told many people because people (including myself) just looked at him like he was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the Phoenix lights DVD, I was amazed.  It looked just like what I had seen in the sky over Rockford at around that time.  The local news also said it was probably military flares, and that was the end of it. I assumed they were telling the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started doing some research and started to scan the sky day and night, lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom barrowed my Phoenix Lights DVD, as she is interested in the subject.  My step dad, who is very skeptical made a joke about her watching the sky since watching the video.  I admitted that I do, but made the joke that my chances of seeing something now that I have this interest are probably much slimmer.  It would be a very strange coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason it wouldn’t be less likely to see something would simply be because I am actually watching, now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left my mom’s house on Friday night, about midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 12:30am, I was looking up at stars in the sky, as I was walking to my garage to get something.  I looked to the north east probably above the nearby cities of Loves Park, or Machesney Park, IL (about 5-10 miles away) and noticed a light that looked like it was about 400-500ft high.  No structures or towers in that area, (that I know of) are nearly that high.  The light was distant, but coming from a fairly large source, because I could tell that the lights were alternating green and red with an orange/yellow in it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a helicopter.  I couldn&#39;t hear it, but that seemed normal since it was so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for several minutes.  I figured if it was a jet or a helicopter that was flying directly away from my view, it would soon look smaller and vanish from view.  If it were flying toward me, it would do the opposite, and I would soon know for sure.  It did neither.  What it did appear to do is jerk left, then right short distances every minute or so.  I saw a jet fly by a little closer, but higher in the sky, and it looked completely different.  The light started to slowly move upward and further to the east.  I went inside and told my girlfriend to go out with me and check it out.  I got my camcorder.  I wanted to make sure I had at least these 2 witnesses, so if I told anyone, they wouldn’t just say that it was just a case of me wanting to see something since I’m suddenly interested in it (which I am sure people wll probably think anyway)  My camcorder has 3CCDs, so I knew it would pick up the colors, well, which it did, but it was too dark outside and too distant to see exactly what it was.  She watched it, and said she saw it occasionally see it jerk left and right.  To make sure that both of us didn&#39;t have a case of our eyes playing tricks on us, we put the camcorder on the light(s), and stared at a star to see if just watching a distant light that intently caused our eyes to make that effect appear, because it was so slight.  That was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over about a half hour, it looked like it had climbed a few hundred more feet in the sky.  This was also after several jets had passed it.  I decided to get into my car and drive toward it.  By the time I had gotten to where I think it was when I first saw it, It had gone several hundred more feet into the sky, and a bit further north.  By this time, it was so far away, at first glance it just blended in with the stars.  No one would notice it.  The colored lights were the same, but washed out by the distance.  This was confirmed when I got home and could see it much further up in the sky.  I had landmarks I could measure it’s movement with.  A neighbor’s roof, and a tree made good reference points.  It got to the point where I could no longer see it on my camcorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know how long a helicopter can hover, but by 2:00am, I had to get to bed, and could no longer observe.  I am no expert, but I have not ever seen a Helicopter behave that way, and can&#39;t imagine it would for any reason over loves park/Machesney Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know is that we did not know what it was, and still don&#39;t after looking at the video.  I didn&#39;t know who to call if anyone to see if anyone else saw it. I was not able to watch the news last night to see if anything was reported.  I’m not sure how to find out if anything was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found this website, and figured I would post the info here first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (for option below: I am not requesting to be contacted, but will be happy to answer any questions if someone wishes to contact me, or provide a copy of the video, upon request)<n>

He said it stayed at the same spot for about 10 seconds and then zoomed off extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the picture he took enlarged several times, it appears to be a complete black circle outlined with a purplish blue light surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only 1 circle that appeared and the only other things in the sky at that time were clouds and a few geese off to the left side, but not near the circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a photo of this circle on my cell phone.  I would need to send it to you in a text message.<n>
8/1/08 23:45|Billings|MT|Cross|15 mins|A cross-shaped craft seen over Billings, MT.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64937.html|483|ndxe200808| A cross-shaped craft seen over Billings, MT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: August 1st, 2008 Time: 23:45 pm MST Location: 23rd floor, Crowne Plaza Hotel  Description of object seen: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which would shift over to a white color, then back to a red color.  Near the end of the sighting, the one light changed into 3 lights, colored red, green, and yellowish white. And, when bathed in the street light below, one could make out a cross like shape before the craft made it&#39;s exit from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object&#39;s Behaviors: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which, after seconds of sighting, began to drift to the left slowly then would STOP, change directions, STOP, and change directions again in a very erratic and sudden fashion, changing directions far too much and too fast to be of any known aircraft.  The red light would, at times, shift, or slowly turn into a white light at times, and in both modes, the light would suddenly flare, or would brighten drastically and then dim back down at random intervals and would appear to have sudden lashes of light whip from it, the color corresponding to the current color of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft would not stay in just one general area, but would at times, move over to another area, fly about in that area, and would then return to the previous area to seemingly wander that area some more.  This was observed for approx. 14 mins. before the craft suddenly multiplied for a total of three 3 lights, a red, green, and yellowish light and began to approach closer to the western end of the town at a very quick speed, much quicker than most civilian helicopters I&#39;ve seen about town.  And after a moment or so, I saw that the ambient light from the streetlights below had illuminated the underside of the craft, showing a white colored cross-like shape, before the craft swiftly flew far off over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Number of objects: One  Shape and Color: White cross shaped craft with red, green, and off-white colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of Sighting: approx. 15 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses: One, myself, station monitor in radio station on top floor of hotel building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes: All range estimates are based on pure conjecture and should not be considered to be ACCURATE data. It should be noted that I did call a friend during the sighting to describe the event.<n>

Just a solid yellow-orange light, it was pretty high on a stable trajactory going from east to west as the object got closer, we could see it there was another object hovering over the light but we could barely see it, and there was no noise coming from the object as it flew over us. It was very quite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran inside to get our camera and started video taping he object as it was moving away in stable line. The object disappeared and it was gone, like the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the object on video, not the best, but you can see the objects orange/yellow color lights.<n>
8/1/08 23:00|Somerset|NJ|Disk|1 hour|Tonight I saw many little aircrafts with two bright lights each, blinking in the dark sky, w/ one saucer leading the way.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64929.html|485|ndxe200808| Tonight I saw many little aircrafts with two bright lights each, blinking in the dark sky, w/ one saucer leading the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:55 or so and I just got back from the movies. Everything was fine. My uncle dropped me off and he stayed outside in the front to chat with my step-father. I was inside getting dressed when my uncle calls at me to get outside. I run outside and so does my mother and we see these red and blue lights blinking. The lights (we believe it was some type of aircraft) were close together and moving at a very fast pace. Every time we blinked, &#34;the craft&#34; was farther than before. I blew it off and said it was only an airplane. My uncle kept telling me it wasn&#39;t an airplane, though. I stayed outside with him while my mother and step-father went inside. My uncle searched the sky while I just stood there. Then he told me to look up and that&#39;s when we saw it. It had white and blue and red lights. It was very close. Every time the lights blinked, the outline of a saucer could be visible. I was in shock. I had always wanted to see a UFO and there it was before my eyes. I couldn&#39;t believe it. It passed us and then we really started searching the sky. After 15 minutes, we saw two more. These looked triangular shaped by the way the lights were fixed. They were a little far but the aircraft were very close to one another. After about 20 minutes then, we kept searching the sky and we did indeed see two real airplanes and that was that. I had to go inside and my uncle decided to go home. As soon as I got into my room, my uncle called me and told me to look out the window. Indeed there it was again. One more triangular shaped aircraft. My uncle tried following it but he lost track due to keeping his eyes both on the road and the craft. When he got home (took him 5 minutes), he saw one above his house and he called out my grandma who saw it. She said it was impossible to be an airplane because it flew so low and had way too many blinking lights. It was about 11:40 and my uncle saw one more above the St. Peter and Paul church. We believe this one was one of the many we had seen before. My uncle we! nt in ba ck inside his house due to a skunk being outside and he looked outside his window and saw one more. Same triangle shaped. Back at my house, I saw one more. One white light and it traveled fast. I have no idea what that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, I&#39;m writing this to explain to you that I simply cannot explain the events that have occured tonight. I&#39;m hoping you can. Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had been the first night for a while I could see them so clear. I was looking north over the top of our house there were several planes towards the south where the regional airport is and DIA. I saw a bright light which I believed to be another plane coming from the north west towards southeast. I was watching it and realized there were no lights around it flashing like a plane and it was going faster then a plane but not as fast as a falling star and it was heading more up then down like a star would. I yelled at my wife to take a look but she didn’t hear me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object(light) then started fading till it almost disappeared then became a red streak then disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky so it didn’t go behind or above a cloud. That was all I saw from that point on. The whole thing probably took a minute or two.<n>

Right at the center of the bridge was a hovering object making no noise.  As we approach it we realize its round with three points and its spinning.  It has 1 white light with red, blue and yellow lights.  As we pass it my husband looks right up at it and says it rotating.  As we got to the end of the bridge I turned around and saw it shoot off to the south about 1/2 mile so fast the lights left a blur.  Then it took off down the Hudson river so fast I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed at it and said &#34;wow that satalite is really moving&#34;.  We watched it move across the sky for about a minute and as we were all watching it did a total 180 degree course change with no turning or pause.  No aircraft or satallite could change direction at a speed like this.  It also when it changed course it did not decelerate and then accelerate in other direction, it simply was traveling fast and in a 1/10 of a second was moving back the other way at the same speed.  As this happened we all made some pretty weird noises as we were so shocked we did not no how to react.  There was no noise noted and no details to be seen of whatever it was because of its alt.  It was most likely out of our atmosphere but was giving off a very distinct red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also note that two of the people viewing are commercial pilots and are familiar with aircraft and lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I saw a round, shiny object that appeared to up very high in the sky, too high for a plane.  It was basically a pinpoint of white light, or perhaps reflective material.  I was curious and continued to watch it, and then noticed there was an identical object a short distance behind it.  They moved at a moderate pace in a straight line and did not waver, which confirmed they were not birds.  Then the second object started moving underneath the first one, but stayed the same distance apart and neither changed speed.  It continued rotating around the first object until it was in front.  Then they passed behind a building and from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible they were satellites, but I have never seen two satellites near each other like that, never during the day, and they also moved slower than other satellites I have seen  Recently someone in the bay area saw something similar: http://www.ktvu.com/news/16548130/detail.html.  But the ones I saw were moving much more slowly.  Their movement was not like anything alive or any other flying object I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/1/08 15:00|Denver International Airport|CO|Light|5 minutes|Objects of light seen below clouds|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65276.html|499|ndxe200808| Objects of light seen below clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying into Denver International Airport on August 1st, 2008, from El Paso.  Our plane initially approached from the south, then turned east to land on a different runway.  After the plane had turned east, I was watching the ground, looking at the cars and houses and farm fields around DIA.  There were clouds beneath us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the things on the ground when a white sphere of light coming from underneath a cloud caught my eye.  I dismissed it as the sun&#39;s reflection off of an airplane or a windshield, or possibly a light on top of a communications tower, this area being a loosely populated area with a high amount of air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then questioned my initial dismissal when from beneath the cloud I observed two more, and noticed how the ground was moving beneath them, in a formation with the first observed.  This was in the course of a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this group, traveling west, but our plane and the formation of lights were traveling in opposite directions and I could no longer see them for the clouds and the window well obstructing my view.  I shrugged my shoulders, and continued to watch the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a white light, moving in a squiggly path, traveling south.  I saw it only momentarily, before it was obscured by another cloud.  We landed and I saw nothing further afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight was a Frontier flight.  The aircraft was a Bombardier turboprop.  I was seated forward of the propellers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Cavalry Scout.  I was deployed to Iraq for all of 2007.  I have training in identifying vehicles on the ground and can identify a number of aircraft in the air as well.  I have been in the service for three years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see no fuselage on any of the aircraft, but it&#39;s possible that I was at too high of an elevation (I was above some spotty clouds, these were below) to be able to see anything beyond the shining lights.  It&#39;s also feasible that this could have been a formation of fighter jets, performing training maneuvers out of Buckley Air Force Base, though a bit near the International Airport.<n>

I was on the lawn of a mountain resort in north central Washington state, having a telephone conversation with my brother.  The area was being prepared for a corporate dinner by the hotel staff.  The jet passed 1000-2000 feet over the hotel at high speed in a northerly direction and began a near vertical climb.  The jet had vapor trails off its wing-tips and behind it. Just as it began its climb I saw a circular/oval shaped object above the jet at about a 75°.  At first I thought the oval object was just slightly larger than the jet but then realized at the speed it was going I couldn’t tell how far in front of the jet it was. It was climbing much faster than the jet and seemed to accelerate at an impossible rate until it disappeared in the blue sky. Both the jet and the object seemed to be the same light color in the bright sunlight. I did not see any markings on the Jet or the oval object. The jet climbed to 20,000 to 25,000 feet before leveling off in a westerly direction. I only heard the sound of one jet, I could not discern any noise whatsoever from the oval object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw the oval object I yelled at my wife who was close by in the swimming pool area. Her view was blocked by trees and she could not see the jet or the other object. There were three women close to me who had the same view as I did. I asked one of the women if she saw it too and she said she saw it but she did not know what she saw. I asked her if she saw any wings on the object and she said she did not.  A waiter appeared and I described what I had seen to him. He said that he had seen things like that before in this location and had assumed the jets were practicing with some kind of remote controlled aircraft. I told him that the object had no wings and travelled at an impossible speed for any known aircraft.  He seemed nonplussed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time this took place I was in cell phone contact with my brother so he heard the events unfold as they happened.  This is a photo of my location when I heard the jet approaching. these pictures were taken shortly after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can see the weather conditions were mostly sunny at the time. The temperature was in the low 80’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a lot of experience around military aircraft at air shows around the country,  I am very familiar with military aircraft sounds and maneuvers, I am used to working very close to operational military aircraft of all size and description.  I spoke with a friend of mine who was a fighter pilot and described my experience.  He said that if the military was training in that area it would be a restricted air space which he doubted it was. I checked online and saw that it was listed as MOA (Military Operations Area) temporarily through August 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this is the type of aircraft I saw and about the same color.  This photo has been flipped horizontally and rotated to a vertical aspect. My view was somewhat similar to this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness sends illustration of F-14 jet, which he indicates was most like the jet he says he witnessed.  We have encouraged the witness to have hotel employees submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

The porch is approx 4 feet off the ground and I was sitting in a lawn chair.  A ball with orangish/redish lights and some sort of protuting &#34;arm&#34; like thing aprox the size of a round coffee table passed between my house and my neighbors at eye level and within 3 feet of where I was sitting moving approx 10 miles an hour making no sound.  It crossed the street while gaining altitude at a diagonal direction, went over the roof of the house across the street and continued into to the sky until it was out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

8/1/08 02:00|Granda Hills|CA|Sphere|2-3 minutes|Bright, star like object blasts into space from the ground at a 45 degree angle no sound incredible speed 5 witnesses.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101402.html|502|ndxe200808| Bright, star like object blasts into space from the ground at a 45 degree angle no sound incredible speed 5 witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 friends and I were hanging out in front of Baja Fresh at about 2 in the morning when all of a sudden, from the horizon, an extremely bright, star like object (for lack of a better word) blasts off from the ground into space at about a 35-45 degree angle.  It launched with incredible speed and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It got to a point in the sky where it appeared stationary, and started to fade, as it got farther and farther into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my ignorance I&#39;ve always assumed it was some sort of military launch, which is why it&#39;s taken so long for me to come forward with this.  Only recently, after looking back into it, have I found that nothing can explain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am suffering from anxiety and stress from not having an explanation from this sighting, as it keeps repeating in my head over and over again, and I really need closure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It had a color changing sequence and was moving slowly in the forest near Dennison Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It picked up speed as I passed and kept up with me and my friend which was approximately 65 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my friend shouted to look to the right and on the righthand side a similar object was traveling beside us.  We stopped to take a picture on our cell phones and both objects that were in the pine forest to our left and right arced into the sky, trailed each other and made a Z zig-zag pattern off into the sky straight up until we could no longer see them at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am college educated with a Master of Science degree and not easily discredited, my friend is United States Coast Guard active duty.  We are not your run of the mill country bumpkins and have never experienced anything like this.....<n>
8/1/08 00:40|La Puente|CA|Oval|3-4 SECONDS|OVAL OBJECT WITH ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHTS FLY'S OVER LA PUENTE|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64939.html|504|ndxe200808| OVAL OBJECT WITH ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHTS FLY&#39;S OVER LA PUENTE<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS OUTSIDE HANGING UP A SHEET IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, AND FROM THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEEN AN OBJECT THAT WAS GLOWING AND AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A SHOOTING STAR OR A COMET. I LOOKED UP AT THE OBJECT AND I SEEN AN OVAL OBJECT WITH CIRCLE AND SQUARE SHAPED WINDOWS THAT WERE DIMLY GLOWING. THE GLOW WAS AN ELECTRIC BLUE. IT WAS FLYING AT A FAST SPEED, TO FAST FOR A PLANE. IT MADE NO SOUND WHAT SO EVER. AS IT MOVED, I LOST SIGHT OF IT BECAUSE MY HOUSE WAS BLOCKING MY VIEW SO I WENT TO THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE ALMOST INSTANTLY TO MAYBE SEE THE OBJECT AGAIN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER THERE. IT JUST DISSAPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/1/08 00:20|Beecher|IL|Flash|1 second|Flash of light, saucer, into another flash of light|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64909.html|505|ndxe200808| Flash of light, saucer, into another flash of light<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on a picnic table at approx. 12.20 AM at my work in Beecher, Il, scanning the horizon, and I saw what looked like a mortar blast about 500 Yards off of the prarieland behind the plant. It was white in the center with a bluish tint surrounding it. A concave, bright white object appeared out of it and headed from north to south at about a 20 degree decent. The object dissapeared into the aforementioned &#34;mortar blast&#34; about 6 inches (from my viewpoint of the horizon), the &#34;mortar blast&#34; appearing when the object came within about 1/16th of an inch from the &#34;mortar blast&#34;. It seemed to be some sort of &#34;warp&#34;, I&#39;ve seen plenty of meteor showers, and this was just too damn close to the horizon line to call it that, and definately too bright to be some sort of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. The angle of decent is also what made me question it.I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before. Please give me some information as to what this occurrance was, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working with a crew of 7; 4 outside, one other witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, I will report to your hotline when I get the time today.  Also, could this have any corrolation with the eclipse today?<n>
