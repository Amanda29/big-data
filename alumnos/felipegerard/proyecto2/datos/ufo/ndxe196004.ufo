Sometimes I would be lucky enough to see a satelite fly over. On this night, the exact date I cannot recall, I saw what I at first thought was a satelite streaking across the sky out of due north. It was brighter than the stars and traveling at what I thought would be the speed of a satelite. To my utter amazement, it came to an absolute stop. I was stunned and tried to imagine what it could be. I aligned it with the peak of the garage roof and stared at for a while, my mind whirling. After what seemed like a minute or less, it resumed its fast speed, due west. It had made a perfect right angle change in its direction after the stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
