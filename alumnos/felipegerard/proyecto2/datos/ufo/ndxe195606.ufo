6/30/56 16:00|New Brunswick|NJ|Disk|approx. 10 minutes|Four Saucers, over the City of New Brunswick, NJ, in the summer of 1956|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62518.html|2|ndxe195606| Four Saucers, over the City of New Brunswick, NJ, in the summer of 1956<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1956 and I lived in the city of New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I was eight years old.  It was a sunny day and sometime in late afternoon, or early evening, our phone rang.  It was a friend of my father’s and he told us to go up to the roof of our building because there were UFO’s flying around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I rushed upstairs to the roof of the building and facing downtown New Brunswick, we could see very clearly, about four flying saucers.  They were roughly about 500-700 ft. up and were clearly &#34;PLAYING!&#34;   (In aviation circles, it is what is called dogfighting). They were chasing each other and darting in hard right angles and various other tight angles that our planes were incapable of doing.  However, they stayed within an imaginary box, so to speak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father’s friend showed up within 5 minutes carrying a telescope.  He quickly set it up and we all had a turn viewing them through the scope.  I was amazed just to see them, in the first place, but seeing them through a telescope, really up close and personal, was truly something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ships were silver but not shiny like the bright side of aluminum foil, more like the reverse side, like a brushed metal texture but lighter in color.  The metal, in the bright sunlight, had a bluish tinge to it reflecting the sun’s light off of it.  They were what I would call the traditional cup and saucer shapes.  Two plates with the top one inverted over the bottom and an inverted cup on top of the two plates.  All four ships were of the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched one of them through the telescope (I could only watch one because the ships weren’t far away to begin with.  Looking at it through the telescope brought it so close that I really couldn’t capture an entire ship in my view, just a section of a ship), I noticed it was radiating colors.  Starting at the top inverted saucer of the ship, first a transparent red color, quite faint, would slowly move towards the bottom of the ship.  As the red reached the bottom, then the color green would start at the top and work its way down to the bottom, also transparent in texture, with the red color starting back up at the top again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as if on cue, they streaked out of sight. Within 2-3 seconds, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t say how long they were up there because I don’t know how long they were there before we got that phone call, but from memory, I would guess we were able to watch them for about 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, in the local New Brunswick newspaper (The Home News), there was a picture of those UFO’s right on the front page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My attention was drawn to a white object that was floating in the sky, and coming toward my playgroup. It eventually began descending, and being unafraid of it, I walked toward where I thought it might land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came down close to a backyard neighbor’s trash/burn spot as I approached it. As stated previously, it was white, very angular (like a fold-up paper airplane), and floated silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came down within 5-6 feet to the ground. I approached it to touch it, and it gently and silently rose and gradually floated out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was warm and the sky was clear with stars being visible.  We were sitting outside the base medical facility on a step.  We were facing west north west when we first sighted a light brighter than the other stars in the sky. We noticed that the light did not seem to be remaining &#34;in place&#34;.  The movement we detected was obvious in comparison with stars that were in the vicinity.  The phone rang at the duty desk, and we went inside.  The crews quarters were at the north end of the building by the medical store room.  Immediately outside was a loading dock. Before bedding down we were curious as to whether the &#34;light&#34; was still visible.  We stepped out on the dock, but could not immediately locate it; this is because in the course of not more than ten (10) minutes the light had changed position to almost due east and the movement we detected was more demonstrable. We called the radar shack and they did not have anything on their scopes.  We rousted the duty photographer out of bed.  The photo lab was in the control building just below the control room itself which was unmanned.  The photographer set up a camera on a tripod, in the open doorway of the lab which faced the area of sky we were interested in.  He took still photos and time lapse photos.  The time lapse photos demonstrated the light/object to maneuvering; changing position (up/down, right/left.  The duty officer in charge of the station was notified and he advised that we hold everything until morning (he had been sleeping).  The following morning the photos were given to the Operations Officer and he took them to the Radar Control Officer.  They went over the photos with the three of us present.  They did not know what to make of what they were seeing.  They contacted the Commanding Officer with all of the information they had and he advised that we all stay availble.  The CO&#39;s office phoned and told us that Naval Intelligence had been contacted, and someone was on the way to interview us.  In addition we were asked to report in writing what had transpired.  The intelligence officer arrived, interviewed everyone who had anything to do with the &#34;incident&#34;, took the photos and our written reports, and that was the last we heard of that.  I know we saw something and what we saw was documented.  I make no claims as to what we saw because we were told by the intelligence officer that the lest said, the better. Thank you.

Day time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a youngster across the street from my home and in the backyard.  (Mid Fifties)  One of the two brothers I was playing ball with called to us to look up and see this strange object.  It was basically a half-sphere.  Like a ball that was cut in half.  Red-Brown in color. There were three specific indications on the side of the craft that best resemebled port-holes on the side for observation.  I have drawn a number of sketches of the object over the years.  I glided across the sky but it seemed fairly close to our neighborhood coming from the north and moving south toward the direction of the City of Fresno.  There was no noise or exhaust. The sky was clear and with brillant sunlight. It was summer time.  I will never forget it.  One of my friends ran inside his house to get a small telescope he had.  We watched it moving and then ran out in the front yard until it went out of site.  I do not know if any of the two brothers are still living.  I have not ! seen them for many years.  We talked about it several in the past as we grew up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I was helping my father spreading topsoil for the front of a new house that he and I had built.I looked up toward the west and about over what seemed to be near the location of Royal Canadian Air Force Station Trenton I saw two bright light. I was use to seeing aircraft around all the time as it was a busy base and still is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up again at these two bright lights fully expecting them to have moved, bot they hadn&#39;t. But as I looked again a moment later they moved very quickly. First one and then the other. They moved very fast. They darted but not in unison. Then they moved again but this time up what seemed to be quite a ways and then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then darted again to my left. I thought that they might have been search lights but were far too bright and why hadn&#39;t I ever seen them before. (nor since). This went on for about 8 to 10 min. and then shot up and away at a very steep angle in little more than a blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 12 and have always been an aircraft enthusiest. Knew all my aircraft very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of years later while living in Stratford Ontario and in Air Cadets I went to my first summer camp. While there I asked if there were any search light on the base or had there ever been. The flying officer told me no. I had never forgotten what I had saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will have to send another report to relate to you another sighting which was even more spectacular that I and my wife saw while living in a rural community just north of Barrie Ontario.

We called the base authorities who contacted the air force project blue book, it was written off as a flight of seagulls in formation  flying down the runway and the runway lights reflecting off them.

I can not remember the Zip Code. The house was on 62nd Drive near Woodhaven Boulevard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking with my brother, towards my home on Woodhaven Boulevard. My Brother was on leave from the military. He was based in Fort Eustis, Virginia. Helicopter unit. He was familiar with flying and various types of Air Craft capabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brothers memory concerning the event is waining. For me it was an event I can NOT forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a source of light in the evening sky, I was unable to see any details as the light was moving in a circular motion at a tremendous speed. After the first circular motion I brought the object to the attention of my brother. He looked at the object and stated &#34;it was obviously NOT an air plane, as a plane can not make such a tight circular manuver at such a tremendous speed. After the third tight circle the light excellerated out of its flight pattern &amp; moved towards the direction of Long Island. The light sourse moved so quickly it disappeared within seconds. My Brother &amp; I couldnt believe what we had just seen, we never saw anything move as fast as this light source object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Brother called the local Airports and asked if their people had seen anything unusual in the sky. They said NO. The Military saw nothing. Nobody would admit there was anything unusual in the night sky. I have NOT seen anything unusual in the sky since 06/15/56. I dont usually look into the evening sky, I just dont believe man is alone in this vast universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dad enthusiastically said; &amp;quot;Come on, let&#39;s go outside. Let&#39;s see what it is. Not me, I was hungry &amp; kept eating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dad rushed back in the to get me, saying; &amp;quot;come on, come on, come on, you don&#39;t want to miss this!&amp;quot;  Reluctantly, I got up (&amp; for some unknown reason) turned directly around to note the exact time ... 8:32 PM on a school house clock. (Dad continued to coax me outside.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got outside dad was pointing to this dark spot in the night sky, it was terribly overcast with just a few stars here &amp; there. Dad had put the yard light on (making it difficult to see) I couldn&#39;t make out a shape, just a darker spot in the sky.  He pointed saying; &amp;quot;Look at the funny lights! See-em? See-em, right there.&amp;quot; I was looking but I didn&#39;t see any funny lights, just a very dark spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to walk further away from the yard light. Mom &amp; dad walked a few steps away too. I was about 25&#39; to 30&#39; further down the yard than them when I decided I was going to concentrate (with all my might) to make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Boom, that was it, the next thing I knew, I was waking up. Mom &amp; dad were asleep standing the yard with their mouths open, &amp; that&#39;s when I realized my legs were aching like I ran a marathon. I looked in the direction they were looking but it wasn&#39;t were, it seemed to be further away, slightly higher, and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (All three of us were in slightly different positions than we were.)   I cleared my throat out loud and sheepishly said; &amp;quot;Ah, dad ... dad?&amp;quot; he woke up as my mom did a second later, they both put their heads down &amp; walked directly in the house. I said; &amp;quot;There it is right there! Look!&amp;quot; they paid no attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I knew, that thing was much lower, easier to see, I walked under a tree, &amp; closer to get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More than anything, I was extremely angry, I could now see the UFO with 5 of them staring at me. (About 150&#39; away, it was no more that 25&#39; off the ground at this point.) (They had rounder bald heads than the grays, the best I can tell, there was like a hazy fog around their ship.)  I remember thinking ... you lousy bastards, you mess with us, then sit there watching what we do? Thinking about that P.O.ed me even more!  I found a rock and threw it at them, I looked for another but only found a dirt clod so I threw that feeling I showed them how I felt about them. (Although they didn&#39;t physically react, I did get a minor feeling they were somewhat surprised I did that.) I turned then stomped in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard dad walking up the stairs, while mom keep repeating; &amp;quot;Would you look at the time? What happened to the time? Where&#39;d the time go?&amp;quot; (About 3 times over.) Don&#39;t know if I would have noticed if she hadn&#39;t pointed it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shocked, it was now 9:40 (an hour &amp; eight minutes later in time). Mom suddenly declared; &amp;quot;I&#39;m going to bed right now!&amp;quot; With me still staring at the clock, &amp; with a burst of determination she quickly went around behind me and shot upstairs. (???)  My mom, as long as I knew her Never Ever went to bed before 12. I was dumbfounded knowing that ... I had lots of questions, I tried processing the events but could not figure out how this happened, it made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (With no answers, I remember thinking, I&#39;ll have to figure it out later, and went to bed.)  The next morning food &amp; dishes were still on the kitchen table, mom was having a fit, shoving a dish right in my face saying; &amp;quot;Nobody finished supper, we left the food on the table all night, I cooked supper for nothing ... &amp;quot; &amp; etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to school that day, waiting until supper (to kind of re-create the moment) when I questioned them both. They completely ignored me at first, I mean I had one heck of a time getting their attention. I asked dad again &amp; again; &amp;quot;Dad, remember you said you heard those funny sounds last night?&amp;quot; after 3 times he finally turned with the most blurry, blood shot, dead eyes, and said; &amp;quot;Uh-huh.&amp;quot; I said; &amp;quot;Dad, dad remember you saw those funny lights?&amp;quot; I repeated it over &amp; over until he turned to me again &amp; said; &amp;quot;Uh-huh.&amp;quot;  That&#39;s it?  I turned to my mom saying; Remember when you said; &amp;quot;Look at the time? What happened to the time? Where&#39;d the time go?&amp;quot; I repeated it several times until she finally turned to me with bleary, welled up, blood shot eyes, and said; &amp;quot;Uh-huh.&amp;quot;  Nothing! Ahhhhh!!!  Mom &amp; dad started talking about something else, and me, I put my head down realizing they didn&#39;t remember anything, they were no help at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, here&#39;s my father one of the most brilliant &amp; talented people I know he was a pilot, an inventor, RCA copied the long range TV antenna after his model, he was smarter than any of my teachers. He had an amazing memory, quoted Shakespeare, could add a full shopping cart of groceries before the checker could finish punching in the prices, he had ESP &amp; could read minds, telling me (word for word) what someone was going to say before they said a thing, he told me my future (things that were 40 years out) &amp; yet, he didn&#39;t have chance against them, he can&#39;t remember anything, they&#39;re more powerful than he is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt very alone &amp; with no one to protect me from those rotten bastards.  I felt hopeless thinking ... what chance do I have?  In third grade, I was home (by myself) when I saw a UFO account on broadcast TV (it involved story after story about crashed military aircraft, including a passenger airliner that had supposedly been downed by UFO craft in the &amp;quot;1950&#39;s&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I was amazed) it showed UFO&#39;s darting a crossed a clear blue sky, &amp; told how the military had made a decision to not attempt to shoot at them because of too many lost lives &amp; equipment losses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching that film I was excited &amp; asked just about everybody. I told my parents, believing I&#39;d soon have answers &amp; find the real truth ... sorry to say, that was it, no one I knew saw it, &amp; nothing ever became of it. (I&#39;ve looked on line to find that same broadcast ... but nothing except for a tiny segment you can see on a Disney broadcast.) &amp;quot;Disney UFO Documentary: &#39;Alien Encounters&#39;&amp;quot;  In sixth grade my class had the most wonderful teacher, Mrs. Mixner (we all loved her) one day she asked if anyone had seen a UFO. Feeling brave I raised my hand &amp; told her &amp; the class the whole story, it was the first time I opened up about what happened. Classmate, Mary Anne Catalano volunteered that she &amp; her parents had seen a strange light in the sky (I was hoping for more) Mrs. Mixner asked her several questions, but she didn&#39;t remember anything else, that was it? (Ahhh ... !!!)  As teen, and as an adult, I would sometimes bring the subject up to dad ... he would just freeze up. I do remember a few times when he&#39;d say; &amp;quot;You know there are UFO&#39;s and E.T.s out there, anybody who believes we&#39;re the only species in this universe is stupid!&amp;quot; I would always say, yes dad, I KNOW we&#39;re not the only ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the years I read whatever I could find on the subject, told my friends, coworkers, two wives, &amp; my kids, but I never had anyone tell me of any experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It always ends the same way, no one ever makes a comment after I tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the last times I talked to my dad (he called from Florida) he was especially up beat &amp; cheerful telling me all the stuff he was doing, fishing, the green house he made, &amp; so I decided to slip in our UFO incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh man ... I&#39;ve felt horrible for doing that ever since. I waited. He didn&#39;t say Uh-huh that day ... it was just this very long pause (dad was always worried about the phone bill &amp; with him not saying anything it was highly unusual) finally I asked if he was still there, he said; &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; I only talked to him one more time after that, I killed his spirit of joy, and that call ended abruptly. Dad died in &amp;quot;1991&amp;quot;  I decided to move to Florida staying with my mom for a little while.  I told her the whole UFO story, carefully detailing every part, what everybody said, &amp; what my thoughts were, just hoping she&#39;d remember or say something helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom didn&#39;t say a word during the story, she just listened. (I seriously doubted she would even respond after all those years of nothing.) Big surprise (as soon as I finished) mom immediately shocked me by going into a story about the time she was pregnant when I was little. She said; &amp;quot;You probably don&#39;t remember this ... &amp;quot;  I said; &amp;quot;Oh yes do (I recounted) I remember the day dad asked if I wanted a little brother or a sister. I was standing by the grape arbor eating grapes when he came out and asked me, he had this bounce in his step, filled with joy, and as happy as I&#39;d ever see him.&amp;quot; Then Mom said; &amp;quot;You know, your dad could never figure it out what happened ... it just went away.&amp;quot;  Ohhhhh ... noooo, alarm bells went off with my knowing about that hybrid program the E.T. were doing, ahhhhh!  Could I have a 1/2 alien brother or sister out there ... ??? ... oh no!  Okay, occasionally a fetus can be absorbed back into the mother&#39;s body, but under the circumstances, considering the time line being so close to that same time (I have NO proof) but I do have some serious concerns as to what could have happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom died in 2005 and I must say I&#39;m grateful for having had the opportunity to relate that story to her, and more than a little spooked to learn what she had to say in return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still searching for answers …<n>

The air was filled with airline pilots asking what had happened.  I was looking directly overhead at were the flash had occured.  I saw a pin point of light going into a cloud as if a flash point had occured and was pulled into the main body of the occurence.  It was like a pin sticking out of a hotdog.  The main body was at first white light that turned to green, to blue, to yellow, to orange, to red, to deep blood red and then to black.  The main body of the explosion roiled in such a manner to open and reveal the interior that was burning blood red.  It would close and open in a different place until it finally disapeared.  The end opposite the entry had a like needle of light which looked to me as the remainder of what was left of the object that had exploded had exited the main body.  This event was reported in the Tulsa World and Tribune.  The article stated that the flash had been observed in Dallas and Kanas City.  The event looked to be in outer space among the stars.  It seemed to me that this event was caused by some object that was filled with an explosive fuel that had ignited and blown the object up forming the lead in spike that expanded into a sausage shaped main body and then trailed the exit spike.  This happened in 1956 or 1957.  I have never reported this event and didn&#39;t interrupt the airline pilots chatter with the Tulsa tower.  I was new to flying and an airline pilot was not to be interrupted by a lowly private pilot.  This event should be checkable through the local papers or the tower records at the Tulsa Internationa Airport, if they keep records that long.  My instructor later denied that he had seen anything which didn&#39;t surprise me since he worn corrective glasses that ! were Cok e bottle bottoms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

The result were not promising.  The event appears to have been no more than 10 to 20 miles above Tulsa.  This would put it well within the capabilities of the armed forces even at that time, 1956-7.  It was probably some military craft blowing up although it doesn&#39;t preclude something from further out.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter:  All I can remember is it was sometime in 56-7.  I&#39;ve lost my log books long ago and have a miserable time with dates.  The papers were full of the report and as I said, the tower at Tulsa International (it was Tulsa Municipal back then I believe)  I tried once some years ago to find it at the Tulsa Trib or World and was unsuccessful.  I wonder if the weather bureau would have something on such an event?  Or some astronomical group might have it.  That&#39;s about all I can come up with.  I&#39;ll try to find more if I can.  The event was way up there in the sky.  The height could be figured by running a line from the center of the earth to Dallas, one to Tulsa and one to KC, then extending the Tulsa radius into space and making a tangent on the Dallas and KC radii.  Where the two tangents intersected with the Tulsa radius would be the height of the event.  Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n>

I had returned by bus to our family farm from Knoxville, TN.  The bus let me off on Kingston Pike. I had to walk along a paved road and then along our quarter-mile driveway.  The time was early evening and the area was pasture such that the view of the sky was clear.  After walking a moment, I noticed that a cigar shaped object was floating in the sky.  It was fairly far away but appeared to be huge! I was walking east and the object was to my south over what I estimate was Fort Loudon Lake.  At first I thought it must be a blimp...there were no glowing lights or windows: just a cigar shape with a prominent tailfin outlined by a red glow.  The red light falling on the &#39;tailfin&#39; appeared to come from above and to the front of the craft--- also a red light was glowing on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it with growing interest as I walked towards my house as the craft very slowly drifted foreward and downward.  When I reached the house I rushed in to get my step-uncle and a camera.  When we went back outside the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we called McGee Tyson airport and they said there had been no blimps in the area for over three years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This is his experience along with my grandparents whom are now deceased.  This event took place in Vista California somewhere around 1955-1958 when my father was around 10 or 11 he said.  They were listening to an Oceanside Ca, radio station called KUDE AM, when it reported a huge cigar shaped craft motionless above Oceanside.  When my father and grandparents got outside, they said the craft was gigantic.  my father estimates the craft to be at least 3 miles long and 1/2 mile wide.  It was bright orange almost neon, and appeared to have some sort of structure to the bottom.  several spaces along the bottom were black and square like in appearance.  the radio was reporting that some fishing boats and commercial shipping were reporting the craft to be approx. 1 mile off the Oceanside pier.  after 10 minutes of observing  the craft, 10-15 small craft which were described as looking like bright stars, emerged from the bottom and began flying all around the cigar shaped craft.  This went on for about 6 or 7 minutes, then the smaller craft docked with the cigar shaped craft one at a time.  Then after a few more minutes, the cigar shaped craft began to slowly gain altitude and then as if a light had been switched off, it was gone.  Not one word of this was printed in the papers, or discussed on the radio the next day  My grandfather worked on B-24&#39;s and B-25&#39;s during WWII, and was later a manager at a local drug store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother installed and repaired radio equipment on B-17&#39;s during WWII, and worked at the same drug store as gramps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father was with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, and is now an ((deleted--medical)) technician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have over the years been intrigued by this sighting and have been largely unsuccessful in finding out any info.  I hope by reporting this, someone will come forward.  After all, a craft of that size and duration of sighting should have gotten someone&#39;s attention<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At that time, it was a &#34;back road.&#34;  As we were about half a mile west of El Camino Real, a brilliant ball of silvery-white light, about 3 to 6 feet in diameter, came whizzing in from about North-Northwest and landed then bounced a couple of times on the ground approximately 100 feet to our south - in what, at that time, was an empty field bordered by a barbed-wire fence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being amazed and wondering, I stopped the car and attempted to get through the barbed wire - to see what the thing was.

One such morning I looked to the north and saw a light sweeping across the sky with a very slight undulating path. I pointed it out and we all speculated what it might be. (this was a bunch of pretty smart guys due to our mission) We discounted inversion reflections, F-86D with afterburners (no satellites yet!) meteors. While speculating, here comes another one! Well for three nights in a row, we saw 4 to ten in one night. Although they were comeing from different parts of the norther horizon, they seemed to vanish pretty nearly the same place on the southern. (as determined by a fiducial point, an antenna)The path, when check on a map, was straight across the libyan desert crossing the Tbilsi Mountains.I did talk to an airman at the A C &amp; W squadron (radar) after hearing the F-86D&#39;s scramble obviously in response to these odd lights. He said, &#34;Oh, Yeah. We see these all the time&#34; and quoted a speed I can&#39;t remember but was very fast.(it was odd to scramble jets at that time of the morning unless it was for an earnest cause- the officers do like their sleep!)<n>

I was paralyzed and could not move or talk, yet I was able to communicate with these two beings telepathically. They told me I would have to go with them. I asked if I could tell my mother as I slept in the bed next to hers, and they told me no. It looked like to me, (at that time) that they had huge black sideways teardrop shoulders. I was only five at the time and my perspective was from a prone position in bed. When many years later I saw drawings of other people&#39;s descriptions of Aliens, I recognized what I saw. Anyway they said I must go with them. Everything else is a blank. When I was next conscious of being back in bed I told my mother what had happend, she told me it was only a dream. It was as real an experience as writing this letter. It was vivid, and clear. Believe me I would not tell of this experience if it were not real. For years after that, whenever any science fiction shows came on TV that had Aliens in it, I would break down and cry uncontrollably. My parents and their friends thought I was emotionally sensitive, or a big baby. (Take your pick.) I have suffered depression, and alcoholism since, and have always felt different. I recently went to a psychologist who TRIED to hypnotize me to remember, but I was either unresponsive to the hypnotism, or the part of the episode that I can&#39;t recall is buried too deep. If anyone knows a therapist who specializes in these events, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate it, but date of the event may be approximate.

See full description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home from a movie one evening. I had just passed the Rubber Bowl on George Washington Blvd, in south east Akron, when the sky behind me lit-up. I thought someone had turned on the lights in the stadium, so I turned around to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the night sky(from the north) came a bright object. It was in a shallow dive. At that moment it seemed to have slightly elongated &#34;wing tips&#34; and a very bright - whitish glow. It was silent, but I could definitely feel its presents in the sky above me. It slowed as it passed almost directly over head.(Perhaps 2,000 feet above me.) Then it picked up speed and climbed away at about a 45 degree - upward angle, going south. It was gone in less than half a minute and the sky became black again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estimated entry speed was + 600 mph. Over head speed was about 100 mph. And estimated exit speed accelerated from 100 mph to well over 1,000 mph before it was out of sight. Overall estimated distance that the object appeared visible was: Approach equals 3 miles. Over head about 1 mile. Departure probably 20 miles, before going totally out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen meteors, artillery shells, tracer bullets, and all kinds of aircraft flying at night: And there has been nothing that I&#39;ve ever seen that behaved like this object. Once over head, I could see that it was slightly curved all across the leading edge (from tip - to tip), and had two smaller curves meeting in the center, at the trailing edge. It had no distinguishable fuselage in the center. A guess at the size would be 100 feet tip to tip and 30 feet leading edge to trailing edge. It could have been 8 feet thick in the center area, but I only got a glimpse at that, as it was coming toward me and going away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a lot of very bright light nearest the object. The light was longer and brighter span-wise. It was smooth, with no exterior features, lights or markings. I was not close enough to determine if it was made out of metal, ceramic or other substance, but its surface did have a bright white glow about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I can tell you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I lived in Upper Glade, West Virginia until I was 11 years old and I believe the year was 1956 or 7.  I was born in 1951.  It was summer time but unsure of the exact date.  My younger brother and I were standing in the road near our home (rural area).  Jets would sometimes fly over our home and break the sound barrier early in the mornings and I had the habit of watching for jets during the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this occasion I heard a slight whirring noise in the distance. I saw a very small silver object. I knew that jets usually left a jet trail and the jets would usually fly ahead of the jet noise. The object was moving horizontally and then turned toward me. I watched as it got closer and closer and it finally parked itself in the air slightly above and in front of me. It was maybe one hundred feet above me/ It wasn&#39;t directly above me because I could see the top as well. It was a circular disk with a smaller dome on it with square windows around the dome. It was a metallic silver in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if anyone was in the windows because they were dark. The disk was maybe fifty feet across or a little bigger and about twenty five feet high. It sat there suspended in midair and not making a sound. After a short time it moved on slowly following the same path that the jets flew, over our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that my brother John was with me but for years I told very few people about this experience and didn&#39;t mention it to him later as adults but eventually told my sister. She said that my brother Kevin had told her the same story. I was mistaken about who was with me that day but it verified my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had another experience later on in life in Boblingen, Germany in around 1978 or nine. I will fill out a separate form for that.<n>

And convinved me to come back to houes and take nap.  My grandmom does not believe in ufos.  She told my cosins not to talk about this to a living soul.  That was her exact words.

They travelled the same route for 18 months every weekend and there were never any street or traffic lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, at approx 1am, they were driving down the dark barren road and noticed a row of saucer shaped lights hovering over the tree line just off the road.  The row of lights stretched down the road as far as they could see.  They drove further and then saw a huge and very wide beam of light coming straight out of the trees.  On the other side of the beam there was another row of saucer shaped lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they stopped at the beam of light and got out of their car, there was compete silence.  The 2 rows of lights on either side of the beam touched the beam in tandem and then rose straight up and disappeared.  Then the next 2 lights did the same thing and then again and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They witnessed this for about 20 minutes and then left to report it to the base commander who told them they saw Northern Lights.  They stand by what they saw and it was not Northern Lights..<n>
