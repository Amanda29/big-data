I then saw a red light at the points of what became a triangular shaped aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the &#34;craft&#34; slowly glided overhead, I realized that it was about 300-400 feet long, triangular in shape, seemed not to reflect light, rather absorb it, and the shape was defined by the dense blackness that was darker than the night sky above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car to ask someone else in another car what they thought. There were no other cars at the 12-way intersection. (It is a very busy intersection, usually.) The craft glided silently overhead, disappearing behind a ridge of trees (also about 60 feet tall,) near some radio towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

My father, my hockey coach and a fellow player were driving home from a tourny in Deseronto, Ontario at about 10:00pm.  We were driving west on the 401 when we noticed a VERY bright light off in the distance.  We made a game out of it, trying to guess what it was.  It was very bright and white.  We guessed a radio tower at first, then, as we neared decided it was far too bright.  Next we guessed a plane - again, it was too bright and we could not see any strobes.  For about 8 minutes we tried to guess as we drove closer and closer to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, after nearly 10 minutes, we closed in on the object and it flew past us.  It was triangular and had four lights - all of them white.  There was a white non-strobing light on each top with a large circular light in the very center that was very, very bright.  This must have been the light we were trying to identify only moments earlier.  The object made no sound as it passed by at an estimated 500ft or so from the ground.  It was moving east, past us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I, being younger childern, became quite upset and my father pulled the car over after voicing a &#34;what the hell was that?&#34;.   My young friend and I watched as the aircraft flew past and crossed over the highway.  We thought it was coming back around so we both screamed for my father to get back on the road, nearly in tears.  We were quite frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now a certified private pilot so I am familar with aircraft lighting and identification.  Based on my experience with this subject I can say that what we witnessed that night was not an aircraft.  I don&#39;t know what it was.<n>

With a bout 5 of my best friends. I my younger brother was there with his younger friends. We used to go &#34;sledding&#34;down snowy hills in the winter at the top of our Street in Sydney, Nova Scotia. It was dark and cold and everyone was having fun. I remember being at the top of the hill, with a friend getting ready to slide down. We did, when we got to the bottom, we stood up and just as we were turning around. I noticed a really, really fast light streak towards us from over the trees. You see, I lived in a part of a city that is just on the border of county area. So, behind this hill was a vast forest. Anyway, just as fast as I saw the light, it was over all of us. I cast a extreemly powerfull WHITE light on all of us. I remeber looking around as this was happening and noticing that the light had boundries. It seemed circular and to be just around all us kids. I then remeber everything get REALLY REALLY quiet and then I remeber looking at my friend who was with me. He fell to the ground, perhaps in shock, I don&#39;t know. Then, I started to look up, it felt like slow motion cause I was really nervous. Just I started to look up, he streaked away, very fast. Immediatly, all the kids started screaming and crying and everyone ran down the street to their homes. We were terrified. We told our parrents and they called the police, but nothing ever came about it. Its a pretty tramatic story for a number of those that were there, and some won;t talk about what that saw. I don;t mind. Pretty amazing, it changed my veiw on things. 15 witnesses is alot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is only one of the many witness I and others had in Sydney on different occations. Very odd things happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My father was a Cub Scout den leader and my father, a friend, and me were travelling in the same car in route to a Cub Scout function.  There was another car following us with another Cub Scout and his step father.  We were travelling through the country towards Melvin, Il about eight miles away.  It was dark at this time and a winter snow storm had just hit.  As we were driving we noticed two bright lights at our two o&#39;clock position (NE).  I remember my father commenting, &#34;It must be two helicopters looking for stranded cars.&#34;  At the time my friend and I became excited about two helicopters flying low over the empty fields.  As we watched them we noticed they were on a direct path for us.  Being the young child I was at the time, I rolled down the window to hear the whoomp, whoomp, whoomp, of the approaching helicopters.  Only there was one problem, there was nothing, except the cold winter wind blowing across the empty fields.  As the lights came closer we noticed that the two lights came from the same craft.  Each light was positioned at the end of the craft.  The craft was the normal saucer shape, composed of three layers.  The middle being the longest, the bottom being the second longest, and the top being the shortest.  Keep in mind though that the top was metallic and extremley long (not a glass bubble).  The craft at this time was about 800-600 ft high and about 40 yards in front of us moving at about 20-30 mph.  My father stopped the car as well as the car behind us.  We rolled down the rest of the windows and watched as it floated over our heads.  It was so low that I am still able to remember the sight of portholes or tiny lights on the side of the craft.  Thinking back I am reminded of portholes, but not entirely certain.  The craft slowed as it floated over our car and came to rest in a field about 200 yards from us.  It maintained its altitude (600 ft or so) and just hovered silently.  I do remember looking up as it floated over the top of! us and seeing the bottom layer was donut like, hollow in the center.  The bottom part had a glowing effect to it, anti-gravity???  Anyways by this time my father was standing outside the car looking at this object along with my friends step-father.  By this time both me and my friend were in tears (same car) begging my Dad to leave.  Finally my father got into the car and took off.  The next thing I remember is being about a mile away and looking back at this object.  It had now tilted up at a perfect 45 degree angle and before I could get my father&#39;s attention it dissapeared.  Both my friend and I (occupied the same car) realize what we saw that night, and do not deny it.  My other friend has moved away now and I haven&#39;t talked to him in several years.  But with hard work I could find him to verify my story.  His step-father has passed away now.  My father still to this day thinks of that moment as one of the greatest in his life.  I believe if it wasn&#39;t for us children, he would have walked out to it.  I know it may seem hard for someone to remember these incidents, what with so much time that has passed.  I still to this day remember those events like yesterday.  It was truely one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen.  I am now a college senior preparing to graduate from a Christian University in Chicago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate.

As I got closer it still hadn&#39;t moved I was going around 40 miles a hr so this took at least a min.  When I ended up in front of it I could see clearly that it was a black triangle about 100 yrds off the road and just above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped for just a second and saw that it was about 40ft across the back and maybe 30 ft from front to back but maybe only 8ft tall if that.you could see the outline of lights in the corners but they were not on and there was no sound at all.  I went on pass it 1/10th of a mile and stopped on a bridge and got out to look back and it wasnt no where in sight.  Since then Ive seen 1 more on Jan 29 of this year.  A bright light coming down the same ridge at midnight.  Set my cellphone on camera looked up and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/90 01:00|Platteville|WI|Disk|10-15 minutes|Close encounter on the highway with a hovering craft / bright lights (white, red and orange).|3/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27549.html|6|ndxe199001| Close encounter on the highway with a hovering craft/bright lights (white, red and orange).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In January 1990 I was a student at the University of Wisconsin in Platteville. I held a night job in Dubuque Iowa, which is about a 30-minute drive from Platteville through mostly rolling hills and farmland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night at about 1am, during my drive to Platteville from Dubuque, I noticed some lights in the distance going back and forth over an open field. I wondered why a farmer would have his equipment out at that hour, especially in January when there is so much snow on the ground. I was puzzled but I didn’t put much thought into it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove down the hills, I would lose sight of the lights but as I came back up I could see them again. There were three colors: white, red and dark yellow/orange. The lights continued to pass back and forth along the countryside. I drove down another hill and lost sight of whatever it was. I was almost back to the school campus, right on the main highway going into the small town of Platteville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the lights were right in the middle of the road, right in front of me!  Not more than 40 feet!  It was hovering over the road and the lights were rotating. I was absolutely terrified! Plus, it was difficult to see. I had to make a choice, either keep driving straight, which would take me directly under it, or make a fast turn onto a winding back road. In a split second, I decided to turn off onto the back road. I was consumed with fear. I just wanted to get away from the lights. I barely used my brakes as I made that turn. I’m not sure how I didn’t lose control of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking in my rear view mirror to see if the lights were still there. Nothing. I calmed myself down a little and tried to rationalize that whatever I saw was sure to still be on the highway. It must have been a semi or emergency vehicles or something! My heart was still racing, but at the end of the road, instead of making a left to go back to the campus, I decided to make a right turn back around to the highway. There was nothing. No lights, no semi, no emergency vehicles, no farm equipment. Nothing! Surely, if the lights I saw could be attributed to any of these things, I would have still been able to see it from the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never know exactly what I saw that night. All I know for sure is that I have never felt terror like I did when I had my close encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is January 1990 is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father was the first out the door, and as he walked out he sudenly stoped. I was right behind him and I saw an object in the sky that I could compare in size to what a full moon looks like. The circular object was hubering above us moving slowly. The circular object was emiting a bright white glow that iluminated the floor. The light would turn off and then turn back on in a different spot. It did this twice before it left at a very high speed and left a trail which I belive was just the bright light it was emiting. When the object was right above us it felt like vibrations similar to what u feel when u stand in front of a woofer with base, the only diference was that this light had no sound. When I arrived to church, other people from close by towns saw a similar object. To this day I am still not sure of what it was. When I tell this to my friends most of them laugh or think I made it up, but it was one of those things that I just couldn&#39;t explain!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was January 1990 and snow had fallen the night before. The sky was completely cloud free and there was a full moon. I was heading home around 3:30 am traveling along a road that ran next to a river, and the moon light reflected off of the snow almost making it seem like day time. I suddenly felt as though I was being watched, the hairs on  my whole body stood up. I looked into my rear view mirror, only to see myself sitting in the back seat., and for an instance, almost a blink of an eye, I saw myself driving while I was sitting in the back seat. At this point I was starting to feel very confused and everything seemed surreal. I peered out of my window up at the full moon, which was in the ten o’clock position, and that’s when the really bizarre happened. The only way I can describe it was like the movie Predator, I didn’t see lights in the sky, but just the opposite. It was the absence of light, like a blackhole. Some iris shaped crafted passed between me and the moon, obscuring it from sight, similarly to an eclipse. It was like the moon was gone, and then the craft passed and the moon started to appear. I was only a few minutes from my home when this took place, and when I arrived my dog, a German Shepard named Trooper, was agitated and barking furiously. Normally at this time he is sleeping and can’t be bothered to get up. When I opened the door  Trooper ran out the door and across the road and into the woods.  I was still out of sorts from the previous few minutes, but I decided I needed to bring him in for the night. Trooper barked and chased after something  into the woods.  I called to him from the road for about a minute only to hear him attacking something, and then he let out a yelp. All went silent. I had no idea what just happened.  Seconds later Trooper ran by me and straight to the house and cried for me to let him in. Looking back into the woods I started to get that fee! ling aga in that someone or  something was watching me. Once inside Trooper ran and hid behind the couch. I pulled him out and checked him for any signs of a fight. I couldn’t find any cuts or scratches on him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I thought about what I could have witnessed. Trying to come up with some kind of explanation for what took place. The only conclusion I can make comes straight out  of sci-fi. Remember this is my hypothesis of the night, not anything based  in science fact. Perhaps some sort of temporal wake was generated by this unknown craft. And this temporal wake gave me the perception that I saw myself in the backseat, and the perception of me in the backseat seeing me drive. I can’t explain this, however I would have thought that someone else would have had a similar experience by now, and maybe even a theory would have been generated. I can’t be alone in this type of UFO phenomenon.  As for what happened to my dog Trooper. This only deepens the mystery, for which I can’t say the two events are connected.  However I’m curious if there has ever been any other such encounters reported or maybe you can offer another theory as to my experience.  I seek honest answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up to see a large disk shaped object hovering over me, around 60 to 70 foot in the air, it was around 50 foot in diameter, it was silent except for a very low sounding hum, a little like a power station hum. The craft was circular with a ball in the centre, that seemed to be glowing orange like the cherry of a cigarette, the circular space outside of the glowing ball was like a black metal, kind of a dark purple silver. There was also a smell that reminded me of electronics class at school, it was of a sulphur type of smell, like when you are using a soldering iron.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure exactly the amount of time I stood there for until I turned to see a man had come out of his home, maybe about 20 seconds since first seeing it, he was standing on his doorstep looking much the same as I was, staring up at the craft in amazement, although the craft was directly over my head, I did not feel scared at the time, I was to confused as to what I was looking at to feel anything. After what must have been about 30 more seconds to a minute, it slowly and silently ascended upwards around another 100 or so foot, then moved forwards towards the north of me for about 50 yards, hovered for a few seconds, and then shot of to my right, which was the direction of RAF Odiham around 8 miles away, the craft moved so fast that it looked like it just vanished in thin air, but you could just make out that it moved off in a certain direction, the only sound it made was a slight whooshing sound, as if it had disturbed the air as it sped through the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the man on his doorstep, and he was looking at me in a confused manner, I then started to feel a little worried in case it came back, and continued on my journey home, I got home in a very excited state at what I had seen, my parents I think thought I had gone loopy, I calmed down somewhat and went to bed as I had school the following day, that night I started to feel very unnerved, as I was starting to think could it ever come back?.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day I got up tired, because of lack of sleep, and went to catch my school bus, which was only a few yards from where I saw the craft, while waiting I went and knocked on the mans door who had also seen it, because I was desperate to find out what he had thought it was, his wife (I think) answered the door, I asked if her husband was in and she asked why, and I said because I wanted to know what he thought about that strange thing last night, and she became agitated and told me not to speak such silly nonsense, then as she was closing the door I saw the man with shaving foam all over his face, but the women closed the door, so I never got to find out what he thought about the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often wonder if anyone else had seen it from there window, maybe not though, as it was very silent (If anyone did please Email me, I would love to hear from you, it happened by the Hook bypass greenhaze@hamptonroads.com).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was, maybe a secret military craft, or maybe an alien craft, but I really don’t believe that with our modern technology, that we could build something so perfect as what I saw that night. I did not imagine it either, as the man definitely saw it too, and the day after the women at the house acted as if her husband (or boy friend) had told her about it based on her reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Our route took us directly over Biloxi, Mississippi and then over the Gulf of Mexico.  This took us over the Gulf just south of New Orleans.  As we passed by Biloxi I picked up a very strong radar return about 100 miles in front of our plane directly in our path.  It appeared to be a very small but powerful thunderstorm so I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it.  As we approached the radar return New Orleans Air Traffic Control Center called to ask we could see &#34;something&#34; directly in front of us.  I replied we had a small but strong thunderstorm and asked to deviate to the left of the return, still assuming it was a compact but powerful storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made our turn to pass just to the left of the return.  As we got within a half-mile of the radar return it completely disappeared.  It was there during one sweep of the radar and gone the next.  The lights from New Orleans were very bright and I could see clearly towards the city.  There weren&#39;t any clouds at all, much less a thunderstorm as we flew by the spot where the return had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I was distracted at that time and didn&#39;t give any more thought to what had happened, although it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a few years later that I suddenly thought about what had happened and that it may have some significance.  I would like to have contacted New Orelans ATC to see if the controller that was on duty that night was still available but too much time had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my 2nd and final report of &#34;sightings&#34; during 45 years and 20,000+ hours flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one where there were many small ufo&#39;s that formed a &#39;v&#39; shape.  Remember?  Some people thought it was flares.  Then they each slowly disappeared behind the mountain they said. 1 of the people is in my friends band.  They had a party Saturday night, and I was talking to this guy who was friends with the person in the band.  He told me a lot of stuff I can&#39;t remember.  What I do remember is this.  He said he went on a trip with S((name deleted)) (The person in my friends band) and they were sitting out in the desert on private property called &#39;claims&#39;.  He said him and S((name deleted)) were writing songs by a camp fire they lit out in the middle of knowwhere.  I forgot S((name deleted)) friends name, but S((name deleted)) friend looked up and saw many lights just above them.  He told S((name deleted)), &#34;S((name deleted)), look up and tell me what you see&#34; and S((name deleted)) was surprised as well.  Cool thing is, S((name deleted)) friend says they have this all on their cassette tape because they were recording song ideas at the time.  I rememeber S((name deleted)) friend saying that there were many lights that were fairly close to them.  He said he could of shot them with a 30 od 6 rifle.  He said each light was zooming from one place to another at too high of a speed for a person to handle.  The &#39;G&#39; force would be too great for a person he said.  Then he said all the small lights formed a &#39;V&#39; shape and took off towards, I forget what state or mountains he mentioned, but I bet it was the same place where everyone on tv mentioned they saw it. So to round this whole thing up.  I think these 2 guys have more information to add to that event.  I think they saw the UFO&#39;s before everyone else.  I personally believe them from talking with S((name deleted)) friend.  He had know reason to lye about this.  I was the one who said that they should call someone and report this because from the show I watched on this event, they never mentioned individual UFO&#39;s that formed the &#39;V&#39; shape were on their own at first and zoomed around at great speed, then formed the &#39;V&#39; shape. I told S((name deleted)) and his friend that I would search on the internet for them to see if I could find a place to report UFO&#39;s and that&#39;s how I found you.  You can call me, and give me a number to contact you after I get S((name deleted)) and his friends phone number.  S((name deleted)) friend says that he would love to tell what happened and even go back to the place he was at and do a film recording for you or whoever does that. I&#39;ll leave my information below.  If you call then I&#39;ll know you are interested.  I&#39;ll then get your number so I can call you back with S((name deleted)) and his friends phone numbers.  I don&#39;t have any of their numbers yet.  I will call H((name deleted)), who is the leader of the band S((name deleted)) is in and I will get S((name deleted))s number.  S((name deleted)) will have the phone number to his friend. See ya, and I hope I helped in this event, I&#39;m sure someone would love to hear these guys story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  No location in Nevada indicate by witness.

I (and my girlfriend) observed what seemed to be a triangular shape with 3 (white) downlights in each corner moving (what seemed to be) slowly in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car (incident occuring on the countryside, outside city), and stepped outside, as I could clearly see that this object/craft was not in any sense using &#34;normal&#34; anticollision-lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved what seemed to be slowly, and completely noiseless, right over my head, and continued in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Colour of object seemed to be black or a dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost visual after 3-5 minutes (the object only using downlights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was dark and the object was completely silent, it is difficult to establish size (either very, very big and &#34;high-level&#34;, or smaller &#34;low-level&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression was that it was flying low-level, aprx 300-500ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky was clear, and weather nil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.

1/1/90 00:15|Sao Paulo (Brasil)||Disk|5 minutes|Large, multicolored, glowing craft hovered over neighborhood in Sao Paulo, Brasil|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55637.html|17|ndxe199001| Large, multicolored, glowing craft hovered over neighborhood in Sao Paulo, Brasil<n> <n><n> <n><n> On New Year&#39;s Eve of 1990 shortly after midnight, my mother, cousin, and myself were standing outside on our balcony of a 3-story house in the Granja Julieta neighborhood of Sao Paulo, Brasil when a massive craft appeared over the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside for new years festivities looking over the neighborhood. The craft seemed to appear out of nowhere and hovered over the neighborhood for a few minutes. We were on the third story and the craft wasnt much higher than us, though it was about 100 or so yards away. We estimate that the craft itself was about 50 yards across. It was disc shaped and had multiple multi-colored lights that were constantly blinking around the entire ship. When asked to describe it, I always state that it had a great resemblence to the ship from the movie &#34;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&#34;. However, I had not seen this film prior to my sighting, so I do not think that had any effect on my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered briefly over the neighborhood and began to glide further and further away. We saw it slowly float behind some trees then it suddenly gained a great amount of speed and disappeared. The following morning, several people around the neighborhood mentioned the encounter as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Til this day, my mother, cousin, and I still stand by our recollection of the event.<n>
