6/30/49 21:00|Salem|OR|Cigar|2300|Cigar Craft, Body Marks and Missing Time|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70810.html|1|ndxe194906| Cigar Craft, Body Marks and Missing Time<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not exactly sure when this took place, but I was told it was clear and warm so I suspect it was Spring or Summer and it was in 1949.  This sighting included my parents, my older brother Bob and myself, I was only 2 ½ and I do not recall anything.   My dad and mom have different stories, so I will tell this like it was told to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 9 PM and we had just left my grandmother’s about 5 miles from our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is about a 20 minute drive.  Dad had the habit of driving up to S Commercial Street about 2 miles from grandmothers and he and mom  go by and would watch the Color TV in the TV shop before coming home, which they did occasionally and stayed about 15 minutes and then drive home.  This was a very sparsely populated, undeveloped area of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dad said, &#34;The UFO  showed up out of no where and it was cigar shaped, it was silver colored and had red lighted round windows and he could see figures moving around inside but did not see any people.&#34;  Then, he said if he slowed down, it would slow down and if he sped up, it would also speed up.  It did not make a sound.  He said it paced him on his drive home. That’s where dad’s memory ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then mom said, &#34;No, it was on Market Street NE, this would be between 10-12 miles distance from dad’s sighting, we were heading down Market near Swegle Grade School and Birchwood Drive about 6 blocks from home and all the sudden the UFO appeared and it was near the &#34;goose house.&#34;  This was a house where they raised geese and had a very distinctive odor.  I said, &#34;Did you get out of the car?&#34;  And she said, &#34;Yes,&#34; and dad said, &#34;No,&#34; in an almost terrorized voice,  mom said “ yes we did and we watched it go over and it almost hit the roof on the goose house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then mom said she did not recall anything more till they were turning in the driveway at home.  Dad went in and called the local airport and was told that “ we are closed “ but he talked to the man anyway telling him what happened, and  the agent said they had also seen it and it went over so fast and without a sound and there was nothing around that could track it or follow it. Note: the airport closed at 11 PM, 2 hours after they left grandma&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shortly after that time that I begin to react to low sound and vibration.  My family tells me that I would hear a train go by or vacuum running or even water going down a drain and I would cover my ears and scream. My aunt recalls that I would be playing and then all the sudden become stock still and then slowly turn my head as if I were tracking a sound that only I could hear.  I am not sure what happened that night, but I do know that when I was old enough to recall things, between 6-11 years of age, we would pass a building on the way to my grandmothers and I would sit on the floor of the car,put my back firmly against the locked car door and bite my arm to keep from screaming from pure terror. In later years I went back and looked at the building, still there and it was/is a car parts store with radiator hoses etc… looking in the windows at night it was dimly lit with curved archways over long dark hallways with lots of dangling tubes hanging down  could this have triggered a memory from that night?  As I said, I do not have any conscious memories of the event Mom has two deep red marks about the size of a small pea about ½” above and below her naval and she has deep dimples from scoop marks on front of both upper thighs and  she has 6 small brown smooth on the skin dots about the size of match heads on her back, forming two separate triangles which one over the other form one diamond and they have been there since that night.  She said the craft almost hit one of the houses as it was so low, it was cigar shaped and had portals and no visible form of engine, fire, etc, but the portals had light behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It paced their car, speeding up when he did and slowing down when he did.  We pieced together there was about a 2 hour missing time for this event.  Dad said it was in one area of Salem, and mom saw it in another, about 10+ miles different in location.  Mom said they stopped the car and got out and looked at it, dad said, noticeably scared, NO WE DID NOT and he would not talk about it any more, he died shortly after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom always wondered about this one and still brings it up from time to time. She is now 83  None of her body marks were there before that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother has no recall of that evening at all, he was about 5 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He still lives in Oregon as well. Since he has no memory of the incident it did not make much of an impact in his life, as far as we can tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dad was about 24 years old. Worked in a cannery as well as sold real estate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> dad was always open minded, but I have to say he did not like talking about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mom was 25 and was home during the day, with my brother and myself to take care of she has always wondered what happened that night and even at her current age of 83 she still has questions and wonders about the marks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/30/49 15:00|Knoxville|TN|Other|~15 minutes|We saw a small object the size of a car shaped like a jet that hovered near the ground in 1949 or 1950.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107738.html|2|ndxe194906| We saw a small object the size of a car shaped like a jet that hovered near the ground in 1949 or 1950.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a Sunday after noon in rural Burlington area of Knoxville, Tn., my little sister and I were in the front yard playing with acorns.  It had rained that day and finally stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a loud noise and saw a thing in the shape of today&#39;s stealth jet.  It was silver, with black windows.  It was the size of a medium size car and was able to maneuver in a small area as we were in an area with lots of trees and another small house near by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came low, close to my little sister and hovered.  I was on the steps of the front porch and she was in the yard collecting acorns.  I thought it might take her.  Neither of us moved.  We felt no wind or any thing.  I don&#39;t remember it being too loud at that time.  It stopped for a time then whooshed away in same direction it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran in and told every body about it.  They paid no attention.  We went across the street and talked to a neighbor lady.  She said she heard a noise but may have just said that to make us feel better.  If the two of us had not seen and remembered it, I would think I dreamed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remember it pretty much the same.  My sister was frightened to be alone for a long time.  It was before TV and I only knew it kind of resembled my cousins toy jet.  I had never really seen a jet or even an airplane at the time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not positive about date as it was years ago, but my sister was not yet in school, and we think it was 1949 or early 1950s.  We wondered if any one else ever saw such a thing.  It stays in our memory fresh like the memory of Kennedy&#39;s death.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/10/49 21:00|Anchorage|AK|Disk|3 minutes|Disk encountered operation difficulties and crashed.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42462.html|3|ndxe194906| Disk encountered operation difficulties and crashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A disk, first visible at about10,000 feet elevation at a distance of about ten miles, became noticable as it proceeded ssw and emerged from behind the southern profile of the Chugach Range.  As it cleared the southernmost peak visible from Anchorage, viewed from approximately 12th and G streets, it made a right turn.  This turn was nearly a U-turn and the disc proceeded nne, now on the west side of the mountains and fully visible from the vantage point.  The disk was now an elevation lower than the mountain peaks, they are between 5,000 and 7,000 feet.  As the disk moved nne it slowly lost altitude and moved closer to the vantage point.  The disk now appeared clearly disc shape with a slightly curved underside, a wider band slightly below the midpoint and a dome shaped top with windows just above the midpoint.  The windows appeared nearly clear yellow, as if from heat, and the craft was that color with slight glowing appearance of hot metal showing green, blue and orange very slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk began to wobble as it descended and it was obvious it was about to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound while it was in the air, although one expected to hear something, and there was no sound from the impact but there was a difference in sound, possibly a very low vibration.  I was a child when I observed this, in the company of adults.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was told that a group of government employees had been sent out to find any remaining debris.  They located the crash scene, crated their findings and sent them to Wright Patterson.  Because this occurred so very long ago I am not sure of the date but have given my best estimate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/4/49 10:00|Los Angeles|CT|Circle|10 minutes|Six objects seen by many over Los Angeles in 1949|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45218.html|4|ndxe194906| Six objects seen by many over Los Angeles in 1949<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event took place on the Crenshaw Blvd.May Co shopping center parking lot on a Saturday morning. I was 8 (9?)  years old.  My mother, father, myself and younger sister entered into the parking lot and noticed people looking up over and beyond the stores.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After parking the car we also looked up and saw six slightly fuzzy bright white oval appearing objects  moving very slowly to our east in a loose formation southward and seemed to be low, perhaps 2 to 4000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother is now 87 years old and has a very clear memory of the event.  I recently talked to her to verify my recollection.  She is of the opinion that the year was 1950 and her description was as I remembered it but she added &#34;they moved soundlessly.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear with sunshine and there wery many people who saw this event, perhaps hundreds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
