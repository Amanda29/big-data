When i was sitting on the staircase and talking with my friend standing in front of me, i saw one very small illuminated (white color) object up high in the sky (north direction) just on the head of the friend. The object travelled at a very fast speed in parabolic tragectory from north to east direction. The fantastic thing is that when the object just came exactly up in the sky (slightly towards east-south) the object took a small round around on fixed object in the sky even at such a high speed. The object then continued in its original parabolic tragectory and disappered towards east-south direction. I have been thinking of this event for last many years and still feel that the fixed object around which this object took a round might be the place from where these UFO&#39;s might be coming. The event time is exact. The exact event date can be found after consulting the university as to when the 2 nd paper of these exams took place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I walked from my house to another building at my farm. When I entered the threshold of the doorway I stopped, turned around 180 degress, and looked straight up, why I did this is puzzeling , because then at that moment I saw a silver cigar shaped object, flying  above the cirrus clouds at twice the speed of a commercial jetliner at that altitude. There were no wings, no con trail,  the cigar shaped object flew from the north due south. I observed this object for about 20 seconds as it clearly was visible in and out of the cloud openings. I know cirrus clouds are usually about 30,000 feet. so I know this cigar shaped object was very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The lights were too bright, too close and too low to be airplane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into my driveway and saw that they were stationary. The first one flew over the house behind me. It had three big white lights which changed to little red and white blinking lights. The second one flew directly over me. It looked light a plane without a fueselage. The lights were the same. The third one remained in original position for an hour. Called my daughter to see. Called Lambert Airport. Tower called back; they had two faint stationary targets on radar. (Objects were between witness and Lambert, due west.)Jennings and Moline police saw objects. Said they would send up helicopter. Commercial aircraft in area could hear engine noise and tell difference. Could see helicopter but copter did not see object which was above him. [Uploaded by inv. NOTE: This report was taken March 1985. Neither wit- ness had ever heard of the Hudson Valley Sightings or a triangular shaped UFO. The mother drew a &#34;classic&#34; boomerang/chevron. The daughter drew a triangle resembling the drawing of Millstadt, Illinois Police officer Craig Stevens,(See NIDS report this web site for Stevens&#39; picture.) which greatly differed from her mother&#39;s depiction.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that there were many sightings reported in Missouri in 1985 of anomalous objects.))<n>

I could see no body of the craft, just the lights. It made no sound and moved from the SE to NW as fast as I could turn my head and watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live just north of a commercial airport and just NW of a major military airport(B-1&#39;s and KC 135 tankers). I was simply observing the stars on a relatively clear night, when out of the corner of my eye came this object with three circles glowing about the color orange of a cigarette ember. There was no sound and no visible body, but it passed overhead to the NW, at maybe 800-1000 ft. as fast as I could turn my head. I had 17 hours of solo time in a private plane when I was 16 yrs. old and have always been enthused by aircraft and the space program. I am also an amateur astronomer and just love looking at the sky at night.This is not something I imagined.<n>
