The object appeared somewhat translucent with an undulating light which changed colors (yellowish, whitish, orangeish) as the light moved in what appeared to be a counter-clockwise direction inside around the margins of the object.  The object looked smooth and rounded with no sharp edges or projections.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound and it moved rapidly and quietly through the sky.  We observed it for probably less than 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I both hold college degrees, traveled extensively around the world, lived in Asia for five years, and never experienced an event like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband served six years in the military and is familiar with aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Watched it for about an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sightseeing on Reddington Pass when two vicious dogs attacked the car.  We looked up towards the sky and saw a dark grey or black object hovering over the  Whetstone Mtns.  We started driving towards the object.  It was an oval shaped football object.  As we kept getting closer and closer to it, the object remained in the same place.  It did not move at all.  There were no lights.  We drove towards it for at least 45 minutes.  It got dark and we lost visual contact.<n>

The house is approximately 60-70 kilometers  ((NUFORC:  meters??)) from the Cheasapeake bay. I had been watching T.V. and had gone out for a smoke. I was facing east-(the Bay) when out of the corner of my eye,-I saw a quick streak from just slightly front and left to behind me(though it&#39;s entire path was visual perifially). It was in every respect, like a shooting star-(I had seen so many during my time there-and it was EXACTLY like a shooting star in every regaurd-Speed Path and duration. It was only as an-&#34;Aww-too bad...I missed it!&#34; after thought,that I looked up in the direction it had-(or should have) disappeared in that I turned and looked up to that point,- I was instantly perplexed by what appeared to be a jumbling or illuminated disturbance in the clear night sky-and I must admit, that it seemed like an attraction spotlight-(only with no &#34;beam from the ground&#34; attached to it). AND- it had no clear or concentrated form or direction and encompassed a much larger portion of the sky than an attraction spotlight would. As I turned not only my head attenuation,but my body as well to gaze at it, the illuminated disturbance moved from my left(west) to my right(east)in a very quick and abbreviated fashion and then disappeared as a tiny,ghostlike/neon,concentrated shape suddenly appeared in it&#39;s place,-the second the disturbance disappeared-(The approximate shape of a car&#39;s window shield and in comparison to the gigantic &#34;Wafting of air&#34;- MUCH SMALLER!) as it made a B-Line due south on a trajectory which was niether de or a-scendant,but was consistantcy of a jet flying on a straight and ulta-high altitude path. As it was nighttime, the shape was clearly defined-It&#39;s just that my memory fails me as to the exact,precise shape. It was either like a cars window shield, or like a triangle with it&#39;s top corner cut off- I went into town-North Beach the next day to ask if there was any &#34;at! traction or special event which would have fostered the use of a spotlight but after asking several locals,the only (even slightly) related testimony,-was that the vibration from a tremor or explosion had shaken a shopping center the morning of the very next day and had broken the windows of some of the shops therein. The &#34;Rolands&#34; Grocery Store Shopping Center with the McDonalds and (nearby)-the &#34;Rod and Reel&#34; Resturant. I am searching for a satisfactory explanation for what I saw,and it has taken a long time for me(as a devout skeptic) to realize that I have no explanation and that what I saw was defying of all my pre-held beliefs. I remember my first inclined emotion was one of violation-feeling that if what I had just seen was every thing I percieved it to be, then everything was now set on it&#39;s ear. The craft disappeared or &#34;Phased into the southern portion of sky-brightened by the (I guess) the Solomons Island City lights or perhaps Prince Frederick. there was no sound thruout and it happened over a period of about 5-6 seconds.<n>

EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&#39;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&#39;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&#39;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &#34;unusual&#34; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!  It&#39;s probably nothing, but thought you&#39;d like to see the report, perhaps someone else has reported something else that will make further sense to someone there.<n>

I attempted to concentrate on the object&#39;s shape and details, but, could detect no hard lines or edges and the object seemed &#34;fuzzy&#34; (the black sections may have been shadowed areas since the sun was overhead).

NW to N, Then in a fixed postion from when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at a rest area. I was coming home from Jamestown NY to Salamanca NY. There is a rest area just before the Randolph truck stop I looked to my left which would be north. There was a light cloud bank to the north. There was the cloud bank closer to the stars. A lower cloud bank towards the ground. About 1000 feet. It was just sitting there in between the cloud banks. The rest area sit about halfway up a mountain side. I could see fog in the valley below. I noticed it out of the corner of my left eye. Then I looked at it directly. It was just sitting there pulsating. After about five minutes. It took off in a North Westernly direction. It hit a high point above the top cloud bank. It went north for about I would say 5 miles. It came back down in a southeastly direction. It just sat there pulsating. After sitting there for about another 5 minutes. It took off. Straight up into the sky. I perceded to head home. That was my very first encounter with a UFO. Then in April of 97. I would say mid april. I was driving on route 241 from Randolph to Connawango. It&#39;s a small village just NW of Randolph. I proceded to go up route 62 from the village of Connawango. I had a small Dodge Ram pick-up truck. About a mile and a half from the village is the Town of Connawango barns. I pulled into the parking lot of the barns. Because of a slow leak in my tire. I checked out the tire and I got back into my truck. I was about to pull back onto the highway. When I saw this object coming from a North Westerly direction. It had lights on the front. It looked just like an airplane that was going to land. I thought, gee why would a airplane want to land here. Unless it was having trouble. The craft came right towards the town barns. Before coming over the town barns. The craft went in a southerly direction. I got quite close to the building across the road from the barns. I believe is a farm. there was ground fog. About 1/4 of a miles west of the farm was a cloud bank. Not a real thick one. It veered West South West into the cloud bank. I got a good view of the craft from its side. Have you ever seen a horseshoe crab. If you look at a side view of a horseshoe crab. That&#39;s what the object looked like. Nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before. There are street lights at the barns kind of shone on the side of the oject. Plus there was a full moon. The front of the oject where the lights were was elongated oval. The lights bobbed down to the ground like it was searching for something, before it went into the cloud bank. The craft or object made no sound what so ever. The color of the object or craft was tannish. I have never told anyone of my experience except here. When I found this on the internet. I felt it was time. Since then. I will at times go out on the back deck and look west. Like I sense theres more objects or crafts flying around over there at Connawango to Randoph. There is a mountain just in back of my house in the city of Salamanca. Also I was taking a shower one evening. This was just before my father died of cancer. A battle he fought for 8 years. He was in his bedroom doing something. He came out of his bedroom. He looked out the hall window. Which looks out the rear of the house. He got very excited, he pounded on the bahroom door. He wanted me to see what he thought was a UFO. He said there was an other craft persuing it. But I was in the shower. I came out of course after he encountered it. I don&#39;t know. But I sense to the west of my house is Ufo coradoor. I haven&#39;t driven over to the area sinse then. I have drive! n to Jamestown and back. But never went to check the area out. It certainly was an unique experience. One I will never forget. It also changed my view on the possibility. That there is life other than ours. Also the object that I talked about in the begining. When it flew it left a trail.<n>

I watched as the light changed direstion and began to fly west hovering about 10 feet above a local elementary school.,  I watched it until it flew directly over my head and climbeed at a 90 degree angle.  Then bam all gone.  There was no sound, and no apparent release of waste from the engine.  This is the second time I have witnessed anything like this.<n>

It was approximately 500 feet above the truck stop. It was a bright white light that had a haze to it. On channel 19, the truckers were speaking many profanities because they couldn&#39;t understand what it was. The object laid above us for approximately 5 minutes although it felt like a half hour, I don&#39;t remember looking at my clock to see how long it was actually there for. Channel 19 went wild with hysteria and confusion. The light made absolutely no noise whatsoever it was so quiet it was scary. I don&#39;t remember hearing the engine of the truck roaring. At the same moment the light disappeared, the lights in the truck stop went out as did the electronic equipment and all Semis and vehicles in the parking lot. This happened in a blink of an eye, approximately five seconds and it was gone. We all were dumbfounded. After the incident, we all looked up to the sky and noticed many helicopters around the area. Not many people talked about it though afterwards, which I thought was weird.

It had absolutely no sound whatsoever. I heard truckers on channel 19 on the CB saying things like &#34;What the *** is that?&#34;, &#34;Sh**, I know I haven&#39;t drank tonight, please someone tell me what the *** that thing is&#34;, &#34;that is no *** airplane&#34;, etc...channel 19 was running like a mad house with profanity. the lights went out at the truck stop at the same time it disappeared, and the trucks, all the trucks lost power too, all electronic equipment was shut off for approximately 5-10 seconds while the &#34;craft&#34; disappeared&#34;...the craft just shut off it&#39;s light the way it looked, but it was gone. After the lights came back on, we saw many helicopters in the skies surrounding the area which normally was not that heavy with aircraft traffic at that time of night.<n>

The object was only 20-30 feet above ground, and was no larger than 6-12 inches in diameter.  The speed of the object was somewhere around 30-50mph.  It came from behind, startling my friend and I, then quickly disappeared.  It&#39;s flight path was an upward arc, kind of a swooping motion, arcing upward after passing us.  This object made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no electrical storms, no powerlines nearby and no one else directly around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were college students at the time.

Department of Corrections. I have a pretty good eye for details.  In Feb. of 1997, I was in my backyard having a cigarette at approx. 8 p.m. when I glanced toward my neighbors yard, I clearly observed what appeared to be a slightly out of round, yellowish/gold orb &#34;floating&#34; (best way to describe it) below the treetop level of the tree in their yard. I was quite excited about having the experience and refused to yell out to my wife (at the time) for fear of causing anything to disrupt the event.  I would estimate the object to be about15 ft. tall and nearly the same wide but not quite.  It was completely silent, appeared to be smooth in texture with no appendages or apparent windows or doors.  It was not brightly lit but rather more glowed than anything else.  It remained clearly in my sight without motion for 15-20 minutes.  I swear I could hit it with a stone for it was only about 50 ft. from me.  I think it was between 30-50 ft off the ground.  When it did move it was extremely slow and silent.  I observed it for approximately 30 minutes as it sort of drifted southward toward Phoenix, until I could no longer see it. I immediately went inside and told my wife who was more than a little irritated at me for not calling her out. I am an avid believer in the existance of ufo&#39;s.  I am not a flake. I could care less if anyone believes this for I know what I saw and that is all that matters to me. My phone number is unlisted so please use discretion.  I do not need to speak to an investigator but am willing to discuss the event with anyone who may think such a conversation would be helpful. Respectfully, ((deleted))<n>

I had decided to take a cigerette break and enjoy the wonderful view from our living room window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking out the window I noticed an object in the sky over the hills beyond the town.  At first I thought it was a kite or a mylar balloon, however I noticed this object was very far away so what I was looking at had to be huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching the object for several moments, it then vanished and reappeared in another part of the sky...that&#39;s when I yelled for my wife! I had too make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things and too my surprise she could see it too. We went out on the side porch to have a totally unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object vanish and reappear several times in different areas of the sky. After the last vanish we stood out there for about an hour waiting to see if it came back, but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened during the daytime in the early afternoon and lasted for maybe a  couple mintues. This was the third time in my life that I had seen a U.F.O. and it was my wifes first time...now I know I&#39;m not crazy!<n>

This could have been a few months prior to the date stated above, or a few moths after. It was approximately 3:00am and myself, and two friends (brothers) were standing in front yard, talking before two of us departed to our homes.  All of a sudden, a noise sounded from the sky...a very solid-like sound which resembled that of a clothes dryer starting its first turn or two of the drum... but much, much more powerful and solid and what seemed like would be extremely loud...however, was shelled-like...retained to paremeters. This sound was approximately one-second in length.  Following this sound (as in sequence of process) was what sounded like a jets exhaust...however, much more determined-soundinding, and of much more power.   The duration of this sound was also approximately one-second. Reactions of all three of us were the same... which was turning our heads up to look in the direction of where these sounds came from and went to.  All three of our opinions of the directions were within the South to Southeast direction (in the sky) from where first started and took-off in the directoin of the sounds and headed in the direction (opinions) varying) somewhere in the South to South West direction.   I describe it as this&gt; Something was sitting in a dead-standstill position...in the sky and, was able to &#34;start&#34; (whatever it is that was started) and accelerate to speeds that enabled them to disappear (so-to- speak).<n>

I looked to the east and couldnt believe what i was seeing either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A chevron shaped object about 100 yards across was silently floating westward from the beachside (we were on the west side of the intracoastal). It was at an altitude of approx. 1000 ft. and came from over the ocean and passed about 100 ft. over the Aliki condos on ormond beachside heading straight for the mainland.  It was only moving about 10-15 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at a riverfront park in which was in direct line of its travel. By this time it was over the river still heading west. My wife and youngest son were to frightened to get out of the car. Myself and my oldest son (about 15 at the time) got out and watched as it moved directly over us and continued west until out of sight. There was no sound at all. There were 3 orangyred lights, 1 on each wingtip and 1 at the nose. My father is a pilot and i grew up around airplanes and we see them flying up and down the coast all the time and this was NO airplane or anything of this world. It was the strangest thing ive ever seen and we will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the object floated out of distance we saw other strange white lights in the distance over the ocean m oving very quickly from 1 area to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went home about an hour later and my wifes sister called who lives nearby and said she had just seen something weird fly over her home as she and her husband were out by the pool...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard of anyother witnesses or anything in the newspapers about it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up on the east coast of central florida, ive seen many shuttle launches and military aircraft and they all pale in comparison to this thing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive since moved to Pa. but will never forget that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

It was a cripsy clear calm night with cotton ball clouds. I could see the stars behind the clouds. The lights of the city were slightly illuminating the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I saw one ball of light pass above the clouds moving in a South-Westerly maybe more Southerly direction. It looked odd so I kept watching. Then another ball of light exactly the same size and distance moved the same direction following the first, completely silent. I kept watching and there was another and another. I ran in to get my video camera and started taping this. There were several more. They seemed to be spaced the same distance apart and travelling the same rate of speed, like in some kind of formation, though the patches of clouds made it difficult to be exact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that they were satellites, but then do satellites travel in this manner? I&#39;ve seen many satellites before, but these were closer, or a lot larger-if they were out in space! These balls of light were about the size of a small green pea if you held it in-between your forefinger and thumb in an out-stretched arm. I think I counted about seven to ten seconds between each ball of light. Also, they just seemed too perfect for shooting stars - and there were too many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saved the tape it&#39;s on (I hope!) Though I only got the last few of the formation on tape. I have other family 8mm tapes I&#39;ve been meaning to go through to put on disc. Hopefully, I&#39;ll find this footage. When I do, I&#39;ll send you a copy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen other unexplained things in the Nevada sky, and yes I&#39;ve seen F-117 and the B-2 bomber, both stealths, amoung other military jets.

We were at a mall about to go underground to the theatre.When we saw a bunch of lights flickering like a strobelight&#39; with colors of green,blue,red,white,and yellow.We got as close as we can to the object,which was about 200 yards.I got out of the car because I could not figure out what this object was. I could not see a shape just a form of a boomerang that was 50 yards or more wide.It lasted about 15 seconds then trees and buildings blocked our view.There is no way we were the only people to see these lights,they were to bright and the object was to big.The mall we were at was Windsor park mall in the city of SanAntonio next to a smaller city called Windcrest but still Bexar county.It flew over a major street called Walzem Rd.,That&#39;s how I know we were not the only observers.My girlfriend and I only saw it for about 15 seconds but it was going slowly to the east and we were facing northeast. The sun was !just going down behind us, so we were facing the night sky. That&#39;s why we could not see a structure I guest, unless it was 7 different objects flying in a perfect formation with no sounds of engines. I THINK NOT!

I went outside to enjoy looking at the clouds. I noticed what apeared to be a silver blimp. It was just sitting there motionlss in a 20mph wind. The object was approx. a half mile from me at the time.Then it turned and headed in my direction or west at a slow speed. it passed right in front of me at about 200 feet. It was about 300 feet long and 60 feet in diameter,there were no seams or openings on the craft and no gondola. It made no noise and moved effortlesly into the wind.The aircraft then turned north and headed away from me, picking up speed as it went. From behind it looked round in shape. Then it accelerated to great speed and was out of sight within 30seconds. I have seen strange lights before but this time I saw the object in broad daylight and right in front of me.<n>

It was about the size of the sun. It shrunk smaller, and then got the original size agian.  It then proceeded to rapidly sink in the horizon till it was behind the hill.  I was positive that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was TOO big to be one.  This is not a joke, i know that it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

He said, &#34;Get up and go look up into the sky.&#34;  My roommate, who was laying on a futon stretched out in the living with his head facing the window, sounded calm but I heard a sense of urgency in his voice. It scared me. I stumbled towards the third floor window of my downtown Seattle apartment overlooking the Westin Hotel.  For some reason, I was unable to stand up, so I kneeled at the windowsill, and looked up into the sky.  I immediately saw 3 shiny, round white blobs of light darting around in very erratic patterns above Elliott Bay.  As I was watching, my roommate said in an equally sickly calm voice, &#34;I have been in the military for over 20 years, and nothing, nothing we have can make those moves.&#34;  Then he rolled slightly on his side, smiled, closed his eyes and started snoring. Within about 4 minutes of his passing out, I remember stumbling about 3 feet towards the couch and nothing after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were shiny, white, and flying slightly lower than cloud level.  I had some difficulty focusing on them. In the distance they looked to be about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.  The most remarkable aspect of these objects was their flying patterns, which defied gravity.  Each of the three objects I observed were moving in straight lines and then quickly shooting off at right angles very, very fast. Much faster than I have ever seen anything mechanical move. I don’t see how a human body could take that kind of movement.  They also moved in close proximity to each other, which appeared equally as dangerous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their flying pattern reminded me of fireflies, and it looked they were playing in the clouds.  I can only say this is not something I have ever witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 2 miles north of Stacy Minnesota (North of Wyoming Minnesota) My wife said, look it&#39;s going to crash ! I looked out side window of the truck, and seen this .... I don&#39;t know what it was, it had 5 or more strobe lights lighting up one at a time around the perimeter of the object. I coundn&#39;t make out the shape because it was dusk, but I could see something. The &#34;craft&#34; came towards the ground at a steep angle and pulled up at the last second and went up..up..up. We watched for what seemed to be about a minute, I never did stop or pull off the freeway, I was just so amazed I didn&#39;t think of stopping ! The freeway runs parallel with state highway 61, the two roads are about 1/4 mile apart where we seen it, so it must have been about half way between interstate 35 and state hwy 61, about 1/8 mile from our truck. The freeway had alot of traffic, some one else had to see this, who would be playing in plane at this time of the evening, in the winter ? I thought plane only had one or two lights? I am only reporting this now because I have just learned about you and I am a big ufo secptic, but I also learned about a week later my in-laws, who winter in Phenoix, seen something really strang in march, which made the news. So I wanted to know if anyone else had seen what we seen ?<n>

I believe it was triangular in shape, but I am not 100% sure. Because it was NOT dark yet, I could very clearly see that this was a flying vehicle, which accelerated at terrific speeds. It appeared lit as it moved south, after accelerating away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of Object(s): Again, 20 meters long and 10 meters high. With my thumbs tucked behind, my other 8 fingers may have covered it had I held them up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance to Object(s) &amp; Altitude: Again, I believe the craft was about 60 meters away, and flying at an altitude of 100-130 meters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of Area / Surroundings: Mesa is a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. The complex I lived in lies near an open field, train track and silos (south), at the end of a road that leaves the main road through town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description &amp; Details:<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 6, 1997 was my final day living in Mesa, Arizona.  The next day I moved to San Francisco. Done packing late in the afternoon, I left my apartment and began walking east, on the southern edge of the southernmost parking lot in the complex. I was headed toward the mailboxes to retrieve my mail for the last time.  To my right (south) was a concrete retaining wall that lines the complex.  Behind me, to my right were the large silos, which sit next to the train tracks.  There were no cars or trains passing by. Approximately 500 meters from the mailboxes, I began to hear a low humming noise behind me and to my right (south).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a large triangular craft, the source of the low humming sound. The craft was flying very slowly, at an altitude of approximately 100-130 meters. It was flying over the train tracks, which lie about 60 meters from where I was walking.  At the moment that I turned my head to the right and looked directly at the craft, it stopped, turned right and accelerated to a terrific speed and disappeared.  The craft made NO noise above the low humming I initially heard.  It emitted NO exhaust, fume, smell or fire. It was very much like watching a movie, in real life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? NO way.  This was a craft that was being flown by somebody. ANYBODY who saw what I saw would instantly have known that.  The only question I have is, who was flying or controlling the craft?  Humans?  Extra-terrestrials?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Background: I&#39;m a teacher in Brooklyn, New York having recently changed careers from advertising.  I have a masters degree in education.  My undergraduate studies focused on marketing and political science and Arizona State University (1990-94).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Views on UFOs, before and after sighting: BEFORE the sighting, I was very open to the possibility that some sightings could be attributed to military tests.  However, I had seen some stories and movies that were compelling with respect to the notion that some UFO&#39;s could actually be extra-terrestrial.  Beyond that, I paid no extraordinary attention to the question, mainly because I felt the odds of seeing something inexplicable were very, very low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFTER the sighting, I spent nearly a month in denial that it even happened.  Then, on national news, I saw the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; sighting on mainstream national news.  My first response was, &#34;That&#39;s what I saw.&#34;  Then, I was not in denial, but also did not speak much of what I saw except with very close friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the last year, my curiosity has risen again, though it is very frustrating to imagine that I may never know exactly what I saw.  However, recently I have had very vivid dreams which strongly suggest that what I saw was extra-terrestrial in nature.<n>

Also provided is an explination of what you will see on the map.  I encourage viewers to open the map in a new window so you may view it and the below explination at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the link to view the map:  http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1750635  ---------EXPLINATION OF WHAT YOU WILL SEE ON THE AERIAL VIEW MAP---------- In the aerial view we see the Mesa, Arizona apartment complex I lived in.  Notice two red markers, separated by a blue line.  Notice that the indicator to the left (outside the map) states that the distance between the two markers is .0242 KM (or 24.2 meters).  The red marker on the top is approximately where I was as I walked east.  The craft was observed flying east over the train tracks (just outside the complex) after it had flown past the silos (which you will also see in the photo).  In my original report, I estimated the lateral distance between myself and the craft to be &#34;60 meters.&#34;  This map has helped me to provide a much more realistic distance (just 24 meters!).  As discussed with the NUFORC, the altitude of the craft could still be estimated at 100-130 meters.  But, the main point of the estimate is that the craft was VERY close and VERY low.  From the point at which the craft was observed, it made a right turn and accelerated to terrific speed as it moved south, and out of sight.<n>

Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first event to happen was the sighting of a &#39;roadwork&#39; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &#39;star&#39; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&#39;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&#39;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &#39;supernatural&#39; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven&#39;t bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters. As well as in the interests of &#39;science&#39;.I hope you make some use of this report.<n>

I was fully awake...  I just feel asleep like right away , but as I was closing my eyes I saw 6 small grey figures and felt something touch my leg and arms.  When I woke up it was 6am and I felt like I wanted to be afraid but couldn&#39;t , I have a lot of trouble understanding what happen.. The only other thing is since then I have had several nose bleeds . Which I rarely have had before.<n>

It was hoovering over the highschool football field. The only reason I could even see it was because of the lights of the football field. I could easily see the shape of a saucer sitting in the clouds over the game i could also see some lights on in the ship they had, i guess windows all over it because i could make out what looked light comming out of the windows you know faint lights because it was in a cloud. I firmly belive i would not have been able to even see it if not for the stadium lights being on and where i happen to be standing. If the stadium light had not been on and i happen to look over there i might have seen the faint lights in the cloud but would have thought nothing of it. just stars. it was truly awesome it was huge way bigger than the football field and high school. I dont know how high up it was it seemed right ontop of the game. I should have called the cops and let them know about it i guess. I just looked at it for about 2minutes went back in the trailer, i can&#39;t even remember if i told my mom about it when i went back out a few minutes later it was gone. I wish I would have had a camera that would have taken night pictures, I would have taken a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was stationary whcih caused me to stay and watch.  I thought it might have to do with the movie industry, but then it was so high that it couldn&#39;t possibly have been &#34;standing on stilts.&#34;  I left after 10 or 15 minutes and never was able to figure out what it was.  It stood still for 10 or 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

2/1/97 13:00|Unincorporated|AZ|Rectangle|10 seconds|Giant rotating rectangular shaped "mirror" flying accross the sky.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106071.html|46|ndxe199702| Giant rotating retangular shaped &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; flying accross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While quail hunting with my brother in Eastern Maricopa County, Arizona, I had the following sighting:  It was approximately 1 pm on a clear, sunny day.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  We were hunting in the desert about 1 mile east of Hwy 87 and North Forest Rd 68, approx. map coordinates are loc: 33.526389,-111.389722.  The day and month are uncertain; it was quite some time ago.  However, I do know it would have occurred during the Arizona quail hunting season which runs from mid-October to mid-February.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had decided to break for lunch at our campsite.  After lunch, we were sitting in lawn chairs facing west.  The sun was high, there was nothing obscuring my view of the western sky.  I would approximate the temperature was in the low to mid 70’s.  The horizon I was facing was actually a line of low mountainous terrain which ran along the western side Hwy 87.  There was also a low mountainous horizon further to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother had decided to pull his hat down over his eyes and take a short nap; I simply sat in my chair taking in the view.  What happened next was simply shocking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From over and behind the mountain range I was facing to the west appeared what I can only describe as a huge rectangular mirror.  Its size was incredible; it had to be at least a mile in length.  The truly bizarre aspect was it seemed to be rotating as it moved across the sky.  Its dimensions appeared to have the ratio of a sheet of printing paper, lying on its long side.  It was rotating on its central axis, so the effect was that I could only see it when the side rotated and caught the full reflection of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved in a west-to-east trajectory, it rotated so I could only see the entire rectangle shape at certain points across the sky.  The object “flew” across the sky to the north of my position in a straight west-east line.  The things I were unable to determine were speed, altitude and size because of how quickly it disappeared from my view, but it was huge and it was fast.  The whole thing lasted no more than 10 seconds, and by the time I thought of saying something to my brother, it was already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only report this because I am fascinated by the subject of UFO’s and have never heard of this type of sighting before.  I only recently became aware of this site to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me via email if you would like a drawing of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

In fact, until this event, I never really believed in UFO&#39;s at all. It was just something that I never thought about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place in a very rural area of southwest Michigan, and I was 15 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting for the bus at approx. 6:35 am. It was still very dark outside. It was very cold, around 15 degrees farenheit, and it was very clear, no clouds at all. I was standing at the end of my driveway, which is about 50 yards from the house. There are no neighbors in this area, and there were no lights on of any kind - no streetlights, vehicles, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across the street is a very large field of soybeans. Above this field I saw four large lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights looked exactly like stadium lights. They were very bright and close together. They were very high in the sky, perhaps twice the height of a normal stadium light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely, I was mesmerized by the lights. I could not figure out why the farmer had put these huge lights in the middle of his field. I watched the lights for approimately 10 minutes, and they never moved. I had no reason to think that they were anything but very tall stadium lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the lights came towards me and zoomed over my head. There was no sound. As the lights approached me, the craft went higher and took off over my head. At this point it was going very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw it in full detail, directly above me. It was only a few hundred feet off the ground. It was triangular, but the edges of the triangle were rounded off. There were lights on either side of it, small red lights that were blinking. As it went above me, The light in front of the craft turned on. It was an interior light, and I could make out a shape moving around in the &#34;cockpit.&#34;  The craft was huge, but not as large as a jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went over my head, it veered sharply to the left (west) and took off very quickly. It completely disappeared within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was completly noiseless, and it was only after the even that I realized I had seen something extraordianry. The main thing I remember is that for some odd reason i could not take my eyes off the thing. It was like it hypnotized me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I realized what I had just seen, I was completely terrified. I felt like I could not breathe. The bus came and I asked everyone if thay had seen anything weird in the sky. They hadn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since that day, I have been a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
