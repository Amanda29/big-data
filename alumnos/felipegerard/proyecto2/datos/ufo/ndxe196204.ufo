One evening I went into a nearby janitor closet to get a broom to sweep up my room.  It was nighttime and the closet had a window.  A glowing green object caught my eye against the black night outside. It moved! Of course, I also moved to the window to get a closer look.  The glowing thing drifted to the top center of the window as I went forward. It strangely moved to follow my head as if it was curious. It was approximately the size of a peanut shell seen from the side, with no details to be seen, only the bright green light.  My immediate thought was that this was alive and must be some strange glowing insect that would make a great addition to my collection. Hoping that it would not go away, I hurried back to my room to get my “butterfly net”.   The excitement increased as I returned to find it was still hovering outside. Pulling a step stool over to the window, and climbing up, the “bug” a! nd I were face to face. Again, it moved slowly side to side watching me as I moved to open the window from the top. It moved a few inches as I raised my right hand, grabbed the handle and pulled the window slowly in to quietly open it.  By this time I was really excited!  It was still hovering around and was still in reach. I brought my net up to make a sweep at it.  As I placed the net at the opening it instantly went straight away, without a sound, at unbelievable speed. It left a trail of light in my eyes. Next, I tried to find an insect in my entomology textbook which fit the object’s description. It did not exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking about this event many times over the last 47 years has led to my conclusion that the “object” was definitely intelligent.  It demonstrated curiosity which is a sign if intelligence and thinking.  Precise movement is common for an insect but not combined with movement showing curiosity.  Also important was the complete silence.  Insects fly by beating the air with their wings which creates a buzzing noise.  This was a fairly large insect which should have made a significant sound when it flew away at such speed.  Similar reports of silent hovering objects have been seen following aircraft in flight.  I wanted a record of this event for future reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a family gathering in the early 1960s when my brother, who served in a special part of the armed forces, revealed that the military was fully aware of the existence of UFOS. My brother, now deceased, had worked in what he described as &#34;missile guidance systems&#34; He told us, as part of the schooling, he and about 30 others received special training in reading radar and being able to identify UFOs from other aircraft.  He said the military did not want an accidental nuclear exchange as a result of confusing UFOs with possible missile launchings from the People’s Republic of China or the Soviet Union. He told also told us that during Cuban missile crisis he spent 2 weeks in a deep underground missile complex waiting for orders that might lead to world war 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The army, he said, not only revealed UFO existence but also trained him and the others of his crew in how recognize their peculiar movements and characteristics on radar. The military, he told us revealed nothing more other then they were just here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My secretary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1978 I hired a 70-year-old woman named ((namd deleted)), as my secretary. I was director of an organization that planned and created activities for older Americans. ((name deleted)) told me when she was a young woman in her early 20s (around 1928) and living in the state of Wyoming, she used to get up early in the morning 2 or 3 times a week and play golf. She recounted one very early summer morning just after 4:30 am she walked about a quarter of a mile to the golf course. When she reached the top off a small hill overlooking the playing area, she said she was stunned to see a greenish glowing sphere-like object setting about 10 feet off the ground. She told me she was so shocked that had she could not move. She described it as being approximately 50 feet in diameter with oval shaped windows around the top third area.  She said she knew instinctively it was not from our world.  After nearly 10 minutes of just staring at this most unusual sight she said the object rose slowly from its position and began making a faint humming noise. Then quite suddenly it just streaked away and was gone with in a few seconds. She never told anyone about this for 25 years for fear people would think she was crazy. I believed this ((name deleted))’s story because she always told me the truth. If she did not like how I was running the Agency she would tell me about it and not always pleasantly.  She was a no-nonsense person who believed neither in God, nor honest politicians.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airline pilot: For a few months in 1980 I worked at a car rental agency. One of my duties was to go to the Seattle International airport and pick up airline flight crew and bring them back for a car rental. Every time I picked up a pilot I would always find some way of asking them if they had ever seen a UFO. Every pilot but two replied no. I felt some were even irritated with the question but most were good sports and gave me their opinion (usually negative) on the subject. A few told me while they did not believe in them, other airline pilot friends did report seeing them on occasion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening I picked up an airline pilot captain whose name was Frank. When I asked Frank if he had ever seen anything strange like a UFO, he was very silent for a few minutes. I thought maybe he was insulted by the question. I was worried he would tell my boss. However, to my surprise he opened up and told a very interesting story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the Carter administration, I was flying out of Washington DC with not only the regulars (passengers) but I had the Secretary of Transportation, and his staff on board.  We were about 20 miles out when three green globes or spheres appeared in front of my plane.  He said they appeared to be about 50 feet or better in diameter and were flying formation.  We not only had visual, but they were being tracked from ground radar.  He told me; because these objects were in front of the plane none of the passengers were aware of what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Secretary of transportation to my cockpit. I wanted a witness and I thought he would want to know. I thought this would be the biggest news story of the century. I asked him if they might have been experimental craft. He said flatly; &#34;No&#34; He said there were oval shaped windows or what appeared to be windows around the top third of the sphere. &#34;Not one of my flight crew nor did the secretary of transportation think they were other then what they appeared to be, some kind of space craft from another world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it remarkable that the type of craft described by both ((name deleted)) and the Airline pilot were identical even thought the two events took place more then 30 years apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote this report becuase I thought it was my public duty. If you care to print it or just keep it on record is fine either way with me. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to communicate with the witness via e-mail, but his address is not valid.  He describes himself as being located outside the U. S..
