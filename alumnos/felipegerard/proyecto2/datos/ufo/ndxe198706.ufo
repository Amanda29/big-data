The object moved silently across the sky, approx. 1/2 to 1 mile above us. The craft was long in shape, with a box shaped nose (front), a long bridge-like narrow middle and a tail that flared wider than the middle portion then tapered down to a point. The object did not streak by, but instead floated slowy across the horizon line, arriving from the south, moving in a north, northwest direction. The sighting lasted about 2 minutes before the object disappeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was covered with many different colored lights, which highlighted its spatial qualities. In a frenzy my friend and I drove home to tell others about the event. The DJ on the radio station that was playing stated that he was receiving a lot of calls about a UFO sighting. The next day or so the newspaper had a small article dismissing the event as a &#34;russian satelite burning up in the atmosphere&#34;. Sorry folks, but this object was crystal clear in appearance and moving slowly, not a streak in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another poster here described the object like a cruise ship in the sky and that description accurately captures the incredible nature of the experience because it was about as freaky as a cruise ship flying overhead. I cannot fully impress upon others the extreme size of the object... much bigger than any man made object known to fly at low speed and low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FYI, The other poster mentioned here described what had to be the same event, but recorded an approximate date of June, 1987. I am quite certain that they were off by a year or two by virtue of the event having taken place at least 20 years ago. Gotta say though, no matter how much time goes by I can never forget that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was early evening, about the time you would start to see stars come out. Especially noticable in the desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out on the balcony sitting and enjoying the warm night and we had been ready to go out for the evening. I noticed two very bright lights flickering high up up in the sky and asked her to come out and look. We were both amazed at how bright they were. I remember asking her since they were so bright, which one would be the north star. We thought that since they were so bright that maybe one was the north star and one may be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and stared at them for about 20 minutes to 1/2 hour and they did not move an inch. They just flickered. We just couldn&#39;t figure out why these two stars were so bright and next to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we got bored looking and continued getting ready. About 15-20 minutes later we were ready to leave. When we went back out both of those bright stars, lights or whatever they were completely gone?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date and time of the incident is approximate.

Turnpike SE of Orlando.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the mid 80&#39;s I had the following : On the way back from my mental health treatment centers in south Florida located in Oakland Park,, Deerfield Beach, and Hollywood in with other centers in Central Florida located in Cocoa Beach, Orlando, Kissimmee,and 2 in Altamonte Springs. Around 16:00 while traveling North on the Florida Turnpike, a few doen cars were (both North &amp; South)were pulled over with emergency blinkers on. I did the same thinking there might have been a auto mishap or something else. I got out of my car and the occupants of the other autos were out of their vehicles. Within moments I noticed they were all looking up in the general direction of an overpass. I looked up and saw a huge object about the same size of cruise boat. It was floating in the air about 500 yards above us not making a sound of any kind with very low levels of light in the background allowing an observation of its shape and size. There were brighter lights coming from what one might call a bridge also shaped in a like way to a large cruise ship. After observing it for 25-30 minutes, I started looking though my car (approx. 2 min) and it was no longer there. Some people left then noticed a couple dozen people looking and pointing towards lights frmo Orlando in which I would approximate to be 20-30 miles In a N.E. direction. I had put my camera back in my car but could tell it was many miles away by then and within a couple minutes it sped (using the term lightly) in the general direction of Cape Kennedy to the east. With in a couple days, the Orlando Sentinal said many reports of this object and the local Air Force said it may have been the Goodyear blimp. This was before the internet and no one had any idea where to report such a U.F.O..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully someone will read this and give further verification of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were sleeping in the family livingroom.Well, I was up late this night. I was looking out the window facing our back yard. All the sudden, I see this beam flashing on and off over houses and trees. I was really afraid. But,I just watch as these lights flash on and off. It was as if they were searching lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a moment notice the light was over my house. It was than, I felt something touch my sides of my waist. The next thing, I woke up sitting upright on my couch the next morning. I dont remember walking over to the couch and I dont have any memory of the rest of the night. Plus I would never in a million years sleep that way. I was shock to see myself in this position it was almost like I was place there. In my heart, I know that I was abducted by a UFO. This is hard because unless it happen to you. It is hard for anyoe to beleive me. I know out in the world there are other like me who have lost time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

When played in slowmotsion it gets very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Mr. Davenport:                                                                                 This is in reguards to pur phone conversation on May 14th 1999, As I explained to you about the video tape I have of a very unsual object I video taped in the summer of 1987 or 1988. I was video Tapeing a paper machine rebuild where I worked at the time. This was the reason  I had my vidio camera with me. As I was going to work that early morning. It was crystal clear and about 4:45 am. I was walking out my door with my vidio camera in the case. From my doorway looking straite west  ruffly 5 mile there is a large hill we call Irma hill, known for the small villiage on the west side of the hill. From my location I had  a very excellent view to the western horizon with the hill slightly outlineing the it, the horizen.. As I was closing the door to lock it I noticed a very bright shineing object directly over  Irma hill coming directly towards me. It was round and very bright and pulsating. I knew right away it was not a star, planet, or plane. When I   When I was younger I was into Astronmany, had my own telescope and farmilier with the nightly skies. It was much more brighter then the planet venius at its brightess point and at its dimmest point of pulsastion hardly visiable. I stared in almost disbelife ruffly 3 or 4 seconds, then reliseing I had my vidio camera with me I quicly as possible bent down and opend the case grabbing  my camera and pulling lens cover off also turning the power on I would estimate this took no more the 7 to 8 seconds being very familiar with my camera. I looked towards Irma hill where I observed the objedt but no longer could see it anymore I quickly looked straite up over me and spotted the object moving very fast in a easterly direction. I brought the camera up and foud it in my view finder and caught it on tape as it went away from me and disapeared. I stood there in complete disbelife asking myself what the hell was that...It took no more then 25 to 30 seconds from the time ! I spotted in the western horixon to disaphere at about a 35 diagree angle in the eastern horizon. When it was straite overhead before I could get the camera on it, the brightness was almost shiney and crome like. there  was absoluity no noice from the object. There was no wind and it was one of them mornings it was perfectly dead quite. The only thing you could here was early morning robbins. Ive had this tape all this time and over the years showed a few friends no one else has realy seen it yet. I wanted some one to look at it but I didnt know where to send it until I heard you on the Art bell show the othernight when you menstioned the event west of Eagleriver Wi. If you have any qustions please feel free to contact me by e-mail at ((e-address deleted))   or phone you have my number there.                                                 Thank you very much for your time.

6/30/87|Crofton|MD|Disk|can't remember|A saucer circles the moon many times.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68351.html|8|ndxe198706| A saucer circles the moon many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was a child, in elementary school, I was playing kick ball with my friend in his yard.  It was around mid-late afternoon.  It was still daylight, but you could see the moon in the sky.  We both noticed an object flying, circling around the moon,over and over.  It did not appear to be moving really fast from our distance, but it circled around the moon I would guess about every 20 seconds.  Knowing how large the moon is, it must have been going VERY fast.  I did not think of this reasoning at the time, because I was achild.  As a child I didn&#39;t think much of the inident because kids believe in imaginary stuff like aliens, but as an adult, it seems very strange.  My friend did make a comment, at the time, about alien ships and astraunats when looking at it.  My friend now does not remember the incident.  I don&#39;t remmeber the exact date.  It was sometime between 1986-1988.  1987 stands out in my mind, so maybe that is it.  I think it was in spring or summer.  It was warm out when we were playing.  I don&#39;t remember how long it lasted.  I don&#39;t think we continued watching it long enough to see it stop.  We had a short attention span.  It looked like a saucer shape, but was far away and could have been looked different.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/24/87 12:00|Manitowoc|WI|Disk|20 seconds|Two saucer-shaped objects at low-mid altitude, silver in color, moving eastward in broad daylight over the middle of town.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116525.html|10|ndxe198706| Two saucer-shaped objects at low-mid altitude, silver in color, moving eastward in broad daylight over the middle of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly clear summer day.  I don&#39;t remember the exact date, month or year, but I would estimate the summer of 1987.  I was in my back yard around mid-day and I looked up in the sky and saw two silver disk-shaped UFOs flying eastward toward Lake Michigan at a rapid speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in the middle of the city near the corner of South 35th Street and Custer Street.  The objects were flying at about the altitude a single-engine prop plane might fly.  The UFOs were flying at slightly different altitudes but perfectly parallel to each other and at the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were circular in shape, but not as flat as a saucer.  The bottom of the objects were smooth and metallic, but had seams/crevices originating in the center and extending to the edge of the object, almost like the edge of a scallop shell or sea shell.  The objects made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were flying directly overhead in an easterly direction.  I ran into the house to notify my mom, who came outside in time to see the objects herself but not in time to capture a photograph as their speed was too high and they had disappeared on the horizon within about 20 seconds&#39; time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight, my first thought was that the objects were two round parachutes or balloons, but there were a few problems that would make that impossible.  The objects were flying low enough to tell there was nothing suspended from the bottom-- no person and no scientific instruments.  The objects could not have been parachutes because the bottom of the objects were not concave.  Most importantly, it was clearly visible that the objects were not made of fabric, but of a harder material; and there were no ripples or indentations caused by the wind.  Lastly and most importantly, the objects were moving too fast to be an un-propelled object such as a balloon, parachute, or a fan-propelled parachute.  The object was moving at at least the speed of a small single-engine prop plane-- faster than the wind could naturally move the objects, especially on a clear day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is most interesting about this sighting is that it was in the middle of the day, over a metropolitan area of about 35,000 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I have ever posted this story online, but I have told many friends and relatives about the sighting.  I have done a lot of research to try to find photos of the objects online, similar stories both in Manitowoc and elsewhere, but I have found nothing.   The only similar story is a sighting that took place in 1987 in Sheboygan in the northern sky, also in mid-day.  That sighting is similar in geographic location, time of day, and the color and shape of the object (silver and round).  It differs in that the sighting only mentions one object (not two), and they witnessed oscillation, which I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

6/23/87 01:30|Summerfield|OK|Light|10 minutes|Unexplained Object seen in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25675.html|11|ndxe198706| Unexplained Object seen in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this hot June night I had decided around 11:00pm to drive to my parents home in Summerfield, OK fropm my home in Norman, OK.  When I was about 3 miles from my parents house I noticed a bright red ight in the sky.  I could not take my eyes from it.  I drove faster to see what in the world it was.  As I was driving down this road, which is very rural, I noticed a car coming from the other direction.  As the car passed under the light their dome light came on.  As they neared me they were waving for me to stop.  Because I did not know the 3 males in the car and because of the time of night I did not stop.  It was a very clear, bright night with hardly any clouds in the sky.  As I drove closer down the road and closer to the light my radio went off and wouldn&#39;t work anymore.  The light was now lower in the sky, about housetop level.  It was red and glowed but did not give off light.  The light reminded me of the light given off by one of those glow-in-the-dark balls that kids play with.  It was elongated and seemed to undulate as it now moved down the road in front of me.  A best guess estimate as to size is that it semed to be about 9 feet long and 3 feet wide.  It dropped from housetop level to the level of a monster truck cab.  Once I was this close I all of a sudden did not want to catch up to it anymore.  I slowed down so that I would stay behind it and not catch up to it.  It was traveling down the road in front of me.  For some reason it now seemed very menacing.  The way I can best descibe it is the way you feel when a dog growls at you and you can tell whether it is a dog that will wag its tail and lick your hand if you talk to it or will back up its growl with an attack if you speak to it.  It was the bad one.  It seemed evil and menacing.  As I approached the intersection, it was now down to windshield level of my chevette car.  I stopped for the stop sign at the intersection and it kept going without stopping.  It is 4/10 of a mile to my parent&#39;s house form the intersection.  Half of this is! on the paved road and half is a private lane.  Where you turn onto the lane the pavement rises into a hill to continue up and around a curve.  The light was barely ahead of me when I reached the lane.  I was just barely idling along at this point, so as not to catch up with it!  While it continued up the hill I turned onto the lane and stomped on the accelerator.  I looked in my rearview mirror and saw it behind me.  I started honking my horn and as soon as I was in my parent&#39;s drivway.  The lights in my parent&#39;s house came on and they came out onto the porch.  I stopped the car and ran as fast as I could into the house.  It took my parents a long while to calm me down.  My mother and I stayed up for a couple of hours and I finally felt I would be able to go to sleep.  I fell asleep on the couch in  the living room.  There were no electrical appliances or lights anywhere near the couch.  At approximately 4am I was literally shocked awake.  The hair on my arms stayed upright for all of the next day.  When the shock jolted me awake and I woke up I saw the light at the corner window of the living room as if it were looking in at me.  At first I was so scared tht I couldn&#39;t even get my vocal cords to work then I was screaming for all I was worth.  My parents ran into the room, turnng on lights as they made their way to the living room.  The light seemed to dissapate and disappear.  I stayed awake till it was daylight and as soon as it was morning left to return back to Norman.  I have never driven alone in that part of the county again at night and refuse to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At that night, I was restless and got out of bed.  I looked out of my hotel window for no given reason.  There was a bright red-orange-yellow sphere in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up at 10:50.  I was very restless and I got out of bed to get a drink of water.  After a quick bathroom break I walked over to the hotel window, and pulled the curtain aside.  Nothing was normal at first to me.  I remember noticing the object in the sky and quickly passing it off for a plane or something else.  After a while it dawned on me that the object in the sky was not moving and was a very unnatural color which kept changing from red to yellow to orange and back to red again.  I could not tell what the shape of the craft was because of the lights which were growing and shrinking in size.  I stared at this figure in the sky for a long time.  Suddenly, the light dissapeared completely from sight, leaving no trace of its existance.  When I looked at the clock again it was 11:12.  The strangest part of this experience was that when I stepped back into bed, even though I had just experienced a strange and even scarry sight, I felt very relaxed and happy, and fell back to sleep easily.<n>

I opened my left side window to watch as the UFO passed approximately 500 ft. underneath my plane (this distance is only an estimate on my part). I then banked the plane to the left so that I would not lose sight of the saucer as it when under the nose of my aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO continued on a straight and level path, and although my air speed was 110 m.p,h. the UFOs speed was such that there was no way I could catch up to it. If I had to approximate it&#39;s speed, I would guess at 400-600 m.p.h. The saucer never deviated from it&#39;s straight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the size of the UFO, I can&#39;t really say, since there was nothing that I could compare it to. But if I had to guess, I would say about 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It happened so quickly, but I did get a very good look at it. There were no windows or any markings on the UFO saucer. The colour was a dull silver, almost a grey colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I usually carry a camera in the side carrying pouch by the pilot&#39;s door. But this time, the camera was in a sports bag behind the rear passenger seat. There was no way of getting access to the camera. If I had a passenger with me that could have handed me the camera, I would have been able to get a very good picture with my 35mm camera! Now when I go flying, I always make sure that I have at least two cameras with me at all times.

There were dense woods all around us. It was very dark that night. We were standing outside of my pick up truck talking. My friend was leaning against the truck and I was facing her. From out of nowhere I saw this fireball appear over the tree tops and fall into the nearby woods. I screamed &#34;Holy ****!&#34; My friend turned around and caught a glimpse of it as well. It was really close. At first I thought it was a meteorite although it was the size of a medicine ball at least. Maybe slightly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later we both heard a rustling sound in the leaves and the breaking of twigs and branches. Something was moving through the woods towards us quickly. I immediatly felt very strong sense of danger and fear. It scared the hell out of us. We jumped in the truck and locked the doors and took off as fast I could.  I never spoke of this to anyone until recently when I realized that there was no way it could have been a meteorite. We never heard a crash or bang of the impact even though it went down so close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I never went back there again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It began on our way home from work, approximately 11:15-11:30. We noticed this bright object in the sky, looked much like Venus does, but for June 1987, Venus was in the W Elongation, what we saw was in the SouthWest sky(we were heading south)We were both just out of the AF after spending time in Europe. We were familiar with quite a few aircraft. This craft was much different though. We watched it as we drove home, we arrived at 11:40-11:50,we went inside and continued to watch it from a bedroom window, it appeared to be moving so we went back outside. It approached and went directly over our heads. Once it passed over, we realized that it was very quiet No dogs, no crickets  not a sound. This was in the country and there were always night noises....Not this time. As for the craft, it was boomerang shaped (Drawing on the way, in the mail)there were lights in the front and on the bottom, all different colors, the structure appeared to be a brushed chrome. The lights in the front were seperated to the point they almost looked like a car radiator. Judging size was quite difficult, but i know it was huge, it also looked close enough to hit with a stone, as it passed over, the lights on the rear appeared to pulsate, as smooth as a heartbeat, as one went off the other came on The craft itself was silent, not even the swishing of air, nothing. We called Wright Patt Air Base, which is about 18 miles north and they told us there was  nothing on their scopes, but if they heaard, they would call us back. Our no. at that time was 513-((number deleted)), for those of you who would like to check records<n>
6/15/87 20:00|Burlington|CT|Fireball|2 Hours|I remember it being in June of 1987 but the actual day is hard to remember.There is a stretch of road that runs through Burlington|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35290.html|16|ndxe198706| I remember it being in June of 1987 but the actual day is hard to remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a stretch of road that runs through Burlington Ct called rout 4. Located off this road and between Johnnycake Airport and the Burlington Trout Hatchery is a stretch of winding roads that takes you into the direction of Nepaug Reservoir. Along these roads which has zero street lights and is very wooded is a clearing that overlooks a small section of the reservoir. On this night my brother, his friend and myself were sitting on the hood of my car looking up at the night sky that was loaded with stars. I remember talking about the Challenger accident (6 months eariler) that for me was still fresh in my mind. My brothers friend was the first to notice a star like object crossing the night sky. Looking in the direction he was pointing I observed this object cross the entire sky within seconds as far as the eye could see than turn around to make a pass back in our direction. This happend 4 times in a matter of 1 minute. On what was to be its final pass we noticed in its path was a much larger object, the best way I can describe it to you is it looked like a circle formation of star like objects. As the moving craft reached this larger circle (maintaining its same observed speed) we thought it would continue going but when it reached the outer edge of this larger circle it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment we looked at each other amaized at what we had seen, and over to our left, above the water and small hilltops were these three(3) fire balls. The formation between these 3 fireballs and our location was a diamond. We looked at the objects for at least 30 minutes. Within this time frame each one moved very slowly, the one to our far left seemed to drift straight back and away from us than it was gone like it flipped off a switch. The object to our far right descended straight down behind the tree line. At that moment we noticed a small plane making its landing approach at the near by airfield, thats when I made the joakingly remark and said (pointing to the object dead ahead of us) &#34;Watch, I bet this one will bounce&#34; Just as I said it, the object started to bounce itself behind the small hilltop. These objects were at the same level as the small plane was at the time of its landing approach to the airfield. By this time we were speechless as to what we saw. At that moment we heard a noise that came from the very dark woods behind us that sounded as if something fell from the top of the trees and hit every branch on its way down. If you had a stop watch at that moment I think it would have been a new worlds record for getting into a car, locking the doors, turning the key and getting our asses outta there. We drove to Torrington Ct which is about a 30 minute drive, within 10 minutes of getting into town we saw another friend of my brothers, we told her what we had seen, drove her back up to the sight and each one of the fireballs were back in the exact place we saw them the first time. After a few minutes they each began to move again as they did before. We never looked up into the sky to see if the star formation was still there and whatever had made the noise that scared us outta there in the first place I guess was gone cause we didn&#39;t hear any noises again. The person we found to show her what we had seen had seen enough and wanted to go back after observing the objects for only about 15 ! minutes. Whatever we had seen that night, in the sky and over the reservoir were not low or high flying air planes except for the one noted. As far as what fell out of the tree, who knows, but I bet it hurt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Other days too but it seemed that those nights were the most active. The area of Vancouver Island viewed by us was very remote area of this Island. It was amazing.

I was twelve or thirteen (26 now) and my sister was eight or nine (22 now). My mother and her live-in boyfriend both worked third shift so they would leave the apartment at about 23:30 or so. They would leave the door locked, the living room light on and the TV going so people wouldn&#39;t try to bother us. I was awoken at probably around 00:00 or so for some reason. I didn&#39;t know why but it felt that I shouldn&#39;t be asleep. I kept having the feeling that something was outside or nearby that shouldn&#39;t be. I still fell asleep though. My sister came into my room at probably 01:00 or maybe later, but it was still nighttime and my mother still wasn&#39;t home. She said she was scared because she&#39;d seen grammy (our grandmother had died not very long before) and she said grammy had had big eyes and vampire teeth (just bear with me). I mumbled that she could sleep with me. Then, not too long after she woke me up again and she was crying now. She had supposedly seen a blue beam of light CREEP in through the window, touch the wall next to my bed, mere inches from us, then slowly ascend the wall. When it hit the thermostat it darted out of the room and she claimed to smell burning paper or wood. Despite wanting to know what happened and being scared, I fell back asleep. In the morning she told me grammy had come into my room and asked my sister to go with her. My sister asked: &#34;To heaven grammy?&#34; to which the apparition chuckled somewhat darkly and said: &#34;Not exactly.&#34; My sister couldn&#39;t remember anything after that until waking up. As I got older I began to become interested in many things, UFOs and the paranormal among the subjects and as I learned how many different ways aliens and supernatural forces come into contact with us, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if this wasn&#39;t some kind of alien contact. I have heard that many abductees recall seeing familiar images instead of Greys or aliens, but with big eyes i.e. owls and monkeys with big eyes. I just kind of figured I would submit the report despite it taking place years ago.<n>

They circled each other a few times.  After a while I became very tired and had to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I set my alarm on purpose to see if they came back, and was not disappointed, I observed 3 objects this time, 2 boomerang and one oval I was prepared this time with binoculars and a stand made out of LEGO to support it.  I watched the objects through an open windoe (without a screen)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the rest of the 2 weeks I observed the objects about 10 out of the 14 days.  I observed a pattern that seemed to support the idea that they were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area they were located in was beside a cliff that led to the Bow River, just down from a church.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the things I was able to observe between the objects was a sort of &#34;static electricity&#34; bolts as the objects came close together.

The state police of southbury said that people were not seeing a space ship and that they were seeing (6) army planes coming from new york  flying close together low to the ground and that they had their navigation lights on. THE STATE POLICE ARE LIARS!!! i saw this space ship on june 11 1987 right in front of my house!!  NOW!! what i saw was a space ship from another planet standind in mid air about a quarter mile away from me and maybe a 100 feet over the ground. i was soo scared!! it was about the size of a little league baseball feild. it was not moving,it was just standing there in the air motion less and no sound whats so ever. i could see it perfectly,i could see the shape of the craft perfectly. it was just like a typical flying saucer as if you put 2 dinner plates together. it was to my west. it had flourescent green and red lights!! there were 3 green flourescent lights that were rectangular just like windows but they were not blinking,they were lit up and i could also see rails inside the green windows,what i mean by rails i mean rails that you use to hold on to when you walk. there could have been more windows but i can only see 1 side of the space ship.the red lights i seen were also rectangular in shape under the green windows and they were moving. the red lights were in the center of the disk moving away from each other around the center of the ship and would meet exactlly where they met before. at this point i am completely confused and i thought i was dreaming. here i am standing in front of my hous! e along with my younger brother looking at a space ship from another planet. the space ship was in the air for over a half hour just lowering alttitude a millimeter every minute or two. we stood there and looked at it untill it finally landed behind the trees. i was outside for a good 2 hours but never saw the space ship again. it was still on the ground doing something,i dont know what. any way i&#39;m real scared!!! with a little help i can pin point this landing site and i think i can pin point the exact location of this landing site. before i finish this FACT of my close encounter i wanna say two things. first; still to this day i have not seen  any thing like i seen on the night of june 11 1987,not even on movies,not even on cartoons,not even on documentaries,photos,or any thing or those soo called bogus moments that people have video taped.i really do feel that if i had a picture camera or video camera that night of june 11 1987,it would have proved and scared the whole world!!    2nd;  i dont know what god is up to, i mean i dont know why he is sending aliens here to visit us.  i&#39;m real scared, it still makes me nervous and scared and my hair stand up when i think or talk about it, it&#39;s even making me scared right now re-reading my encounter. please, help mee, i just dont know what to think any more.     i really appreciate you for taking the time reading my close encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.

It was so large that we could not see the lights around the back side. It was huge. It dwarfed the size of a high school track and football field complex. We stood almost right under it. The people there getting gas and the clerk inside told us that they see these large craft quite often and they said that the craft were US equipment and that it is no big deal. We watched it move from it&#39;s stationary position upward for quite a ways up. Then it tilted upward to our right and flew away very fast and out of sight in seconds. The craft made no sound and no exhaust seemed present to us. It was so great to just stand and watch.

Observed a light we thougt was a person with a flashlight.we noticed that this object was above treeline. no noise, object moved rapidly side to side up &amp; down. Watched for 2+ hrs. Object left area slowly and faded to dim object then moved more rapidly after dimming. It was like watching someone swirling a cigaret in the dark, only very,very bright. I never reported this because I figured it would be by the rangers. It was fun and awesome to watch, I&#39;d love to see one again. I tried to see if I could get it to come closer by signaling with a flashlight. Maybe I was being foolish, but if it wasn&#34;t from here I really wanted make contact. Am I nuts or is this normal? Please contact me<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of June 6, 1987. I was about three miles outside of the Jackson Lake Lodge resort area, where I had worked. There were four of us hanging out at a foot bridge having a few beers and counting stars, when we saw what we thought was someone walking down a trail with a very bright flashlight. It was swaying back and forth and kind of bobbing up and down. Sort of like a flashlight would if someone was walking with one. I then noticed that the shadow of the tree-line was below the light. I told everyone to watch it and to confirm that I was correct about the light being above the trees. It was very quiet that night. Around there you can hear a car from over five miles away. There was no sound coming from whatever it was we were watching. The more we watched the more we realized that this object looked like a star. I flashed my flash-light at the light hoping (out loud) that I would get a response. I did not get one, I wish I had. I was becoming excited, because it was thrilling to see. The two college age women who were with us became scared, and wanted to go back to the workers dorms. When we returned to the dorms, the light was still in the sky. I pointed it out to two Park rangers and a security officer. I asked them what the saw, and they said a star. I told them to watch it for a while. The security officer and Rangers pretty much &#34;freaked&#34; than almost simultaneously announced that it was moving. It was about that time that the two young women came back with a couple of the wranglers to show them the light. Other employees from the Lodge  statred to come over to us to see what it was we were looking at. some lodgers came up to the Rangers to ask what the light was. A small crowd had gathered and we all watched the light together until a little after midnight. It was about that time that the light steadied and started moving in a north-eastern direction and began to dim. We watched until the light began to move only slightly ( or so it seemed) faster and finally blende in with the numerous ! others s tars in that wonderful night sky.<n>

Between 10 and 10:30 p.m., I stepped outside of our tipi and approached a friend of my father&#39;s to chat.  Suddenly, I spotted off toward the east a large blue light that hovered still for a few minutes not moving.  Before I knew what had happened, I saw it drop like a stone to the earth in a straight downward motion.  There was no accompanying sound.  Afterwards, I asked my father&#39;s friend if he had seen what I&#39;d seen, and he said that he had but didn&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was only 13 years old at the time and when I mentioned it to my science teacher he said it was possible that it could have been a meteor. I just was scared and excited at the same time.

When the flash went off 4 red lights flashed on at the bottom and the craft was quite large-instead of going away from us it came toward us and I shot many pictures of the underneath side of the craft the red lights blinked in a succession of first , third, second, forth. The underneath was like a large configuration of computer chips with no empty space except for the lights, the bottom was covered by a screening.  I could see these things in the sky because the oval lights would make you thin they were twinkling stars at a distance.

The lights were traveling very slow it appeared to be  very large and was heading directly toward where we were parked.  My wife jumped back into the car, eventually it was close enough I could tell it was the length of two football fields, and had 12 windows and had 4 layers,and was lit up like florescent lights. It looked like as if you were looking down a hallway but no one was in it roughly moving about 6 miles an hour and didn&#39;t pay no mind to us on the side of the road.

I ran to get my husband which had just pulled into the drive. I pointed at the object and asked him if he saw what I saw. He said yes. We watched the object go from the size of a basketball to a point of light in seconds. I trully wish I knew what happened to me.

I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My roommate and I were on my our to work one morning.  I can only estimate that it was in the mid to late 1980&#39;s since this happened so long ago.  There was a full moon setting as the sun was rising.  While stopped at a red light I commented to my roommate that the moon appeared to have a &#34;crack&#34; cut out in the bottom of the moon.  Since the moon was nearing the horizon, I assumed that the visual appearance was caused by a telephone pole or something that we could not see.  After the street light turned green we continued on our way and I really did not think about it untill a couple of minutes later I glanced over and saw that the crack was still there, only bigger now, about 1/4 across the diameter of the moon.  This time I was driving and the horizon was moving along but the notch remained.  We kept watching as we were driving and could see the crack growing.  We really did not know what was happening and thought the moon was splitting in two before our very eyes.  We pulled over in a spot where we had a good view and watched to see what was happening.  (We figured if the moon was really breaking up, why bother going to work because we were probably all going to die?)  We watched as the crack literally went all the way to the top of the moon and gave the appearance of a moon spit into two halves!  We sat waiting for the earth to be destroyed or something, but then the &#34;crack&#34; drifted to the right of the moon and off of the surface entirely after about 10 minutes.  When we got to work and explained why we were late, everyone thought we were crazy of course except for one other guy who also saw the event.  I called the newspaper and TV stations but they thought I was crazy too.  The only explanation I can imagine is that somewhere on the earths surface, a rocket was being launched into space and the exhaust trail cast a shadow on the moon.  Is this possible?  Or do you have any other similar repor! ts as th is in your database?  I know the moon did not split in half that day, but I am not making up what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was probably about 15 feet above us in the trees. The front of it was domed shaped all clear, inside were to men with masks that had long tubes hanging in front of them. Their faces were un-identifiable due to the dark masks.  The &#34;men&#34; were staring at us and spoke to us but it was very muffled so we couldn&#39;t understand them.

In the sky, approx 60 degrees in front of me (and a crowd of non believers it seed at the time, I stood transfixed to a point in the sky.  An unusual line of 4 stars appeared.  They did not twinkle or move, but they were equidistant.  After a number of minutes these objects begand to move very slowly.  First one object moved from the right to the far left, passing each light in sequence then stoped.  Then another did the same.  This continued for a period of about two to three minutes before they all started to move being joined by further lights all on the same trajectory moving quicker by the minute.  Eventually a number of lights approx 8 to 10 moved back and forth until at what I can onlt describe as light speed (sorry) they shot off in different directions.  A collegue of mine, a lady, locked herself in her car and refused to come out!  This was witnessed by at least a dozen people.  None of which were aware that either of us were looking at the same thing until it ended.  Time did seem to pause for at least 2 hours.  Sounds silly I know but...it happened!  THe second episode was many years later between Christmas and New Year. I was walking through the towns car park on a clear night.  I was aware that there was something amiss above me.  To give a full description of the scene, I was in a built up area with mainly single storey buildings around.  As if a fog filled the sky, an object dusky grey in colour moved almost motionless over head.  This seemed to be, not necessary delta shaped, but simlar, with pale amber lights on each wing.  It took the size of this object to be the size of two large football pitches!  Then without sound one wing overlapped the other and the thing disappeared and the night sky was clear once more.  Where the Heck did it go!!!!  Unfortunately, I had my dog with me at the time so no witness to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above are true accounts and believe me, although not frightening to me, would have been to most persons.

I just assumed that is what a satellite looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, all of a sudden, after about 10 seconds of me observing it moving past the stars (from my perspective), it sped up to a tremendous speed but in a zigzag fashion.  It took very sharp turns at quite sharp angles, probably three or four times, each time over distances that equalled the distance of its initial slow straight line journey that I first observed.  It then disappeared into the stars.  It appeared to have travelled huge distances at great speeds and completed fantastical sharp turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone until years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

6/1/87 01:00|Atlantic Ocean (Bermuda Triangle)||Light|20 seconds|About halfway between British Virgin Islands and North Carolina, on sailing vessels, at night, star size light zigzagging at great spee|3/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117415.html|47|ndxe198706| A bright light came through the ceiling and paralyzed me and my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 20 years ago, I was 16 years old and spending the night with my best friend.  As we were laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep, A bright white light came through the ceiling and landed upon us.  We were both immediately paralyzed and filled with a sensation of peace and happiness, a feeling well beyond anything from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It filled us and the room for approx. 15 seconds before leaving through the ceiling.  After we were able to move, I asked him if he seen and felt &#34;that&#34; and he said that he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought at the time that we had received the &#34;holy ghost&#34;.  Now, I have almost convinced myself that the light that came through the ceiling might have came from some form of Alien Contact opposed to the &#34;holy ghost&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone out their can help me better understand what happened that night I would greatly appreciated it.  That night has deeply troubled me for many years and now I owe it to myself to seek some help and understanding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My email address is ((deleted)).<n> <n><n> Thank You<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We had a big window where we could see the sky easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half mile from our house was the Ramblewood Country Club.  A very large golf course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both looking out the window when a bright light moved straight up from the trees from the direction of the golf course and just stopped dead in the sky.  It just sat there glowing white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in a blink of an eye it shot off to the right so fast it made a streak of light behind it and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw it and ran into our parents room scared to death.<n>

I ASKED HER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, SHOWN HER ANIMAL BOOKS,AND TRIED TO GET A PICTURE IN MY MIND OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. SHE DOESN&#39;T REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AS SHE WAS REAL SCARED AT THAT TIME AS SHE HAS TOLD ME.SHE DOES REMEMBER THAT THE BEING WAS AS TALL AS SHE, AND SHE WAS 5 YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME, AND THAT IT SCARED HER. SHE DID SAY THAT IT WAS ON TWO LEGS NOT FOUR AND DID&#39;NT LOOK LIKE ANY ANIMAL. NOW I KNOW SHE WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME BUT I DO BELEIVE HER.
