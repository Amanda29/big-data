This occurred 2 times within approximately one minute. The flashes were orange in color and then seemed to change over to a pale green color as they faded out in the sky. There was significant cloud cover that night I remember correctly and the movement of the these lights were a bit choppy because of the cloud interference.<n>

This object travled from east to west down the middle of the valley. It was at about 500 ft. and just glided silentle by. It had no wings, tail, exaust, etc. It was only about the size of a jet fighter and was traveling at about the same speed those planes cruz at.It was also very smooth looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see preceding report from Alameda, CA.

It flies over Dublin every morning and I see it at 7:40 am from the BART station.  In my first reporting of the object, it was flying much lower, and much slower.  I reported my sighting here, and to the local FAA office at the Livermore Airport.  Is it coincidental that the object now passes overhead at a much higher altitude so that it will go largely unobserved?  It appears to be white, cigar-shaped, with no wings, no sound, no windows, nor anything that would make it resemble a known object.  It flies from the southwest to the northeast or east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the reported object is, but there may be conventional aircraft, e.g. blimps, military a/c, etc., that may be the cause.  We do not understand how an object can apparently be so prominent, and be reported by one source, but this paucity of reports to overt events is not unheard of in the UFO field.  Please see next report from Lucerne Valley, CA.  PD))<n>

I noticed a red glow out of my passenger window.  We were a little bit out of Cloudcroft, NM and it was about 11:00 pm.  There was a red glow that appeared to coming from behind a mountain and covered a good portion of the sky.  I kind of looked like there was a big forest fire.  We pulled over once then drove a little more to get a better view and pulled over again.  The red was more intense in one area and seemed to lighten out, the further it went out to the edges.  There were also white beams of light the shot very high into the sky, almost to the point where they were over my head.  They beams were not extremely bright but stretched a ways into the sky.  There was also a time where there was 3 or 4 beams and then to the right of these, a could more appeared.  They just started appearing in succession from left to right. Every once in a while they would fade away they in a while they would come back again.  They never moved across the sky though, they would appear in different places but they were always stationary.  Another weird thing was that when their were about 4 or so in a row, they were all space the same distane apart.  Then after a little while, the red was gone but the beams of light were still there.  There were two other cars pulled over at the same spot that we were but I didn&#39;t talk to them so I don&#39;t know if they were looking at the light or not.  But we couldn&#39;t have been the only ones to see this, it was hard to miss if you just looked in that direction at the sky.  There are nothing but a few very small towns in that area, and I have never seen any type of spot light that can make a beam of light like the ones that we saw  It is the wierdest thing that I have ever seen.  I regret that we had no video camera or anything with us.  Well, I guess that is it, it happened about 4 hours ago, and I had to document it somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this phenomenon from Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Arizona, and Texas.

3/30/01 22:00|Nipomo|CA||Unspecified|Red "glow" seen in clear night sky|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17103.html|8|ndxe200103| Red &#34;glow&#34; seen in clear night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have twice reported, on previous occasions, strange sightings I have personally witnessed.  I am a bit hesitant to keep reporting things for fear that I may be taken as one who &#34;jumps to conclusions.&#34;  I have seen several strange phenomena since my last formal report, but as mentioned above, I have been leary to report them yet again.  This all being said, I was scanning through the data base for this month to see if anyone witnessed a similar event to what my husband and I both saw when I came upon several reports from the same day that sounded too intriguing.  I feel that I must now break my silence and report what I saw... March 30th, approximately 1030 p.m... TOWN/AREA PROFILE:  I live approximately 4-5 miles southeast of the Pacific ocean in a small town.  Our town is relatively unpopulated in some areas, including where I walk my dog at night.  There are no overly bright lights on our street, the houses around our development or within the surrounding area.  I have never noticed any red outdoor lighting before. WEATHER CONDITIONS: We can usually see the entire night sky (stars, etc.) unless their is fog.  There was no fog this night.  It was about 50 degrees out. REPORT:  I had just leashed-up my dog and headed out our back door to take her for her nightly walk around the neighborhood when I noticed a very strange &#34;glow&#34; of red in the night sky.  This &#34;glow&#34; was pure red and looked somewhat like what was described in the movie &#34;A Fire in the Sky.&#34;  I know that sounds silly, but the glow spanned for quite a distance on the horizon.  Its strength and color intrigued me.  It appeared to move somewhat, but was mainly stationary.  There were many dogs howling/barking within the neighborhood at the time.  The &#34;glow&#34; lasted an unspecifed length of time.  I know that it was there at least through when my husband got back from walking the dog.  -I decided not to walk the dog after I saw the glow!   I repeat..this was NOT caused by any outdoor lighting and there was NO fog that a light could cast a reflective quality upon. WITNESS DATA:  My husband and I both witnessed the phenomenon.  He is usually not &#34;spooked&#34; by anything; even he, though, said that he thought that the event was weird and that the dogs barking in the area was strange.  We are both college-educated professionals.  I am 29 and my husband is 30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A major coronal mass ejection from the Sun was predicted to strike the earth&#39;s magnetic field on this date.  NUFORC received reports from Utah, Oregon, California, Texas, and New Mexico on the same night.  Everyone reported a peculiar red glow.  We suspect the witness describes the same phenomenon, which we believe was an unusual aurora.  It was unusual, in that it was red, and unusual in that it was seen at latitudes that are much farther south than where the aurora traditionally is seen from.  PD))<n>

When we looked up in the sky there was an apparent group of 3 hovering red lights in the sky.  They seemed to hold an apparent triad shaped formation and they just hovered and occasionall one would blink bright white a total of 2 or three times and then another would almost appear to answer.  This was not far from the capitol building in Madison.  Many others had witnessed this.  We watched for a bit and drove off and they remained in sight for quite some time.  I hope others who saw this will write their accounts as well.  I have never heard of a fighter plane that could hover in the same place, I have never seen an object in the sky brighten as if flashing its lights to signal to another.  Could this be some kind of lazer light show hoax?  Maybe but highly unlikely!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other recent reports from southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois, for the last month, or so.  PD))<n>
3/30/01 21:30|Disputanta|VA|Diamond|15 min|Multitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky.|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17100.html|11|ndxe200103| Multitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday evening, March 31, 2001,  ((sic. Date os sighting was 30MR01.  PD)) I was working at my PC. The window was cracked open and I heard an approaching car and looked out the window to see if someone was coming down our driveway. We have a gravel driveway that leads to a country road. The driveway is approx 1/4 mile long. It was about 9:20 p.m. or so...I was not aware of the time at that point. As I looked out the window and saw the car was headed to another house by the main road, I noticed lights in the sky. They appeared to be those of a plane initially, but there was NO noise at any time! There were yellow lights and red lights and I was startled because it seemed to be flying at a very low altitude. It appeared to be coming head on rather than across the sky. It was located on the other side of the road, off the road, back towards the woods, near the tree tops. I understand that they were coming from the East. I continued to watch and then called my husband as I left the office to go outside for a better view. I couldn&#39;t get the words out because I had to sneeze and by the time my husband got to the front porch it had disappeared. I told him to wait as I was going to get the video camera as I felt &#34;something was very different about this plane and it would be back.&#34;  Only a few minutes passed and I returned to the front porch and I would guess it was around 9:25 or so. The rest is recorded on the video tape. I would say that in retrospect, that the so called quick movements made by the aircraft as perceived by me, probably resulted from my zooming in and out. I used the night vision mode. The camera is a Sony Digital 8 , Model DCR-TRV310.  There is quite a bit of air traffic in this area, BUT we can hear the planes without any difficulty whatsoever. That is what is very odd about this, unless the objects were so far away that we couldn&#39;t hear them. It was cloudy that evening and you could not see the stars with the exception of the one I recorded close to the moon. I am assuming that was a star. The &#34;planes&#34; seemed to appear from the woods in the East. At the beginning of the video there are two...which my husband  reasons are planes. They are traveling at different altitudes from south to north the best I can tell. My last shot of the event films an object going the other way, from north to south, back towards the woods.  (To be continued)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part II of report After reviewing the video several times in different modes, I might accept someone telling me that these are planes. But in order to do that, I want to video tape again, during the evening on a clear night and compare the two.  I find it very difficult however, for anyone to come up with any explanation for the visual display of rapid-fire light activity (similar to a seventies psychedelic rock concert) in such a small airspace. I find it difficult to believe that FAA would allow planes to fly so close to the ground and/or allow the number of planes (as represented by the flashing lights) we saw in such close proximity to one another. To take this further, IF you view the tape in frame by fame mode, you can actually see the smaller objects moving from one point to another, at such a speed and in directions that defy what I, with no knowledge of physics, know as possible. It is difficult to see initially, but the parts are noted with my commentary (which I hope you will ignore!) about &#34;twinkle, twinkle little stars&#34; and then later, with &#34;they are like mosquitoes.&#34;  There are frame views of the objects that show two round lights and also parts that show how the objects appear to be turning 360 degrees on an imaginary axis, then close up (like a clam) and move. On the frame by frame close ups, they look like a diamond shaped object. In one of the views , unless this is all my imagination or camera foolery, the object looks like it rotates, gets very dark on one side with a finite line showing a very dark underside and starts to collapse before heading to another location. Today I shot some more video of the area in daylight. Hopefully that may help in orientation of the landscape. Perhaps I am making more of this that what is actually there. But it is something I have never seen before. Also, I guess it could be tricks played by the camera and the way it films light? I have no idea. Would appreciate hearing what you think after viewing the copy of the tape.  Rather than emitting objects, which I did not see, I felt by movements that this was some type of exercise or manuevers and the object went back (not all) into another object? I know....CRAZY! End of Report<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received the lengthy video tape on 16AP01, and we have looked at it several times.  We agree with the witness that the lights &#34;strobe,&#34; and we agree that they move in the night sky.  However, although we cannot be certain yet, our suspicion is that she may have been video taping aircraft in the distance.  We will investigate a bit more, but the strobing patterns are not inconsistent with aircraft, or perhaps helicopters.  PD))<n>

I had to run to our new place to take a few things over while she and my daughter atayed home. I was taking in the woods around us and looking at the field across the road. I heard a sound which was soft and different from other noises which a person would hear in this area. The sound seem to increase slowly and I was trying to see where it would be coming from and light appeared from no where. I was wondering if it was a air craft of some kind searching with a spotlight. When the sound was over head I seen these two shape triangle shape images or craft whichever it should be moving very slow. I was alarmed and there was no phone to call anyone because our new phone wasn&#39;t hooked up yet. Well, I was afraid and did not know what to do. Go to the car and get out of the area ? well I went inside on the trailer and watch there where color lights also red, light blue and a off white dusty light which was scanning the ground across the road. It seemed forever but as soon as they started to desend they quickly went. It looked like a burst of energy but the sound was soft but a tone louder. I did not report it to any offical because of being made a fool out of. I do not drink, I do not do drugs and do not smoke. I know what I saw and that will never leave me.<n>

I had gone to the phone @ a convienence store and while on the phone to a friend, I was looking to the N.W. when I noticed four red light&#39;s in the sky, they were pulsing and moving toward&#39;s me and stopped above Nellis Air Stip, then the one on the right left the staggered line formation and dipped down below the others,( the centers were white but the pulses were red flashes ), and strobed brighter than the other&#39;s as it manuvered around below the others from right to left, then it hovered for a few second&#39;s flashing brighter in intensity then proceded on its course to my left and circled around back up to the others and they all proceded to move away to the N.W.N then northerly and out of sight. These red lights were not like a planes red light because they were at least 10 times brighter and the one that was manuvering around was at least 20 times brighter because I could compare them to planes in the sky above L.V., and I didn&#39;t notice any sound coming from the direction of the objects, then all of a sudden Nellis A.F.B. came alive with sound, jet engines roar filled the air and it was constant, then planes started taking off one after the other, I counted between 10 and 12 in the first wave and they climbed upward fast to about 12,000 to 15,000 feet and leveled off and they proceded toward the direction the UFO&#39;s had gone. The first wave made a scurmish line roughly five miles long from left to right above the mountain range of the Nellis test site range and they seemed to me to be hearding or escorting the objects out of the area and it seemed also that they were looking for them and blocking them from the test site area. While the first wave was busy several more waves of planes took off in groupes of 4 and 6 and this lasted for a good 10 minutes and I stsrted to loose count but I estimated between 30 and 40 planes had taken off in that time and the last wave of planes to take off were the big airliner size and I counted 5 of th! em and a t this time I noticed another large plane coming in to nellis from the east at about 15,000 feet and it eventually headed off to the N.W. also but was just above the flight path of the fighters that were taking off. I continued to watch the planes that were still flying around above the test range to the north of me and all of a sudden out of thin air amist planes there appeared a white orange light object and the planes in the immediate area changed there courses toward the object and then it flashed a bright orange and winked out and re-appeared in a new place in the sky in the same area and all the planes changed there courses again and the object winked out again and re-appeared in another spot like it was playing its version of cat and mouse and it did this atleast four times that I saw &#39;cause I grabbed my binocularsto see if I could Identify these Objects for myself then it winked out brightly one last time and was gone and the planes cicled around for a few more seconds and then headed north. This second sighting occured @ about 8:45pm p.s.t. I watched for another 15 minutes then went to the phone to report the sighting I had just witnessedfirst hand. After talking to Mr. Davenport I was a little taken aback by his disbelief as to the number of planes I witnessed taking off from N.A.F.B., it was as though he thought the number of planes was excessive, but he wasn&#39;t here and I was, so after I hung up with Mr. Davenport I went staight home,for I was about 45 seconds from home and started to write down what I saw as per Mr. davenport&#39;s instruction&#39;s and then I heard the plkanes coming back in to land, so I stopped writing and went outside and started counting the number of planes that were coming into land and I counted &#34;38&#34; fighter&#39;s and &#34;6&#34; big airliner size type military planes and with my binoculars I was able to distinguish &#34;9&#34; different types of planes of the fighter&#39;s and big planes and they kept coming in until 10:35pm (pst) and the big planes landed last and one was a propeller type and they! finishe d landing by 11pm and I finished this report at 11:42pm (pst).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report is anonymous, but apparently is the same person who telephoned our hotline about this alleged event.  We have no other reports of &#34;30-40&#34; planes taking off from Nellis.  Upon reflection, we suspect that few military air bases have 30-40 military aircraft, and the necessary crew members and necessary ground personnel, to get that many aircraft in the air on short notice, and in a very short period of time.  Moreover, the air traffic control problem, it seems to us, would be significant.  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged incident, we would be grateful for additional reports.

She said &#34;Dad what is that? It&#39;s really shiny.&#34; I looked and couldn&#39;t see it at first, but she continued to talk about it and soon after I spotted it too. I pulled the car over and got a very good look at it. The object was square in shape from a frontal view, but thin from a side view. The front of the object, while square, contained 4 circular shapes within it (like 4 dinner plates placed side by side, two across, two down, to fill the square.)The front was &#34;chrome-like&#34; and extremely shiny. The back side of the object was black &amp; flat with no other markings. The object was on end and slowly spinning horizontally, so that to look at it while spinning was to see the shiny side of the square, then the thin, then the black side, and so on; a pattern of thick &amp; thins. While spinning, the object traveled North towards downtown, then made a turn to head West near Busch Creek. A guess to it&#39;s speed may be about a varying 10-25 miles an hour. A guess to it&#39;s height from the ground would be approx. 100-150 feet. The overall size estimate would be 5+ feet with the thinner side maybe 1 foot thick. We watched the object as it changed course and even tried to follow it, but it soon vanished from our sight due to obstacles. I am anxiously awaiting an explaination of what we saw. I am not the type who even proposes this could be a UFO. I feel that I am a well grounded person as well as local business owner and would much prefer an explaination of this, than none... but I still cannot explain what my daughter &amp; I saw. My wife had each of us draw on paper what we saw &amp; they matched exactly. I would not have reported this, but my wife insisted, since afterall, it happened right in the middle of town during daylight hours around 3:30 in the afternoon. Is there anyone out there in Washington that saw this too? Please report to this site if so.<n>

The two lights were moving from east to west and were moving very slowly.  The lights moved in a very exacting detial as if they were connected to each other, which would make it a extremely big object if we could have seen the super structure.  These object made no sound on its pass.  This was observed at the Deseret Ranch just east of the Orlando International Airport.  There are usually alot of plane traffic in this area.  But these objects did not display the standard navigation lights observed on airplane traffic and were flying to low for normal approach to the airport. 20 mins later observed a small airplane in the same general area but higher in altitude and you could clearly here the engines of this aircraft. We work at a Central Office communications site in which the company rents the land from the Deseret Ranch owned by the Mormon church.<n>

I just came out of my office and spotted them in the distance...then called my husband to look.  This time they were more in line rather than a triangle at first.  They hovered or moved very slowly...turned slightly and faded out into the distance over the Plomosa Mountain range. I rushed back into the office and got my 7x50s and 20x50s binoculars to watch them with. Again these were extremely bright pulsating amber lights with on other color lights. After they first disappeared, I watched the mountain tops for any &#34;glow&#34; or trace of them if they reappeared.  They did briefly and were abit fainter as if further away...this time as an elongated triangle.  My husband got out his video camera hoping to catch them on film but was not able to. The event lasted roughly 15 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Same witnesses as on 28MR01 in the same town.  Good witnesses.  PD))<n>

I&#39;m sitting here talking to my friends, yaddy yaddy ya, you know havin a good time.  All of a sudden, I feel a sudden vibrant movement of the house, I don&#39;t hesitate to think what the hell is going on, I quickly dart for the window, and right when I look out, to my own suprise, I see this triangular-shaped object just traveling in a straight line in what looked like 150 mph. This triangular object also had lights on the bottom of it. and red lights in the back of it. It wasn&#39;t flat, it was 3-demensional. It made a huge roaring noise. Right when I lossed sight of it, I could still see it, hovering, just sitting in mid air, all I could see at this time were the lights though. And all of a sudden, it vanished, and that was the last I have seen it. This is definetly no plane, helicopter, military base test flight, or anything else normal. It is the wierdest thing I have ever seen in my life and I&#39;m still shocked over it. I think this is something that definetly needs to be reasearched or investigated.<n>

I had let my beagle out in the back yard to go to the bathroom. It was cold so I closed the sliding glass door and cupped my hands and put my face againest the glass so I could see her in the yard.  It was dark, no moonlight,just a stray of light from the street lights from the front of the house.  I lost site of the dog and was straining to see when a hot white vertical column of light shone down into the yard over our two empty garden spots. The light shone in a very angular way.  First more square and then it elongated as it moved towards me and the house. So now it looks like a wall of white light as it expands towards me, almost like a door sliding open, and then it stops about 15 feet from the house and the back or the light moves forward and it becomes a column of light again, and then it is gone.  This all happened in 1-3 seconds.  My dog did not react to the light-I don&#39;t know if she saw it. The light was intensely white but did not shine outside it&#39;s boundaries and was as tall has I could see. You could not see through it. It moved very quickly and was gone.  Afterwards, as I tried to make it all logical, I thought it must be the coast guard helicopter. But as I slid open the door and stepped out to look up -I realized at the same time that I heard not a sound from anything. Not a copter, not a plane. It immediately frightend me and I stepped back in the house. But I was still trying to work it out.  I knew that a street light on the street behind us shone on and off every half a minute or so. I waited for it to come on and could not get the same effect-- I fogged up the glass door-several times- could not get the same effect when the street light came on. After this I woke my husband up and told him what had happened because it was so surreal. I never did see or try to see a craft after I became frightened.<n>

This range is about 10-12 miles from us and is between us and Quartzsite, AZ/Blythe, CA.   We had been notified earlier by a friend who saw similar lights earlier that night over Parker AZ (33 miles West of us bordering the Colorado River).  My husband saw more bright lights over the Butler Valley in the NE that were just a bright.  But I did not see these. I went out with my 7x50 binoculars and 20x50 binoculars to watch the triangular formation of extremely bright amber lights.  They just hovered there keeping a constant triangle formation and at one point, turned slightly.  Then they slowly disappeared over the Plomosa mountain range.  But I could see the glow from them rising above the mountain tops and waited just encase they reappeared.  They did in the same formation and just as bright.  Then after a few minutes, turned and slowly faded away.  I kept a watch with my 20x50 binoculars and you could see these did pulsate a very bright amber light...much brighter than anything I have seen before in this area.  There were no other colored lights on these things that I could see as you would see on an airplane while veiwing them through the binoculars.  They did not &#34;wink&#34; out but faded out and kept station in relation to each other all the while.  My husband also saw the glow when these lights first went down over the Plomosa range and saw the glow as well.  Then witnessed the reappearance. In all, the event lasted about 15 to 20 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  These witnesses are well known to us, and they have reported several such incidents in their area.

It also changed color from an orangish yellow to a bright red.  The end of it looked like it had a flame-like tail.  We lost it behind some trees on the horizon.

They were in formation, and totally silent, but changed positions and were casting their own individual light (self illuminated). They were not in any spotlight or hotel light beam. I was able to record the event with my VHS camcorder and have a copy of the film with the objects. They disappeared when they passed over the adjacent hotel. I have provided a report and a copy of my film over 1 year ago to the Las Vegas local MUFON chapter. A Ms. Nancy Smoot (MUFON) has contacted me but is baffled by the objects on the film.

3/27/01 21:30|Phoenix|AZ|Light|90 seconds|Small yellow light following jetliner|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17013.html|33|ndxe200103| Small yellow light following jetliner<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is in north central Phoenix, along the approach pattern for aircraft landing at the local airport. (sky harbor) I am familiar with most types of aircraft (civilian and military) and can usually identify them quickly, due to their low altitude. (about 5000 feet)  Most of the aircraft are Boeing 737&#39;s, moving from due east to due west flying the approach to Sky Harbor, though there are a few Air Bus 300&#39;s, Boeing 757&#39;s, and MD-80&#39;s. On Tuesday evening (3/27/01) at about 9:30 pm I was standing in my backyard. There were a few aircraft in the approach pattern, I would say one every 3 to 5 minutes. As I looked to the south I noticed an aircraft (looked like a Boeing 757) moving from south west, to northeast, passing just east of my position. I then noticed a very small, dim yellow light which seemed to be following the 757 about one and a half plane lengths behind. As the jet got closer (to me) the light began a slow arc to the northwest, executing a turn of roughly 90 degrees. If I had to estimate the size of the light, I would say it was less than 10 feet in diameter, based on its proximity to the aircraft. The strangest thing of all was the way in which the light moved. It was like a fish swimming. It continued on a northwest course and just &#34;blinked out&#34; after about 10 seconds<n>

A glowing ball of light travelling in the air when I was on the road driving towards Delhi from Punjab state near Ambala city. The ball was moving with a high speed and then light goes off. After sometime glowing ball appeared again at a far distance in opposite direction of its previous path. After travelling in the air for sometime glowing ball changed its color from white to red. After that I saw 6 or 7 Indian air force jets chasing glowing ball at high speeds. It gives a clear indication that Indian army knows what happening out there. I&#39;ve seen these glowing ball photos on the internet UFO websites. I know that they of alien nature.<n>

Then I thought it might be a paracheute man trying to land. But then it drifted a bit higher up. It was long and thin shapped like a rectangle parachute. After a few minutes of hovering in one spot , it moved upwards ito the distance. The fact that it went upwards outruled that it was a parachute .<n>

I couldn&#39;t tell what the object itself was, but whatever it was, it had a bright, intense, GREEN flame following it.  There was abosolutely no noise, it didn&#39;t crash anywhere, so it must have just kept on going beyond my sight.  The sky was clear, and nothing I&#39;ve ever seen fly through the sky has ever looked like that under any circumstances.  I contacted the local airport control tower to double check their radars, but they didn&#39;t return any information on the subject.<n>

Soon after, I spotted the same flashes but they were of green color.  Once again, we concluded they were transformers blowing up.  However, when we watched the 10 o&#39;clock news that evening they showed on Channel 11 (Fox Network) Coast Guard boats and police cruisers searching the beach since the event had been  spotted from San Diego to Santa Barbara and it centered in Long Beach.  The authorities believed it was probably a mid-air collission of some sort but nothing further has been heard.  My friend and I strongly believed to be a UFO of some sort cruising in the Southern California Area that either crashed or was just making another spectacle of lights in the sky.<n>

One of my kids finally asked me what is that.  The only thing I could think of was that maybe they had put up some kind of tower because I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  We continued to watch it just sitting there and then it began to move very slowly across the main roadway to the other side and began to hover again.  As we got closer to where it was we looked up at it and noticed a strange triangular shape with a redish light in the bottom of the center of it.  It began moving again very slowly and then turned and moved back across the main roadway toward the side we had first seen it then it suddenly just disappeared.  We turned around to go see if we could see where it went to thinking maybe it went down below the tree line but it was gone.  Then as we approached near the hospital we looked over in the field and saw the two bright lights hovering there again.  As we observed it began to move slowly away again and looked like it was moving downward then it suddenly dissapeared again.  We rode around near both places we had seen it and could not find it anymore.  We never heard any type of sound coming from it.<n>

I guess I scrwed up the last time I tried to send this 3 days after sighting happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was driving North bound on I-15 with girl friend on the way to Vegas, about 5 miles past the Silverwood Lake turn off and about one and a half miles befor Oak hill RD. exit at the top of grade. Was only doing 55 mph. because this is the steepest part of that strech of Fwy. All of a sudden, droping out below  the celing(appx. 6000 ft. that nite) from the north was a dull orange glowing ball of light that lit up the clouds as it passsed through them. Allmost at the same time we see a bright blue pinpoint of light come UP from the west and in a zig zag manner head for the orange ball that now had become brighter. The blue pinpoint then wildly flew around the bigger orange ball that was getting closer to us so that we could see somr kind of structur to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in a big blue orange flash thay joined together into a bright multi colored ball of light that lasted only a few seconds and then thay separated again. At this time this is all happening right above us less than 1500ft. away just below the clouds that would light up with the bigger flashes. Awsum huh? Any way the blue pinpoint slowly started back the way it came only this time flying straght and true and did a slow fade away/out right befor our eyes! At this time the other thing was getting brighter and brighter and brighter and small thin orange thread like stuff was hanging from the bottom of it and then the F--king thing disapeared! I guess you guys call it a &#34;blink out&#34; well anyway it was gone and we were both left with our mouth&#39;s hanging open wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been to many air shows and we&#39;ve seen lots of different aircraft flying around the local mountains and deserts while camping and four wheeling and never seen anything like this befor. I am shure other cars and trucks saw what we saw because 4259ft. is the summit at Cajon Pass and that dont leave much room below the clouds and above the ground. The whole thing lasted about 35 to 45 seconds. I will never forget this ever and dont think she will to soon also. This event occured at appx. same time that reports of two planes crashing off Long Beach harbor that same nite on Fox news 11 that my neighbor told me about on my return from Vegas on Wed. 3/28/01<n>

The trailing light moved closer to the leading one at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two lights flying in unison that were star like but duller than a star. They seemed to be at a very high altitude. They were traveling in a northwest to southeast direction. I thought it was one object with two lights until the trailing one moved closer as if catching up to the other. There was no sound associated with them. They crossed the sky in less than one minute. They were not aircraft as they had no strobe lights or colored lights. I first thought that perhaps it was a satillite until the trailing one moved closer to the leading one. I have always beleived that there are too many sightings for UFO&#39;s not to exist. I have never seen anything like this before. Usually I can explain what I saw. Usually it turns out to be an aircraft or what I would assume is a satillite. This time however when the second one moved closer to the first and the dullness of the light I cannot explain what I saw other than it was a UFO.<n>

They were running around playing and I was BBQing.  As I was cooking something caught my eye to the West. At first I thought someone was burning something in there backyard about 3 houses down from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me give you a perspective:  It looked like a cloud of smoke hanging in the air about 10 feet about the roof line.  It was as big as a small RV.  As I looked at the cloud I thought is was odd. Then the whole thing moved.. it went south and did a small u-turn and stopped right over our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids were very excited and got behind me as I was looking at this cloud that moved as if it were being driven. There were no distant lines to it ..it was cloaked. It was so close I could have picked up a rock and smacked it very easily. There was no sound or lights at this point. It was just hanging in the air over our backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were all very excited when all of a sudden a portion of the cloud kind of rolled back and we saw a bank of about 7 rectangular lights. Each light was about 8 X 4 inches. I saw the lights as multicolored, my kids saw the lights as all one color; purple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the cloud rolled back over where the lights were and flew to the north faster then anything I’ve every seen and it disappeared very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it flew away I told my daughter to go in the house and draw what you saw. She did this before any of us discussed the event. A few minutes later she came back with a drawing of what we all saw except she draw the color of the lights as all purple as where I saw multicolors.<n>

The sky was still black when we saw a white light, brighter than an aircraft and about as bright as some of the night stars moving very fast from west to east. It moved in a horizontal line and did not appear to be a meteor etc., which I have seen bounce across the atmosphere as it moved across the horiz. It moved much faster than we were going (575 kts) and was much higher than an aircraft could fly. I was only visual on it for about 1 min. at the most and the Co-Pilot said he saw it a bit before I noticed it. What brought my attention to it was another airline pilot pointing it out to the Air Traffic control center and asking if they had any high altitude fast movers? They said NO. I called and told the other airline pilot and center that we aslo had the object in sight.

Thought you might be interested in a sighting in Ga I found on the internet. I did some research on this sighting and came across what is known as a black project called STEALTH BLIMP Not really sure if this helps you or not but it is worth a try. Click on this link to see if this matches anything they might have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.geocities.com/area51/atlantis/1545/stealthblimphtml.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> GEORGIA CYLINDERS SIGHTED SEVERAL TIMES  State MUFON Director of Georgia and former Police Chief, Tom Sheets writes, &#34;On Monday morning March 26, 2001, I opened my current batch of email and found a preliminary morning report from John Bodin, Sr., MUFONGA‘s DD for South Georgia.&#34; John indicated that he had gone out right after dawn for his normal morning walk; the weather was crisp and clear with a crystal blue sky. Off to the SE he noticed an aircraft‘s contrail similar to those he had noticed during the past weekend. He also observed that the aircraft appeared to be lower in altitude than when such vapor trails are normally formed. The metallic aircraft color was readily apparent in the sunlight, and the contrail was white against the blue sky. Suddenly the contrail stopped, and at this point the aircraft appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser head at arm‘s length but incredibly, the aircraft seemed to have almost halted in the sky. John watched as the contrail dissipated right up toward the back of the aircraft. He also noticed that the body of the aircraft seemed a little too long as compared to others he had observed. At that point, he realized there were no wings attached to the fuselage. He continued his observation for 6 to 7 minutes until, moving very slow, it was lost from view with no change in it‘s appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon receiving the above report from John about 10:00 AM, I noticed that the skies above Fayetteville and the Atlanta area 15 miles to the North, were full of jet aircraft making a very obvious checkerboard pattern of vapor trails (the sky was FULL). Inspection of these via binoculars and video zoom over the next few hours indicated they appeared to be the normal contrail vapor formations, slowly drifting more or less eastwards. Due to the aerial activity, this writer alerted other MUFONGA members in the Atlanta area. SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross (northern Atlanta suburbs) then indicated he would be outside most of the day and would conduct surveillance and report back later<n>

I was driving so my wife opened her window and was able to see a structure. The object was massive and quickly without any noise dissapeared into the fog. I must also state that I am a ufologist and this is the first time I&#39;ve witnessed a craft with my own eyes. Also many people were on the highway at this time. Would like other witnesses to come forward. This sighting has also been reported to George Filer.<n>

We saw the same thing 1 week ago except on Saturday night instead of Sunday night, although both were at the same time of night.  It appeared to be a very bright star at first, but then we noticed movement.  It would move up, down, left, right--no specific pattern.  It seems to be staying in the same place just moving around.  It is far away when we see it, so we don&#39;t know where it is actually flying over. We also see light flashes of red and green.  It is almost like an aura at times with light reflecting in color around it.  Sometimes it looks like it is going out, and then we see it light up again.  It gradually moves off until out of sight, but continues to have the unusual movement pattern.

It was getting dark, so I decided that i had better turn around and head home. Just as I turned around for home, a huge light appeared coming out of the sky. It became closer and closer. It then came about  feet off the ground, 20 yeards away from me. Then it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous to us.  PD))<n>

At one time a red glow flashed from the lower right side of the blue light.  Then appx. 3 sec. later a white glow flashed from the left side of the blue light.  The Blue light seemed to be in the same air space as the airplanes.  This light was very different in movement, color and size of all the airplanes.  Whenever a planed seemed to be getting close to the light it moved very very fast and sparatic, as if it were almost jumping about.  Its movements were very unstable as  in a hovering state.  It would move caddy corner left at extreme speeds, stop and shoot straight back up to where it was to begin with.  Sometimes it would shoot straight up at extreme speed and then return just as quickly  to the same place.  The light was still there when we finally had to leave where we were, we watched it for about 40 minutes.  This night was on Sunday, March 25th, The skies were very clear and you could see stars for miles.  There seemed to be a lot of Air traffic at this time.  The vicinity of the object was:  We were looking approximately  south/southwest from the city of Loganville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume that there is a typographical error in the time, and we have amended it to read &#34;1935 hrs..&#34;  That is an assumed time.

The weather had a slight ground breeze and there was a slight haze in various areas of the skies due to airplane exhaust.  Other than that the view was well over 250 miles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and was commenting on the streaks of airplane contrails that were going east to west and vice-versa. I noticed a large 767 that was flying at about 40,000 ft going west to east just cross over and above a 737 going from east to west and was commenting about that also.  Then I noticed a larger than the 767 white object appearing to be stationary in the sky directly overhead.  I asked my wife to pull over and we observed the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly crawled across the sky at an estimated altitude of approx 50,000 to 60,000 ft.  It was not shining and was pure white.  It initially appeared to have small stubby like wings coming from the oval body but that was lost as the item was moving straight easterly from us. I noted the time of initial sighting @ 1105hrs and we were stopped by the side of the road for exactly 5 minutes watching the object.  We were stopped only 500 yards from the Prescott Airport (small planes only).  There is also a FAA VFR station approximately 10 miles NW of the airport.  There were a lot of commericial flights going east to west and vice-versa but those plane configurations were noticeable and identifiable.  I asked that we start driving North on Hwy 89 back to our homes at 1106 hrs and I watched the object as we progressed northward.  By the one mile mark past were we had stopped previously, the object not only had continued easterly but also had shifted to southernly view point.  That told me that the object was semi-stationary and since we were the ones moving that explained the object appearing to be more in the southern view. As we continued to drive north to our home, hoping to get a camera, the object was lost above one of the haze clouds from the lower flying aircraft.  I attempted to continue to track the projected course of the object but at approximately 1111 hrs I could no longer see any objects even in the clear patches.<n>

As the pizza was warming I went outside to join my dog, and when I walked outside I noticed something moving accross the sky. At first I was confused by what I was watching, because I couldn&#39;t quite make out it&#39;s shape. At first it appeared to look round, kind of saucer shaped, then as it moved it looked almost cigar shaped. Suddenlly after moving about three quarters of the way accross the sky it&#39;s shape appeared more cheveron like. I should note that the backyard is on the north side of our property, so I was looking at this facing north. There was this strange silence to everything as the object flew accoss the sky, almost as if the object was sucking in the sound like a vacuum as it went by. The object had no lights, or light pattern on it, yet it was somewhat luminous. It seemed to be white, almost siver in color. The object flew from east to the southwest at about a 60 degree angle from the horizon, and that&#39;s the opposite direction of the flight pattern of the commercial air traffic in the area. It should also be noted that I live approximatly two and a half miles from Sky Harbor Intl Airport, so I know the flight patterns of the aircraft in the night sky. This object appeared to be rather large, and to be flying at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet in alltitude. It swept accross the sky at a speed at least 3 to 4 times faster than anything else in the sky. The object disappeared into the night sky to the south, southwest as fast as it had appeared in the east. The whole time of the sighting couldn&#39;t have been more than 30 seconds. After losing sight of the object I could once again hear the sounds of the other objects in the sky.<n>

As there aint alot to look at in my back yard I started to look up at the stars and to find constellations like the Southern cross etc. As I was looking in a ssw direction at approx 45degrees I noticed a flash 10-15degrees below where I was looking. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I noticed the flash in my peripheral vision, but as I looked at the spot where the flash occurred I saw another flash in around the same place. This second flash occurred maybe 15secs after the first and was the shape/size/colour of a bright star. Then as I was pondering what it was that I saw, I saw another flash exactly the same as the second and then another following 2-3secs after. Then as my mind started racing to explain this flashing I saw a smaller dimmer object the size/shape/colour of a faint star appear a thumbs width to the left of where the flashes ocurred moving diagonally down to the right at about a 30-35 dgree angle and then disappear just after it crossed the up/down 90degree angle line of where the flashes ocurred. The smaller, dimmer, moving object moved the distance of 1 and a 1/2-2 thumb widths alltogether and this took around the time it takes to say &#34;one&#34;. I could not see any shape to these objects as they must have been too far away. After realizing what I&#39;d seen was most definately a U.F.O. I became very excited and ran inside to get a flashlight to signal back as it seemed &#34;they&#34; might have been using morse code, but this was in vain as I did not see anything else unusual that night.<n>

At 2:00 am we were both awakened by a loud &#34;humming&#34; noise accompanied by a pulsating light that filled the entire night sky (not a beam) but seemed to emanate from a circular/semi-circular object as far away as any other star in the sky. The humming/light would get louder/brighter and then dim.  This happened three times in a period of 10-15 seconds.  There was absolutely no alcohol/drugs involved in this sighting and this is our first experience ever with this sort of phenomena.  Any explanation or insight would be appreciated.<n>

As we got closer, we realized that it was comming towards us, and had what appeared to be blinking lights on the side. As we got closer to it and it to us, it became apparent that it was either close to the ground or very large, and had I believe 8 lights on it, 7 on the front in the chevron formation, and an 8th white blinking light in the back, located two inches(from my vantage point directly below it) from the frontmost light in the front. The front lights were varius sizes of cirlcles ranging from medium to large, with a red light at the &#34;nose&#34; of the object. The size of the circles were in no apparent order, but were symetrical in placement, i.e. a medium was across from a medium, and a large light was across from a large light. Once the object moved over the road, it slowed down to a nearly complete stop and shot out what looked like a faint spot light on the shoulder of the road at an angle of about 45 degrees from either the center or one side of the chevron. After the spotlight went out, it sped up, crossed the road diagonaly, and contined to move away from us towards the house at a fairly quick clip. At this point I called ((dleeted)) to tell him to get outside and see if he could get a look at what we had just driven under. I was on the phone with ((deleted)), who had answered ((deleted)) phone, for about a half of a minute when I looked out  the window and spotted another object, this time shaped like what I would call a classic saucer, only fairly  then what is normally reported.. like a sort of cigar, but more saucer shapped. It was moving over a field in the distance, complete with blinking lights that formed the saucer shape. It stopped over the field, sat there for about 5 seconds, then moved about three inches into what I presume was a different field, and stopped again, this time for about three seconds. Then continued its course in the same direction as the first object we had seen. My friend thinks that it was a helipcopter, but I havent seen helicopters with that many lights on it.. there may have been 6-7 lights on it, that appeared small from where we were. Also, from the distance that it seemed to be at, it must have been a very large helicopter, as it was about the size of a Altoid from where we were sitting on the road (we had pulled into a shoulder at this point to watch the object over the field). I was already extreemly excited over the first sighting, but this second one sent me over the top. I was yelling into the phone, &#34;oh my god what the hell is that, theres another one out there, look at that thing ((deleted))! Do you see it? Is that a helicopter? Jesus man its stopped!&#34; Then, as it sped away, I said something like, &#34;Holy *&amp;^@! Holy *&amp;^@! Christ man look at it!&#34; At this point I heard ((deleted)) say to ((deleted)), who must have been in the room with him, &#34;Damn man it sounds like ((deleted)) is flipping out, do you see anything?&#34; Shortly thereafter the object disipeared behin the treeline and we continued home. I couldnt shut up about it, while ((deleted)) didnt say much. I kept asking him if he had seen &#34;that first one&#34; shoot out the spotlight, and he would say yea, he thought so. PLEASE get back to me, I am dying to know if anyone else saw these things and reported them.<n>

I &#39;ve believed in UFOs since I was a little kid.  I follow the press, internet, web sites and all other publications about UFOs.  My hobby is watching the skies on clear nights when all the stars are out there.  Last night was one of those nights and I was at the rooftop of our building smoking one last cigarette before going to bed and watching the skies as usual.  Suddenly something filled my thoughts.  I felt it with all my nerves.  I said to myself &#34;something&#39;s about to happen&#34;.  I started watching with a higher attention and at first I saw two shooting stars. For some reason I knew that the show wasn&#39;t over yet and I kept looking.  Then it happened appr. 5 mins later and it happened right in front of my eyes.  This one round light (10X bigger then a regular star) drew an S in the sky.  I just saw this thing...light make that S very fast and dissappear.  I am an Aircraft Operations Agent in real life, military service is still mandatory in my country and I&#39;m doing my 18 months of service here in Mersin since April 2000.  I used to work for USAF in Istanbul (my home town) Ataturk Intl. Airport. I know a lot about aviation and I can tell for sure that it wasn&#39;t a plane or another flying object made by humans.  I haven&#39;t told anybody what I&#39;ve seen.  People who don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s (actually I think they&#39;re way to scared to accept their existance)laugh at others who believe and even see them.  I don&#39;t even know reporting this will do any good but at least I feel better sharing this with someone who believes.  I wish I live long enough to see the truth being shared with the public. P.S: I am also a big fan of Zecheria Sitchin...His studies about the Sumerian tabletes are very interesting.<n>

At about 8:40pm that Friday, I drove to a nearby gas station from my home to get a pack of cigarettes.  As I was driving back home I noticed a very large craft of some kind Flying relatively low in the sky.  It was about the size of an audio tape long wise at arms length.  I saw two lights at first thinking that is was two airplanes flying side by side in unison.  Then I realised it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light.  As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear.  It was three lights in a line with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernable shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it.   I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulless International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes ad helecopters that fly in this area.  For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound.  This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere.  It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view.  I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area given its large population.  Whatever it was, I think it was intended for peolple to see it since it was so large and flying so low.<n>
3/23/01 20:30|Blythe|CA|Fireball|30 minutes|Meteor-like fireballs near Blythe California on the night the Mir Space Station plummeted back to earth|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18636.html|71|ndxe200103| Meteor-like fireballs near Blythe California on the night the Mir Space Station plummeted back to earth<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night the Mir space station was crashing back to earth, I was driving West on I10 from Phoenix to Los Angeles with a friend.  Right as I passed the California/Arizona border I noticed what looked to be three glowing lights in the sky, just above the horizon.  I commented about them to my friend because unlike aircraft lights these were glowing an orange color, were much larger, and appeared to be motionless, like they were hanging there.  At that point they did not look like fireballs. I thought they could be tower lights but they were much too high, the wrong colors, and there were no towers around.  We passed behind some hills and lost site of them, and basically forgot about them. About fifteen minutes later we were in an open stretch of the desert when I saw the lights again streaking parallel to the highway but far off and very high.  Rather than lights I could see more clearly there were several huge white-orange fireballs streaking across the sky at high speed, just like meteors but seemingly much bigger.  They were so clear and vivid (no clouds, haze, fog) not to mention bizarre, we pulled off to the road to watch them.  Several would streak across the sky, then another couple more would come, then several more and so on all following the same &#34;path.&#34;  Again these fireballs were huge.  They streaked from east to west, directly to the glow from the city of Palm Springs (which was hidden behind a mountain).  What was especially memorable was that while some streaked by with meteor-like trails behind them, those already in the distance appeared to hang motionless in the sky (quite possibly because of our angle of vision). The fireballs did not appear to have a manufactured shape, like a saucer, have any visible manufactured elements such as lights, or move in a controlled fashion across multiple planes; they simply streaked. Then it suddenly occurred to me: this must be the Mir re-entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere.  I knew the station was supposed to come in over Argentina but no one knew exactly where it would go.  It looked just like a body entering earth&#39;s atmosphere and breaking up.  I did question some elements at the time though, because the fireballs seemed very large, much bigger then pieces from the Mir, but then again I don&#39;t know anything about the Mir.  The other question my friend and I discussed while watching this display was why it had been going on for a good 25+ minutes.  If the Mir came in I would expect it to be more or less one &#34;clump&#34; of little fireballs. In the distance, the exact direction the fireballs were traveling, they seemed to arc down toward the earth, like they were falling gradually.  Then there were large flashes where they appeared to fall.  Seeing the arcs and flashes (which looked like lightening in clouds far off in the distance) I thought the &#34;Mir&#34; was breaking up and hitting the earth, although the flashes seemed surprisingly large.  Although it sounds absurd now, I actually thought the LA area was being hit with &#34;debris.&#34; After the display ended we kept driving west.  I turned on the radio near Palm Springs only to hear that at the Mir re-entry was not due for another 45 minutes and indeed it was coming in over Argentina.<n>

I looked up also. About 500 feet in the air were eight crafts that appeared to be making high speed ninety degree (90 degree) turns.  The gentleman noticed me watching and asked me if I saw them too. I replied with a &#39;yes sir&#34; and then proceeded to ask him, &#39;What are they?&#39;&#39;. He replied &#39;I dunno.&#39;  We watched these acrobatic crafts for almost seven minuets before six of them shot off to the north at a astounding rate of speed. The othe two craft just sat and hovered for a minuet or so and then shot off tho the west just as fast as the six to the north did. I have seen aircraft like F-16&#39;s make turns but not as sharp or perfectly cornered as these craft seemed to be doing.<n>

At first when I saw it, it was by itself, then the helicopters came from out of no where.  I knew it was a ufo, and I wanted to pull over and stop but I was in the fast lane, and traffic was going too fast, so I kept an eye on it as I worked my way over to the far right hand lane.  As I got closer to it, it seemed to disapear suddenly, and the helicopters flew off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a blimp.  I know what the blimps of the bay area look like.  It was not a plane or a helicopter... it was a dark round disc, floating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I wondered why everyone else on the freeway didn&#39;t seem to see it.  I never reported it until now.  I remember the date clearly because it was one of my brothers birthday.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Observed 3 or 4 airpanes in night sky as is usual at any given time as a regional airport exists 5 minutes from my observation point and a major airport exits an hour to the North.  I happened to glance toward the East when right in my eye sight I observed two faintly visible, white, dim, non-blinking lights moving to the East NorthEast at what I thought was an impossible rate of speed for even a military jet, which is rarely seen around here. My assumption at that time was it was one fairly long object with one dim, non-blinking light forward and one dim, non-blinking light at the rear at an undeterminable altitude.  No wing lights seemed visible although between front and rear lights a very slight dim, white illumination seemed barely noticable along the edges of its body. The observed object was at about 60 degrees from my vantage point and covered about two thirds of the sky within approximately 5 seconds or so. Suddenly the object slowed down so very rapidly it barely seemed possible.  It seemed to just &#34;coast&#34; slowly for a second and it then just vanished.  Although sounds from the nearby airplanes could be heard, when the object I saw darted across the sky I thought I could hear a faint, steady sound like a hum of some sort but unlike that of an airplane or jet engine.<n>

Right at dusk, about 30 miles west of Jackson, I saw a beautiful circular (front) object just below the top of my winshield and pretty much over the midddle of the interstate. I would estimate it was at about 300-400 ft. There was a white star on top (lit up) and 2 colored lights on the bottom. These top &amp; bottom lights both extended away from the circular gold surface The size was about that of a full moon. I could not tell its speed as I was doing about 75 mph, but it did not appear to be moving fast if at all. As I passed under it, the body seemed to appear much like that of a blimp or fat cigar. I did not notice the usual pointed nose in front however. The most unusual thing was the body; it was glittering gold and the surface looked like fish scales.<n>

3/22/01 03:30|Tacoma|WA|Other|2 hours|UFO observed visiting several homes in my neighborhood|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17665.html|82|ndxe200103| UFO observed visiting several homes in my neighborhood<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had been hearing a distinctive humming for a couple months prior to the sighting. On the night in particular we turned off the lights pretending to go to bed but stayed quietly inside observing out the windows. At around 3:30am we began to hear the hum, but then it changed into the sound of a small aircraft. I then observed white lights just above the trees at the side of the house circling over the tree-tops. It made at least 6 circles. We then opened the back door to look at the &#39;airplane&#39; when it suddenly turned on very bright white lights and slowly moved toward the back behind our home and went down about 2 blocks behind us in the neighborhood. It later appeared to approach our house from the back direction when it suddenly began flashing lights all over the craft and turned slightly to my left and came down at a house on our street about 1 block away. At approximately 5am I had gone to bed but the other 2 witnesses observed the craft right over our house, it was straight above their heads, then it appeared to go straight up until it looked like just another star. It was a black cylinder shape with two round appendeges on either side which appeared to rotate with lights on them. The back end of the cylinder appeared to open and close with the thrumming of the sound and when open the inside could only be described as having &#39;liquid&#39; light. We got a camcorder the next day, and saw it that night but at a distance and attempted to capture it on video, and though it doesn&#39;t look like a normal aircraft the video isn&#39;t that definative. I think this is important and needs to be shared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness includes photographs of object, apparently fabricated out of which paper.

(camel&#39;s hump mtn is the landmark i would reference). camel&#39;s hump was sort of in the background. so i was outside at approx 2:30am and i was facing north from south hill in moretown and i looked up for a sec and saw a VERY VERY bright greenish VERY LARGE flash or formation kind of shape descending almost vertically and VERY RAPIDLY!! instantly i KNEW that thing was NOT a plane. i thought MAYBE a meteor, but it did NOT look as if it crashed or landed!! it actually seemed to switch off or disappear from view as it got closer to the ground. i looked for about 2 minutes towards the ground where the object would have landed or crashed but i saw no flames or explosions. unfortunately, because i was in a jacuzzi, the jets made too much sound to hear well, but this is sort of a valley here and even with jacuzzi jets going, one might hear such a massive object hit! i&#39;m very frightened as i write this so i need to log off... if you need more information, contact me. i did report the incident to 911, in case it was a plane going down- or whatever... but i know that was not a plane!!  thank you, dj<n>
3/22/01 00:40|Las Vegas|NV|Formation|3 minutes|12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape.|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17021.html|84|ndxe200103| 12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us outside Starbucks coffee shop parking lot at Paradise and Flamingo avenues in Las Vegas very early Thursday morning (12:40 a.m.), 3/22/01, saw an amazing display of a squadron of burnt-amber lights -- each coming from different directions -- zipping about a black oval shape in a highly coordinated, interacting, maneuvering display. To the south, the Luxor Hotel&#39;s laser beamed straight up, and we could see nighthawks illuminated in the lower part of the beam, but those were not the UFOs we are describing in this report.  There were no clouds. We were looking up at a 45-degree angle and to the northwest.  At arm&#39;s length, the entire system appeared to cover no more than an inch. Witness #1 first saw the lights moving like a wave like a sine wave, then changing to individual burnt-amber dots in a straight, non-waving line like a string of beads, then changing to a circular formation.  Then each light spread away from the others, weaving in and out from each other in highly coordinated maneuvering, each moving at the same speed but from different directions.  In this last configuration, the 12 lights were all zipping around a contained oval diameter, but the startling aspect to the movements was the highly coordinated maneuvering between the objects.  The entire system slowly moved north and perhaps upward until it was too far away to see. Witness #2 (this writer) saw the formation only at this latter stage, when the 12 burnt-amber lights were simultaneously zipping around the ovoid shape but each one coming from a different direction and going to a different location about this black ovoid shape.  All 12 lights stopped momentarily before again zipping around in different directions and not in sequence, but all around this black shape. This was done repeatedly for about two minutes.  The movements were fast, including very fast but rounded turns -- no zig-zagging. Mike Castrada, chief of the Public Affairs Office at Nellis Air Force Base, told me he has no report of this, which he would not have if it were classified, but he &#34;wishes he were there&#34; and that if Project Blue Book were still open, this report would probably be a case they would put into it. Castrada said that it appears we were looking at the Western part of the Nellis Test Range. Castrada said that &#34;various FAA and Air Force radars control all that air space -- about 12,000 square miles -- from 3000 ft. about the North Las Vegas Airport to infinity, and all the way to the Utah border.&#34; Castrada said that Special Forces was there on an exercise but only from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  He said that if they were flying at night, they wouldn&#39;t have their lights on because that would defeat the purpose.  He said Special Forces might have had perhaps four but not 10 to 12 planes. Witness #3 viewed the object thhe same length of time as Witness #1 but has not yet been interviewed in detail.<n>

Triangular craft hovered with car for aprox 10min, then moved forward, up &amp; dissapeared fast<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving from Orlando to Daytona on I4 East-bound.  I would say it was approximately 00:30-01:00 hours.  I was in the backseat of the car, staring at the skyline as we drove home. My best friend was in the back with me, but she was sleeping soundly.  There are lot&#39;s of tree&#39;s to the sides of I4, so I had my face kind of plastered against the window so that I could look at the stars. The night was very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver had his eyes on the road, but his friend in the passenger seat was fiddling with a CD.  I remember he put it in and it was some music from The Phantom of the Opera so I glanced at them for a few seconds and went back to looking out of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed something different in the distance and started paying close attention.  There were three very bright lights hovering above us, they were not stars because they were moving in unison with us.  They started getting bigger and MUCH closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t want to look away, I was sort of in awe and wondering what the heck I was looking at.  I ran through all of the things it could be... a jet, a military plane... hmmm, but it hovered down even more so and now I could see it was a triangular object and since it was now so close the middle of it looked pitch black, you could only tell it was triangular because of the lights -- they were close the the edges of this massive aircraft, and because it was so dark it looked like there was a triangular whole in the sky -- (for lack of a better description)  There was NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove the thing hovered along with us for a good ten minutes.  The guy in the passenger seat was watching it too but neither of us really said anything at first.  I think we were both kind of shocked and silently curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell you how high up this thing was.  The gap between it and the tree&#39;s wasn&#39;t huge to the eyesight, but the angle was a little strange so I have no way to measure.  It was definitely high up, but it still looked SO LARGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, it moved away by going up, slightly forward and then in a flash it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend and I both spoke then, wondering if the driver had seen it.  We were glad that the both of us had watched it so carefully and talked about it only for a few minutes afterward, but our reports were identical.  We knew then we had definitely seen something that was not normal.  We were silent the rest of the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my brother when I got home.  I was only 20 at the time and thought everyone would think I was crazy, well, everyone except for my brother.  He thought I should report it and see if anyone else did, but I felt weird about doing so.  I found this website a while back and thought about report it several times, but because it was so long ago I didn&#39;t think it would matter now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t give you any background information on the guy in the passenger seat. He was a friend of the driver and I had only met him twice before and very briefly.  I know he was a serious kind of guy, but that is about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was a florist and wedding planner. Since then I have been very interested in UFO&#39;s and I keep my eyes open all of the time, but sadly I have not seen anything strange since.  I wish I would have had a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had been drinking at all. The car was not affected at all.  There was no interference with the engine or CD player as I have seen in dozens of specials and read on reports.<n>

Plenty of stars visable when from the south came a streaking bright light and traveled north for about 2.5 seconds. At the end of this 2.5 seconds it became very bright white light , like a light bulb just before it burns out, and suddenly went dark. At first my friend and I thought it was a meteor. After thinking about what I saw I am not sure. The meteors I have seen in the past fizzle out. This thing became very bright and large. I can&#39;t really say how large but from the size of the light it was too big to have just went out. I would think that if it was a meteor it would have continued to move through the air and fizzled out.<n>

I could clearly see a dark black triangle shape with a curved stern this craft had to be at about 12000 ft since I am at about 4200 ft here.there was no sound and it was moving very slowly all of the sudden,the lights quit strobeing and a strait line apeared amindships and it doubled and the tripled its speed without a sound and disapeared to the SSE in less than ten seconds.<n>

They where bright red constant lights. They had no formation, as we watched they sped up and slowed down passing each other. However they all seemed to be going the same speed. They never caught up to or passed the large craft in front. They traveled full view from the southeast sky and traveled to the north. After they had traveled about 15 miles they where still in view till they went behind a mountain. Weirdest thing I have ever seen... never experience something this weird before.<n>

I listened to this for approximately 10 minutes then decided to go outside to see if I could see anything.  I first looked at at sky in the front of my house and noticed alot of small aircraft flying (which is not unusual).  I then turned around to look behind the house and still did not notice any jets or anything that could be making such a loud roar.  But I did however notice that the stars looked very funny and continued to look thinking to myself that I had never seen them look quite that way before. They were red.  So, I then decided to turn back around and look in front again which is east, and as I did suddenly a big orange light appeared just above where I was standing.  Instantly I thought oh my gosh its a UFO. No sooner then I had that thought another big orange light appeared just to the right of the other. They were very big and just right there not far away. I did not see a spaceship just very big bright orange lights right above me that were stationary and possible some sort of beam.<n>

In that pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just now outside getting a few items from the car. When i looked up, and there it was. Something that looked liked a shooting star, but it stopped. It traveled at amazing speed across the sky, and then just stopped!It flashed few colors: blue, red, and green. It didn&#39;t hold it&#39;s position but for a few seconds, then darted off with the same magnificant speed as when it came.<n>

VERY LARGE formation descending and VERY RAPIDLY almost vertically; no crash,no flames;disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i&#39;m very freaked out right now... typing is difficult.... unfortunately,i have a terrible sense of measurement, but i&#39;ll try my best. i can&#39;t tell you how low it was sky, but it was REMARKABLY LOW and very close- like within 30 miles. i was facing north towards duxbury, vermont. (camel&#39;s hump mtn is the landmark i would reference). camel&#39;s hump was sort of in the background. so i was outside at approx 2:30am and i was facing north from south hill in moretown and i looked up for a sec and saw a VERY VERY bright greenish VERY LARGE flash or formation kind of shape descending almost vertically and VERY RAPIDLY!! instantly i KNEW that thing was NOT a plane. i thought MAYBE a meteor, but it did NOT look as if it crashed or landed!! it actually seemed to switch off or disappear from view as it got closer to the ground. i looked for about 2 minutes towards the ground where the object would have landed or crashed but i saw no flames or explosions. unfortunately, because i was in a jacuzzi, the jets made too much sound to hear well, but this is sort of a valley here and even with jacuzzi jets going, one might hear such a massive object hit! i&#39;m very frightened as i write this so i need to log off... if you need more information, contact me. i did report the incident to 911, in case it was a plane going down- or whatever... but i know that was not a plane!!  thank you, ((initials deleted))<n>

We were in the hottub in our backyard just doing some general stargazing.  The sky was very clear with a full blanket of stars.  Local aircraft traffic is prominent. This was not like that traffic. For less than 30 seconds an object appeared, chevron in shape, with (I believe) 6 unblinking lights along the perimeter.  From my perspective it appeared in the night sky to be a hand&#39;s breadth and length.  It moved swiftly and straight from the east-south-east to the north-north-west.<n>

I entered our car and discussed what we viewed.We then,both,got out of the car, to watch a thick stream of pinkish smoke(gas)...rise vertically on the horizon,very soon(seconds)after,which,we saw a large bullet shaped,object, Very shiny and silver,with one circular ring around it&#39;s middle,(and apparently attached)start to rise vertically. We had great difficulty,in not paying attention to it.I did not seek the attention of any other people in the lot,there were very few. We saw it reach a certain altitude,then,saw,it start to fly horizontally,left,to,us.There were no flashing lights or sound to be heard. We,then,got in the car,to follow as best we could,the direction,it was headed.We travelled approximately one tenth of a mile(if that)to see only a grayish line of smoke(gas)in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her story rather interesting.

When I couldn&#39;t view them anymore I looked back at the cloud and there was one more that seemed to be following them in the same direction and I watched it until it disappeared.  These &#34;dots&#34; were moving fairly fast.  Faster than an aircraft would have at that altitude.  There are airplanes flying overhead all the time heading towards either Brainard Airport or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks.  I went inside and called my mother to tell her of my experience and then went back outside about 10 minutes later.  I layed on the sidewalk watching the sky again and sure enough, I saw a bigger dot coming from the northeast heading southwest this time.  As I watched it it split up into a triangle shape with 3 of the dots at the angles and one of the dots kept going back and forth between the other 3 as if &#34;merging&#34; and then coming apart.  I am a very sane person and I tried to convince myself that what I was seeing was a flock of birds or some aircraft or anything but UFOs, but after watching these craft for about 5 minutes until they disappeared into the clouds, I can only say that I don&#39;t know what they were.  Just bright, shiny dots that seemed to move with a definate purpose.<n>

One the west side about a mile or two away, I saw two black cigar shaped objects hovering.  They looked like blimps.  At first I thought they were helicoptors but they were too high.  I drove into the parking garage and made my way to the opposite side of the building where I could get a better view.  The objects were gone but in thier place where three contrails intersecting to form a triangle around the area where I saw the objects.  One of the contrails had been formed by a jet that was still visible.  Once I made my way into work I looked out the window and saw another jet making its way to the same general area.  The objects couldnt have been blimps because the dissapreared to quickly and they couldnt have been helicopters becaue they were hovering pretty high and there were no visible rotors.<n>

I&#39;m assuming there was a heat source as the object was shimmering like the distant ground on a hot day.  It was around the size of car but perfectly squarish/rectangle.  At first, it looked like a silver refrigerator placed sideways in the sky, it was very shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend somethings floating in sky and he turned around, his first words was &#34;is that a weather balloon?&#34;  I responded, &#34;Where&#39;s the balloon part and how is floating&#34; right then the train we heading to beeped its horn to signal people it was near and we both looked away from the UFO box thing as the sound startled us, we turned back and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend now pretends he didn&#39;t see it but i think its because his wife is religious.<n>

It appears as a regular star from a quick look, but once you take the time to watch closely you can clearly see how intense the light coloration can be.  I recently aquired a long range telescope for Xmas so i decided to put it to good use.  As i adjusted the lense on my telescope i noticed two distinct rings around the object.  The object was luminating so brightly that it formed an outer ring around itself. It was very clear that the object was rotating very fast.  The upper half of the circle rotated to the right, and the lower half of the object rotated to the left.  The rings had a tendency to wave against eachother as if they were on some type of axis.  The object was moving at a fast rate from one side of my lense to the other.  I also had to adjust my lense down because the object was moving farther away.  The lights of the object were in very distinct colors of red, green , blue, white, and a slight orange.  The objects movements were very sporatic in the way it moved from left to right at a high rate of speed. This object has been seen by myself and my mother for quite some time now for at least a year and a half i have made various attempts to contact observatories and other support systems and have received no response or cooperation. I truly hope that this creates some type of interest and investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this may be a description of the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

So I turned-off the computer, and turned off the lamp, and headed downstairs. The hallway was dark, and as I passed by the north-facing window, I saw a bright light outside, above the tall trees jsut west of the window. I thought that it was one of the bright planets that are visible in the west this time of night, and stopped to look at it. But, it moved. The movement was slow - lazy - like drifting in the sky. The light pulsated - growing very bright - then dimming - and then growing very bright again. It moved from high to low, sort of drifting down in an arc. The direction of movement from here, was toward the town of Grand Junction north and west).When the light pulsed bright, it was as bright as Venus is now. When dim, could barely see it. Color - yellow-white. Size - not as large as Venus - more like the size Jupiter is now. Only saw it travel a short distance(don&#39;t know how many meters - can tell you that it was from the top of the trees to just before Redlands Mesa norht of me. Just couldn&#39;t see any light at that point. When I could no longer see it, I went downstairs and looked at the clock - 21:20. What did I see? Was this a space station? Was the pulsating light from the sun shinning on it when in certain positions? Why did it appear to be moving so slowly - drifting? It was intriging. I would really like to know what this object was. Thanks.<n>

It then started to move around within the area and then moved swiftly behind the house next door.I was spooked and came in the house.About 2-3 minutes later I  went back outside and walked a couple houses down to see if I could still see anything behind or around the house next door.

Another that was kinda by it was the same color and stayed on bright and then another was above that one slowly moving upward and to the right.

To its left, or starboard side, was a light of medium plus intensity like a full moon light and color to match (pale yellow). This object emitted or showed no blinking lights whatsoever.  It was neither higher or lower than the aircraft and the distance from the aircraft was between 100 and 300 yards, to the best of my knowledge.

Visable to the naked eye .  Picked up binoculars, through them the &#34;orb&#34;, took on a horseshoe shape with beams of red lights shooting down.  Shape appeared almost translucent, or 3-D.  Watched with binoculars for about 5 minutes, shape would almost flatten out and change into squares, upon examining with a telescope, the shape  was a large &#34;orb&#34; broke off into three triangles, all still within the orb.  Than formed the ball again, than broke off into 3 circles, began to move rapidly within the orb, with very bright red and green lights surrounding them, this   continued for about 3-5 minutes, than merged again to the large orb.  At times with the eye this appeared to be like a giant ferris wheel moving around with all the colors.  This orb could change shapes, and appeared almost translucent, yet when I viewed through it, I saw bright glowing lights.  It moved out of view for a few seconds, and when it reappeared, it was not as bright, the light was clear, of halogen quality.  after 30 minutes it finally went behind the hill.  The sky was crystal clear, I began to see this at dusk, and continued until well after dark.  the sky above the orb was brightly lit, it is amazing it was not viewed by others.<n>

It was average star size as seen with human eye. Object was moving southwest across horizon (about 40 degrees above horizon). It left no trail, was not blinking, just a solid light moving quickly. At first thought it was a satellite, but then it stopped dead. Then it started to speed up again, then disappeard altogether. It reappeared a moment later on same course, then changed course by about 10 degrees, slowed down, sped up again. It then disappeared twice more, reappearing each time. Changed course sharply once again, sped up and disappeared into horizon. Reported to Vermont State Police same night.<n>

NOTE: This was NOT the MIR, as this event was the Monday before. At sunset this past Monday, several people including myself, all abslutely stone-cold-sober, were at a Texaco gas station located on a high hill, at the intersection of &#34;Exposition&#34; and &#34;Westover&#34; in West Austin. &#34;We&#34; consists of myself, a 50-year-old semi-disabled retiree and college student; my son, ((deleted))l, 28, who works for a prestegious ((deleted)) company, doing precision ((deleted)) work; ((deleted)) friend and co-worker, ((deleted)); two adult male Service Station mechanics. They were fixing a truck my sonhad just bought the day before at an auction, and we all met there to check out the progress. My brother, ((deleted)), a photographer, who didn&#39;t have his camera and I could just kick him, had just been there to check out Joel&#39;s truck and had just driven away. A few minutes after ((deleted)) left, around 6:30pm or so, he called on this cell phone very excitedly and told us to immediately go out and look to the West in the sky. He said there was this amazing streak of fire falling really slowly toward the horizon. By the time we got outside, whatever it was had just broken up into three distinct pieces, all of which continued to fall incredibly slowly to the horizon. I guess they wer e at about 40 degrees or so up from the horizon when we first saw them. ((deleted)) rported it was higher when he saw it, and it was falling very rapidly. apparently when it broke apart, it started falling more slowly? Anyway, we first assumed it was the &#34;Mir&#34; falling (we obviously weren&#39;t real up on the details about when that was supposed to happen last Monday, although we know all about it now), but then we were reminded that &#34;Mir&#34; wasn&#39;t going to fall for a few more days. I was immeditaely concerned that it could be our space shuttle, which was also up there somewhere. But whatever it was really seemed like it must have been bigger thaftn that. We were amazed at how high and HUGE this object must have been, since it was probably 15-20 minutes at least before it finally disappeared into the horizon. We rushed home and swiched on the news, but, amazingly again, ther was NOTHING!! We&#39;ve watched all week, but NOTHING (but the &#34;Mir&#34;, big deal. This object looked to be WAY West of Austin, Texas, as we were looking pretty much due West, I think. It wasn&#39;t dark yet, and we could all clearly see that this was in no way anything but something ON FIRE, not contrails or anything &#34;routine&#34;. We&#39;ve ALL been walking around in question marks all week! Help! Has anyone else reported anything? For the sake of our fragile sanity, we&#39;d sure appreciate a quick response of some kind, if only to tell us you&#39;re checking on it.<n>

The sky was completely clear with the sun shining.  Passenger jet traffic was clearly visible with airplane detail quite clear.  These objects appeared to be much higher, or smaller, or both than the passenger jets. They &#34;played&#34; in a spiraling motion much like what you would see in a &#34;Top Gun&#34; movie.  It could have been military aircraft in practice manuevers, however the aircraft were too high to make out any definitive shape.  They appeared to be triangular and shone in the sunlight quite briliantly at times.  After several minutes one of the aircraft departed in a Northwest direction.  It passed behind (over) the contrail of a passing 747.  I lost sight of the other objects when I looked back to them.  About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw two of the objects come from the Northwest loop around come together very close, split apart and both departed in a North, Northwest direction.  From what I saw no actions were taken that would be impossible for a military fighter, but it would have to have been performing to the limits of it&#39;s capabilities. It looked like they had the agility of a kite or bird, but were much too high to be that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means March 19, not April 19.

March 19 2001 when I saw it. I was listening to Power 106, and was just about to fall asleep when I heard this weird airplane noise. Now I usually hear lots of airplanes and helicopters fly over the neighborhood as I did with the weird noise. It sounded a lot like an airplane except it also had whooshing noise, which sounded like this: woo,woo,woo, wuooo. Then I heard it stop maybe 450 feet directly in front of my window (I was in my room at the time, which is in the back of my house on the second floor). And then my curiosity got the better of me, and I got up and looked out my window. What I saw made me paralyzed - mouth open. When I finally got up my courage (it took 3 seconds) I said &#34;Holy S@*t!!!&#34; It appeared to look somewhat like the little dude&#39;s space ship from Space Jam. It was as big as two compact cars, one in front of the other, and one on top of the other two like a pyramid (although it wasn&#39;t in the same shape). And then it landed. This part is kind of hard to explain, so I&#39;ll do it as best I can. It flew for about 700 feet, then laned in a most peculier way. It landed kind of like the way that you see flying cars land, like the flying Delorian from Back to the Future part II.<n>

The first 7 have seemed to have stopped for about 2 minutes just hovering. When one would signal 2 bright white lights, another one would signal in the same matter. The lower one has join formation and one by one they would all signal two bright white lights. They where moving from east to northwest untill they disappeared. Two minutes after the last one disappeared. A low flying airplane was moving in the direction of last known location. This is the first time that I have seen them for myself. The other co-workers have said that this is the forth time in resent months to have seen for the last one was about 3 weeks prior and was estimated to be only 40 feet above the building and size scale was about the size of a small house.<n>

I was standing in my driveway which is roughly ten miles southwest of Rockford, IL, and saw six lights low on the horizon over Rockford.  They were orange in color, about the size of a bright star and looked to be almost stationary.  They were in what appeared to be two, side by side trianglar formations, with three lights in each formation.  The light to my extreme right started blinking rapidly much in the manner of a stobe light.  After about three to five miniutes, the lights faded to black while moving slightly to my left.  They seemed to be moving away from me to the east or northeast.  Channel 17 News (WTVO) at Ten (22:00)reported that lights were being seen over Rockford, including one report of &#34;a light hovering over North Main street.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and he seemed to be an exceptionally capable observer.

All in formation, I know there were at least six dim orange lights, but amidst the hustle-&amp;-bustle it was hard to tell... especially since the lights appeared to be taking &#34;turns&#34; blinking EXTREMELY bright like flares (one-at-a-time). Each burst of light lasted, I&#39;d say, about ten seconds or so. None of the lights moved-- they appeared to remain in the same spot the whole time I observed. It seemed during each interval between the twinklings, that each light &#34;faded&#34; into the darkness, and with the final visible light, there were eight witnesses standing in the same lawn-- seeing the same thing. Within 3 minutes from when I first saw the formation, they were all out of sight.<n>

3/18/01 15:00|Kelseyville|CA|Circle|15-20 seconds|White disc moves perpendicular to wind in clear sky, then suddenly disappears.|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16899.html|129|ndxe200103| White disc moves perpendicular to wind in clear sky, then suddenly disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the back yard on a clear day today, except for a few normal contrails and cirrus clouds.  I noticed that a swarm of insects was flying over my home, following the wind direction.  I was annoyed by this, and scanned the sky to see if I could find out where they were coming from.  A few seconds later, I noticed a white circular object in the sky, almost directly overhead.  It was about half the size of a sunflower seed at arms&#39; length. It appeared to be self-luminous, since I could see no shading or shadows on its uniform white contour.  I quickly resolved that this was a rubber party balloon, and decided to watch it out of sheer amusement. Assuming that the circle was a balloon a few thousand feet up (which we can get from simple ratios, considering the size of a typical party balloon versus its projected size at arm&#39;s length), then the object&#39;s speed in radians/second, and therefore its implied speed, are within the normal range of wind speed, roughly 2-30mph.  But the analysis is not complete. First of all, 15-20 seconds into this boring event, the circle simply disappeared.  I don&#39;t mean that it stopped radiating and turned black, the way an airplane does as its reflective surfaces rotate with respect to the sun.  Rather, it disappeared, revealing the blue sky behind it.  I flipped my sunglasses on and off, scanning the sky around it, but found nothing.  There was at least a baseball-at-arms-length of steradial blue sky around the place where it had disappeared, so it could not have simply wandered behind a cloud.  I did not see any change in the object which might have presaged its disappearance; it simply ceased to exist.  I must admit, I have a Bachelor&#39;s in Physics, but my blood ran cold. But perhaps the &#34;balloon&#34; could have popped as a result of the cumulative thermal stresses of the high atmosphere on its rubber skin.   Originally, I had determined that this was the explanation, until just this evening, the following hit me, and my blood ran cold again:  I could tell from the way that the insects were sweeping over the roof that the wind was in a certain direction on the ground, about 5mph.  I could tell from the direction in which the cirrus clouds _and_ the contrails swept overhead that the wind direction was similar up high.  But the &#34;balloon&#34; had travelled in an apparently arrow-straight line roughly perpendicular to the wind direction.  So I would have to believe that the wind suddenly rotated 90 degrees, then 90 degrees again, between the ground and the cirrus clouds, which seems unlikely. I would note that this second fact also eliminates another possibility, which was that the circle was some form of exotic ball lightning emmanating from the local dormant volcano, Mount Konocti.  I have heard that such balls of light sometimes bubble out of the ground due to tectonic stress in the weeks prior to an earthquake or eruption.  Again, though, I would expect ball lightning to follow the prevailing wind pattern. I am left with these possibilities:  (1) The circle was high above the winds, i.e. in the mesosphere or higher.  It was simply a round satellite which for some reason popped of existence in an instant, without any signs of an explosion.  (2) The circle was not of this world, and either popped into hyperspace, or accelerated out of view so quickly that I thought it had simply ceased to exist. I do not think that this observation is meaningful or substantial unto itself.  I post it here just in case you get similar stories regrading this locale or time period.  I am reminded of similar white circles/balls which were observed in groups of 10-20 in the vicinity of Mount Popocatapetl(sp?) in Mexico.  I do not recall how such balls eventually disappeared from sight.<n>

Outside the weather was brisk, and the skies were blue with scattered clouds.  Looking out my south-facing window at about 14:50, I saw a white, circular-shaped object descend from 70 degrees into cloud cover.  I continued to watch the cloud, hoping the object would appear again.  But that was the last I saw of it.  I don&#39;t know what the object was, but it was definitely not a balloon.  Its movement appeared controlled. About an hour later, I heard the low rumble of helicopters flying at low altitude.  Looking out my north-facing window, I saw at least three twin-blade, Sikorsky-type helicopters flying over the city in a westerly direction.  The dark, unmarked helicopters flew over the Hudson River before banking to the north and out of sight. In 8 years of living in Manhattan, I have never seen a UFO or &#34;black helicopters.&#34;  It was very weird to see both on the same day, within an hour of each sighting.<n>

I was doing some spring cleaning in my barn. After taking some stuff to my burn pile I was looking at my barn trim because I have to fix it this summer. The sky was clear as a bell. I caught in my eye a white streak. It surprized me so I followed it with my eye. I walked past the trees into my side field to get a better look. My sons and I star gaze at night and we have seen satilites. Much to my amaze there was three objects. They moved at the speed of satilites. A jet was flying underneath them tracking west so I new they were very high. They acted like they were chasing each other with one sort of holding back. Four times they made a triangle and then darted around more. This lasted for almost five minutes. After the stunts they went to the northwest and I lost them in my sight.  This was during the middle of the day. We can see real well in the sky. Out in the country.

Height anywhere between 2000 and 10000 feet. No loss in height. No noise. Highly reflective on this sunny day with light clouds. Estimate speed over 100 knots. Visible for 8 minutes from zenith to 30 degrees above southerly horizon, when dwindled to a point. No course deviations observed. Wife saw it at zenith (90) down to about 80 degrees azimuth. Called me, and we both then tracked it until it disappeared into the distance. No time for telescopes or camera; too busy trying to figure it out (hey, I&#39;m a virgin UFO spotter so sue me). Wife asserts (too late for me to tell by the time I got there): * triangular * not a hang-glider (too fast) * not a balloon (wrong shape) * not a parachute (no height loss) * something swinging from the bottom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:45pm  3/17/01 I used to fly small planes, so I can say that as an ex-pilot I&#39;m mystified. I called the airport ATC. * Nothing reported from San Jose ATC in the tower, except for a helicopter taking pictures close to the airport. * Wind on ground around 12 knots, little to no gusts. (So unless the wind increased to over 100 knots at a few thousand feet, this wasn&#39;t flying unpowered, therefore.) * Visibility: 10 miles. (So - and this is very rough - 10 miles in 8 minutes = 75 knots roughly. Agrees roughly with my estimates. Also, I reckon the visibility due south was more like 15 miles, which makes my estimate of 100 knots even closer.). A nice sunny day with very light and intermittent clouding. No clouds near the object for the entire time we tracked it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6pm 3/17/01 I expected to be excited and/or elated or something, but I guess today being tax return payment day, my reactions are dampened! Also, my wife got the best view, and all I saw was a bright, highly reflective object receding into the distance. We agreed that differentiating between a high large object travelling fast, and a lower, smaller object travelling slower, is damned difficult with no other nearby skycraft as references! There&#39;s some more info left out which my wife and I pulled together: 1. It seemed not to be metallic, but rather the texture of bright white silk. 2. The assemblage hanging down and swaying was entirely white, and the same colour as the triangle. It was about the same length as the traingle&#39;s span. The hanging part appeared to consist of a single U-loop of rope/cable, whereby nothing (e.g. a load, a person) was noticeable at the bottom of the U. 3. The triangle was neither thick nor thin; maybe 10:1 ratio between span and thickness. It appeared to be a rigid body, unlike the hanging assemblage. 4. The prevailing wind, according to reports, was between 5 and 12 knots, at every altitude from zero to 10,000&#39; MSL. It was in direction 310 degrees (out of the NW), which lines up pretty much with the observed course of the object. 5. We also discount a helicopter on two counts a) wrong shape b) no sound whatsoever. 6. The course of the object relative to our south-facing garden (from where we observed it) appeared to be about one half mile due east, so it did not travel directly overhead. 7. At zenith, when only my wife was observing, the angle subtended by the object was approximately that of an object of size 0.7 inches held at arm&#39;s length. When I observed it first, at roughly 80 degrees azimuth, it was about 0.3 inches, and dwindled down to a sparkling point as it receded. 8. At the time of the initial zenith sighting, my wife had been looking up because of the noise of a passenger jet flying by (to or from the nearby airport). If the object were making sound, this could have masked it until it was too distant to hear. Hypothesis: an electric hang glider?

My wife is 30 years old, and has a degree from a Michigan university in theatre. We were both drinking non-alcoholic beverages (and we don&#39;t do drugs!) at the time of the sighting. It was a sunny day in the garden with the children, and we were both relaxed and fully aware. We were both  wearing our glasses during the sighting, so long-distance vision was excellent.<n>

It was about 1:45am I just look at my watch and told my wife I was going to bed. We had a guest over from the next camp site, sitting and talking with us. When thru an opening in the clouds came two saucer shaped objects very fast, then they suddenly stopped and hovered over the lake.the three of us were in shock to say the least. They made no sound like an engine would, but a slight hum was all we heard.they were about 75 yards away from us and about 30 feet above the water. one of the craft emitted a very bright beam of white light into the water. I flashed my Q-Beam at them just for a second it seamed then a bright like from the second craft shot towards us at the dock. I pulled out my pistol and fired one shot at the light.we heard a sound of the bullit hitting something but it was&#39;nt like hitting metal. Within 10 seconds after that, they both shot up into the clouds and it was over. We hav&#39;nt been back since..<n>

I watched it for a couple of minutes, trying to decide if it was a star, plane, or what.  The light was a steady glow, white in color, and motionless.  I called my wife to come look and she told me that was the same light she had seen in the past and called me to come look, but I dismissed it as a plane or a nightwatcher light of a neighbor, without ever looking when she called.  I took binoculars outside, and looking through them, this object had a triangular shape, with lights going up one side and down the other.  None across bottom oftriangle. I came back inside, we talked about it, and when I looked again, it had dis- appeared.  We observed for perhaps 20 min., how long it had been there before I noticed it, I don&#39;t know.<n>

As I watched it, and I wondered at what I was seeing, It stopped, hovered for a moment, then suddenly shot off at a 45 degree angle to the east at a high rate of speed.<n>

I am not sure of dates and times. Especially the times. It could be much later. Past midnight. Helicopters have flown over our house at night, on a pretty regular basis, as there are National Guard helicopters at the airport in Decatur. However, over the past few months (I do not know the dates) the house has been shaken quite violently, 3 times. I&#39;d assumed it was helicopters that had, for some reason, started flying lower than usual. (Which I&#39;m assuming is a no-no over residential areas, though I didn&#39;t call anyone to complain.) The first extra-loud fly-over (late February or early March) lasted several minutes. The windows rattled for quite some time (more than one but perhaps not 2 full minutes) before the &#34;helicopter&#34; was heard. I didn&#39;t even think &#34;helicopter&#34; until it was over. I cannot actually say that these loud ones are helicopters because of all the extra noise. i.e. I know what a helicopter sounds like as I hear them quite often but the extra noise of the house shaking was so loud that I couldn&#39;t swear it was a helicopter that flew over. There have been 2 others, a couple of weeks apart. And the time between when the windows begin to rattle and the source of the vibration is heard is very short. That first one was strange because the house shook and simply kept shaking for no apparent reason. I will definitely pay more attention and record the times, duration and what, if anything, I can see.<n>

We were laying on our backs looking at a clear night sky, with approximately 160 degrees of sky visible.  I am the son of an aeronautics engineer, and have been raised around all types of commercial and military aircraft.  I grew up near an Air Force base, and have observed hundreds of various aircraft in flight, both at night and in the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular night, while viewing the stars, an object moved toward us from the south.  It was very dark and difficult to determine the shape.  It had one distinguishing feature:  a single pulsing red light on the bottom of the craft.  The size of the pulsing light led me to determine that the craft was only a few hundred feet off the ground, yet the craft was moving at a high rate of speed with absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My experience tells me that only a jet-propelled craft or very high-powered turboprop could move at this speed, typically with lots of noise associated, particularly at this altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was absolutely silent.  It moved south to north, spanning my field of vision in less than 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both saw the craft and corroborated what we had seen and agreed completely that we had witnessed a craft that did not exist in any records or memory that we had.

I can pretty well tell how big and how far away and how high the objects were because the lights were in front of the white tank mountains which are 15 miles away so they had to be no farther than that.  They were about 1000 ft. above the ground and about 3/4 mile wide.  This location is in the flight path of Luke Air Force base.  There were 5 amber lights a bit smaller than a full moon.  They were stationary for a few minuites then two lights went out and the 3 middle lights rapidly moved upward in a north direction (on video) - then the lights got closer together as they were moving away, as if a craft were turning making the lights closer together but appearing to be not same distance apart.  I have seen (no video) much vivid detail on two other earlier occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry I didn&#39;t report earlier as I assumed so many others did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 61 years old at the time and both me and my wife saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

San Jose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here at work in San Jose on the 5th floor my coworker came over to my cubicle and told me to look out the window and check out this thing.  We looked out the window and nothing was there.  He hurried me to the otherside of the building and I saw what looked to be a black helium baloon slowly rising.  I told him that it was a black baloon that someone had lost.  He then said &#34;wait, just look at it&#34;.  I looked a few more seconds and realized that all of a sudden it was either much closer or it had expanded.  It was no longer a small looking baloon but an ablong egg-shaped ojbect floating end over end.  It appeared to be the size of a large van, not quite shaped like a cigar but not as round as an egg.  It was all black and possibly shiny on one side as it tumbled in the air or it was polished on all sides.  It tumbled more or less as if something in space out of control end over end.  It continued to rise and then accelerated rather fast and shortly disappeared heading south of San Jose while continuing to rise.  Within seconds it was gone.  There&#39;s absolutely no way it was a helicopter or another such aircraft.  It was positively all black, nothing protruding, and possibly changing shape.  The reason why I say possibly changing shape is because it was to me quite obvious that it was a round baloon.  Then all of a sudden it was much larger and elongated.  It either changed shape or it was extremely fast and I could see it much clearer when it came closer.  There was no sound, no lights, no windows, nothing but a shiny black object. I called the Airforce base in Sunnyvale and the local police department.  My background is Systems Administrator for a large financial company and I honestly don&#39;t believe in U.F.O&#39;s.  The person he grabbed me is an outside consultant that was working a little late on database issues on one of our servers.<n>

The report described a UFO sighting in San Jose at approximately the same time. I didn&#39;t see the object reported in the report, but I think I must have saw our military tracking the UFO. I was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge at 6 pm, on my way into San Francisco for a night class when I just about died. Right before me a black jet fighter crossed very low over the Golden Gate Bridge, during rush hour traffic! I looked around to see if others saw what happened, but eveyone seemed completely unaware. I watched as the jet flew around the Bay, going over to the East Bay then moving South. I was unable to keep track of it after about 10 seconds. I asked if anyone else saw it when I arrived at school. And I watched the news to see if there were any reports. Nothing. I have seen the Blue Angels fly into the Bay many times, so I am familiar with the military aircraft. But, I have never seen anything like this before. This fly over was definately an unusual event. I was very nervous because I thought that maybe a foriegn aircraft may have been in the area, or a pilot had gone crazy and was going to do a fly by for fun. Little did I know something really foreign was in the area!<n>

I was driving south, the moon was still visible at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the southwest and the sun had not yet come above the horizon but it was light out.  A few degrees below the moon I saw a cigar shape, nearly black in color, with no lights. It seemed to be moving towards the west, it was hard to judge because I was in a moving car.  As I drove I lost sight of it several times because of curves in the road, trees, and having to look at the road. In the first instance of regaining sight of it, it seemed to have a more triangular shape but still no lights. It was moving very slowly, if at all, and seemed very high in the sky. As I passed a tree it vanished. I stopped for a minute or so, to try to find it again, I did not see it anywhere in the sky. It had acctually vanished in a split second. There were no planes or helicopters that I could see, either.<n>
3/15/01 03:00|Seattle|WA||unknown|detail of a dream...not critical...read when you have time...thanks|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16863.html|160|ndxe200103| detail of a dream...not critical...read when you have time...thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure how or if I should report this, or to whom...and this is probably going to not be of interest to you guys... because this isn&#39;t about a physical encounter, it&#39;s about a recurring dream since childhood about various spacecraft flybys and landing sites. But after the vivid clarity of this one last night, I felt almost driven to find out what&#39;s going on here...This dream was in very specific detail and extremely clear and in color. Last nights, had a combination of disc shaped aircraft and what looked like shining mercury-like material craft...they were zipping across the sky in the Seattle sky leaving a golden haze colored trail behind them. Several large ships with cylindrical engines on the sides and a round disc in the center of the engines (like the Star Trek ship only with the disk in the middle of the engines and other complex connective elements between the engines and disc (which was a dark green color) I noticed a small US Flag decal on the bottom of the craft and some other symbols. I also saw what looked like several aircraft but they were unusual, they seemed to be escorting the other craft. The aircraft looked like overblown A10 warthog jets...except the engines were huge and they were very smooth on the surface...with some non reflective material that was dark green almost black in color. When I was about 14 years old (I&#39;m 42 now) I had a dream like this about similar ships landing at Moon Island near Hoquiam, Washington (in the 1970s) in that dream I called a good friend (who can witness this) ((name deleted)), and told him to look up in the sky...and he set the phone down (this is all in the dream) and went out to look into the sky...when I went back out to look up at the crafts all I saw left was what appeared to be one large star that broke into three pieces one fell over towards Moon Island (I was in Aberdeen) the other started desending toward me and I saw one headed towards ((name deleted)) direction several blocks North... A cylindrical object that looked very much like the old Apollo command module softly landed in my front yard and I called ((name deleted)) back and told him and he said something that looked like the LEM landed in his. Now here&#39;s the freaky part... the next day (this is NOT a dream) I was telling him my dream and he literally turned white because he had the SAME dream from HIS perspective...and remembers my phone call. Since then I&#39;ve had many, many of the ship dreams and they are in incredibly detailed, color...I can see every detail of the ships...and I always wake up excited and hopeful like we&#39;re getting closer to something. I hope I haven&#39;t wasted your time...maybe this can help in some way, maybe it&#39;s nothing...but I just felt led to share this with you and if you have any suggestions or can offer any help about others that have had this dream or know what&#39;s goin gon I&#39;d appreciate it. I hope I haven&#39;t wasted your time, but since I don&#39;t know if these are physical, psychic, spiritual or interdimensional issues, a dream constitutes on level of contact or reality to me and should be noted incase something else ties into it and can help you with your research…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We traditionally do not post reported dream sequences, since they are impossible to document.

Both of us then noticed an object almost directly overhead moving to the east in a snake-like pattern. The object moved silently, quickly, and seemingly just vanished.  No immediate air traffic in its vicinity, and it appeared to be at a consistent high altitiude. Object appeared to emit faint red light from at least 3 lights side-to-side, and appeared to be a triangular shape, although somewhat fuzzy at the edges.<n>

It was shaped in the front like a half moon circle. I thought it might be a blimp, but again it did not have the shape of a blimp. There were lights in the front that blinked in sequential order with bright colored lights, then it would stop for a second, then the lights would start again.  The object was over the San Francisco Bay, I was driving over the bridge so I could not stop, but I noticed another car had pulled over and they may have been looking at the same object.  I have never believed in ufo&#39;s, but this one changed my mind.  I use to be in the Air Force and have never seen anything craft like it before.<n>

The object itself was an undefined oval glow of light which I witnessed changing in size and shape several times. Usualy increasing in size tenfold. It would appear to stop while changing, turning a bright blue/white light. I would guess the altitude of the object to be under 600ft. traveling in a zig-zag motion from the north and heading south.<n>

It was reported on the 18:00 newscast on 03/15/01 that the station had recieved numerous call form viewers that observed the Mir spacestation and also observed another object with multicolored lights on a parrallel course with the spacestation. Mr. Burns also stated that he had contacted several agencies and noone seemed to know what this object was.

I actually saw &#34;tracers&#34; following it&#39;s sudden departure upward. There is no way it could have been any sort of known airplane or helicoptor. It certainly was not a bug or a spotlight reflection. It was totally silent and was close enough I am sure we could have seen the vehicle if it had been daytime.  No meteor could have possibly fallen and riccocheted back into space at this sharp of an angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color never changed or distorted, it was there and then it simply was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I usually observe aircraft passing from East to West along a designated flight path. Today, as I was rounding the corner near McConnel, I saw a very bright light moving from South to North. I thought that the aircraft I had been observing (which was now behind some trees) had turned on final for the AFB. I was thinking how bright the light was and that I had never seen landing lights that bright. I had to take my eyes off of it to make the turn on the road. Then, I looked South again to watch it, but it had moved beyond where I originally saw it.. Looking out the North-West side of my window I observed the fireball travelling North. A green shielding haze was on the front of the fireball. So, I really think it could have been a satellite reentering or a comet.<n>

They were at an altitude of less than 1000ft. and were both dimly lit with at least 15 white lights each. I could not distinguish either objects form due to their incredibly fast speed. Generally they mirrored one anothers movements but clearly the craft on the East side was jumping to the East as much as 100ft. and changing its altitude 100ft. simultaneously without any overt sign of acceleration yet jumped back to mirror the general flight path of the craft to its immediate West. Both crafts appeared to move effortlessly and the only sound I could distinguish was a slight whishing noise when they were almost directly overhead.

I couldn&#39;t sleep so I was watching TV. We have sliding glass doors along side of the TV. I noticed something Bright through the sliding glass door. It was Reddish orange and very bright. The entire object was not this color just the edges all the way around. We live near the lake in Elizabethtown Ky. This lake had a problem and they drained most of the water out of it. The Dam is repaired now but the water level is not up to normal level yet. This Bright Light appeared to be over the lake near the dam.  It stayed at that location for a long time with out moving. I thought it might be a Helicopter from Fort Knox. While this object was over the lake a Helicopter came by, I thought sure he would have seen the bright light from the object but he never changed his direction. She said she could hear the Helicopter but never heard any sound from the other object. We are located on the flight path for The Helicopters from the Louisville hospitals to Hardin Memorial Hospital our local hospital. She said aer a while the bright light started moving easterly which brought it closer to me. It was moving very slow over the tree tops and when it was located over the First Presbyterian Church, which is about a half block away I could see it very good. (It could have been farther away then half a block but she could not tell.) It was not a Helicopter and it was not an Airplane. I moved to a kitchen window where I could see better and it looked like a big arrow pointing up. She said it stayed in this position the entire time she seen it. It was lit up all the way around the outside edge and it was easy to see it&#39;s shape. Enclosed is a drawing of what it looked like. As it started getting out of my view, I went up stairs and watched until I could not see it any longer. We do not have any windows on the east side of our house. I watched it for a total of 45 minutes. She was unable to tell the size other than it looked about 8 to 10 feet tall. This is the position it stayed in all the time she seen it.

Take off every Zig.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing on the strip just south of the Stratosphere Tower on Las Vegas Blvd.  We looked up and saw a large, metallic object.  It had flashing lights which had a definite sequence to them. There were about 10 lights in all.  They alternated in their flashing sequence from right to left as best we could tell.  The UFO must have been 10000 feet or greater.  The visibility was clear.  It moved up and down and then side to side in an &#34;A&#34; type motion.  It changed altitudes quite rapidly and began moving in an &#34;Y&#34; pattern.  After a little hovering, it moved in a &#34;B&#34; pattern. Then back to &#34;A&#34;.  Then back to a &#34;B&#34; pattern.  It then moved like a &#34;T&#34;, before performing a &#34;U&#34; maneuver and then shooting off in the sky at a high rate of speed.  After the incident, my girlfriend turned to me and said, &#34;What you say?&#34;   My friends began acting strangely and their speech became quite strange.

I am in the Air and Ocean Freight business and have worked around Sea-Tac Airport for 25 + years.  This was not a commercial Aircraft, it was moving way to fast and there was a single light, no blinkers.

It appeared just above the horizon and flew at a very constant speed and passed my line of vision to the north of me.  It was bright in the center and seemed to appear dimmer as it radiated out, and then brighter on its edge.  It did not streak across the sky like meteors I have seen.  It did not leave a trail, smoke or sparks and it seemed to travel parallel to land.  It was much larger than a star, but appeared about a tenth the size of a full moon.   Since it did not change in size or shape as it moved, I assume it must have been very high in the sky.  I heard no sound, and I often do from aircraft flying in the area.  I ran downstairs from my bedroom to try to catch sight of anything on the other side of my house and saw nothing.  I then noted the time on the clock on the wall as being 11:52PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have taken a report from this individual over the telephone, and he seemed unusually lucid and credible.

After she leaves, I often go out on the back porch to write in my journal.  The porch faces west, overlooking Blake and Vashon Islands and Puget Sound.  I had just stepped out on the porch and was admiring the clear night sky when an object traveling very, very fast crossed from the south to the north.  It caught my eye because I thought it was a shooting star, but then I realized that it was flying within earth&#39;s atmosphere. Moreover, it had least 3 distinguishable bright orange lights in an oblong formation.  It was too dark for me to make out the outline of the vessel itself. It flew at about the height on the horizon as a plane would, but was totally silent and at about 10 times faster -- it took about 10 seconds for it to cross the sky.  To reconfirm my thought that it could not possibly be a plane that had just passed, moments later one in fact did fly by (presumably coming from SeaTac airport as they often do), and I could make out its shape, hear it clearly, and it was much slower than what I had just seen. I took out my journal and wrote: &#34;3/13/01: It&#39;s dark and I can&#39;t see to write well.  I just saw something cruise through the night sky.  It had orange lights and was very, very fast and completely silent.  A plane just flew by, too, but slower - much slower - and I could hear it pass.  It must have been a satellite but it seemed so close.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and believe the witness is an excellent source of objective information.

I live in South Bellevue, Washington. I had just stepped outside to take one of my dogs out before going to bed. As I stepped off the porch in the back yard I looked back, over the roof of my house, to the West. There I first saw the bright orange light. It was due west when I first caught sight of it.  There were a number of trees blocking my view, yet I could see that it traveled at a very high rate of speed.  It moved quite a bit faster than any plane I had ever seen.  I would say it took about 5 seconds to travel from where I first saw it to the west until it disappeared from my view to the North.  I would say it was around 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  There was no sound nor was there any trail of sparks. It appeared to travel straight and level. I wrote down notes about the sighting the next day. I didn&#39;t know what to do about it at the time. Then a few days ago I saw your program on the local cable access channel.  I copied down the URL for the web site and decided I should report it.<n>

We were out on the street, for approximatly 10 minutes.  I remember the sky being clear enough to see the stars and the approaching planes at near by Boeing Field.  As we were finishing up our conversation, the person on the drivers side of the car, looked up and pointed over our shoulders and said look.  We turned and saw a BRIGHT, ROUND, REDISH, ORANGE, UNFAMILIAR FLYING OBJECT, flying from West to East, fairly low.  It traveled in that direction for approx. a few seconds and then made a turn and started to travel in a NorthEastern direction.  It traveled N.E. for a few more seconds, we could clearly see it traveling across the sky, at that point I told the guys it was only a meteor falling from the sky, At that monment the craft made another sudden turn due North and increased speed and zipped away very, very fast.  One of the guys started running down the block to keep it in eyesight, but it faded out of view, as it flew away.  I made the comment that what ever it was, it could have easily have crossed the state within a minutes time, thats how fast it appeared to fly away. As an Ex-Navy Aviation Operations Yeoman, I&#39;ve seen various types of military Aircraft, including the F/A-18 and others.  For those planes to travel at their highest rate of speed, theres always an after blast/Sonic Boom.  This object travel much, much faster, made impossible turns and theres was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  He had a very good look at this object.  PD))<n>

It was a clear and starry night with a few scattered clouds and a waning moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stargazing when something caught the corner of my eye. It was round, about 10 feet in diameter, about 3000 feet in altitude.  It was glowing orange and yellow and had a little tale behind it about one eighth of its diameter.  It flew over us heading east and made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it until it got to about the middle of the harbour, about a mile away.  It appeared to be getting smaller until it just disappeared, which is strange because you can see airplanes further away than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately 11:45 P.M. and the sighting lasted for about 30 seconds.<n>

Went upstairs to get a snack &amp; watch a little Jay Leno.  Got ready to go downstairs.  Heard a rumbling noise that made me curious but had lots of computer work to do so I didn&#39;t go outside to investigate. I work at my computer with ear phones listening to music.  Vaguely aware that the rumbling noise was louder and vibrating the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was helping our youngest son with his homework.  They were on the 2nd floor.  My wife called me on the phone and said I should come up and figure out what was making noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I came up stairs the noise suddenly stopped.  My 15 yr old daughter came out of her bedroom where she had just turned out the lights to go to bed.  The noise was so loud that she thought she would look our her window.  She said Holy S**t I think I just saw a meteor.  She described a light as big as a basket ball twice the heighth of trees flash accross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as she saw the light the noice stopped abruptly.  My wife&#39;s ears were hurting because of the loud noise.  She had the sensation that it was passing slowly over our house from a SW to NE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I talked to several neighbors who all reported hearing the loud sound.  One of our neighbors looked out the door and didn&#39;t see anything but said the sound was deafening and frightened her shaking the whole house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another neighbor said she went all the way out to her drive way and looked up in the sky (clear night) and saw no lights but couldn&#39;t figure out what was making such a loud noise (like a squadron of jumbo jets.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later I talked to a friend about the noise and him and his wife said they heard something just like I described on that same night.  My friend lives about 5 miles SW of where I live. I called the airport.  They said they were testing engines at about that time. But I hear them testing engines all the time.  Seldom more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. Since Mitchel international airport is 3 miles away the sound never is very loud.<n>

I pulled over to safely view the object.  It was travelling at a spead comparable to that of jet hellicopter, but it had no marking lights normally associated with such craft.  It continued north at a low alltitude until I lost visual contact once it entered the tree line.  I didn&#39;t think much of it, until I heard other reports in the community, and on local radio station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The e-address of this witness is so bizarre, we are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report.

Then as we slowed way down on the freeway, as did the car putting on their brakes in front of us to watch as these strange lights came closer.  They were I would say traveling at a speed of say 60-120 mph about 200-500 feet above the freeway and appeared to be following the freeway!  As they went directly over our car I rolled down the window and looked up at what seemed to be 2 lights about say 4-6 feet apart making up each of the three lights which were traveling in a line with the first one lower then the second higher and the last one being the highest.  They just kind of floated of down the freeway.  They didn&#39;t seem to move away from each other at all as if all part of a much larger unseen craft.  I called the Hillsboro Airport and they said they had no reports of any strange lights that night and acted disinterested.  I was going to let it go until I saw the other posting in Beaverton.<n>

It was roughly the same size as the other stars in the formation. It was changing direction and eventually moved out of sight. At first I though it may have been a satelite but it was changing direction so much it had to be controlled. When I&#39;ve seen satelites before their speed across the sky was similar to this object.<n>

At first I thought  it might by a plane, although  I have never seen one so bright. I watched it for a few minutes and then went to get my camera. I am disabled so I walk very slow. It probably took at least 4 minutes to get my camera. I took pictures over a 12 minute period as you can tell by putting your mouse over the pictures. I leaned against a tree to try to keep the pictures from blurring. I would say it seemed to be in the same area for long time, at least 20 minutes and probably  longer. The only thing I thought it might be is the space shuttle, although  I don’t think it could be that low in the sky. I  have never seen anything that seemed to be in the same place for  long. I was watching a program on the travel channel that reminded me of that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe these will be of some interest to you.

Monday March 5, 2001 my husband and my son were coming home from Alabama.  It was evening and I noticed a bright light in the sky, in the West.  I first noticed it as we were going into Westpoint, MS.  I continued to see the light till we got home.  30 minutes after getting home I went out to my patio to see the light, but it was gone.  Tonight in the early eveing dark but still some light, I was sitting on my patio enjoying the nice weather, when I looked in the West sky and I saw my light again. I went and told my husband that the bright light was in the sky again.  It did not move, nor twinkle, it just stayed in the same spot as the one I saw when we were coming home on the 5th of March.  As we were watching it suddenly began moving westward then had a haze or glow all around it and began getting smaller.  Not like anything I have ever seen.  It was&#39;t a plane, that I could tell.  My sister in law saw the same light not long ago but she was coming from the west going east. She rememberd me telling her about what my son and I saw on March 5, 2001.  Since I saw it twice now and two seperate wittnesses, is this a possible UFO?  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Perhaps a celestial body.  We are not sure.  PD))<n>

The drawing of that sighting is the only thing I have ever seen even remotely resembling what I witnessed. I want to ask did the caller specify the shape as it is drawn? Mine appeared to be circular although I believe it rotated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did I report only 10 minutes for that sighting? As I remember it, there would have had to be approximately 40 minutes driving time for that stretch and a bit more for the time I was stopped. Sorry, if it was my reporting error.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still looking for an explanation for this event.  I did not want it in my report at the time, but I will add here, “off the record,” that I was in contact with a NASA Russian Spacecraft Specialist at the time.  I sold real estate and he wanted a place to retire when he came back from Russia. After I couldn’t find anything on the news, and the thing didn’t show up in my pictures (digital and not a bit distorted anywhere, no pun) I contacted my NASA friend and told him about and said it was only a UFO until he told me what I saw.  He checked thoroughly and came back with “It isn’t ours.”  Well, what else could he have said.  It seemed curious at the time, but less so now, that he totally believed me, even the no show in the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there were three black low flying planes over the area.  Had they asked me, I could have told them they wouldn’t find anything.  There was an “earthquake” the night before that rattled stuff on the shelves. I assumed what didn’t burn was blowing up.  I checked earthquake activity the next morning.  The closest was a 2 some 200 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was so big! And at one point while it was stopped and I drove to within maybe a hundred and fifty feet of it (big guess) it must have been 80’ long, with a width of 50’ across the top and 30’ at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t want this posted, but I would like to know about that other sighting I mentioned up top.  And if you have anything similar in your files, please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>
3/13/01 18:20|Timbo (nearest)|AR|Other|10 minutes|Was this demise of object sighted in Seattle?|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17284.html|193|ndxe200103| Was this demise of object sighted in Seattle?<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:20 pm on March 13, 2001 as I was driving home from work just before dusk and topped a hill facing west I saw a white something dropping fast from high in the sky in the west. At first thought it dropped straight down but after consulting a map that showed my route veered slightly north I realize the craft did, also. At first it was a shape like a flat bottomed cone (tall popcorn bucket- elongated thimble, maybe) with larger part at the top, it had very sharp edges visible and at times while dropping there was an indication of fold or line the length of it from top to bottom (as if rotation presented different view to me). It was very bright white against the palest blue sky. As the highway I was on turned north, I took a side road to the west heading toward the still dropping object, in hopes of keeping it in sight and getting a better look, wondering where it might land assuming it was very large space debris, perhaps even from Mir that might be breaking up already. When I stopped my car I watched it drop to just above the top of tree line about 75 feet ahead of me. At that time while I remained stationary, the object seemed to hesitate and the bottom lifted pointing north. It moved across the sky (18&#34; at extended arm length) to the north and appeared to stop. There was no sound, scents or other noted effects. I watched a few moments as it seemed to just stay suspended there. This discounted my idea of space debris and I assumed I would be able to check NASA sites to discover what it was. It didn&#39;t seem to be in danger of crashing. I turned and went back out to the highway headed north and when I cleared line of woods to my left I saw what I believe to be the same object that had traveled a bit further north than I had. (As it was out of my sight for a period, I can not be absolutely positive it was the same object.) I parked my car across from cleared pasture area (less than 1/2 mile north of first stop) to take more pictures. The object was then seen as a rather vertical jelly bean (cigar) shaped bright yellow &#34;glow&#34; sitting barely above tree line in the west less than a quarter mile away. I took another picture and as I watched it seemed to ignite as if exploding and began to ascend. At this point I feel sure it was on fire. The top (front) blazing was bulged out like smushed ice cream cone as it seemed to meet resistence. The back tapered only gradually. This was intense fiery orange, black, yellow, red colors. As it rose, I looked to two guys a hundred feet north on the highway working on their truck and realized they hadn&#39;t noticed it. I pulled my car up and just said look. One of these guys immediately said, &#34;Thats it! That&#39;s that space station.&#34; We watched it turn back overhead toward the east and discussed things we knew about Mir coming down for a couple of minutes before the object appeared to burn out. At that time it continued overhead east as a pattern of black debris in various geometic shapes from front to length of previous burning tail. Still all this time no sound or odor of fire. Help had come for the stalled truck and I needed to move my car so I went on toward home, assuming an explanation would be all over the news. After about 3 miles I turned on a highway headed east and looked back with clear view of the burnup area and could see nothing. There were no images of the object in my pictures! Only the treeline! And needless to say, nothing on the news to explain it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This reported sighting occurred approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes before the earliest sighting NUFORC has on file, which occurred over Henderson, NV.

It was early to mid-dusk. The sky was cloudless. I observed two white jet trails, much shorter than what is normally seen and could just barely make out a craft at the front of each trail.  What caught my attention was that neither the jet trails nor the small objects in front(presumably an aircraft of some type) were moving.  They appeared to be absolutely stationary!!  It would be hard to estimate the altitude but I would guess 5-10 miles.  The craft/jet trails were positioned where it appeared that had the craft been moving, it would be travelling from north to south. As stated above the jet trails were white in color but were unusually short, much shorter than what is commonly seen.  From my perspective, they were both an inch to an inch an half in length. Additionally, they did not appear to disperse from the effects of the wind, as would normally be expected. The jet trails were not close together, separated by about 15-20 degrees horizontally. Since I was driving a vehicle, I had to divert my view briefly in order to drive safely.  At one point, I looked up and the plane/jet trail to my right completely disappeared!  I scanned the sky in the vicinity of where I had seen it and it was totally absent.   I had just seen it a few seconds previously. The object to my left was still visible. After about a minute, the object to my left then completely disappeared.  In both cases there were no remnants of the white jet trail as is normally seen. I am an investigator with an agency of the federal government, in my early 50s and married.  I have BS degree in Aeronautics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed.  We suspect he may have been observing the contrails behind aircraft, which simply entered an area of the sky where contrail formation didn&#39;t occur.  However, given his background in aeronautics, we have to presume that he had allowed for that possibility.  PD))<n>

Diablo.  I have never seen anything quite like this.  At first, I thought that it must be a plane as we have a lot of air traffic in our area.  But the object did not move, it just seemed to hoover there in the sky.  As I tried to keep my eyes on the road and watch the object at the same time, I noticed that it appeared to have colored lights, in a random blinking type pattern. Then I thought it had to be a star.  After I got home I checked to see if the object was visible from my backyard and it was.   So, I quickly unloaded my groceries, grab my binoculars and went into the backyard for a better look.  Through the binoculars, I could definitely see that the object was trianfular in shape with primarily bright green lights, it had sort a strob light coming off the left hand side and then there was a red light that seemed to travel in a circular path, counter clockwise around center of the object. It remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then it traveled very quickly up and to the right to a new position.  It remained there in its new position for another span of time, then quickly darted down and to the left, to another position in the sky.  The object did not move along with the other stars in the sky. I went inside and got my husband out of bed, I felt like I needed someone else to say that I what I was looking at was really there.  He watch the object  with me for about 15 minutes and finally said, &#34;Humm, that&#39;s kind of wierd isn&#39;t&#34;.  The object stayed primarily in the same vacinity for more than an hour, making sharp, sudden and random changes in its position.   I finally went inside as it was getting late but my curiousity got the better of me and I had to go back out and check to see if the object was still there.  Only about 15 minutes had passed by since I came inside the house and when I return to my backyard to look at the object one more time, it had vanished.<n>

After that we herd three pinging noises and a whoosh like some thing took off. The coyotes were dead quiet now and all was silent.we quickly ran up to the house to see if they saw what we saw, but no. they turned on the scanner to lisen to see if anything had happened, but nothing.

They looked like red flares, yet were moving independantly, so it was not the wind.  They were in sort of a taper Isoceles triangle with a single light separated from the other two by an order of 4 of the separation of the others.  I observed them for about 8 minutes when I pulled into a service station just next to US26 on Murray.  When I mentioned the lights to the attendant, he said he had been watching them for over a half our and they had started out in the Southeast &amp; had moved to their current location over a span of about 10 minutes.  The objects appeared to extremely high up so no sound was eveident.  As we watched two of the objects came towards one another and became one, or one went out.  The others just seemed to fadse away after a few moments, though there was a hint of rapid motion just before disappearing.<n>

I was looking at the moon through the sunroof top of the car and all of a sudden a light appeared out of nowhere.It looked just like a regular star, but it was moving so i knew it wasnt a star. I kept following it, and it kept making these sharp curves, going slowly then fast and vice versa. But then as it was going away from the moon it started dimming out and finally disappeared. It didnt come back until a half hour later, and it was all the way on the other side of the sky. It did the same movements, dimmed out and disappeared once again.

They were the color of sodium lights and just as bright as one you would see 2 blocks away.  Definitley not the color of airplane lights.  I first saw two lights, then two more faded on at a higher altitude (closer?).  The lights then proceeded to fade out either in pairs or singly.  They were moving slowly and would fade in and out as they moved horizontally and vertically. The horizon line of the mountains would not be explainable as lights higher would fade out while lower ones remained. Just after the last one faded another one lit up slightly to the right and higher for about 5 seconds.  Perhaps the military uses different colored (and brighter) lights on helicopters?  They were not flares as they moved horizontally.<n>

3/12/01 07:45|Dublin|CA|Cigar|3 min.|White, cigar-shaped, silent object flying at low altitude.|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16818.html|207|ndxe200103| White, cigar-shaped, silent object flying at low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of 3/12/01, at about 7:45 a.m., my Daughter and I saw a white, cigar-shaped object moving slowly, and at low altitude, from the southwest toward the northeast and then it turned slightly north, toward Mt. Diablo.  At times, it seemed to stay in one position, as if to observe something below, then moved forward, again.  The day was a bright, clear, cloudless morning.  The object was moving through the air at a lower altitude than I have seen many single engine planes fly.  It made no noise whatsoever.  It had no wings, no visible cockpit, no rudder, wheels, propeler, no cables or anything on or protruding from it.  I am only certain of what it was NOT: it was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a blimp, not a balloon, not a glider, or any ordinary object I have ever seen in the sky.  It appeared to move intentionally.  I did not have the benefit of binoculars, but with the naked eye, it appeared that it may have had narrow band of dark-colored metal very slightly bisecting the middle of the object, which gave the hint of an indentation or slightly &#34;segmented&#34; body, but I cannot be sure because it was further away from me, at that point.  Mostly, it appeared to be made of a smooth, cigar-shaped, bright white, non-reflecting material, i.e., not a &#34;shiny&#34; metal.  Because it had no visible means of propulsion, I was amazed at how slowly it was moving.  It&#39;s length was about the width of my thumbnail, held at arm&#39;s length.  The object was still in sight, when it was followed by a single engine plane that flew overhead, in the same direction (toward the northeast), but the plane was flying at a lower altitude.  So, for a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds,I had both the plane and the silent, cigar-shaped object in view, before they both passed behind the buildings and trees, and out of my line of sight.  The strange object was moving much slower than the single engine plane behind and below it.  It would seem to me that any observer in the small plane would have had a clear, much closer view of th! e cigar- shaped object.  I went in and called the FAA Office at the Livermore Airport, nearby, but they said they had no other reports nor did they see anything.<n>

We left early enough to go to Sunday school and church. We always exit Interstate 10 at the Pinal Air park exit and then turn south on Trico road. That morning there were a lot of military vehicles and personnel parked on Trico road right next to the air park. It looked like a military reserve thing. After church and lunch at the Grandparents my wife and I started back to Mesa around 3:00 PM. The military vehicles were gone by now. We were going North on Trico at about the Trico Marana road intersection when I noticed this aircraft making a banking turn and then descend below the tree line just like any normal airplane would to make a landing. BUT this was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. As soon as I saw it I immediately thought of the famous Phoenix lights incident, from the images shown on TV. I hollered to my wife look at that, but she didn&#39;t see it until it was a profile and didn&#39;t get a good look. The profile was strange too, it didn&#39;t seem to jive with what it looked like from the top. I have attached a JPEG I created of the the shape I saw when the aircraft was in its banking turn. The aircraft was solid black with no lights or windows that I could make out, but we were still pretty far away. When we got on I-10 I did notice a Cessna at about the same altitude I saw the black one in its bank and in comparison the black aircraft was much larger. I&#39;ve been stewing over this ever since I saw it. I would be glad to tell anyone what I saw.<n>

It was in the middle of a banking turn with one wing tip down and the other up. This gave me a good look @ it&#39;s top view profile or footprint. It was a solid black chevron shape. It&#39;s nose and wing tips came to points. After turning the craft descended dissapeared behind the trees, which obstructed my view of it actually touching the ground. I saw a Cessna @ about the same altitude about 10 minutes later and from comparing the sizes of the 2 craft I figure the UFO was about the size of the Stealth Bomber. I design packaging for flying toys. I have a lot of reference photos of our Stealth Bomber, and this was NOT a Stealth Bomber. As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to be looking @ the craft responsible for the famous &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; incident because the shape was the same as the shape rendered and shown on local TV. The thing that sort of puts the icing on the cake, is that this aircraft landed @ Evergreen Air Center. This thing flew like a conventional aircraft. I had my windows up and was probably too far away to hear any noise anyway, so I didn&#39;t hear anything. I saw no lights, and I didn&#39;t see any cockpit or windows. As it leveled out on it&#39;s approach, I could see what had to be it&#39;s landing gear, but I couldn&#39;t make sense of what I was seeing. It didn&#39;t seem to make sense, it just didn&#39;t jive with what I know about retractable landing gear. The shape of it&#39;s profile seemed awkward, I tried to contact local news about it, but they just refered me to guy locally that didn&#39;t help or do anyting.<n>

Growing up I was an Air Force dependent and spent three years in the US Army 1966-69 serving a year combat tour in Vietnam. On the morning of Sunday, March 11, 2001, my wife and I took four of our dogs to Sarasota, Florida, approximately 10 miles south of where we live, to walk them at a place called Robarts Arena.  This is an area covering several acres and is where county fairs, rodeos, etc., are held.  I was walking about 50 yards in front of my wife when I simply heard the noise of a small single engine plane overhead and looked up to observe it.  When I first located the plane another object caught my eye.  This object was light gray and circular.  Seagulls are common here and I thought perhaps that it what I was looking at but it did not waver or move erratic as they do.  It was obvious this object was moving in a direct line westward.  I then noticed another object of the same description in what appeared to be about a quarter mile apart traveling same direction and speed as the first.  Other than the small plane&#39;s engine, there were no other sounds of aircraft.  There is an airport located in Sarasota and a McDill Air Force base located 50 miles north in Tampa.  However, my years around all types of aircraft left me with the certainty that these two objects were not normal aircraft.  When I turned to my wife and pointed to what I had seen, the objects were no longer in view.  After several hours of thought, I felt it should be reported to this organization.  There were no distinctive markings, lights, or other features; just to very light gray circular objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be a quite credible witness.  His description of what he and his wife reportedly had seen was quite precise, and described in unambiguous, objective terms.  We deem this to be a quite good report.  PD))<n>
3/10/01 23:30|Beaverton|OR|Light|5 min|3 people saw 3 flickering orange lights moving slowly away from each other.|3/16/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16792.html|215|ndxe200103| 3 people saw 3 flickering orange lights moving slowly away from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour ago I was leaving my friends&#39; house and as I walked outside, two orange, flickering, fire-colored lights in the sky to the south immediately caught my attention. They were too small to discern any detail. They were about as bright as a typical airplane, but seemed a little bigger. I called my two friends outside to look, but they didn&#39;t get outside in time to see anything. I watched the lights for about 30 seconds total. They were about 40 degrees above the horizon, about 1 handspan at arms length apart from each other. I believe the one on the left was stationary when I first saw it, then it started moving slowly to the left away from the other one. (It was moving w.r.t. the clouds behind it.) It moved a total distance of about one handspan. The one on the right was stationary the whole time. Both lights faded out about 30 seconds after I first saw them. I saw nothing remaining after they faded out, and I never heard any sounds. I noticed that a car had stopped down the street.  After the lights faded out, the car drove over to the three of us and stopped. There was a couple in the car who had been watching the lights as well. They said they had seen them from the nearby freeway, and had pulled off to watch. They said they had watched for about 5 minutes total, and that there were three lights initially. Apparently this third light had started out stationary and then slowly moved to the right, away from the other two lights and disappeared before I had come outside. We all agreed that they were much more orange than the red broadcast tower lights visible to the east, and too orange to have been red airplane lights. The couple speculated that the flickering orange color looked like fire and may have been candles tied to balloons, except that all three were moving in different directions, which seemed strange. There&#39;s a very slight, variable breeze outside at ground level, and the clouds aren&#39;t moving noticeably w.r.t stationary objects. The weather is cloudy--no stars visible--and the lights were below the clouds. When they disappeared I couldn&#39;t tell if it was because they entered the clouds or because they faded out. There&#39;s a lake about a quarter mile to the south. I didn&#39;t think to ask the couple how far away they thought the lights might have been. Maybe it was just a prank, but I figured I&#39;d report it in case anyone else saw anything unusual. I would guess that others probably saw it too since it was visible from the freeway. Background of the observer: I&#39;m a 32 year old software engineer with a computer science / electrical engineering bachelor&#39;s degree.<n>

It appeared to be, at first, an elongated string of lights.  The size of the object was difficult to assess due to its distance from us.  As we continued home, we tracked the object as it headed east towards New York City.  My fiancee got a good look at it at one point when it was directly to our north side and said it appeared to be cigar-shaped, describing as looking like a butter knife when light is reflected off of it.  Upon arriving home and stepping out of our car, we continued to watch the object as it hovered well off in the distance, quite possibly over New York City.  Again, the distance was hard to estimate.  When we looked back towards the west, we were startled to see that 3-4 other similar &#34;strings of lights&#34; were hovering almost directly over our position but far up in the atmosphere.  We went inside to further observe the original craft, which still hovered in the east.  Its lights seemed to pulsate/strobe in intensity and change colors (red, blue, green, white).  These objects (3-5 on average) have appeared nightly in our sky now and there has been a dramatic increase in plane and helicopter activity since their initial appearance.  We live near Teterboro Airport, but a lot of the air traffic we have seen is NOT conventional or commercial airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses may be looking at a twinkling star, airliner landing lights, or perhaps some other normal phenomenon.

While i was driving in my car on the 60 fwy headed East to the 10fwy (Palm Springs) I noticed a small fierce lighted object in the sky. It looked like a it was going to crash into the mountains. The sky was dark. Overcast weather with slight rain. The object was small at first then all of a sudden ... it got bigger like a flash of pictures. Its movement made no sense to me and i knew it was not a plane or car. It was the size of about 5 semi trucks put together. It had no white, blue, green, or yellow lights ... just red window like very bright lights. It darted from the right to the left and caused me and 4 or 5 other motorists to slow down and check what the heck it was. I couldnt turn around or stop traffic so i kept going. One driver seemed to pull over or lag behind the other vehicles to get a closer look. The Object was Black, with bright red lights, diamond shaped but wider. I noticed it had levels of lights in an organization that was not human like. I would like to hear from others if they saw this object. I am a sane, female. 30 years old. I am a full time professional worker and i was traveling to see my mother in Joshua Tree.

I quickly turned my head and saw a large fireball-like object of bright blue streak quite fast downward through the sky and over the horizon.  Since I had been studying Astrophysics at McGill University I thought I&#39;d ask my teacher about what I saw, and after I told her about it she couldn&#39;t identify what it could have been.  She says it couldn&#39;t have been a shooting star (because I wouldn&#39;t be able to see such a small faint light through a window with lights on in the house), and it couldn&#39;t have been an airplane (unless it was completely engulfed in flames and burning so hot that they were blue flames).  So what else could it be?  It is definitely an Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/10/01 19:00|Venice|CA|Cylinder|5-10 seconds|Observed 3 or 4 fast-moving, silver-copper-colored oblong objects for up to ten seconds as they whizzed by my house.|8/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18941.html|220|ndxe200103| Observed 3 or 4 fast-moving, silver-copper-colored oblong objects for up to ten seconds as they whizzed by my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a married man with one eleven-year-old child. I have a M.A. degree in history. I am currently employed as a manager of a hedge fund. I am also a writer of short stories and novels. My wife is a former filmmaker and an animal rights advocate. It was a clear evening at approximately 7:00. I was sitting on my back porch with my wife. We were talking, and I looked to the west. I noticed what appeared to be three or four seagulls flying in close formation towards us. The ocean is very close, and it is not unusual to observe sesagulls flying in the area. I have seen them many times in the past. However, this time I instinctively stood up to see better because they were flying at a very rapid speed. I remember remarking to my wife that they were flying much faster than seagulls were capable of flying. The objects flew within approximately a fifty feet of my house. I remember thinking that there must have been a very powerful sea breeze above us because the objects were so fast. I noticed that the objects were oblong with short wings (I am not sure about the wings) that did not move. As the objects whizzed past me, I was amazed by how rigid and metallic they looked. My wife still believes the objects were seagulls. She, however, did not notice them as soon as I did, and she did not stand up to really look until they had almost passed by. The entire time frame of the sighting from first seeing what I thought were birds to their flight past our house was maybe five-to-ten seconds. That&#39;s what I found so amazing because I first saw them a couple of blocks away coming from the direction of the ocean. Birds just do not move that fast, and they were so low in the sky, i.e., maybe fifty-to-hundred feet over roof tops, that I could clearly see them. The three or four objects, which were flying in a perfect, tight formation, were small but bigger than seagulls. I will never forget thinking how unusual it was for those birds to be moving so rapidly in such a tight formation without flapping their wings, and how awe! struck I was when they passed in front of me. They were metallic and looked like some kind of gliders that were on a mission. I remember thinking (my first thought when I noticed their metallic nature) that they were probably extraterrestrial reconnaissance flights surveying the city. I have always been a believer in the existence of alien life, and I have always wanted to see some evidence of it. Since it happened, I have had second thoughts about what it really was. However, it is something that I cannot dismiss because the experience stays with me, and the objects were metallic. I did run to the front of the house to see more after they passed by, but they had disappeared. I thought this unusual too because of the speed by which they disappeared. My eleven-year-old son, who was inside the house, heard me remark about them, and he ran to the front of the house before I did. He saw them for an instant, and he agrees that the objects were not birds, but rather some kind of solid objects that disappeared in a flash. Also, they made absolutely no noise, and I found that to be unusual considering the rate of speed at which the objects traveled. They passed within several feet of the front of my house. I certainly would have heard a noise if they made one. I must say that UFO experiences are very mystifying simply because they catch one offguard and happen so quickly. You do not have time to collect your thoughts.  Then, you experience self-doubt because what you&#39;ve seen violates the known laws of physics, traveling a distance of a half mile to one mile in seconds without any noise or observable means of propulsion. They looked to be gliding in a smooth pattern but at a very rapid speed. I cannot imagine how the objects I saw were man-made. They moved too fast, without any noise, without any engine glow, and without any exhaust. The three or four objects looked like highly polished silver/copper-colored oblong objects. They flew in perfect unison and moved very rapidly. I will never forget how amazed I was with the ! rich-loo king metallic appearance of the objects. It was a beautiful metallic color that I had not seen before. The objects looked very well-designed with an appearance of substance and strength. I am just now reporting this incident because it is something that I cannot forget. I often times think about how strange the metallic objects were, and I believe it is worthwhile reporting something that I consider to be other-worldly, especially after thinking about it for so long.

When this object was in view out my side driver window, it sort of came out of the haze and I knew it wasn&#39;t birds. It was a large black mass and as it moved easterly, it was again surrounded by this haze in the sky and disappeared in it. I carry my camera in my purse now, in hopes that i see something phenomonal, and took it out to snap the pic when it was highly visible out my side driver window. Snapped the pic and nothing happened. Looked down and seen that my batteries had fallen out. Jeezzzzzzzz! This has never happened before and this is a somewhat new camera. By the time I put the batteries back, in the object was gone.

It was white and had a little red (looked like a light) towards the top. It was at 6:30 p.m EST. It was about 23 degreese out at the time. It was moving pretty fast, I was getting the camera as fast as I could but didn&#39;t make it in time to get a picture. It was just traveling in a straight line (N.W as I said above) and was kinda hard to see. Very small looking from where I was standing. I didn&#39;t notice anything else really, I first saw it when I was standing out by my dad&#39;s van and when I looked up it was there.<n>

I was fixing to leave when I looked up and notice a light in the sky.  I thought at first that it was a star but I notice that it was kind of cloudy and you wouldn&#39;t be able to see any stars that night. I told my friend to take a look he just said it was porbably just a plane.  But it just stayed in that one spot for at least 5 to 10 min. Then it started to move in an upward movement and gradually picked up speed intill it was out of site. I don&#39;t know much about planes but from the ones I&#39;ve seen they have more than just one light on them and they have on e that flashes. The object I saw was just a circle of light.<n>

I was trying to see what they were and trying to stay on the road.  They were traveling very fast and traveling very closely, in a south, southeast direction. One higher and one nearer to the ground.  As I passed the higher land, I lost sight of them.  When I parked my vehicle outside my home, which is on a higher elevation than where I was traveling, I no longer saw them.  I went inside my home to do my evening chores for my animals.  At about 7:00 PM, when I was walking my dogs back to my house I saw bright flashing red strobe type lights (VERY BRIGHT) on probably what is Mt Lincoln in NH.  By the time I went to my barn, at about 7:15 PM EST, they were gone.  I am a very sensible person.  Is anyone out there???<n>
3/8/01 17:30|Portland|OR|Sphere|10 minutes|100 or so golden spheres hovering and moving up and down in a corkscrew fashion in bright sun.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17841.html|237|ndxe200103| 100 or so golden spheres hovering and moving up and down in a corkscrew fashion in bright sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 8th, 2001, around 5:30 PM, I walked out of my office into the parking lot to look at the ominous cloud formations that had been massing that afternoon. They were kind of unusual, in that they were large, opaque forms that looked like the kind in Maxfield Parrish paintings. Our office is on highway 43, which looks out in a North Easterly direction (Mt. Hood is East of where we are). I looked at the very dark cloud behind the shopping center across the street, and noticed what looked like a huge swarm of birds slowly hovering around in a kind of slow, corkscrew pattern. I watched for 30 seconds or so, and called for a couple of office mates to come see the swarm. Two co-workers came out, and I asked them what they thought we were looking at. We sort of decided that we were looking at 100 or so golden spheres. They moved in the way flocks of birds do in relation to each other (though even more so the way embers from a fire slowly waft skyward.) There appeared to be no visible wings, and they made no particular sound, so only nearby traffic could be heard. The orbs sort of drifted, corkscrew-like, up and down the column-like concentration of orbs that hovered around the &#34;center&#34; of the group. The sun was very bright, and not blocked, and the rays fully hit the spheres, making it hard to discern what they actually were. The sun made the cloud behind the orbs particularly dark and smokey-looking, and one could not see through it. This event lasted about 10 minutes, until all the orbs had drifted into cloud cover, and as cloud cover moved over them. Since we couldn&#39;t get a photo, I have tried to re-create what I saw in Photoshop. Though I can&#39;t produce the intensity of light coming from the sun (right corner of the picture) nor can I accurately reproduce the cloud formations, this &#34;painting&#34; pretty much re-creates what we saw. The sky was bright blue, and these huge cloud banks were moving rather swiftly across the sky. The dark clouds had that weird greenish-grey tinge that they get when a tornado is coming (or threatening.) Everything was very brightly lit, as on a cloudless summer day. It was hard to tell exactly how many spheres we were looking at, since it was bright, and all the orbs were drifting around each other. I don&#39;t know if this was reported in the media, or even if anyone else saw this grouping. I would love to know if someone else so the orbs actually doing something, or know where they went next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  An illustration was included with the report.  The cluster of small objects, in our opinion, is reminiscent of a swarm of flying insects.  However, how the flight of insects could be mistaken for the flight of a flock of birds is not clear to us.  We may include the illustration here, and the reader can make his/her own decision on the matter.  No other reports from the Portland for this incident.  PD))<n>

Moved with intellegence<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident hapened a few days after we got plowed with a couple feet of snow in march of 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Iam glad I have a place to post this because what happened was very strange. I hope this is not too long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in wayland my whole life and live adjacent to miles of conservation land. No one knows these woods as well as I do because I have been out there almost everyday of every season since the early 1980s. There are no conservation trails in this area and does not see any traffic from dog walkers or hikers. The area is sort of swampy which I think helps keep people away. Its the kind of area that if you know your way it can take you five minutes to get to a point that would take someone else an hour to get to. I love it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway. There sure is history out there in those woods. European settlers have been in that exact spot since the early 1640s. My woods was home to one of the original families. They were millers and provided timber for most of the early town works. But unusually they were quite far from their neighbors. Also there is an ancient fishing site thousands of years old well within walking distance. This site was also intricate in the king Philip Indian insurgency and the revolutionary war. This is a brief history of what I know about my woods out there. Maybe this pertains? At about 1.00 am I was in my yard letting my dog relieve himself before bedtime. Looking out into the forest I noticed a light, that looked to me like a candle being walked around through the trees at waist length. Knowing that there are no houses in that direction and that there should be no one walking in the woods at night I became curious and went with my dog about 30 yards in, past my yard to get a better look. I couldn’t see much but something was happening out there. The flickers of light I was seeing had no explanation, had never been there before, and shouldn’t have been there at all. But I could still hardly make them out, there was a hundred yards between us and lots of trees. I went inside woke up a family member and told them there were people in the woods with candles or flashlights. We went into the yard but the small flicker of lights didn’t impress enough to go out there and check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my friend heard about this from me and begged me to go out there with him at around the same time, I agreed. We bundled up, I grabbed a B.B. rifle(makes me feel safer) and we headed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately we saw the same thing I had seen the night before, small flickering through the trees just above ground level. We were about 300 yards in when suddenly there was like a camera flashbulb going of in front of us deep in the woods,  about another 80 yards in front of us. Then one way to the right of the last flash, but still in front of us, then a flash to the left. Real bright flashes. The flashes then started flashing towards us. We were talking to each other saying &#34;you’re seeing this, right?&#34; There were about 30 separate flashes from different directions in front of us gradually getting closer and closer. One flashed about 3 feet from my face. It looked like someone struck a huge match of different colors but it was not fire, it was all of a sudden light from nowhere. They flashed about twice the size of a basketball and the one that flashed next to my face seemed like slow motion. When it flashed there was slow motion. that’s the best I can explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I looked at each other and ran back to the house as fast as we could out of sheer terror.(I should have stayed but my stomach got very queasy) When we got back to my yard. We talked about what we saw and decided it would be stupid not to go back out and really experience and try to interact and get to the bottom of the &#34;ORBS&#34; that just seemed to display at least some intelligence by coming directly to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked in complete darkness back to the exact spot we had 25 minutes earlier seen the orbs. No flashes or peeks of light through the woods greeted us. We couldn’t believe they were gone. So we went farther. When we reached about 3 quarters of a mile into the woods(significantly farther than the initial experience)we saw light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost to the top of one of the oldest trees in the woods(an old field corner marker next to a stone wall)were 3 Huge orb lights circling this tree!!! We were about 25 yards away and they were suddenly in very clear view, literally in perfect view of us. They were about 6ft by 6ft and one was slightly larger and had a slightly different tint than the others they made no sound. We watched in shock, from an excellent vantage point for what felt like it was 10 minutes. I still had the B.B gun and we took turns looking through the scope at them for an even better view. They were totally unnatural and foreign to anything I had ever seen before. They had a natural very bright bio luminescence sort of look to them but the spheres themselves did look metallic. They slowly circled, lucidly, near the top of the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started panicking about how we might start to get out of there. Continuing to face them we backed away. I turned and started running as fast as I could. When I turned to look back all three orbs had stopped circling the tree and had begun to follow us in a single file 10-12ft above ground. They were slow and didn’t catch up to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran all the way back to the yard non stop.  In my yard we were safe.  We kneeled down panting, relaying to each other what had just happened. We had not said a peep to each other during the whole encounter trying not to give ourselves away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t seen anything similar out there since. Not even the initial flashbulb things through the trees no matter how deep I am out there. But in that spot, where the tree they circled is located the branches of all the surrounding trees are bent in the same direction in a very odd and obvious way. This, like the rest of the story is very hard to explain. Never the less it happened and it proved to me that there is much more out there that still is unexplained by modern science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have had a similiar encounter or have questions email me at ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was not involved in this incident, and am just going on hearsay.  I also heard that two of the deputies were so traumatized by their experience that they had to sign out for the night and take the rest of the shift off.  From what I can determine there was an object hovering over the Power Plant in Clover.  I also have heard that the deputies attempted to take several photographs.  (again hearsay) Two of the deputies went to get a different angle to observe the object, but when they entered an open field, the entire field lit up (as if it were a football field on the night of a game) (these were the two traumatized deputies).  The Power Plant had a meeting about this event the next morning (known for a fact) but nobody is talking.  I just thought this might be an event that someone would want to investigate further, since there were 5+ representative of the Halifax SO to witness this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by anonymous source.

I ran quickly to the door and watched as it moved. It was only visible at that point inbetween the tree tops but each space affording a clear view. It was yellow/orange and seemed very lively like it was pulsating the colors I saw. There was no sound at all. This was very intense! Something sooo real about it .....no fantasy for sure.<n>

We were in Santa Monica, CA, aproximatelly 7 blocks from the beach and looked West and saw like a glow in the sky.  It was definitelly not an airplane as we know what airplane look like as we have the LAX and SM airports close to us.  As a matter of fact, we saw an airplane go by with it&#39;s blinking light clearly identifiable. Initially, this object moved back and forth (did not go in a straing line in one direction) for what seemed like a minute.  It did not look like a helicopter moving either.  All of a sudden it started moving north-west and it even created some sparks (the same as a broken mufler that&#39;s dragged on the pavement) and then it disappeard behind the homes in our view.

The color dropped off in a gradient, brightest in the center and progressively dimmer towards the boundary of the diamond shape. The diamond shape was thinner in width than in height. It hovered, and moved non-linearly. The size was approximately the diameter of a cigarette at arms length. While I was watching the object, I had a feeling like I knew where it was going to move, or that it was moving in such a way as to manifest my expectations. At this point I got very agitated, and went into the next room to wake up a friend. By the time we looked out the window I could no longer see the object anywhere in the sky. by this time it was about 12 or 12:01 am 3-7-01. I am a student at the local junior college majoring in mathematics. I know enough physics to know that this object wasn&#39;t using standard principals of aerodynamic lift, at least as we know them.<n>

It had a long tail of yellow sparks. The sighting lasted for only a couple of seconds as it was moving very fast. Within approx 15 seconds of my sighting, I heard over my scanner one of our local police officers say &#34;Did anyone else see that?&#34; A second police officer replied &#34;That&#39;s a big affirmative&#34; The skies were very overcast last night and I felt like the blue flash was the object reflecting off the underside of the clouds.<n>

I watched it move N and it just faded away and I could not see it anymore.  I had been sitting there maybe 30 seconds.  The total sighting was about 4 minutes.  Just wanted you to know that at your urging on the phone today, I did call our little local newspaper.  He said that he had gotten a call about 2 wks ago from someone who had seen something very similar.  He is planning on putting something in the paper (without names) and I urged him to list your website and your phone number.  I also told him that you recommended a tripod and getting time, sight duration, and direction detail.  He also said that my description was absolutely identical to the sighting that our local police officer and friend had about 13 years ago here.  Identical.  13 years ago was when Belleville had a large, large amt of sightings.<n>

We had heard from friends which area it was sighted in and drove down that road (SW of Belleville).  At 8:02pm, rounding a corner and going west, we finally saw what our friends were talking about!  Bright, bright light, subtley changing from white to yellow to orange and was located on the passenger side of the car.  It was moving slowly, towards the north, it looked like.  Decided to stop at the stop sign to film it and get it sighted in with the binoculars.  As my sister in law was coming to a stop, my brother in law (drivers side backseat) started to get out.  Unfortunately, he got out before she was actually stopped and somehow his foot got under the car and under the cars tire, twisting his whole leg.  He was in a great deal of pain and couldn&#39;t tell us what had happened for several seconds.  He got out of the car to get control of himself and looked up and saw that the light in the sky had disappeared!  Both of us in the front seat looked and sure enough it had vanished from sight.  My brother in law later removed his shoe and sock to find much blood and a huge piece of skin ripped off his foot (about the size of small apple).  A day later he is nursing a very sore leg, especially the twisted thigh area. He is lucky not to have a broken leg. Strange happenings.  After going back to their house, I got in my car and rode back out to the area.  I didn&#39;t expect to see anything, but didn&#39;t have anything better to do that nite.  I did see it again and I have filled out another report of yours detailing. Later that night after going home, there was a helicopter that went over really, really low over my house, N of Belleville.  This is out of the norm.<n>

It almost looked like one giant sparkler.  The object moved only slightly and we were again looking west to northwest.  We did not watch it as much as we had the two previous nights, but tonight everytime we would watch it, it would get larger then smaller with it always being bright in color (red, blue, yellow).  There was a halo around it as well.  During the time we saw it, there was a plane that seemed to pass underneath it.  Nothing happened, just that we noticed a plane going by it.<n>

We came around a corner and saw a very bright light about a half mile away very low to the ground. When we first saw it, it was hovering over a hill top and shining a beam of light on the ground. We stopped the car to watch it for a moment. It then began to come towards us. We started moving again and it moved very fast to the other side of the road. As we traveled, it continued to move around us. At one point it stopped and hovered by us about 100 yards away. That is when I got a good look at it. In the distance it looked like a very bright light. Up close it looked like a saucer with a dome on the top of it. It was silver in color and emitted this very bright light from it. It made no sound that I could detect. It is very hard to describe the exact size of it, but it appeared to me to be at least the size of a house. Not humongous, but notsmall either. By then I was very scared and wanted to get away from the object. My daughter said she would keep an eye on it so that I could drive faster. We had at least 8 more miles to go and the thing continued to follow us all the way to the interstate. It stayed in the area for at least another minute and then vanished. I drove as quickly as I could to get to my friends house where I called my husband. He said that he would go out and look around. He called me later and said he had spoke to a friend of his that lives in the area of the sighting and that he had seen some jets flying through the canyon like they were looking for something.<n>

I was in the passenger side front seat. We were not too far from the Johnson Space center. I happened to look up and saw this Triangular craft approximately 2 or 3 thousand feet high. . To me it looked like a equilateral triangle. It appeared quite large but was difficult to estimate. It was black or almost dark grayish in color&gt; It hovered for a short length of time then took off with such speed it was out of sight like a light turned on and off. The skie was fairly clear with a few scattrered clouds.<n>

The two men were traveling in a car, watching it. It had crossed the highway from the leftside, moving to the right. It was moving very slowly, almost hanging over the highway for a while.   One of the men thought that it should be moving faster and be out of site when compared to commercial planes.  It was fairly low in the sky, a little higher than treetop level, he thought about a block high.  They pulled the car over to the side and stopped to listen. There was no sound coming from it.  It continued drifting slowly until it went past a bunch of trees and then it suddenly either took off extremely fast or just disappeared.   It was angling in the direction of the Duluth Air Force Base which has been officially closed for quite some time. (Although there is some activity, I think Air National Guard stuff happening there. There have been some fighter jet activity around there, since the Sept. ll attack.) The craft was triangluar shaped, except in the back it wasn&#39;t a straight line , like a true trianglar, but was indented some.<n>

I called my sister in law who lives in the same town as I do and went to her house to pick her up, arriving at 8:33.  We could see this bank of lights from her front porch, west, seemed to change (subtle) from white to yellow to orangish.  It was moving very slowly and seemed to be traveling north.  When I say &#34;bank of lights&#34; I mean horizontal and wide.  Comparing the size to a planet in the sky, it was about 6-8 planets of size, but maybe not quite as bright.  I can&#39;t say that I could necessarily count lights on it tho.  Just a bank of lights.  We got in my car and traveled toward New Glarus, watching it on the way.  We could see it up until we got over a high hill on the way to New Glarus just outside of Belleville, when we started to get down into the valley, we lost it and did not see it again.  This was the first incident that my sister in law and I have witnessed.  Two more reports to follow this in which the sightings occurred the next night.<n>

The direction was again west to northwest.  The shape was flat on the left side and to the right side it was like flames shooting out.  We quit watching for a couple of minutes and went back to look at it and it looked the same except for it rotated and was flat on the right side with flames on the left side.  This was all through binoculars. We took a ride into town to look at it from a different direction and it rotated again so that it was flat on the left side with what looked to be flames on the right side, but now there was a bright yellow round object out in front of the flames on the right side.  It contained red, blue and yellow bright colors.  By 20:30 it started to fade and finally went out of sight.<n>

It would circle and then hover, circle and then hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were driving to Lubbock, TX.  I had been asleep.  When I woke, I noticed a very strange airplane flying low to the ground.  It would circle and then hover, circle and then hover.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter though; it was a long aircraft with wings far back on the tail.  I said to my husband, &#34;What is that weird plane?&#34;  He said that he didn&#39;t know, but he&#39;d been watching it for sometime. He told me to watch because it would seemingly stop right in mid-air--which is what I had observed it doing. It seemed to be circling the highway, but keeping up with the traffic that was north-bound.  It was a clear day; few clouds.  No rain.  Other motorists appeared to be watching the craft was well.  It eventually took off very rapidly southward and disappeared. Our background--husband is a professor; I am a writer.  This is the first sighting for my husband.  My 2nd-- the previous happened 35 years ago. We think it may have been some kind of test plane for the gov&#39;t.  Lubbock Tx occasionally experiences tremendous sonic booms.  The testing may have come from Reese Airforce Base at one time,. but it&#39;s closed now.  I don&#39;t know where this craft would have orginated from.<n>

The object seemed to stay in the same place.  I called a neighbor and he said that he couldn&#39;t see it because of trees in his yard but his brother in law had seen the same type of object earlier (unknown if earlier was earlier that night or another day).  My neighbor immediately asked if I had seen the different colored lights that I previously described.  After speaking with my neighbor, the object seemed to either move further in the distance or had dropped and then faded out of sight.  The object had 5 or 6 very long and sharp pointed arms.  The red and blue lights were around the center.<n>

I saw, what at first appeared to be a shooting star, but it wasn&#39;t. It was almost identical to a regular star, but it didn&#39;t flash. It was moving at a very fast speed, and making a sound similar to an airplane, but I can reassure you that it was going much to fast even to be a concorde. It moved in an almost straight path, but zig-zagged slightly up and down as it was moving, it finally just disappeared. I would like you to acknowledge that I am of sound mind.<n>

She ran in and told my husband and myself. We went outside in the front yard facing the south western direction in the sky and it was very visible to the naked eye. We grabbed the binoculars and looked thru them, it was evident it was not a flying craft that would be recgonized from any military instalation that is known to us. This craft hoovered in the same spot for a very long time, about 20 minates before I decided to call the FBI. I was told to call the local police dept 911. I did so and one police car showed up within 4 minates of the call. Then he got out and looked thru the binoculars and while doing so another showed up. The first officer then went to his car and made a call, then without saying a word drove off like he was in a race. The second officer stayed there with us but walked away for a second to his car and made a call as well, at that time another police car showed up. The third officer got out of the car and looked thru the binoculars as well and went over to the second officer and talked to him. Then about 2 minates later the first car showed back up and jumped out and told me and my daughter who is 13 yrs old, that it was a weather balloon. I knew it was not as this crqft hoovered in the same spot now for almost an hour and the shape of it was like a disk laying down, then about 30 minates later it changed like it had flip to the side. It was now lookimg sidways. About 10 minates after that another light of the same sort showed up right below it. I knew at this time this was not a weather balloon. But they (the officers) would not tell me where this was being reported to. I asked if I could follow this investigation and was denied. Then all 3 of the officers took off. The crafts stayed hoovered about 1 and a half hours longer and then dissapeared. It was very obvious that this was not a weather ballon. I went on the websites to look up weather balloons and nothing I foun! d looked anything like what we saw. Thank you for listening to our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be lucid and serious in her description of the object.  Our first suspicion is that they might have been looking at a celestial body, but she insisted that such was not the case.  No photograph was taken of the object, apparently, in the course of the approximately 3 hours that it reportedly was observed.  PD))<n>

One object was very close to the ground and 2 others at high altitude above it.  Lights would disappear and then reappear in different areas.  Lights were orange the color of streetlights and about 3 times brighter than landing lights.  I estimate objects at about 15 miles from williams gateway airport at about 20-30 degrees from where I was standing-except for the one which was close to the ground.  Sighting occurred in the desert.  Pretty flat, and farmers fields all around.(schnepf farms) is pretty close. No mountains around the lights, and no military ranges. I have video of the objects.<n>

(Just so you realize the context of this story, and the fact that NONE of us were under the influence of anything chemical.) I was the featured speaker for a meeting at a clubhouse that hosts meetings of our organization. During my talk, which was about my life and how I got sober, I happened to mention, humorously, that I had always felt like an alien in my family, and in the world. I even had a little alien doll with me that my daughter had given me as a joke. After my talk, which ended at 8:30PM CST, I was standing around inside the building chatting with some of my fellow recovering folk, when one of our brethren came into the room where we were and yelled: &#34;Hey, (my name)...Your people are here!!!&#34; Several of us went outside to see what our friend was yelling about. To our surprise, hovering over Lake Mendota, very close to the house, four light objects were hovering silently. They hovered in a staggered formation for a few moments, almost like motorcylists riding on a highway. One broke away from the the others and drifted slowly toward the roof of a large apartment building next to our clubhouse. It hovered over the apartment roof for a few moments, winked out abruptly, and just as abruptly reappeared with the other three again. All four objects pulsated, changed colors, and alternately grew dimmer and brighter as we watched them. There were no noises associated with them, although several of our group were noisily making jokes about them. We were all pretty amazed, albeit somewhat skeptical, and thoroughly curious. Eventually, one by one, they all grew very dim and disappeared from our view. The even took approximately 10 minutes. There were roughly about 20 of us in the parking lot. I would estimate the distance between us and the lights to be about a quarter of a mile...maybe. It&#39;s hard to judge distances at night, particularly in that neighborhood. I do not know what the lights were or what they might have meant. I accepted the e! vent as either explainable, or else God having a bit of fun with me, since I had mentioned feeling like an alien.<n>

When he needs to go outside at night, he usually waits until my husband or myself gets out of bed to use the washroom. My dog never barks unless he hears strange noises or someone comes to the door. Because of this, I thought him barking was due to something he heard downstairs. I didn&#39;t think anything of it. Seeing as I was awake, I sat up and he jumped off the bed and headed to the door of the bedroom, which means he wants to go outside. I had left the light on out back. I opened the door leading to the deck and watched him while I waited for him to finish. He had just been neutered the day before so I was watching him very closely to make sure he wasn&#39;t trying to remove his stitches. He walked down the deck and looked in a South Eastern direction. I kept watching him for about 20 seconds when I looked up and saw an incredibly bright light. The street lights on our main road are orange in colour and this thing was bright bright white. Because my husband and I had gone to his mother&#39;s for her birthday on the weekend, our camcorder just happened to be close by, so I grabbed the camera and video taped the light. When I was zooming in, I noticed that there were smaller lights next to the huge ball of white lights, but didn&#39;t see it until I watch the footage after. I tried squinting to see the huge object better because I didn&#39;t have my glasses on and I had just woken up. I noticed that it was round and had 4 large lights on top and 4 large lights on the bottom. The smaller lights next to the big one had two blinking red and blue lights, one white light underneath, and two other white light under the single light. There was also one small white light to the side of this last cluster. I don&#39;t know if these clusters were stars (too bright for stars in my opinion, plus they disappeared) or a reflection. I filmed this with the door open, and I couldn&#39;t hear any strange sounds other than the usual sounds at that time of night. I decided to go and get my glasses from upstairs so I could make out how many lights there were. I shut the camera off, put it down on my counter and turned to shut the patio door, when I noticed the light was gone. I picked up the camera again and filmed where it was. The small cluster was still there so I filmed that. I also filmed this morning, to compare where I had seen the lights to make sure it wasn&#39;t something that I was forgetting, like a baseball field etc...the only thing around that area is trees, trees and more trees....oh and one street light, which cannot be seen from my back deck.<n>

I was riding passenger and my girlfriend was driving.  I looked out the passenger window and saw a red light in the sky, heading diagonally to our direction.  After watching it a few seconds, it changed course to parallel ours and headed south for a few seconds, then resumed it&#39;s original course, then headed south and then it&#39;s original course again.  The object was making incredibly smooth course corrections, with no jerky motion like a helicopter, and I didn&#39;t understand why it was jigging right and left. After it crossed in front of us (and my girlfriend saw it too), it came alongside what looked like a dark spot in the sky.  We could see three white lights marking htree points of a triangle, a huge one.  It looked a little like the &#34;arrowhead&#34; ships from the Start Wars movies.  We could make out the outline, and we could not see through it (the night was perfectly clear, and in the rural area we were in, we could see all the starts in the sky).  The triangle was &#34;pointed&#34; west, left-to-right base-to-point. We pulled into a convenience store in Hooper.  I got out and looked back over the grain elevators where we had seen the triangle, and still couldn&#39;t see any stars.  I did notice that there was a police officer parked at the convenience store as well, with his dome light on, and he was looking to the north (the direction we had just come from).<n>

The night went as follows:  My 2 friends and I were driving NNW on Highway 161 near Puyallup, WA when we saw an bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of approx. 5500&#39; above sea level. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it&#39;s propulsion system(i.e. afterburner flames,exhaust,etc.)  I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either.(Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations.)  We followed it until it disappeared from sight approx.60-70 miles away.  It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed.  The object &#34;blinked-out&#34; at about 70 miles away.  One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations.  Also, judging by its flight path, it most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also.  The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was overhead. I am more than willing to talk about it further.  Please call with any other questions.  Thank you for your services.<n>

Stayed motionless in the evening sky ( clear evening, minimal cloud ) alttitude about 2000 feet. The size of the triangle was quite large, much lager than any existing airliner ( which it was not !! )nor a helicopter. These lights remained stationry for at least 6 minutes, and then one by one went out. This object has been seen at least 3 times over our town in a month. Local residents have seen it gliding silently, and low ( anout 500 feet ) over houses before going out to sea. We are baffled. I am an aircraft enthusiast, used to observing them. This object was like NOTHING I have ever observed. No obvious military or MOD activity in the area. My wife observed this as well..we are both baffled<n>

I was standing on the north side of the home I was living in at that time. The front of my home faceies the west and sits just to the east of the aircrafe approch to the Huntsville internation airport. I see small to very larg air craff daily. I had step out on the front porch for a smoke  and decided to stept in to the shadows on the norht side of the house to releave my self. As I stood there, facing north looking stright up in the night sky, a full moon with what seam to be a thin clod cover apeard just 15 deg. (approxaly) to the right of were I was looking.For the first few secands (1 or 2 maybe 3) I did not realize that the moon was to for north form were it normal path is. Then I notice also how fast it was travling for east to west. It took a approxaly 15 to 20 secands to go from 15 degs to my right to 15 degs to my left. Then it disapered completly. I told my wife of what I had seen and one or two others. I supose it may have be a reflexion, but who knows what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I returned from work late one evening, I saw a UFO as I was standing in the Freshman parking lot. This parking lot is over a hill and out of sight (or shouting distance) from the rest of campus. I was the only person in the vicinity at the time. What follows is my best remembrance of the event. I saw a vertical disc shaped object (symmetrically rounded on both sides). It was smooth and dark colored and had dim lights on the rim. It seemed to be moving by rotating slowly like an upright wheel. It was almost totally silent although there seemed to be a very slight humming noise. It was very low in the air, seemingly only a few hundred yards above my head, and so I could see it&#39;s outline quite clearly although the object itself was very dark and only dimly lit. It appeared quite large to me although I had nothing to judge it&#39;s size against and I could not tell for certain how far above me it was. It came from the direction of the town of Clarion and and it eventually passed out of sight as it continued ENE over the woods (state game lands 74).  The whole experience lasted about a minute and I was very clear-headed throughout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife called me upstairs to look at the strange lights in the sky across the valley.  There were 4 bright orange/yellow brightly glowing balls of light.  The lights remained perfectly fixed.  I have a telescope set up. I  looked at the light and they were perfectly round, no wings or other support structures several times brighter than any light in the Las Vegas valley. After about three minutes of viewing, the lights still had not moved, I noticed jet fighters take off from Nellis AFB and go toward the lights. The fighters turned toward the lights and appeared to be on a course toward the lights.  The fighters had to traverse about 2/3 of the valley to get to the lights.  When they were half way to the lights the highest light blinked out, about 15 seconds latter two more lights blinked out at the same time and the fourth light went out about 5 seconds latter.  The jet fighter flew to where the lights were and then appeared to go in circles for the next five minutes before returning to the base.  As the fighter was searching the area two helicopters also moved into the area.  I believe the helicopters came from the North Las Vegas airport.<n>

Indialantic, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting a sighting from 2001 in the town of Indialantic Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late one evening, I was outside on the patio of the home in which I was living with roommates. I was startled by the sound of jets flying very low overhead, coming from East to West from the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like anyone would, I looked up instantly to see two military jets, with a spherical object between and slightly behind the (2) aircraft. My first impression was that the object was attached and was being towed by the jets. At this point I called a roommate and his mother outside to witness this as well. One of the jets turned South, and the other turned North. The object moved further behind the northbound aircraft and followed it out of site(toward Patrick airforce base). Seconds later a third military jet flew over and continued west, until out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a description of the object. It was about twice the height of the tail fins on the aircraft. The object was perfectly spherical, transparent, and emanating a blue light. We were clearly able to see what I could best describe as blue plasma, or thick blue and white smoke roiling inside a transparent sphere. It was like looking at a flying crystal ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I make no assumption as to what it was, however I know beyond doubt what we saw, and that the military is aware of it. Regardless of its origin, it was very much out of place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to talk to someone who has had a similar experience; it really is almost impossible to believe unless you experience it for yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

At first my friend thought it was a UFO of some sort,  but when we looked it had disappeared behind a building, out of sight.  Assuming he had seen an aeroplane from the local airport and not a UFO, we took no notice and continued with our business.  When I processed the film I saw an object that was not a aeroplane but more of a disc shape.  The event has shocked both me and my friend and I haven&#39;t been getting much sleep recently either.  i have never believed in all that &#39;X-Files&#39; rubbish before, but now i truely believe what we saw was something either secretly produced by the government or indeed something from outer space.<n>

But then I noticed it was moving very very slowly, and it wasn&#39;t being whipped around.  It was hovering over the building about 6 feet or so, and ever so slowly moving north, staying the exact same distace up in the air.  Then I also noticed that there was no reflection coming off of it, which was also strange, since the sun was shining right on it.  And it was jet-black.  It continued along the top of those two building, and then went across a rather large football field - all the while moving extremely slowly and at the same height off the ground - never once being whipped by the wind or changing its oval shape.  I watch it for some time as it went into the distance.  To this day I can&#39;t think of any know object that fits that description.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I want to come forward with a complete report of my sightings which occurred on 3/1/01 at 04:50. I am a construction contractor, 43 years old and have lived at ((town deleted)), Oregon all of my life. I spend much time out doors, camping out hiking and star gazing. My home elevation is 1100 feet and I see passenger jets fly over all the time. (and military) I see them fly over in various cloud formations and at night I have studyied them with their fog lights on, rays pointing downwards at the forward angle. The luminance is yellow in the cloud ceiling and one inch long at arms length. During the day, passenger jets average 1/4&#34; to 1/8&#34; inch at arms length. The speed of the passenger jets is quite slow. The object I saw that early morning was 2&#34; inches at arms lenght and was moving fast in the ceiling at about eleven thousand feet. I saw the clouds passing under it and the brightness was like a white sixty watt flourescence with a hue of blue. And a faint red was glowing at the center through the mist. I heard no sound, it was traveling North with one light in the forward position. The three lights were about 3/8&#34; inch in diameter at arms length. After seeing this thing I immediately went out side with a flash light and saw to my West other lights at an angle of about 30 degrees. They were an odd arrangement of lights, 2&#34; inches at arms length. Small bright green lights one red, and I saw a white light not flash but pulse only once at the trailing end as it moved behind the tree tops. As it moved North, I heard a faint low rumble. I continued studying the sky and could see the brightest stars shining through the ceiling and there were small breaks in the clouds. I saw a triangle of lights directly over my head, 1 1/4&#34; inch at arms length, brighter than the other stars and I was suspicious of this and watched them for about 15 seconds when suddenly a bright flash occurred at the center of the triangle. all three lights just blinked out. I studyied the sky for about a half hour after that, but saw no oth! er movin g objects. At day break I noticed the clouds to be at about eleven thousand to thirteen thousand feet above the surrounding mountains. In my back yard, Mt Horeb is directly North of my house at two and a half miles and is 4212&#39; feet high. The object I saw that early morning, flew directly over its position.<n>

When the car got close to the light, just close enough to see the triangular shaped outline, it took off at high speed heading south towards Klamath Falls.  We drove the rest of the way home.  When we got out of the car, we looked back in the direction that they went, and we saw some craft heading north at extremely high speed, this craft looked to be the shape of a lopsided triangle and had about five to seven varicolored flashing lights along the outline.  Soon afterward, an identical craft appeared heading the same direction.  This one however was flying in a high speed zigzag pattern.  When the craft were overhead, all of the neighborhood dogs began barking. (this may or may not be a result of the craft flying overhead) We watched the craft untill they dissapeared over the north horizon.  I have grown up around Kingsley air force base, and have seen all manner of jets and helicopters and these behaved like none of those that I had ever seen.<n>
