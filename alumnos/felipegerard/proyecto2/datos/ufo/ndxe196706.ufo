Lewis, Washington in the summer of 1967, and was practicing setting up a squad perimeter defense at night.  A buddy and I were assigned a ‘foxhole’ and told to watch out for the ‘enemy’.  We were basically just lying around in the depression that was our ‘foxhole’, listening and watching for anyone approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and there were no lights or vegetation, other than grass, nearby, so the sky was broad and full of stars.  We saw at least one satellite go across the sky, i.e. a point of light looking like a star, but traveling in a straight line and a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed, practically straight up, three points of light that came from different directions approaching each other.  They looked very high, and no different than the satellite or the stars.  They stopped at equal distances from each other, sort of forming a triangle, and hovered there.  After a short time, they each streaked off in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My buddy and I agreed not to say anything about the sighting because we didn’t need or want any hassle from the Army or anyone else.  I’ve always just told myself that we saw what we saw, and I didn’t need anyone telling me we didn’t see it.  I’m reporting it now because I’m getting older and might die at any time.  I just thought other UFO followers would like to know about it.  I don’t have anything else to say about it, here or at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The Milky Way was overhead and extremely brilliant. It must have been a new moon and I lived in a small country town so there were no lights and lots of stars. My father was in the garage working on his car when my boyfriend and I came back early from a date. We parked in the yard away from the house and decided to lie on his hood and see who could find and name the most constellations. We were parked facing an easterly direction. I was looking toward the south and my boyfriend toward the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly he grabbed me and said, &#34;Look there.&#34;  At first I didn’t see anything.  Then my eye caught a movement under the starry sky.  No lights, no sound.  It appeared to be 7 disc-shaped objects flying in a tight V formation.  There were 3 discs on one side and 4 on the other, so not even.  Or at least it appeared that way.  We weren’t sure if it was one object or seven.  The only reason we could see it was because the star light reflected from the bottom and the fact that it moved across the star scape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we had no perspective we could not tell how far above it was.  But I saw it at about 11 O’Clock (my left) and it moved very quickly to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it left, we listened for a few seconds but heard nothing.  I yelled for my Dad but he didn’t come out in time.  Something that I feel is very significant is that the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville at that very time had the Apollo missile.  I remember a big to-do about transporting it to Florida.  Also, my father who worked for IBM had just been told he was being transferred with the contract to Cape Kennedy.  I have always felt there was some kind of connection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The bottom was straight and the top was round like a half shaped moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the other navy controller I was working with &#34;Doesn’t the moon look different tonight?&#34;  He responded the moon is behind us.

We stepped out onto the tower catwalk to make sure it wasn’t a reflection from the tower windows and the light inside the tower cab.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for around 6 or 7 minutes.  We were ready to report it when we heard on the tower speakers from Clark AFB they scrambled jet fighters on UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object get smaller and smaller and disappear, never changing direction.

My fiancée and I were driving south on Waukegan Road in Glenview, Illinois and saw a large, (about the size of the moon when it is midway up in the sky), round glowing object hovering high over the road about ½ mile in front of us. There was no noise from this object.   Everyone was out of their cars, including the police. All traffic was stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was so bright, all that could be seen was light. It hovered there for such a long time, that we finally had to leave. I’m going say it was there for at least ten to fifteen minutes before we left. I remember saying to my fiancée that we would find out about what happened the next morning, because it would definitely be in the newspaper or on TV.  There was no way that this could go unreported, because the police and 25 - 30 people were standing in the middle of Waukegan Road watching the incident. There was no report in the paper, or on the news the following days. FYI, the Glenview Naval Air Station was about four or five miles from this spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later, I tried contacting J. Alan Hynek, but he had died. I believe I contacted his office and they said they had no report of this, but that was probably 15 - 20 years after the occurrence.  It was so extraordinary, I can’t believe there wasn’t a report to someone. I’ll never forget the sight of this, and will always wonder what it was. Someone suggested a flare, but it was so large, hovering in one spot for so long, and didn’t move the entire time, so another person in the crowd said a flare wasn’t possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/67 21:30|Aiken|SC|Oval|3 minutes|Strange oval shaped silent metallic object about 2000 feet ovrehead with four oscillating lights|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33564.html|5|ndxe196706| Strange oval shaped silent metallic object about 2000 feet ovrehead with four oscillating lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> At sixteen years of age I was observing the sky in my own yard with a new refractor telescope my parents had bought me.  A family re-union was taking place inside my home at the time and several others were with me while observing.  Out of nowhere an oval craft appeared about 1,500 feet directly over our heads.  The craft was completely silent and appeared to be about 30-50 feet long.  It was metallic on the bottom and had four oscillating soft looking lights.  The color of the lights were white, amber, purpleish and green.  Ocillation events for these four lights occurred about every second or two.  The craft stayed in this position long enough for me to grab a few of the other relatives inside, one of whom was my uncle who had a commercial flying liscense.  My uncle immediately called a nearby radar station at a local airport.  They stated they didn&#39;t see anything unusual on their screens.  After about three minutes the object left out of sight at a 45 degree angle at tremendous speed (no trail and still no sound).  I estimate its speed must have been every bit as fast as a meteor since it completely disappeared from sight into a clear night sky within two seconds.  To this date I am still mystified by what we saw and can not begin to even guess at the technology employed by this object.  The Air Force Project Blue Book mission caught wind of the report in our local paper and sent me a 20 page report to fill out.  I was already deeply into astronomy at the time and even then found the report criteria quite insulting (ie; where was the moon, how big was the moon, etc).  All I know is that I have seen strange aircraft, the planets, and lots of other celestial objects most of my life but this was not even close to being an astronomical event or piece of earthly origin equipment.  Thirty six years later and I still find myself considering hyposis to try and better understand this unusual event.  I think I&#39;ll make that promise to myself as a New Year&#39;s resolution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw a round object moving above the tree line that was about one hundred yards off.  The object appeared to be lite from within. I was mainly red with yellow and white streaks.  The color was like looking at a light shining through the skin between your fingers. It moved at a steady pace across the top of the trees.  The color did not change and there were no changes or movement, just a round ball moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to find out the exact date of the sighting by looking up the date of death of the person who died (I think his name was Jimmy Isley).  But, I have not been able to locate this information.  I do know that I was around twelve or thirteen years old.  This would make it 1967 or 68. It was chilly but not cold.  So, it was probably either spring or fall.  The house was on Mt. Carmel Church Rd, about a fourth of a mile off Hwy 14 (now loop).  This is half way between Reidsville and Eden NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told this story for years to anyone who would listen.

I was a young lad who went outside to feed the dog in the back yard. While walking back to the house, I gazed at the sky and saw these rotating colorful lights on some object. It was so amazing because I had no idea what it could have been, especially being so young and unaware of UFO&#39;s. I watched it move swiftly from side to side, then all of a sudden it just took off at an amazing speed until I could not see it any longer. It moved so fast, it appeared to just vanish in a few seconds. I reported this to my siblings immediately when returning inside the house. I have often shared this sighting throughout my life. It is something I can never forget. After reading of these other sighting from others, there is so much parallism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was about 8 or 9 pm, and as we were walking towards the sea, we could feel a presence or something. I turned around to look behind me, and I saw 7 to 11 little bipods who looked like penguins. They appeared to be about 3 feet tall, and the reason the reminded me of penguins were because they had no ears, and there was a V-shape lighter color on their chests, like the coloring of penguins. I turned to my companion, who was also 16, and said, “ Don’t look now, but we are being followed” My friend stopped and turned to look, and I said, “Do you see what I see?” and he said yes, and I said, “ Let’s run” and so we did, we ran until we were wore out, about a quarter of a mile, ( which is strange because we both did track sports well ) and we turned and faced the strange guys following us, and we were breathing really hard, and I noticed they were not breathing hard at all. They looked at us, and then walked, single file, around us and disappeared into a coyote bush, by the side of the dirt road we were walking on.  We caught our breath, and we ran to the edge of the cliffs overlooking the sea. We sat down and talked about our strange experience, and then we decided to go back to the bush and attempt to talk to them. We did that, and we heard nothing. They were gone, seemed like. We then got our senses back, and became very frightened, and hurried home. When I got home from what was a short hour walk to the beach, we discovered that we were missing at least 3 hours. I got in after 12:30 AM and was grounded. Other people saw things that night as well. My high school news paper wrote about it and said a lot of people thought they saw a UFO but it was a weather balloon.  My little brother, who was 5 at the time saw it (the craft), and was so frightened that he ran and slept with the parents for a week. The man next door, who saw it, start! ed drink ing again. I have no recollection of seeing any craft; I have a healthy fear of grays and other alien creatures. My experience was also written about in Tom Dongo’s book, The Alien Tide. (pg 59) I apologize for reporting this some 40 years later. I am really frightened of the grays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I only know that in the fifty years I have lived, I have never seen anything like this since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, in town called Oakwood.   I believe it was the fall of 1967 when I had this encounter, which would put me at about 8 years old.  This phenomenon occurred in the middle of the night after having returned to my bed from the bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After laying back down I noticed a bright, round, moonlike object about a mile to the west and coming closer.  I was so unsure of what I was witnessing that I went to the window to get a better look.  I watched for a couple of minutes as this bright object came closer.  It was now several stories above the tree tops above our neighbor’s backyard. It had no sound and no discernable outline, but only the color of light.  It was round, about 30 feet across, and moving rather slowly.  I had to move to the other window that faced north to our backyard.   I thought about calling out to my mother, but thought that by the time she awoke and got to me, the object would be gone.  Just then the light went out.  It didn’t shoot away or disappear, it just went out.   It wasn’t replaced by a black outline against the sky.  I looked for several more minutes waiting to see if it would light up again or see some outline moving against the sky.  Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t scared, just a bit confused, so went back to bed and fell asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, before going to school, I sat at breakfast and told my mother what I saw.   She didn’t have much comment over the subject, so I didn’t push the topic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That day in school we had show and tell.  I remember sitting in a circle to the left of our teacher.   As we went around the circle, I wondered if I should tell about my night.  I did.  To my surprise the teacher didn’t think I was making up stories.  Instead, she said on her way to work she heard on the radio that there had been reports by others who had seen this strange object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will always wonder what it was, who it was, where it came from or where it went.  I have never seen anything like it to explain away what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have recalled this account so that it might conjure up a memory for someone else that may have seen this around the same time and in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A week later as I was 19 years old and living at a rooming house  as I went to take a shower on the third floor on a Saturday afternoon as I had a date and a young man with long Blond hair and wearing a white outfit and wearing dark sunglasses walked into the restroom and came straight to the shower as I opened the door and he grabbed me by my groin and turned and left. I immediatedly got dressed and went to the lobby to report this to the desk clerk and asked him if he saw a young man with Blond hair wearing dark sunglasses come down and he said no as at that time another man came down and said a young man wearing sung! lasses o pended the shower door on the second floor and turned around and left but did not touch him as he did  me. After all this occurred I was exaimed by Doctor&#39;s and an exray clearly showed that an object which Doctor&#39;s could not identify was lodged near my femur bone as this object is still near my femur bone as I have had exray&#39;s taken over the years and as of two years ago this object still near the femur. There is more to this as I married and fathered two daughters and  divorced in 1974 and who my exwife married would be of extreme importance to your organization and all UFO investigators.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

6/30/67 01:00|Columbus|OH|||Fifty feet from my driveway, up to my left, out of the north sky came a large lighted object.|11/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115358.html|16|ndxe196706| In the summer of 1967, I lived north of Columbus, Ohio, on East Powell Road, half a mile east of I71.  Houses were on long, narrow ten acre lots - about two tenths of a mile up a hill on the edge of the woods.   I was fifteen years old and regularly sneaking out - no fear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking home alone at 1 am.  Fifty feet from my driveway, up to my left, out of the north sky came a large lighted object..  It stopped in mid air just past the edge of the woods.  Scared, I hid behind a large oak tree peeking, not knowing what to do.  It made no noise - no movement. I knew &#34;they&#34; knew I was there, so I ran up the driveway stopping in front of my house.  Approx one- two hundred feet away at tree top level was a saucer shaped aircraft with pale colored, rectangular lights around the bottom.  The lights were white, red, blue, and glowing.  Maybe an acre in size - it just stayed there. I didn&#39;t dare move - it came to me &#34;they&#34; wouldn&#39;t hurt me.  Who were &#34;! they&#34;?  It finally moved at the same level slowly south parallel to I71, with a slight up and down motion.  On top of the hill, I could see it for maybe a few miles and it made three loud, high pitched, whirling noises and went straight down.  I had left my friends house at 1am, when I next looked at the time it was 3 am.  A short time later I saw headlines in the Columbus dispatch where an airforce pilot reported a UFO sighting.  I had my proof.  Now I always wonder.. where did 2 hours go during the time I was outside with the ufo?  Could I have been upducted?  I&#39;ve had a bump behind my ear the I always pick at, its bothersome.. and I don&#39;t remember always having it.  And since this day, I have been obssessed with UFO&#39;s.<n>

She was approximately 16 years old at the time.  The lights in the house were very dim, as the children were sleeping, so it was quite dark out with the exception of a street light on the busy Bethany Home Road which was one block north, or directly behind (North)of my baby sitters house.  We saw a white light that appeared to come from or accross Bethany Home Road, it moved silently accross the distance from Bethany Home Road towards us.  At first you think you&#39;re imagining things, but my neighbor (babysitter) was seeing it also.  It came right up to our faces, with a motion forwards and backwards as if examining us, it felt as tho it were alive or intelligent, then it retreated out, and over my street, Flynn Lane, changed directions and moved east over my street.  My VW was still parked on the driveway, so we quickly jumped in and roared down the street after it, and of course it was disappearing out of sight by the time we got moving on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s size was maybe the size of a large grapefruit, it was impossible to tell what shape it took other than it appeared to be round and just that....light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it before or after that event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Home.  The airport was near the top of the ground horizon, with what was to become freeway I80 running along the rim and out east past the south end of the main runway of Gowen Field.  We could easily spot approaching aircraft, watch it circle before landing and touch down.  We could even see how the aircraft would then taxi from the end of the landing zone back to the terminal.  The end of the landing ztrip is separated by perhaps 4 or 5 miles,  and in those days was simply open desert with very few buildings.  The area roads were well know to us and the headlights of autos followed a well established pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance across the valley to the rim from Table Rock was perhaps a few miles, and then a few miles further over spaserly settled rural area to the Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could time landings at about every 8-10 minutes at that time of evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all were amazed as one of the landing lights, which had a different color spectrum to it--still just a small circular light source, descended from the right of the landing pattern, onto the runway, and at the point all aircraft would slow and turn back to the tower, this light continued across the end of the landing zone, out across the desert, several miles out onto I80.  It turned onto the route of I80 headed east and followed in the same line of travel as the rest of the traffic towards Mtn Home 45 miles east.  This same thing happened a couple of times that night.  We never saw it before or after.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But the details I will never forget. When you see something so unusual, it stays with you. When I was a teenager, my friend and I were out in the evening when we noticed low in the sky about 20-30 degrees above the horizon,a set of five orange glowing spheres or circular shapes. It was more like a glow than a bright light, but with dstinct round edges, not fuzzy. The spheres were in a line, with the edges touching each other, so as to form one object. The center sphere was the largest, about half the size of a full moon. The next adjacent two were smaller, and the outer two were the smallest, about half the size of the center sphere. We stood there for a few minutes staring at it in amazement. There were no sounds, movement, blinking or rays of light coming from it. Just completely still and glowing orange.  My house was at the edge of a subdivision, and the direction was east over a wooded undeveloped area.  It was very dark, so there were no street lights or ground lights to confuse it with something else.  The spheres were much bigger than any aircraft lights. We ran down the street to get another friend to come out and see it, but a few minutes later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, as I recall, there was a short newspaper article that various people in Savannah had seen orange glowing lights in the night sky.  I assume it was the same object that we had seen.  Whoever they interviewed explained that it was migrating ducks flying in a &#34;v&#34; formation and their bellies glowed orange from reflected light. Yeah, right! Duck bellies are not perfectly round and are extremely tiny in the sky! I have never seen anything like that since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I faced the lake waiting for my friend to get a flashlight I saw a bright white light zigzag across from the far end of the lake and then cross to my left over the land and stop instantly directly in front of a tall pine tree about 3 feet from its tip to my left across the road.  Had it not stopped I think it would have hit the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It sat perfectly still and that is when I could see it was a saucer shape of a light yellow orange-ish glow.  I though it might have &#39;noticed&#39; me and was observing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 25 to 30 seconds of sitting there it zigged to the side of the tree then moved at a ninety degree angle to the side and shot into the sky at about a 50 degree angle moving very fast.  Just a guess but at least several hundred miles per hour until disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.

It hovered completely still in the air for 20 or 30 seconds. Then it went north still quite close to the ground and below the horizon along the Wasatch front and was out of sight in a split second.  It returned from the north along the same path and was out of sight in the south in a split second. Everybody waiting in thier cars at the drive-in (Woodland Drive-in Salt Lake City, Utah) saw it too. It was very close and we all saw it clearly.  My other sister and a freind of hers were sitting on the front porch of our home in Kearns, Utah at this time and also saw it. From our front yard the whole Salt lake valley can be seen to the east.

All that was left in the sky was off into the distance, over the Western Foothills.  A  bright Turquoise streak, like a whisp of cloud, as if the speed of the thing was such that it left this turquoise vapor behind, in the early twilight.  All the reading I&#39;ve done throughout the years of others&#39; sightings, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone else seeing this Turquoise light streak.  Anyone?  Please let me know.

Our vehicle faced in mostly an Eastern direction.  Directly behind us approximately, 1.5 miles was and remains the Y-12 National Defense Plant from which weapons grade Uranium is produced, stored and modified. Immediately to our right, approximately 5 to 6 miles distant was the ORNL (X-10) DOE facility. At our 10 – 11 O’clock position was a DOE animal research facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing through the traffic light, the road took one past the animal research facility, to ones left, directly towards a fenced and locked gate (approx ¼ mile, behind which was a freshwater pumping station for the city), to an access road bearing left to a lake side recreational area called “Carbide Park.”  Built by Union Carbide for the use of its employees and families.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When at the traffic light the topography is such that the road bisects two ridges as one continues towards the access road to Carbide Park.  One ridge descended from the left, the other ascended from the right towards ORNL.  The ridge lines were uneven in height but were continuous and forested. At this time of night the sun was setting and just a small amount of twilight remained.  Atmospheric conditions were clear, no moon, and temperature of mid seventies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While stopped, the driver of our car noticed something upon the apex of the ridge line located at approximately 1 O’clock relative to our vehicle.   He pointed it out and we all observed a stationary red sphere at the top of the ridge that ascended from the access road to the park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped talking and watched. In about 15 to 20 seconds the red sphere began moving, following the ridge line to our right, which would be from a southeasterly to south to southwesterly direction.  The sphere was moving slowly.  I would approximate Its speed about as fast as one would normally walk.  We had time to turn off the car, exit the vehicle, and observe the sphere while standing in the road.  No other traffic was on the road during this time.  It was quiet without critter noises one would associate with a summer night.  We watched this red sphere continue down the ridge line for approximately 10 – 12 minutes until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sphere’s light was continuous, non-pulsating, and red similar to that of ones vehicles’ taillight. I approximate the size of the sphere to be that of a large beach ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was playing in our back yard, and walk around our detached garage, toward the back yard, when I noticed to the left and up just over the trees and next door back yard a craft slowly moving towards our back yard from left to right direction taking it directly over the tree line in our yard , but in plain sight to me . I called for my mother who was just inside our house in the kitchen, and she came outside, I ran to to back our our yard in excitment looking up, my mother ran to me , and the craft passed slowly over our heads at a very slow speed, My recall, being young is that it was grey on the bottom, flat, no sound, was maybe 100 ft long, 50 ft wide, My mother to this date remembers the same though she recalls lights, and a low humming noise, as it left our yard crossing over to the next yard , that leads to a crossing of a street, that brings it over my school yard, I remember it seemed to be there , then gone , then there, but maybe 50 ft futher away, at this time it was directly over a large tree, in the middle of the large open school yard, at this time, wanting to see more I ran to my bike at the back of our house to pursue the craft, my mother was yelling for me to come back, caught in the moment , I preceded to ride my bike down around the corner to the school yard to see more, as I aprouched the scool yard , I could see two young friends that lived 4 houses behind ours riding thier bikes along the backside near trees of the schoolyard chasing what apeared to be the same thing, we met up at the top of a small hill near a tree line that leads to waht is called crandal park, we jumped off our bike ,still seeing this object still in viewover the tree line. we ran in under the trees and then it was gone. I went home and told my mother we should tell someone , but she was reluctant to do so, Later about 2 hours later my mother told me she heard on the radio ,that a women in south glens falls had reported seeing a similar object cross over her! car, and her electric system shut down her car, My mother and I have shared this with our family, and at times through the years ,we discuss it, I have always wished thier was away that I could go back and relive it so I could get a better sense of what we saw, I was young and find it a little cloudy, to remember al the detail, this is the first time I have written to anyone concerening this, but if you find it helpful then it is worth my time, Thanks,<n>

It was one of the states in between but I can&#39;t be sure which and it was the early hours of the morning and dark.  The roundish craft saw us and silently darted behind a hill.  As I recall we went off the road to see it behind the hill.  It saw us again and this time shot behind a larger mountain and we could not follow it.  We never reported it because I was just a teen and thought it was probably a secret air force craft or something.  But now I am reporting it after the seeing Larry King show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a B.A. in Humanities from the Unv. of Washington and am now 58 years old.

Houses were on long, narrow 10 acre lots - about two tenths of a mile up a hill on the edge of the woods.  I was 15 years old and no fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the family went to bed I walked a mile up the road to my friend&#39;s.  Leaving about  1AM ,  walking alone  and  50 ft from the bottom of my driveway, I looked up to my left  and out of the north sky came a large lighted object!  It  stopped in mid air silently  hovering, just past the edge of the woods.  		I was so scared, I hid behind a large oak tree  peeking out not knowing what to do.  I was looking at a flying saucer and somehow knew &#34; they&#34;  knew I was there.  Finally I ran up the driveway and stopped in front of the house watching &#34; it&#34;.  It was maybe 200 ft across and  glowed a pale wite light in the center and rectangular shaped lights of different pale colors, red, blue, maybe green.  I wish I could be hypnotized to really remember the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could think of is &#34; who are they?&#39;  I was overcome with a feeling they wouldn&#39;t hurt me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I don&#39;t know how long it finally began slowly moving south, parallel to I71 with a slight up and down motion.  On top of our hill, I could see it for a few miles and it stopped, made three loud whirling noises and went straight down.  						I went in the house and looked at the clock.  It was 3am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that summer, I saw headlines in the Columbus Dispatch where an airforce pilot reported seeing a UFO.  I had my proof.  Now I watch the skys and wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also wonder what the small bump behind my ear is  after seeing a ufo movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It stopped for a second or so then sped directly west in the sky again in a perfectly straight line for a few more seconds. Then it disappeared totally from the skies.

It was about 10:00 p.m. and we had all gone to bed when my friends sister yelled boys, come and and look out my window. We saw a light in the distance maybe a mile or two away. It looked to be about 100 ft. off the ground. The light was changing colors from red, blue, and white or maybe more. The exiting thing about it was how it would move so fast across the sky. It would move rapidly sideways for about 1/4 of a mile and stop instanly, then move back across the sky and stop again. At one point someone said let&#39;s get in the car and drive toward it but we chickened out.  We watched it dart back and forth for about 15 minutes then it started slowly zig zagging across the sky getting higher and higher untill it was out of sight. After all these years I wonder what would have happened if we had driven ovrer toward it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/9/67 23:00|Camelon (UK/Scotland)||Sphere|40mins|Sphere|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82436.html|40|ndxe196706| When I was around eight years old, I observed a sphere of light (about 40ft) in size floating 10 ft above the houses in the other housing scheme, that was visible from my bedroom window about 250 yds away, it just sat there pulsing, like a street light will do with a certain type of rain falling past it, so slight but the pulse was visiable just the same.  After a while (5 mins) it seemed to get smaller but denser, more vibrant, as it was doing this it rolled over the roof and down to the park that divided my scheme with the one where it appeared.   A ball of light about 20ft in circumference bouncing about.  The more it bounced, thrumbed, vibrated, the more light,energetic and animated it became.  It seemed like it took about twenty minutes to gain its peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its colours were a fire-red flickering like as in a fire, within a peachy coloured sphere.  Every now and then you would hear a pop-like something.  I noticed smaller (about 2 ft) dimmer spheres drop down through the big spheres circumferance, like tail-less sperm entering an egg, the colour would change slightly, looking less strong in colour, then some of the flame-like streaks changed to a fire-yellow, and as more yellow than red were visiable, coloured sparks began resounding, they sounded like distant fire-crackers within the sphere.  It was like they were being sparked off in the colour-sequence of the rainbow, there was method to this sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just remember it looked like an invisible gyroscope with coloured halogen light strapped to it being spun in all manner of directions but with a pattern and going that fast that the tracers start to look like solid lines, creating patterns that resemble spirograph or many a crop circle, each colour individually forming its own pattern and after completion it looked like they dropped into a vortex just lower of centre, as it went through the rainbow sequence, I feared I would not stay awake long enough to see the purple, my favourite colour, it started of as the palest lilac and ended its sequence purple neon,the green sequence seemed very urgent,as if it was in a hurry to get it over with, still the yellow-flamed streaks of colour within the sphere were getting whiter, as the green sequence finished the whiteness level got to what could be described as, as bright as a halogen bulb, as you are staring right into it. At this point it lifted about six feet from the ground and ! then disappeared vertically along the side of a hill and up into the air, it was cloaking itself as it moved, by the time it got over the Bonnybridge Road, high enough for me to see it again.   I followed it skyward, where I saw were three stationary black bat-shaped ships waiting for it,by this time my UFO looked like a cresent moon.  They were there and gone in the blink of an eye.  IN a blink of Halogen light!.I fell asleep immediately afterwards and woke up to a rollicking for moving the linen-box over to the window I was moved back into the front room because I wouldn&#39;t stay away from the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I didn&#39;t see an airplane or a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1966, 1967, 1968:  My buddy and I lived within walking distance of the river. Several times a week we would walk down to the river and sit on the dock and watch the skies and discuss girls, our band, and our future.  Sometimes we would fish but usually we would lay on the pier and watch the skies as we talked.  We began noticing the movement in the skies and starting jokingly calling them UFOs.  After a few months, it was very easy to distinguish between single engine airplanes, commercial jets, high flying military jets, satellites, and of course the very fast moving meteors.  We even began to start noticing the stars and their familiar patterns in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began noticing lights in the sky that were almost definitely not planes or satellites or meteors and we started calling them UFOs (half joking and half serious).  We would see an average of 2 or 3 UFOs on any given night.  We then started watching the skies for about 3 or 4 hours a night just to look for UFOs. We didn’t know what these things were, but they were not planes…and since they were very high up in the air, we never saw the shape of these object.  They were the size of the largest stars moving around in erratic patterns…but very, very fast.  Faster than our military jets and faster than our satellites.  Satellites move in a straight line and jets move basically in a straight line with some deviation in their course.  But jets and satellites do not stop and hover or circle at 60,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting: My buddy and I had met a couple of girls and we were at their grandmothers house out in the country one night in the front yard. I was sitting on the front porch with my date and my buddy was sitting in the swing in the front yard with his date (4 of us total). The last thing on our minds that night was UFOs. My buddy yelled my name loudly and called for me to come and look at something. I wasn’t interested in him at the time and almost ignored him, but he wouldn’t shut up about it. So all four of us met in the front yard and looked up in the sky to the west. There was a fairly large light moving from west to east toward our position. This particular light did not move like any of the other UFOs that we had seen before. This light was a little bit larger than any of the other lights before and it was larger than any star in the sky that night. As it moved, it reminded me of pulling a fishing lure through water. It seemed to sort of vibrate through the air as it tra! veled in a straight line to almost overhead. We had been watching now for almost 30-45 seconds as this thing moved from the horizon to overhead at what we figured was about 20,000 to 50,000 feet. It moved extremely fast. Faster than a military jet or satellite but not as fast as a meteor. Then it stopped almost overhead. If we had walked down the road about a half mile, it would have been directly overhead…straight up. It hovered for about 3 to 5 seconds and then it began to circle overhead. It was not a perfect circle and it was not a complete circle. (Imagine a 3 year old trying to draw a circle on a paper with a crayon.) That best describes the path that it slowly flew above us. It seemed to be looking for something. The diameter of the “circle” was less than a quarter mile. Circling took about 10 to 15 seconds. Then it stopped again for about 3 seconds and started getting bigger and bigger. It was now about 5 times the size of the brightest star I have ever seen in the ! sky…almost the size of a street light. This thing was landing ! and it w as going to land in the field across the street about 200 or 300 yards away from us. All four of us began to run down toward that field to watch it land. All of sudden, something bit me and kept biting me. Something was in my way and I couldn’t move forward. I didn’t want to look down to see what was biting me because the UFO had just captured my total awareness. However, when I did look down to see what was “biting” my leg, I saw that I had run into an electric fence. So I was not going to get to catch up to everyone else and I decided to just watch the UFO from this vantage point. I watched this thing as it was coming down toward earth and it seemed to “panic” and stop descending at almost the exact time that I ran into the electric fence. The UFO was now low enough that we could have seen what it was if it was daylight…but it was still just a very, bright light in the sky. It stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds like it didn’t know what to do and then it went straight ! up and out of sight in less than 2 seconds. Totally silent. I have never seen anything move that fast before or since. I thought “we don’t have anything that can do that!” There was no sound of rockets or jet engines or any kind of smoke trail. My father worked on the Saturn 5 rocket booster and I was familiar with rockets and jet engines. This vehicle was strictly antigravity powered. Romance had now changed to UFO talk and we spent the rest of the evening looking for more UFOs. After that event, the girls never ridiculed our UFO stories. This event was within a year of the Falkville policeman who reported chasing an alien through the woods. Sadly, he was laughed out of the force. Falkville is 25 miles from Decatur. I figured that the NASA military base in Huntsville was the interest of all the UFOs we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After graduation in 1969, I never got to spend time just watching the skies and I haven’t got to see anymore UFOs.<n>

Sleeping on the grass. All the girls except one stayed out with me, it got too cold for the rest so they retreated to the family room.  All I remeber was talking about all the stars, and how we are ants in an aquarian for others to watch. We decided to go into the house and get a drink. My companion and I looked out the window and spotted the savirical ship, it was gray metallinc in color, with a set of circular cube lights on top. The squares on the top were large and one blinked on and then the next. They were multiple colors. It gave the ship the appearence that it was spinning, but it was not. One light would go on and then the next in a sequence around the ship.  My friend and I went out on the porch to look at it.  I was amazed at how large it was.  I would have to guess about 3 football fields. Some of the other girls looked but freaked when they say it.  I stood on the porch and watched, when suddenly an extremely intense blue white light came from the center, bottom of the ship and hit the ground.  We all became frighted after that and hid in the house.  We told parents the next day, but no one believed us, we were only 14 at the time. We did report it to the airforce, and police, but no response.  The part that scared me the most was the small spheres of light that came to my window two summers after I had seen the UFO.  I knew they wanted me to come out, but I was so scarred I hid.  I have since ran into people that have similar experiences, especially the glowing balls outside there window that seem to becon one to come with it..I also remember knowing somehow that this ship was a minning ship and that it was minning quaritze crystals.  I remember telling my mom to buy all the quaritze she could find because it would be very valuable some day.  I also remember that there may have been missing time envoled, but I have never found anyone that could do regressive hypnosysis.  I would like to try again, and see the most fantastic thing I have ever seen! .  It tr uly changed by life.  Thank you for you time, ((name deleted))…<n>

By this time, I began feeling afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise became quite loud, and suddenly, in front of my window, wreathed in green light, appeared a figure in silhouette, moving back and forth in my window as if trying to look in at me. While the window had a sheer curtain covering part of the view, it did not obscure the bright green aura, or the box-like protuberance around the ears of the being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wavered back and forth in front of my window for a minute or so, and then moved away down the path behind my house.  As it did so, the electronic sound diminished as well, eventually fading completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point, I had the covers over my head, and was shaking in fear. I did not jump up to tell my parents who were sitting in the living room in the front of the house, as one would normally do, and have never understood why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say I have never been so frightened in my life. What happened was, of course, completely unexpected, and there fore carried an element of shock as well.  It was not a prank by friends (to stand as high in the window on the path behind my room, one would have to be 7 ft. tall) nor was it a dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have replayed the incident many times over in my mind since that time--and each time must conclude, after looking at all other rational explanations, that I saw the outline, silhouetted in green light, of a being not from this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are other elements to this story from other members of my family, and neighbors as well.  But this is enough for now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I have told this story to people several times over the years, I still get a cold chill down my spine from the remembrance, and even feel it now as I write this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Those present were: my mother and stepfather; my two grown brothers; my husband and me.  It was early June, 1967.  It was approximately 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very warm evening and we had played cards and then went outside to sit and enjoy the evening.  No alcohol had been consumed. We were quietly talking and discussing UFO’s. My stepfather said he thought he’d seen a UFO just over the city of Yucca Valley a few nights earlier. He described his sighting as a bright light in oval or round shape. He said it made no sound. There was a bit of debate and my wondering was could he have just seen some type of craft from the nearby Marine Corps base, 29 Palms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The subject changed and we were discussing other topics when, all of a sudden an oval light appeared out of no where, no sound. We did not hear it coming. It shot across the sky, stopped instantly and hovered in the distance, it seemed like it was about ½ mile away. It was not possible to judge its height exactly, but it looked like it might have been between 500 and 1,000 ft above us and to the South of where we were sitting. We were all stunned. It just sat motionless and completely silent for around 5 minutes. Then it blinked 3 times and vanished. I mean literally vanished, without a sound.  Whatever the craft was it was like nothing any of us had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We got up the road to within two hundred yards of our house, which the meadow is before the house.  Out in the middle of our field about 500ft up was this object with lights going on and off.  My mom stopped the car and said to me, half asleep, rolled down your window to see if there is ant noise. I did , I was seven at the time ,I know that if something is up in the sky, it has a sound, this thing made no noise at all.I could not understand why there was no noise at all. I could hear the peepers peep? Mom called the troopers , they made a joke of it. my dog acted crazy when we first came home after it , the object left.I dont know what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Objects hovered very close to ground and shined lights.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03057.html|51|ndxe196706| Summary : 5 objects seen over Sumner WA June of 1967. Objects hovered very close to ground and shined lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grade school friend and I witnessed these objects when we were 11 years old. We were at Fred&#39;s parents house (not his real name), planning to sleep in their front yard. I know this is a long time to go before reporting this to anyone, but I did not know where to till I saw this site on the Internet. We were on the front lawn about 2100 in our sleeping bags checking out the sky, valley ect. My friends house has a panoramic view of trhe Puyallup Valley, Orting Valley, and Mt. Rainier. We were startled to see a formation of lights (v shaped, 5 objects) moving from the direction of Auburn (to the north) to dontown Sumner. Te objects were orange in color with a sort of bluish aura or halo around them. They were silent. When they reached the city, they dimmed but were still visible and began to shine lights on the ground and houses. they were all spread out in the south east part of the city shining lights. Again, there was no sound. After about 10-15 minutes of this, they reformed their v shaped formation and flew directly over our heads (height was hard to judge) fairly slowly, then accelerated out of sight towards Tacoma. there are more storie from this period of time in the Puyallup Valley. I don&#39;t know if you or anyone else has investigated this period of time (1961-1970) in the south Puget Sound, but I have other stories from people who&#39;s neighborhoods were visited, where craft had landed (seen by officials) and other reports of &#34;craft&#34;.<n>

Object did not change elevation…just cruised slowly along the crestline.  Intermittent red and blue flashes of light.  Sighting lasted 15 minutes and object just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 weeks later…8:30 pm  past sunset but still light outside my mom walked with me next door to Gram’s house where I slept  …Mom said goodnight to Gram while I walked into my bedroom…I had walked 3 steps into bedroom when out the window appeared rotating flashes of white-red-blue-green light..initially thought it was the rotating lights of a piece of road equipment next door at the county road crew shop, but became alarmed when the colors started rotating far too fast and multicolored for any piece of road equipment I had ever seen.  I stepped back one large step to reach the door handle of the closed bedroom door (which I had not closed).  Gram was on the other side of the door yelling my name..we could not open the door even though we tried hard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I “awoke” late at 8:30 AM to hear my Mom talking to Gram in the kitchen…I was standing fully dressed in exactly the...3 steps into the room position that I had been in the night before. I noted that the bed was fully made-up and unrumpled.  Mom asked if I was ok and if I remembered what happened last night. I said “yes”. Later she said that as she was walking back home she was alarmed to see the large round object hovering over the part of house I was in  and a voice in her head told her “just go home and go to bed” she protested and the voice again gave the same reply. She said she felt compelled to go home and go straight to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told the story to a relative many years later – 1993- the relative promptly reported my “descent into delusions” to my Mom…..who thankfully confirmed the story to the relative stating that she regretted being unable to do anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my 14th birthday between the initial sighting and the “bedroom events”<n>

I was watching as we drove in a neon light on the West side of town, mentally thinking I needed to find out what new business had such a bright light.  I thought it was a neon light.  It was (I must only have been able to see 1/2 of it) round or arched appearing in shape.  It had a circle within the circle and orange lights within the two circles. We turned into a grocery store parking lot to get something for the person we were going to see in the hospital, and I looked up over the store, (This was also over the West Bend Company) and I saw that same object.  It was as big as a football field.  I reached to grab the person beside me to show them the object, and in a split second it disappeared!  Had I not seen it, and watched it for a full 15 minutes as we approached the city, I would not have believed that I saw it at all. I felt that it had intelligent life, and possibly could read my mind, as it disappeared in a split second leaving me looking like a sputtering idiot. No one believed me.   Others at the time reported seeing it also. I do not know what it was except it was like a orange neon sign in brilliance and it knew when I was going to share the information was the feeling I got. I did a drawing of the object, and sent it into the radio station.  I did not know who to report this thing to.<n>

When flying past the carrier, it was suddenly lit from below the water by a very bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was commanded to circle and observe the light.  The initial theory was that a Soviet sub was under the carrier and was somehow shining a light up at them; playing games with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute though, the light took off through the water still submerged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They and another jet followed above for about 20 seconds when suddenly the light left the water (not sure if they saw the shape) and took off straight up into the air and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When back on board the carrier, all personnel were commanded to never mention the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I asked my brother 20 years later if we really seen what we seen or did we imagine it he said to not ever doubt it we were there we seen it and thats that, I have seen a few pictures on line similar to it,... after all these years I still remember thats why I now report it to you....I hope to see it again<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It floated/flew around each of our heads a few minutes while we tried to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see if anyone was in the tree above us because I thought somebody was pulling a prank on us.  The leaves had fallen off the tree so the branches were mostly bare. I saw no one in the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure why we all just stood still while the sphere flew/floated around us. I remember being very curious but I didn&#39;t try to touch or grab it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was opaque and a medium to darkish brown.  It made no sound.  There were no lights or markings on it.

I was bringing in the groceries when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright, stationary light in the Northern sky about 30 - 45 degrees off the horizon. I turned to look at it - it was extremely bright, high in the sky and about the size to my eye of about 3 or 4 bright stars combined. As I watched it, another smaller, but just as bright light, came flying at an incredible speed out of the east, intersected with the larger light and they both moved flew up and away, again at incredible speed, and were quickly out of sight. I called to my husband when I noticed the first light, but by the time he got outside they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/67 01:00|Edgemoor|SC|Disk|2 minutes|Myself and 3 friends witnessed a circular shaped craft in the spring of 1967 hovering over a railroad track.|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12256.html|63|ndxe196706| Myself and 3 friends witnessed a circular shaped craft in the spring of 1967 hovering over a railroad track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spring of 1967 3 friends and myself were returning from Rock Hill, SC, to our homes in Edgemoor, SC.  It was approximately 1:00 AM when we witnessed a circular shaped craft hovering over the Seaboard railroad tracks.  This was to our left, and the craft was approximately 100 feet from us hovering at around 60 feet. The craft was approximately 40 in diameter and had colored lights around the edges.  We pulled over into the driveway of a gas station (closed at the time) and we all got out of the car.  The craft made no noise as it proceeded to pass over us to our right. It then hovered over a local residents front yard, and at this time was approximately 100 + feet from us. A cylinder of light came from the bottom of the craft as if taking samples from the yard.  This light defied the laws of physics, as you could see the bottom of the cylinder(of light) decend 1/2 way, 3/4 way down, etc. before reaching the earth. The light then ascended in the same manner, and then the craft vanished in thin air.  Again, making no noise whatsoever.  We then jumped back in the car and sped to our homes in a state of terror.  I have never officially reported this in 33 years but have told this to many friends and relatives.  Some believe, and of course many laugh, but this really happened to me and my 3 friends.<n>

There were a number of sightings between 1966 - 67 but I fail to find them listed any where. They were large enough to have news coverage on the radio. ?????<n> <n><n> <n><n> On tucking my children to bed one evening, I looked out the window and framed between tree limbs there was a large light that caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to leave the room and tell my brother and husband that the North star was sure bright that evening and went to stand in the back yard and observe this star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being out there watching the star the others in the house joined me at which point I was told that is not the North Star.  The object was far enough away that it looked to be the size of a quarter - we then observed that the lighting changed to red, blue and green flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With this came the observation of two additional spheres one on each side of the first sphere.  Lights continued to go on and off and then I observed what I concidered way out in space a V formation of lights that traveled in different directions instead of a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally after 45 or so minutes all lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was only one sighting for that period of time.  I have found no other listing of others that had sightings and yet there was ample news coverage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one eveing of sightings our dog went apsolutly beserk and stayed that way for 3 days, there was one room in our home she would not even enter, but stand in the door way with her hackles up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do the words &#34;good morning morning star&#34; mean anything to any one???

We was going from farmersville OH. to Germantown OH. To visit our grand parents, we lived in an old rented brick farm house that the owner had pigs on the farm, as you leave Farmersville to Germantown we lived on a road A little out of town on the left a little way&#39;s but before you get to the railroad tracks the farm house was down a long lane, I remember the train going by the old farm house all the time. I rememember sometimes on the way from Farmersville to Germantown, (as a little kid) this bridge that we had to cross out in the country would get flooded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to our grand parents house the night of the sighting but my parents did not say anything, we had went to my grand parents the next morning and it was in the news paper of people reporting seeing UFO, my mother started to cry and telling my grand parents everything, My parents are in their 60&#39;s now and do not talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember my ant and uncle living in overlook Oh. and visiting them all time.

6/1/67|Shofield Barracks-Civilian|HI|Changing|1-2 hours|Inside.|7/26/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111743.html|67|ndxe196706| Mother, sister older sister, younger brother and I were living at Schofield while my father was a doctor in the Vietnam War.  I was about two as I was potty trained but still wore a diaper at night.  I don’t know the exact month or time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night my friend and neighbor, &#34;C,&#34; would scream bloody murder, as she was afraid of the dark.  Her mother was Asian so her parenting style was to let her cry it out.  Her screaming however scared me.  I could not sleep until she stopped screaming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night a thin man with black hair appeared at my crib.  &#34;C&#34; was still screaming.  He told me not to be afraid.  He asked me if I wanted to go for a walk.  He was talking to me but his mouth was not moving.  I pointed to my shoes.  I told him that I didn&#39;t know how to tie them.  His face was expressionless.  He said that it was okay and that he would carry me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He held me and we were in a field.  But it wasn&#39;t the pineapple plantation across the road.  I don’t know how we left my room.  His black hair reminded me of my father, so I told him that I loved him.  He told me that I did not know him.  So, I asked him his name.   I can’t remember it, but I remember it was too long for me to say as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the field we went inside a room.  I don’t know how we got into it.  It seemed small and round shaped inside.  He put me down and said he had to work.  I told him I could clean as I liked to clean the tub.  He asked me not to touch anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He spoke to another who told him that he should bring me back.  I told him that my diaper was wet and asked him to change it.  He told me that he better bring me back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When back in my room, he told me not to tell anyone or he couldn&#39;t come get me anymore when the girl screamed.  I was having trouble opening the door, so he opened it for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to be with my family.  My father, mother and sister were playing a game.  My father wanted to know how I got out of my room so I told him that a man let me out.  My father asked me if the man was black.  I thought that he meant, did he have black hair, as I had never seen an African American male before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said yes.  He searched my room including the closet.  He checked the window/s and it was locked.  I could tell my dad was upset because I remember he was sweating.  He told my mom that it must have been someone from the barracks but he didn&#39;t know how they got out with the window locked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father asked if he hurt me and I told him, “No.”  My father reminded me of the importance of telling the truth.  I told him again that the man was there.  The next night when &#34;C&#34; screamed, the man did not come for me.  I remember standing and waiting until &#34;C&#34; stopped screaming, but I saw no one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
