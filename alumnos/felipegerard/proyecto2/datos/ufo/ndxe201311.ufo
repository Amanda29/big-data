Sometimes I will see a poof like a small cloud and then one of these small objects appear, others are just there without the little cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can see them whether it is cloudy or clear and sometimes in broad daylight.  I can see them most anytime I look for them.  They are in no particular area of the sky, just all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once in a while I will see what appears to be something shooting away from them, one here or there.  There are so many of them it amazes me!  I live pretty high up on the east bench of Pocatello where it is usually pretty dark, not many city lights to interfere with sight.  Some of these objects appear red, some white. I wish I owned a good telescope!  I will see if I can borrow one and report back.  These objects are extremely tiny as I stated, but appear to be all over the place up here. I would really like to know exactly what these are. They are far too tiny for me to photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far, I have no witnesses but will definitely do that soon and have them file supporting reports.  My 23 yr. old son and my dear friend Melody are very interested in seeing these objects, so I should have their info for you soon.<n>

It moved from south to north in a fairly straight line.  No noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought that it may be a falling star or something burning as it entered the atmosphere.  Then a second one appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went  inside and got my wife. We watched a couple more that looked exactly the same follow the same path.  Each time flying over us and then off to the distance and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife then went in and got our two daughters. (18 and 21)   We live on a farm and there was no noise to be heard.   We all watched as a couple more flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total there were at least 5 or 6.  I have lived here for 17 years and am out about the same time each night.  This is the only time that I had seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have no idea what it could be, one, perhaps even two falling stars, but not six that were identical in size and shape following the same path.   Not to mention that the flight of each lasted for a couple minutes.<n>

Myself and my Mother and Father witnessed about 15-20 Orange spheres that looked to all be moving at the same exact slow speed across the sky, just above the tree line of our back yard.  They looked almost like a bright north star but orange and each one would show up and move across the sky from left to right and then after about 30 seconds of being visible and moving they would just dissapear.  They looked EXACTLY like the objects captured in a photo about a week ago in Bridgewater Massachusetts.  Bridgewater, MA, is about 45 minutes South East of where I live and saw these objects.<n>

11/30/13 21:20|Missoula|MT|Oval|15 minutes|Bright whitish/gold orbs travelled south at tree level down Rattlesnake Creek in MIssoula, Montana|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105002.html|9|ndxe201311| Bright whitish/gold orbs travelled south at tree level down Rattlesnake Creek in MIssoula, Montana<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:20 pm on the night of November 30, 2013 I was packing some bags out to the truck and noticed two bright lights to the north.  Our house is located up Rattlesnake Creek about 1.5 miles north of the Clark Fork River and considered a part of Missoula, Montana.  This area is not a regular airplane route, especially at night, so I paid particular attention to the lights.  When I first spotted the two lights they were maybe 2-3 miles to the north and just above the trees.  They were heading south, down Rattlesnake Creek, at a uniform speed, with one behind the other and at the same altitude.  The large pines along the creek occasionally obstructed my view of the moving lights.  Initially I thought that they may be two helicopters with search lights looking for something or someone.  As they continued south they became larger to the eye and I could see that they were more orb-like and rather large.  They were round or oblong in shape and bright white to gold in color with a red aura near the back end.  It appeared that they were only a couple hundred feet above the ground and when they were within about 1 mile of our home the trailing orb dimmed and went straight up in the air at a high speed and disappeared within a couple of seconds.  The leading orb continued down the creek for another few seconds, then, it too dimmed and headed straight up in the sky light the other one also disappearing in a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This initial encounter lasted about 5 minutes because I had enough to time to run back into the house to yell for my wife to “Hurry, come out, there’s a UFO!” and still continue to monitor the orbs.  My wife made it out after the 3rd call for the last 20 seconds of the sightings.  She went back in the house to get her boots and coat on and shortly after coming back outside, we saw two more orbs in the same area to the north that I first saw the original two.  They were heading in same direction, with the same spacing, altitude and speed as the first ones.  These two orbs were the same shape and color and travelled further south down the creek.  Then as the first two did, the trailing orb dimmed and went straight up in the sky at a fast rate of speed quickly disappearing. The lead orb came within ½ mile of our house and looked to be quite large and bright.  It appeared to be no more than 100-200 feet above ground and then it too dimmed and went straight up at a high rate of spe! ed disappearing in a second or two.  During both encounters the orbs did not make any distinguishable sound.  This second encounter also lasted about 5 minutes and was over at about 9:35.<n>

I saw the same thing last summer and made a report here then, (See Sag Harbor,NY).  The orange ball was travelling south to north again, this time several miles distant from me as I was looking west. Unknown altitude and speed.  I called my son and told him to watch and that it would flicker out and another would appear then, exactly in the spot where we saw the first one. True to form, this is exactly what happened.  I told him to watch and as soon as this one died out another would appear.  This is exactly what happened as it did last summer. I don&#39;t like the term fireball as these are orange balls and have no tail. Nother appears on fire, but they sorta flicker out.  Again I have no explanation for them.<n>

As I crossed South Preston St, I happened to look to my right and saw three orb like white lights, diffuse but big, less than a two blocks away.  The night was bright enough to easily see that these lights (as big as beach balls would look sitting in a chair next to you) were steady and connected by a black triangular structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed no other lights and no noise of any kind beyond normal traffic and ground noises. I checked again to make sure I wasn&#39;t mistaking it for a plane, and there it sat, exactly the same way that bricks don&#39;t, in place in the air, maybe four to 5 stories off the ground if the surrounding buildings went up that high.  No other lights or markings or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t doing anything, just sitting there and not moving and not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Swung by about 6 minutes later, and it was gone.  On way home we saw some aircraft seeming to be searching the area and you could hear them miles off.. which helped confirm for me that there was no way that black triangle was a plane or a helicopter..  I would have heard it and it probably would have smacked into the buildings downtown at the height it was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say how big it was for sure, but it looked to be about 50-75 ft across.. but there was a tip of the triangle over both buildings on either side of the street, so.. it was big enough.<n>

All lights moved at the same, slow speed, keeping the same relative distance from one and other.  The line was south-to-north moving.  As one light left the northern horizon, a new light appeared in the south - there appeared to be even spacing.  Some of  the lights in the line had &#34;companion lights&#34; located at 90 degrees from the line of trajectory.  These companions moved at the same speed, keeping the same distance at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves were red/orange.  They were brighter and larger than the appearance of venus.  The altitude appeared to be similar to a single engine plane.  There was no noise and they lights appeared blurry through binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire procession lasted at least 20 minutes, though it could have started earlier.<n>

The flash resembled a welding spark without slag or smoke, the very intense flashing was rapid and random but seemed to be sequential in nature. 10 minutes after I observed this anomaly in the sky that had appeared for approximately 4 to 6 seconds at what seemed to be over Mac Dill AFB. Tampa Fla.  I heard what sounded like afterburners being used on what I felt were scrambled fighter jets.  The epicenter of the event or craft occupied about 1/4 inch of the sky when viewed, relative to surroundings at the distance I was at.<n>

I pulled over and we watched the orbs and noticed they appeared to very slowly drift in an direction towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, gradually one of the orbs furthest to the east seemed to simply disappear.  Then I noticed yet another orb lift what appeared upwards and fade away leaving two orbs.  Then to the west-southwest of the western most orb an new red orb appeared brightly and gradually drifted eastward.  The orb in front of it appeared to dip downward and fade while one of the other orbs lifted upward and faded.  This continued for about 7 minutes with the orbs disappearing and a new one appearing to keep the number constant between 3 and 4.  Finally, one by one, they all faded away and were gone, just as uniquely as they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched closely to see if I could make them out as navigation lights from aircraft but they never seemed to blink on and off like navigation lights should.  They also did not move like typical approaching aircraft would when in the flight pattern with Lambert St. Louis International Airport.  There was also ZERO sound.  It was as quiet as could be.  No engine sounds or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Towards the end of the odd event, I was able to capture some video using my iPhone.

There is this one bright light that appears in the sky every other night.  I have a feeling it is not a plane or a star because this light tends to move a lot.  It  brights up so bright, that looks like it could be the northern star.  Then all of a sudden the lights get really dim then seconds later it gets really bright, sometimes it turns blue other people have seen this.  It kind of looks like if it has lights on it turning around in circles.  I really have to idea what it could be and I am determined to find out what the bright moving light really is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 days ago approximately around 8:00 pm , above a tall tree there was this big ball of light that looked like it was falling from the sky but it looked so close.  My boyfriend was with me and as soon as I saw it I told him to look because I wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing anything.  When it appeared it looked as if it was a huge shooting star but couldn&#39;t have been because after I seen the big bright light that it flashed it disappeared that&#39;s when I told my boyfriend and when he looked up he saw it brighten up again right  when it was passing the tree that I had seen it above.  This isn&#39;t the first time I have experienced sightings of weird, strange lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just really would like for others to know that theres unexplainable lights in the sky.  Whenever I get the chance I will make sure I record or take pictures to prove what I am seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD))<n>

There were a pair of blinking lights in the black sky heading N.  It would&#39;ve passed for an airplane except when it turned the opposite direction, the lights (both)just turned; no U-turn...just turned around and there was no sound being emitted from craft/object.

11/30/13 20:00|Tucson|AZ|Unknown|3-4 minutes|Unusual Lights Above Catalina Mountains in Tucson|12/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105064.html|25|ndxe201311| Unusual Lights Above Catalina Mountains in Tucson<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 8pm in the northern Tucson area of Sabino Canyon, while observing the night sky, a friend of mine and I witnessed a dull whitish light moving in a southerly direction towards the city of Tucson.  At the time of the sighting, it was located almost directly over the mid section of the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light did not have the characteristics of a &#39;beam&#39; with a ray emanating forward, but rather that of a glowing effect that was constant in luminescence.  Estimating height would put it at several miles up however there was insufficient evidence to make more than a guess. It moved very slowly relative to what one might see from an airliner or even that of a small plane.  There were no strobe lights seen during this sighting and no other color was present than the dull white glow.  No sound could be heard either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched its flight path, it moved towards, and eventually into, a small cloud. Fully expecting to see it emerge on the other side of this small cloud I was surprised to see nothing emerge. When the cloud moved on, there was no light anywhere in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later, we again witnessed what appeared to be another light in the same general area and same characteristics as the first only moving somewhat perpendicular to that of the first object&#39;s path. This time there was no cloud in the object&#39;s path but after a couple of minutes, it just faded to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects seemed to travel about the same distance in their respective directions before disappearing.  Both were larger relative to the &#39;moving spot&#39; one sees when a satellite passes overhead.  Logical assumptions as to expected characteristics of these moving objects did not seem to apply when trying to put them in a frame of context for normal plane or helicopter flight.<n>

The object just kept moving in a steady pace same altitude while on fire-I could see the flames clearly from my window.  Being about 25 miles from Newark airport we are in the flight path of the airlines and see planes fly over constantly and this was not an airplane.  At this time I grabbed my iPad and ran out my front door to video the object which I did while screaming for the rest of the family to come outside and witness the object.  The object flew directly over my house and we all could very clearly see that the object was under control flying westward and what looked like flames surrounding the craft.  It was a awesome sight beautiful actually.  The night was cloudy,after the craft passed us it traveled probably a mile definitely slowed down  then seemed to ascend get smaller and smaller then disappear.<n>

I looked up and there was a bright light and almost looking like a fire ball, we stopped and looked there were 6 right behind that one.  You could see some of them still for a little bit and then they would start moving very slowly, then disappear.  They were as high as a plane maybe even higher and very very bright.<n>

They were very far apart and at four different heights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived at my house and looked outside to see they had moved.  The lights seemed to get brighter and dimmer as I viewed them but sporadically like burning orbs.  They made no sound. The lights began to hover and move towards each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flickered out and disappeared for five minutes and then mysteriously came into view as quickly as they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four orbs hovered for two minutes and then came close together and made a “Z” like formation.  They then moved into a “V” formation and hovered upwards a bit.  They flickered out of view after about three minutes of there reappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made my family come out and watch the orbs with me; there were five of us who witnessed this in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something I really want to emphasize is they were hovering.  It did not move like an airplane, balloon, or anything I had seen before.  They were four glowing balls of light that had the control to stay in one place or hover whenever they chose as well as maneuver into different formations….  As of now I have no explanation of what they could have possibly been.  I have never seen such a thing in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This pattern was repeated for the next several hours. One by one, the UFO&#39;s would appear, hover, then proceed south.  My son, and I did see a few crafts moving to the north, but I could not make out the shape only the flashing lights.  We also observed a very bright shape in the southern sky that appeared to be a star, but was very large and had a very large hue around it.  As, I observed it through the binoculars and I could see flashing lights enter the object.   At one point 6 &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; appeared and moved into what looked like a formation.  I also was able to see through the binoculars that they seemed to be traveling in pairs, so my numbers could be way off.  They change shape, as I did see a saucer shape very clearly and sketched it out as soon as I saw it, but also other shapes that resembled a cigar and some that appeared to have a tail like a comma, among others. The colors varied from ship to ship, but most has blue, red, yellow, gold, maybe green alternating flashing/pulsating.  It really depends on the angle I was looking and the distance, but the colors were present on all the crafts.<n>

It was late afternoon on November 30th 2013.  About one mile outside of Little Chute we noticed a dark circle ahead in the distance over the highway&#39;s left lane.  We watched it as we got closer we realized it was completely motionless.  There was a car slightly in front of me on in the left lane that I was sure was going to hit it.  As we approached it the object appeared very metallic in the headlights of the car.  It hovered over the highway at about 8 feet, and was approximately the size of a basketball, or slightly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the car in front of me passed directly underneath it, the object did not move at all.  It hovered completely motionless even when the car passed under it.  This happened around 4:40 P.M. and as soon as i got home i reported it to Fox 11 news as well as some other stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen in my 33 years on the planet.  Whatever this was, it was silent, motionless, metallic, and unaffected by air movement.<n>

They seemed to have a shape similar to a glider parachute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I seen them they were heading toward Lake Havasu there were 4 to 6 of them in formation about 10 miles away from me.  They were very stealth (hard to detect) the second time I seen them about 10 miles away from me they turned away 180* and the sun reflected on them, again exposing them and they headed out toward the &#34;Heart of the Mojave&#34; Desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no other aircraft in the sky.

11/30/13 01:53|Mukilteo|WA||90 seconds|More Strange Noises Outside House|12/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105040.html|40|ndxe201311| More Strange Noises Outside House<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is new and also a follow-up to my report: &#34;Strange Humming Noise Outside House (Mukilteo) - 11/21/2013 23:35.”  It was on Saturday, November 30, 2013, (a few days after the first report I submitted for a relative). It was at 1:53 a.m. and I woke up from a sound sleep to a noise coming from outside my window in the courtyard area (which is the front of my house). It was the same area and direction where my adult relative heard a noise one week earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound that woke me from sleep was a loud noise giving off electrical feedback, like from an amplifier, or like a microphone being put close to a large wattage speaker, creating a high pitch sound or frequency. I also heard what sounded like a muffled, soft, metallic voice speaking over or through the noise, like it was giving some kind of verbal directions or orders. I could not make out what the voice was saying, but it sounded like English. The direction of the noise definitely was in the courtyard, but seemed directed from above and down across to the house. I had been awake for about thirty seconds and continued hearing this. I was really tired and ready to get up to go look out the window, but as I was ready to do so, the noise and voice faded to silence. Again, no lights or craft were seen or witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I asked my adult relative who heard a noise one week prior (first report) if she heard this and this time she did not. It was then that we both, and another relative, started to discuss these strange noises and some other ones throughout the last couple of years. I also studied the courtyard and one half side of it has five tall birch trees (20 ft. in height) and the other side of the courtyard (where our front yard is and where our bedroom windows face) there are four red maple trees (6 ft. in height). Among these maple trees, two had unexpectedly died a few summers ago, I would say in 2010. Two new maples were planted, and they, and the other original three all started to change their leaves for the Fall season that June and July, way ahead of schedule, and the leaves turned black (or scorched) and fell off by the end of August of that year. Not sure why. Then as of this last year, the two newly planted maples died and had to be replaced again. Before the! y died, their leaves also change ahead of time and turned black as well. These two spots where these maples are located are right outside and below our windows about 12 and 20 feet away. So far, the new trees appear to be doing better than the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, as we were discussing this, a relative reminded me about a dream I shared a few summers ago, sometime in either 2010 or 2011. I had totally forgotten about this… but I had woken up one summer morning feeling very disturbed by a dream I had (at least I hope it was a dream as it seemed so real). The dream was short in duration, but in the dream, I was lying down and looking up at two alien beings staring down at me. I was being examined by them, and the portion of that dream felt like it was the end of the dream or after the examination. For some reason, that is the only part of the dream I remember and then I woke up scared because it all felt too real. I really can’t describe it any other way. This dream was around the time when I first started hearing strange computer-like &#34;beeping noises&#34; in the early pre-dawn hours during the summer when I had my window open on various nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m an adult male who is a devout, non-denominational Christian. I’m not sure what all these things mean, but it’s clear we might be (and have been) witnessing some strange encounters unbeknownst to us all this time. Again, we would like to remain anonymous, but continue to be vigilant of our nighttime surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

11/29/13 23:30|Cranford|NJ|Chevron|7 seconds|Large, silent V-shaped craft spotted traveling southeast quickly in a linear path.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104970.html|41|ndxe201311| Large, silent V-shaped craft spotted traveling southeast quickly in a linear path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday around 11:30 to 11:33pm Eastern time, I was taking my dog out in my backyard and looking at the sky since it was unusually clear.  While looking at some stars I noticed slightly dimmer lights (yellowish-white) in a V-shaped formation moving across the sky.  I quickly reached for my iPhone in my pocket, looked down to pull up the camera, but by the time I was ready to take a picture, the object was passing over some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have the time to count the amount of lights but I would approximate there were about a little over a dozen.  They were about the size of the stars-that is, they were tiny lights, not large.  These yellowish-white lights did not flicker or blink and were very close together, about six or seven forming each arm of the V-shape.  Since the sky was very clear and dark, I could not make out an actual shape of the aircraft aside from the shape the lights made.  The V-shape was neither too wide nor too narrow.  It was shaped like a normal &#34;V&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was silent, but massive.  If you stretch out your arm and separate your thumb and pointer fingers by about 2.5 to 3 inches, you will get a pretty good idea of how large it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very quickly across the sky in a linear path, meaning it wasn&#39;t zigzagging around.  I pulled up the compass on my phone to see exactly what direction it was heading in-it was heading around 150 degrees southeast, and coming from the north or northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final note: my dog acted normal as if nothing had happened.<n>

I looked up and about halfway on the horizon I saw a large red oval shape traveling straight up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nudged my friend and said, ``Look at that,`` pointing to the object in the sky.  Both amazed we walked to that direction of the object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glowing red oval object continued to rise straight up very fast.  As it reached very high in the sky it started to cloak until all that was seen was a very small faint almost clear dot than it started moving back and forth a few times very fast.  It than starting to come back down as it did it looked like an orb around the dot and it gained red color.  The closer it got to the ground it took on the oval shape and was fire red with a little blue.  It came down and what seemed very close to the ground from where we were.  It disappeared behind an apt. building from our view point and seemed to have been going to the ground somewhere nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is an amazing, beautiful and unforgettable sighting.<n>

There was no fuselage section or tail.  The shape resembled a B2 bomber but lacked the jagged edges in the back.  It was a flying wing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a dark grey color and had what looked like four equidistant lines like armament racks along the wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over MSU University area in a southern direction.  I tried to watch it further but it blended in with the sky so well I lost my tracking sooner than I thought I would.  About 5 seconds after it passed over me a regular small passenger type jet followed a few hundred yards to the left of it.  It seemed like a coincidence but maybe they were flying together.<n>

I was following a car driven by my wife with my daughter in the front passenger seat and her friend in the back.  The skies were extremely clear.   A bright white light came into view to my right at a slight angle upwards but well over the tree tops.  It moved very fast to the right and vanished.  Total sighting time may have been 1 to 1.5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t be sure how far it travelled before it disappeared, but it was a good distance across the sky.  It didn’t make any sound that I could detect being in the car, and it did not leave any type of vapor trail that I could tell.  I cannot be sure how big it was only that it had to be substantial to give off that much light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we reached our home on Mohawk Trail in West Greenwich, RI, my daughter ran from my wife’s car to ask if I had seen it and I told her I had.  My wife had also seen it but not my daughter’s friend in the back seat.   Later that evening, I mentioned the sighting to my neighbor who said that he had also seen a bright white light go across the sky while he was standing in his front yard.  He confirmed it to be right around 8PM.  He described its movement the same as we did, it seemed to appear move across the sky and vanished very quickly and made no sound.  The way he described it, it would have been travelling east to west in the sky.<n>

When I looked I did not see what he was referring to.  However, as we stood outside several minutes later I witnessed first hand a formation of rapidly moving &#34;white&#34; lights, moving from a north to south general direction.  When I observed the lights it appeared that at first, they were in a pointed formation similar to a chevron, however as they moved, the lights were moving in and out of formation randomly.  For example, some of the lights moved ahead of the others periodically, and then back, as others did the opposite.  There were approximately 10 or 12 of these lights in this particular instance.  Our viewing angle was approximately 120 to 150 degrees from where we were standing to the objects in question.  Approximately 5 minutes later, a third set of lights was seen, a! lso traveling the same trajectory as the previously mentioned.  However, there were only about 5 of the lights in this occurrence.  These particular lights were moving very rapidly as well, but in more of a &#34;line&#34; formation, semi-diagonal in nature from a north to south direction.  These particular lights did not appear to move out of formation as the aforementioned.  About 10 minutes later, myself and one of the two witnessing coworkers made a fourth observance of these lights, this time there were four lights in total.  The lights were much brighter this time, and coming from a more eastern direction heading west, south-west.  These four lights were packed much closer together, and weaving in and out of their formation rapidly.  As they approached our position, they changed course to a more southern direction very rapidly.  Each visual lasted approx. one minute, with the last one lasting slightly longer.  There was no sound associated with these occurrences, and! no other visible anomalies associated with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A little wave of oddness washed over me.  Then they were moving south, in the same shape.  Then, I saw some more orange dots coming in from the north, heading the same direction.  I am now scared.  All I heard were the noises of the cars moving by.  And I saw the cars, too.

I looked to see if the corners of the formation were steady, hoping to see a mother ship, but they were independently moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were overhead, not directly, overhead like if you were looking out a window.  It appeared to me that one of the ships was a laggard and moving more quickly to catch up to the rest, I cupped my eyes out the window and looked at laggard object catching up and did see a rotating light pattern moving about a pentagon or hexagon shape, red, green, blue, after a few minutes the objects disappeared either behind a clouds, fog! , or they just faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound from the crafts whatsoever.

I then noticed I had left the blinds and curtains open in my bedroom so I went to close them.   The time is 6:50PM in Frederick, Maryland, technically Urbana, but we have no post office in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went in front of the window (of which there is a small wicker settee in front of it), I glanced outside and saw at that moment two orange lights heading to the right in the sky, which is heading south.  It is not strange to see helicopters around here either for rescue or for the military, but I thought it was strange that I did not hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then opened up the window to hear the sound, but it was quiet except for my waterfall of my pond from below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my 9 year old daughter upstairs to see this strange sight.  She was eating oatmeal and she came upstairs and was frightened by the site.  Then I called up my husband to see these lights.  I then noticed another 4 or 5 orange lights w! ere going at the same altitude, heading north to south.  These lights approached from my left, from the north.  I left my husband upstairs, calmed down my daughter, who went back to her Ipad, and I grabbed my Ipod to take what video I could, knowing it would not turn out great because it is an Ipod.  I keep the Ipod on my body all day because I am tracking my steps with the goal of 12,000 steps a day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the video, though I moved some and also attempted to zoom in.  If you look at the very last shot of the video, you can see an orange light with movement, almost as if the sight of a meteor with a tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would describe these as very bright lights.  If I had to guess the height of the aircraft, I’d say 10-12,000 feet high at the highest.  They could have even been lower.  The seemed to have an alternating pattern of either one closer, one further away, or even if you picture a line graph, one would be at one exact height and the following one would be at a different height, but as they flowed through they all stayed consistent at the height in the sky where they were.   They seemed to fade away as they went south.  They were moving as quickly as a helicopter would, or even an airplane.  They were not zooming, but keeping a steady pace but with obvious movement.  I did not sense fear, but more curiosity.  I did not feel the urge to run outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on the very edge of a large residential community, so possibly they were following along the edge of darkness?  A country road borders our neighborhood just a street away from the direction where I saw these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I called my daughter and husband up to see them, the dog came too.  The dog is afraid of helicopters, last summer a helicopter was hovering about 100 feet above our residential street trying to find a car crash that was a few miles away.  The dog showed no signs of fear or unusual behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will add that I was not wearing my glasses which are used for distance.  I only use them for driving, some television, and to watch live shows.<n>

There was no noise or flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The winds were light out of the north.  The objects moved too quickly to be riding on the wind and did not waiver.  The general appearance was that of a fireball without a tail or trace.<n>

It was not a star, it was to low on the horizon.  I watched it carefully to see if it moved, like a plane or helicopter, anything, but it didn&#39;t move, it just hovered for several minutes.  It was very large and very bright.  Then suddenly the object split into two, and one part began to fly off to the south.  After a few minutes the second object followed.  I visually followed the first object and watched it fly at a high rate of speed due south, then it abruptly turned right and flew straight up until it disappeared.  The second object followed the same southerly path, but did not turn right.  I thought it was over.  I was very wrong.  Next, I once again saw another object manifest itself in roughly the same spot.  This object again split and instead of immediately flying south, three objects hovered over to the left of the main &#34;ship.&#34;  Over the next 2.5 hours, myself, my son and my husband all witnessed something, I can not even believe really happened.  I watched as these &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; manifested themselves out of thin air one after the other, they would hover for several moments then fly due south.  It was like a caravan of UFO&#39;s, as I looked back to the North from where the original UFO had appeared, I literally witnessed one after the other flying in the same direction about the same distance apart from each other.  They were all the same colors and seemed to be the same shape.  We counted roughly 40-50 UFO&#39;s total over that 2.5 hour period of time.  I do not have access to anything stronger than a pair of binoculars, but those were enough to see what I needed to see.  I saw a ring with bright alternating colors of blu! e, green, red and yellow lights flashing, they made no noise o! r sound and all of them followed the same path.  They appeared to change shape( looking fuller while hovering, then flattening out while flying).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they seemed to have some sort of bubble on the front of the craft, then they turned flat and rotated and at other times they seemed to have some sort of tail (all of these assessments of exact shape are from the photos).  I was able to take pictures and some video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed was amazing, as well as, terrifying. I know my life is forever changed from this experience and would love some feedback or any insight. Thank in advance for your help.<n>

They moved and passed by each other.  I watched for about 10 minutes until me and the passenger decided to go home.  The background was totally black, clear sky.  They looked almost like a cell phone tower height from afar.  At first I thought that&#39;s what it was a tower I never noticed until they began to move and they never blinked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I could see her being held down by a force like a blanket and trying to get to her.  The room I saw was black on the floor but really bright white above and when you tried to look at anyone in the room a brighter flash would be in your face to cover them up.  A beam like a laser ray would scan up and down my body, they were highly pissed they could not identify us together and kept asking me why we were together and our purpose together.  I kept showing identification but they didn&#39;t care they wanted proof we were together. Finally I showed them my debit card and said scan this to see both of our names are on the account, you can then see we are together.  Fi! nally they allowed me to go to her and when I reached for her that&#39;s when we both woke up on the floor.  she heard me yelling at them and that I showed my debit card and kept saying...scan this scan this...  my debit card was OUT of my wallet which was other side of room and was on top of my wallet.?  the only card out.  we both are still shaking from this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We all looked at the lights and then we noticed they all started slowly moving.  At first, we only noticed three little lights, but then after a while we noticed two more not as close.  All of these five lights seemed to be pulsing slowly, they would pulsate to a really bright light to a duller light.  The three lights seemed to be moving slowly in sync with each other.  They did not have a distinct shape but they seemed to move together towards the sky; I did not believe it was a comet or an airplane.  Slowly they would pulse bright and then dimmer until one disappeared.  They all disappeared one right after another, one at a time.  This was less than five minutes and it seemed like they moved a far distance in the sky but they moved very slowly.<n>

In the center it was darker blue then lighter blue then white on the parameter if the object.  A trail or tail followed the object.  It filled the horizon.

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to empty trash into my garbage bin at about 7:40 PM and was walking back to my front door when I noticed a VERY bright, deep-orange-red light traveling from north to south about the speed of a small plane at low altitude or a jet at a higher altitude.  It made absolutely no sound.  No prop noise-no jet noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen aircraft flying at night that had an orange-red light on the front which made me stop and look at it.  I also thought it was very odd in that private planes/commercial jets always have flashing lights on their wings/fuselage and this had none, just an orange-red “headlight”.  I call it a “headlight” because as it passed directly overhead, the orange-red light faded and disappeared.  I’m guessing the light pointed forward which is why I was no longer able to see it once it was traveling away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it disappeared, I looked back from where I first saw it and there was ANOTHER, identical, very bright, orange-red light traveling in the same direction at the same speed-no sound.  I watched it and again, the orange light faded and disappeared once it was directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After rubber-necking, I looked back again where I had first seen the first two and now there were THREE MORE!  They were all visible at the same time.  They were obviously traveling in a line, following one another.  The first two must have been spaced farther apart and the  last 3 must have been following one another more closely which is why I could see all three of them at once.  I live at the base of a hill with trees on top so I don’t have a good view of the horizon so I could not see all five of them approaching at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last three did the same thing-fade and disappear once they were directly overhead, one after another.  I could see no wings or profile of the crafts, nor could I hear them.  It was a clear night with stars visible.  No city lights and dead quiet.  I live in the boonies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m pretty sure they were very low-maybe 3000-6000 feet.  If they were higher, I would have seen them all at once and they would not have “crept” past the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen military planes/copters traveling in convoys before-they make a racket.  These things made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at the Mufon posts, I see that others in Wisconsin have seen the exact same red-orange things flying the exact same way.  What the heck are they?

Whole sky glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother &amp; his wife were leaving after Thanksgivivg dinner  He happen to notice very bright lights in sky.  His wife came in house telling everyone to go outside and look in the sky.  I grabbed my camera as I walked outside and sure enough there were very bright lights lighting up the sky.  There were 4 for sure in the front line and I believe two behind at each end.  As soon as we got outside the rear lights started to fade then the line started fading out one at a time.  We weren&#39;t sure if they were lost to cloud cover or fading out.  As soon as I walked outside and seen them I started recording.  I started to zoom right away towards one of them.  The 1st second of video you can see 4 lights in line all equal distances apart.  You can hear everyone on the audio questioning what they are seeing.  The lights were silent and headed east over Lake Erie.  We see planes headed to and from Detroit all the time, this was not even close.  These lights were huge in comparison, silent, and moved very slow.<n>

My boyfriend came outside a few minutes later to go to the store.  As he drove away I happen to notice something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happen to be facing North west. I saw what seem to be an orange string like object floating across the sky. It was lightly illuminated.  As it floated across the sky it would change form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I closed my eyes a few times to see if what I was seeing was true.  It was night and dark and clear as day I could see this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object continue across the sky in the south east direction.  I could not take my eyes off of this now.  I watched it take several different forms.  It wasn&#39;t a straight line. It was more like a ribbon floating across the sky, only this was lit up and was large in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I just saw but I do know it wasn&#39;t a plane or clouds.  Clouds are not orange and do not move across the sky in that manner.<n>

It was close enough that had it been an aircraft we should have heard some type of noise, yet we did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 more came from the vicinity of the ocean and hovered with the first.  They then appeared to be getting smaller and we could tell that they were actually getting farther away from us.  Then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in shock and were talking about what we had just witnessed when two more in the same formation as the two that came in together before came in, stopped and hovered, then again started to ascend until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband came up and we were telling him what we had seen when a single object appeared coming from the ocean and it too hovered then started to ascend.  We talked for a couple of minutes then went upstairs into our of! fice.  I walked to the window to look one more time and another single object was in the sky in the same space as the others, I knocked on the window to get my husband&#39;s attention and pointed to it, and he too saw that one and we watched it until it disappeared like the others.<n>

The house faces the River just a few yards to the west. Our friends have a large stone fire pit and it&#39;s common for us to make a fire and sit around it after dinner chatting and enjoying the stars.  We had an unusually clear view of the western sky due to it being winter and all the leaves being gone.  We have seen satellites, shooting stars and many other aircraft over the years; even the international space station, which we confirm with the NASA website as to when it is passing by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say we took note of Venus on Thursday evening because by the time we got out there,  plenty of bright stars were out.  However, tonight--Friday, we were out there an hour early and saw the very bright rising of Venus at around 5:30 PM. White , bright, &amp; steady.  If you are familiar with the night sky upstate, you can&#39;t mistake it as anything else but a planet.  I&#39;ve heard about folks mistaking Venus for a UFO, but this was not the case with us.  For one thing, Venus is in a totally different location in the sky: SSW.  Our fireball was out of the WNW as we were looking directly over the river at 6:50 PM Thursday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we all thought it was an aircraft with its landing lights on; but not white--orange--the color of flame.  It was pretty far away, looked like a couple of miles.  We realized this was no ordinary aircraft as it appeared to enlarge or come closer to us.  I thought it had 2 tiny white dot lights  inside and we all saw an &#34;aura&#34; or haze around the sphere.  One of us saw a red &#34;trail&#34;.  The &#34;aura&#34; looked like the  suns corona during an eclipse.  It made several horizontal shifts to the left and right.  The shifts looked perfectly straight and sharp, like it was under guided control.  Then we thought it must be a rocket launch or a piece of gigantic space debris burning up slowly.  A helicopter on fire?  But there was absolutely no sound.  While it was in the sky, an actual plane with normal red blinking lights passed by it and gave us perspective on how much larger this fire ball was or how much farther away it was from us.  Unfortunately, we were all so stupefied none of us thought to whip out a cell phone and try to record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it enlarged (or came closer to us on an easterly course) we got the strange feeling our large pit fire was somehow visible to the craft (IF it was a craft!) and maybe was attracting it&#39;s attention?  I hate to be unscientific but since we all felt that way afterwards, it&#39;s worth noting.  After about 3 minutes it slowly just &#34;winked out&#34; and disappeared.  Very reminiscent of the second stage of a rocket reaching orbital height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, there WAS a planned launch of a Space X satellite scheduled for 6:20 that evening from Cape Canaveral, but the launch was aborted, so that wasn&#39;t it. We were also aware of comet ISON approaching perihelion that afternoon -- but there was no way that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final observation: we can clearly see a local New Paltz landmark, the little light in the tower at Mohonk Mountain House way up on a mountain from that location.  We can see that light with the naked eye, and since my friends have hiked up there many times they know that light is made by two little 75 watt bulbs.  After discussing this, we all agree what we saw for that brief time was 1,000 times brighter than that little light at Mohonk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks so much for your interest. Please keep me posted on any developments or ideas you have on what we saw--what we all might be seeing--in these &#34;fireball&#34; type sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I came around a corner and saw what looked like three bright orange flares in the sky.  At first I thought that it was not moving, so I pulled over to look more closely.  With my car stopped I realized that all three flares were moving simultaneously in the same direction.  The top right light disappeared first, then the bottom and finally the top left.  It looked like it may have been a mile at most in the sky, maybe lower.  If it was as far away as I thought it was, it was a very large object, the size of a stadium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer (me) is a 26 year old married caucasian male.  I have lived in this area my entire life and am very familiar with this drive.  I believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial life previous to this event.  I have a good job, just got married, just bought a house, and have a very stable, simple life.  Just a run of the mill American.<n>

My husband was walking our dog. He came to the front door and asked me to come outside and check out “these weird lights”.  I saw 3 bright red/orange orbs moving across the sky (moving west to east).  They were in a perfect line moving at the same speed on the same path.  They were completely silent and no other planes were flying around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be about 700-1,000 feet altitude. My husband said he saw 4 orbs initially, but one drop down from the line slowly.  When they passed over the house, we went to the back yard to continue the watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, one at a time they appeared to be ascending upward and they disappeared.  We ran back to the front of the house and 2 more appeared coming from the same direction (west to east), at the same speed, on the same path.  Again, they passed over the house, we ran to the backyard, they ascended, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred 2 more time…10 orbs in total.

It looked as if it could be the top of a cell phone tower except there is not ome there. after watching for 10 minutes we began to see red and orange blinking lights.  It just hovered in the same spot and we saw an airplane pass by it but it made it very obvious that the light was not a regular airplane because it was much larger and the lights were more rotating around the object versus the airplanes lights which blinked fastly and stayed in one spot.  After about 40 minutes it SLOWLY began to travel south, still flying very low.  We then witnessed another plane flying in the sky above it so we dont think it was a satellite since that plane (clearly a regular plane) was flying above it.  At about 45 minutes in the objects lighta started to flicker out and then get bright again.  Each dimming episode lasted about 20 secs, every 90 secs.  We watched it for an hour before it traveled out of our line of sight.<n>

We take her home as much as we can {it seems to help her condition}<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was taking out the garbage during a clean up process I noticed a very bright large white star in the west south-west sky, it was very beautiful.  I stared at it for a moment and then looked further to the west and gazed at a tiny star twinkling and then further west north-west an orange star began to appear it reminded me of the moon that every now and again turns yellow orange {you know}.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peering through the trees out at the horizon the orange star was moving – “ oh well jet airliner<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it drifted higher like the ember from a fire another orange star began to appear, I was certain that the Columbus Air Force Base was conducting drills.  As the two orange lights rose slowly from the horizon-I was waiting for a familiar aerial sound-wop, wop, wop, but there was no sound and then another orange light appeared in the same area of orientation and began to rise into sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there I certainly did not want to make a complete fool out of myself while another orange light began to rise.  My hopes were very anxious and high that a sonic boom or a popping sound would become proof that it was Columbus doing their thing. Only seconds had passed from the first light  to the fourth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and opened the kitchen door and called out to my wife and said honey come here and look at this and she I immediately came to where I was standing and said “WOW “its beautiful! What is it?”  Then another orange sphere begin to rise from the same location as all the others came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we peered through the trees my wife said I bet we can see them better in the front yard so we went to the front yard and the view was a little better as the orange lights were rising higher and were heading due north and then another orange sphere began to appear from the same area of orientation and then another and then another it was like a roman candle in a slow m! otion rotation pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somewhere higher than the others in a drift pattern you would expect the embers of a fire swirling in the wind.  My wife said “there is no sound maybe its those balloons they put candles in and release on a wish!<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK I was starting to buy into the idea and suddenly all the lights became in alignment shaped like a v or as my wife put it – like a row of geese but the alignment was moving due north and the point of the shape was pointing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began quickly to disappear and my wife ran inside the house to get a camera to possibly photograph them.  There were only 3 light left – 1 alone and 2 together.

They just seemed to disappear after a few minutes. There was no sound whatsoever.  If we hadnt been standing on our deck we would have never known. Our TV did go black screen at the same time but when we came back in we were able to turn it back on. By the time we thought of getting our phones to take a pic it was gone. We were all trying to figure out what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Too large and too early in the day to be a star, I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  We joked about it, but I kept watching.  Heading due-west, I realized it was moving North and South, but there was no smoke trail.  As soon as I opened my mouth to mention it to my husband, he exclaimed, “It’s moving!”  Very soon after, it seemed to stop moving North-South, but the light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, we were passing over a body of water by a Framingham exit.  The reflection looked orange, so I looked up, expecting to see sunset starting.  Instead, the sky was bright blue and clear of clouds, except for one, which was directly ahead of us.  It was neon orange in color, a vertical ellipse in shape, about 40 azimuth from the horizon, about 10 azimuth in height.  I joked in less technical terms that it looked like female genitalia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do a lot of sky gazing, I’ve never seen a cloud like this, my jaw was in my chest, eyes trained on it.  I remarked that it looked like it was glowing brighter, and the constantly white UFO reappeared at the very top of the elliptical cloud, growing from pinpoint in size to the same size as we had originally seen it.  The cloud dissipated within seconds, from the top down, looking more purple as it dissipated.  There was a bright white flash at the very top of the UFO, and a few seconds later it seemed to momentarily change from white to a faint green, but I don’t remember if this was before or after the cloud dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to gauge if the UFO was moving or hovering after that, due to the winding roads. It fell out of sight a few times when we dropped in altitude, (particularly Westbound on I/84). The diameter of the illumination was consistent until we neared the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it seemed to grow larger, and appeared to be hovering South of Hartford. We lost sight of it when we exited in New Britain, Connecticut, and we couldn’t see it at our final destination.<n>

Looking outside as I often do, now, I see in the western sky above tree line, a white light which hangs there, probably 2-3 miles away, at a couple hundred feet off the ground.  Now this is very sparsely populated area, so there is not much over there.  This UFO, gets bright then goes dim, goes out, then dim, then gets brighter, then dimmer, then brighter, then dimmer and goes out, only to grow dim-bright again.  This pattern goes on for some time, entertaining for a little while perhaps 20 minutes (I would watch, go away, and come back to still see it, eventually I got busy and forgot,  finally going back much later, it was gone) but, after a while, I just thought, well, they&#39;re back, again.  I don&#39;t know if they are attempting to tell me something or what?  I did not know until getting this iPad and going on google earth, there is actually a road back there, of which, I was unaware, I had thought it just open countryside for miles.  However, knowing that now, I think the next time, I see this craft, just hanging around back there, I may just go for a ride, I hope, on them.<n>

In Mississippi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 18 year old daughter and I were driving on HWY 8, headed east right at the Calhoun/Chickasaw County line.  We noticed a glowing (silver-ish) ball that was going back and forth from one ball to two balls.  Connected like Mickey Mouse ears.  It was just above the tree line.  Hovering.  After about 45 seconds, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 20 seconds later a blinding neon light was coming straight at us.  At first, it looked like headlights.  But it was so bright that it lit up everything like looking through infrared glasses.  It was greenish blue waves that looked hot.  Like how the highway looks on a extremely hot day- kinda wavy.  This light shot straight through my car and passed by the passenger side window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned to look, everything in the background - the field - the trees were lit up.  And then it was gone.  It happened so fast that I didn&#39;t realize I had slammed on my brakes.  An 18 wheeler must have seen it too because he was stopped dead still on the highway too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I&#39;m posting this now is due to my daughter&#39;s nightmares.  About a month ago she started having dreams about the incident.  She won&#39;t go into detail about them but she has slept with me every night since.  I&#39;m not sure why it started 5 months after we saw this, but she is terrified.  This isn&#39;t normal behavior for her.<n>

We set up a couple of camping chairs on the edge of the road so that we could look at the night sky to the north east and have a conversation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 19:30 I turned my gaze to the north and saw a white light in the sky at about 10:00 above the horizon.  The light was moving slowly from north to south and appeared to be both below and in some clouds that peppered the otherwise clear sky.  The light was soft white with no blinking running lights and did not have the bright glare of an airplane headlight.  It looked similar to a satellite but was about 3 to 5 times larger.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If one were to hold their arm out and spread their fingers to about 4 inches, that would be the distance this object travelled.  It then faded out at the end and disappeared.  From our vantage point this object was moving more towards us than away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later I looked at the same location and saw a light that looked exactly the same but this time it was headed at a 90 degree angle from where the first one was seen to fade out and this one went about the same distance from east to west and faded out as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 20:00 my attention again was drawn to this location in the sky and another white light was moving very slowly from east to west again seeming to be in the clouds and not above them.  This one was seen for a longer duration of 3 minutes where the others were viewed for just under a minute each.  This 3rd light disappeared into the clouds and my friend G*** said it should be coming out of the clouds at a break in them at any moment.  We never saw the object again even though its trajectory should have had it come out at a good sized piece of cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night (Thanksgiving) our local channel 4 TV station aired a report about strange lights over Tucson on 11/28.<n>

The light was one of the brightest lights I have ever seen. it also looked like there was dome shape on the top part of the craft. so I pulled over and began recording it.   The object would be bright then it would go dimmer then brighter again.  I know it wasn&#39;t a cellphone tower because I noticed the object was moving. it was moving very slowly but nevertheless it was moving. there was only one of them.  it seemed to be moving then it began to hover then moving again.  this was a big object though my guess would be about the length of 4 semi trucks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and agree that the object probably was Venus, seen prominently in the southwest sky.

I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first and thought it was my neighbors next door, but it got louder.  I looked out my rear window and saw, what I can describe as a fleeting shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to my daughters room which is down the hall (10 feet), where her curtains were open and I saw what appeared to be a round object.  This object flashed very bright red lights which stayed steady for a several seconds, then flashed again.  There were two of these lights, and two white lights.  The white lights were very bright and flashed much more quickly then these two lights.  I could see a structure to this craft and it appeared to be round.  Due to the darkness the detail could not be made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going back to the lights, the best way to explain the position of the lights is by showing them in a lower case &#34;t&#34;.  One red light was at the top, the other at the bottom, while the two white lights were one on each side of the arms of the &#34;t&#34;.  This craft was very low and after it went past my house, made no noise.   flight path for aircraft flies from Richmond normally higher altitudes north and south.  This craft came from the West and again was very low.  I would have to estimate it was about 1,000 feet off the ground, maybe lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am former air force security forces and have extensive experience around aircraft, ranging from helicopters through the crafts. In the past week or so, I have seen either a C-17 or C-5 flying north of where I live, but they were MUCH higher then this craft, at approximately 20,000 feet.  I waited some time to see if one would fly back around again, and none have.  The nearest AFB is Andrews in MD, while Langley is south east. I know without a doubt that it was not a helicopter. This was much, much bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quantico, Stafford are within 20 minutes of my house while Shannon is within 10.  Neither Shannon or Stafford could support any large aircraft.  I am trying to find a rational explanation for what I saw, but cant find one, which is why I am reporting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to record any video and would request follow up to see if any other reports were made and or if any information was found that would explain it.<n>

They were all changing multiple colores, and they moved back and forth, up and down very quickly and almost gracefully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I should get my family to have the! m bring out a camera, and I turned again to walk back Sothbound to the house, as I looked over my shoulder to continue watching they all just seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise, saw no lights shining up  like search lights, or did not see any other air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside, and was a little freaked out because I believe that I just saw a UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched the local papers and news for any other reported sightings  since last night, and as of this report I have not found any other sightings or explanation for these lights over Hollister, Ca.<n>

It slightly &#34;rocked&#34; forward and back once while passing over the road and continued from west to east until we drove further and it was out of sight.  More cars were on the interstate but none seemed to slow down or be concerned with it.  It seemed to be too many lights to be an airplane which usually don&#39;t have that many lights in a singular upward curving row or be that low flying.<n>

My passenger and I saw what looked to be a very bright star in the night sky, and noticed it was slowly decreasing its altitude.  It descended from the sky until it was what seemed like right above our car.  I could make out an unusual shape from our sunroof.  It was a triangle-shaped object with bright light surrounding all sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was not a cool blue, but a warmer light.  It was radiant- as if for a moment someone had shined a flashlight in your eyes.  We know it was no plane or helicopter as there was dead silence above us.  It was moving very slowly, still quite a distance away.  For it to descend that fast only to &#34;hover&#34; above the road before moving away in the opposite direction is a very odd thing for a plane or helicopter to do.<n>

I ran home and grabbed my neighbors.  We went out to see it and watched it for another 10 minutes.  During that time, changed from bright white to yellow/gold, occasionally flashed red, grew dim and then bright, lights reflecting off of surrounding clouds.

I observed a light to the south, at a very high altitude moving across the morning sky from west to east.  I would estimate the altitude at somewhere around 90,000 to 100,000 feet and possibly following interstate 40 over Oklahoma City, Okla.  I would estimate the speed to be around Mach 20.  It took approximately 120 seconds for the object to traverse from the west to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traversed across the sky faster than the space stations, which I have watched from 11,000 feet in the San Christie Mountains at Philmont Scout Ranch.  But a whole lot slower than a streaking meteorite, with no contrail visible.   It appeared to me as if the sun was reflecting off the bottom of an aircraft.  Although there were no white or red strobe lights that was visible.  I feel that this could have been the experimental aircraft, Falcon HTV-2.  I am not sure what it was, but it was fast.<n>

I took a video that I&#39;m 100 percent sure it lasted roughly around 30 seconds.  When I arrived at my girlfriend&#39;s house it came only to be around 10 seconds.

It looked as if it had trusses, like 3-5 of them around the craft, that must&#39;ve been supports of some kind.  I would have assumed this was one of those large chinook helicopters but there was no lights, and as I said before, no sound to it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time a plane was flying at cruising altitude with its lights on, and from that perspective I would guess this craft couldn&#39;t have been much more than 1000 ft up.

They  either had to go up and over the pines to continue advancing toward me or turn.  The lights  on each craft were like two car head lights placed together.  I say on each craft because as I observed them, they each  in succession turned off to the west.  The lights were not extremely bright, nor were they a focused light.

I came in to the office and still stunned at what I saw and obviously feeling crazy in front of my partner I thought to check our video footage on our super camera that pans the field, and sure enough it picked them up great.  But not as far as I could see them for, the camera only pans so far and high, and the lights seem smaller on the camera than from my view, I was about half way between camera location and the lights as you can see my truck lights in the footage.<n>

As we traveled south (towards the fire station) and took a left onto Deerbrush, we both noticed a large, bright white light low in the sky on our left.  It was too large, low in the sky and bright to be a star or planet.  And it wasn&#39;t moving so we knew it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer to the light it became apparent it was a large, diamond shaped black object hovering over an area to our left (maybe as far off as over Childs street or closer over the Bryant Woods nature park area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled the car over right behind Lakeridge Jr. High and we turned around in our seats and watched the craft for about 3 minutes as it just floated/hovered in the same spot.  Then it started moving and flew over Lakeridge Jr. High.  It went behind a tree line and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter doesn&#39;t want to talk about this and is scared which is why I&#39;m even following up on this.  I&#39;m not scared but I want to know if anyone else saw the craft.  Strangely no one else was out walking in our neighborhood (which is usually busy with foot traffic and people jogging or walking their dogs--even on dark, winter night).  I remarked to my daughter that &#34;great, no other cars are driving now and no one else is out&#34; so we didn&#39;t see anyone else that saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing was weird.  We both wondered at first if it was a drone but as it became more clear to us it was too large (we thought) to be a drone.<n>

I have seen the craft most often in the vicinity of White River Narrows, a short stretch of canyon through which 318 winds just north of Hiko.  During the most recent sighting (in December 2014, I believe), I was concerned that the craft was being flown in hazardous weather conditions - high winds and rain/snow, a risky venture for the operators if they were in it ... or for the craft if it&#39;s just a remote.  The craft appears to have no fixed or flashing running lights (FAA violation?), so until the red light array is activated, it is basically invisible.  The effect is rather striking, though, because the light pattern is different each time - reminds me of the animated light patterns on the side of some blimps, but appears to be on the underside/underwing of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t get details of why this craft is being flown (I&#39;ve only seen it at night), but it could just be for fun or publicity to spice up interest in the mystique of the area with its adjacency to Area 51, which lies west of here off State Route 375 going toward Rachel.  There are a few Area 51-themed tourist attractions and businesses in this area, including E.T. Beef Jerky (right at the junction of 318 and 93), The Alien Research Center (just a short distance up 375 after it splits off from 318), which is more a gimmicky Sci-Fi memorabilia shop than any genuine &#34;research center.&#34;  Also up 375 is the Little A-lé-inn (spelling?) in Rachel, which is a good ways north of the famous/infamous &#34;Black Mailbox&#34; and main turnoff to get to Area 51 (there are actually several ... but not necessarily passenger-car-friendly ... access roads and backways into the property that comprises Area 51 - travel along them is highly inadvisable).  Maybe the operators of this craf! t are just playing into the lingering appeal of this area to UFO seekers from afar.  Pretty clever, but risky.  This report is just an explanation of this particular object to any &#34;newbies&#34; who see it for the first time and wonder if it might be extraterrestrial.  This one is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object #2: Some type of craft (likely a high-performance jet) performing dizzying maneuvers above the Hiko/Ash Springs/Alamo area near where SR 318 and US 93 intersect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this craft on a cold winter day in early 2014, when the sky was crystal clear ... other than the (perhaps unintended?) contrail that made it possible for me to track the movement of the craft, if not actually see it (it was either at very high altitude or very small and at low altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrail appeared intermittently, as though the craft was hitting pockets of very cold air along its path (much like one might see from a jetliner passing high overhead through variable air masses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cannot say if this was a manned or remotely controlled craft, but it was making some very sharp, sudden turns and loops that were far beyond what I believe to be the envelope of most known fighter planes, including those I have observed at air shows or conducting military practice maneuvers.  Possible sources:  Area 51, which is not far from here, or Nellis AFB, which lies about 80 - 90 miles south of here.  Pretty sure it was not just the Thunderbirds, whose home base is Nellis.  They usually stick close to Vegas and in a group.  This was an individual craft.  Wondering if anyone else has seen this type of craft executing similar aerobatics in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Every day and into the night he has an hourly smoke on the back porch, so he is very familiar with the skies and flight paths ect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, he pointed out a stationary UFO which had blue and white or very light yellow flashing lights around the perimeter.  It was about 10 miles away in the south and 400 feet above us.  It was hovering above a forested hill and was there for at least two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 4 seconds it was over us.  There was a VERY bright white light underneath and you could barely see the blues on the edges anymore due to its location to us.  However, the smaller lights around the large white one almost seemed recessed as it flew above us.  The back lights were more distinct in their outline.  ((Husband&#39;s name deleted)) believed it to be triangular in shape.  He had been outside in the dark longer so his eyes were able to see edges better than mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to determine size due to the fact that we could not see the elevation.  However, given the following perhaps you could make a calculation of how high it was:  Our property is 150 feet long, so looking up from underneath the UFO, it was covering at least 75 feet of the property and the probably 35 feet of the 45 foot width of the property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to come directly from the mountain south of us which is a good 400 feet or more above us and 10 miles away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved south to north and its acceleration was not uniform as it was stationary over the mountain and then was upon us in 4 seconds (so 10 miles in 4 seconds), it slowed when directly over us, it didn’t hover but it slowed enough for us to get a good look and be able to agree on a uniform description.  It accelerated again, however it was slower than a jet but much faster than a small plane or copter.  I have emailed a crude drawing but it is accurate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot emphasis enough how large the center light was in proportion to the vehicle and how white and brilliant the light was, it was amazing.  If we had stared at the light itself for any time we would have been blinded by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 18:35pm my husband witnessed another similar object move to the Northwest and he only saw it&#39;s edges which were also rimmed with lights.  This moved so fast that he could not yell for me to come and see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer background:  Male is a 54 yr old CAO of a company, and Female is a 50 yr old public safety instructor for law enforcement and social services.<n>

We had just parked the car and got out to do some Christmas shopping when my girlfriend tugged on my arm and said, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw a very strange looking craft.  It was vaguely T-shaped, like a capital letter T laying on its side.  On the horizontal part were four equally-spaced, brilliant red lights, and on the vertical part were four equally spaced blue lights.  The object seemed to be as large as a jet airliner at about 1000 ft altitude above ground, and then proceeded to fly to the west.  It followed a curving path towards the north as it flew (very quickly) away, and was out of sight in 30 seconds.  It made absolutely NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another lady who was getting out of her car was only feet away and saw what we were looking at.  She asked, &#34;What is that thing?&#34;  I have worked in aviation as an aircraft fueler, and I know that any lights that are not FAA approved are probably not going to appear on an aircraft.  I have never, ever seen brilliant blue lights on a general aviation aircraft.  I told the lady, &#34;What you are looking at is a UFO - holy crap holy crap holy crap!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish we had time to get our phones out to take pictures, but my phone sucks and can&#39;t even photograph the moon decently.  :-(<n>

My eyes went back to the right of my vision (North).  Literally out of nowhere, a ball of light appeared in the distance.  (Almost like I watched it form into creation) than it started moving fast to the left.  Split into four individual smaller lights.  Not much brighter than the stars that make up Orion&#39;s belt.  Appeared to be traveling in unison, at an angle than seemed to do a banking maneuver to the objects right.  My direct front.  Which is West over upstate NY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights faded out.  If this was a single object it was massive.  After the lights split into four and they stopped expanding there was about an inch gap in between each light and Lake Champlain is about 900 yards from my position.  If it was over the middle of the lake, it would be easily three C-37s wingtip to wingtip in width when it banked away over NY.  The object didn&#39;t have a form to it though.

11/24/13 22:00|Bend|OR|Light|7-10 minutes|Eight bright red lights in the sky.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104958.html|186|ndxe201311| On 11/24/13, at 10pm, I was walking my dog to an empty lot near my house, where my dog takes his breaks.  It was a very clear night, and I was looking at the stars as I walked.  My attention went to my dog for a minute or two when we reached the empty lot, and then I glanced back up at the sky.  Upon looking up at the sky, I was somewhat taken back by the amount of bright lights in the sky.  It took me a minute to try to interpret what I was looking at, because there was no easy explanation for what it could be.  There were at least eight bright red lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright red lights were at a 45º angle to the West of me.  They were well above the mountains, so I knew that it was not any structure.  Additionally, the lights were not moving in relation to each other, nor were they moving in unison.  They were very bright red lights that suddenly appeared, and were remaining motionless in the sky.  There may have been more than eight, but when I got over the surprise of seeing them and began to count, there were eight.  Right after I counted the lights, one of the two top most lights, dimmed slightly, then came back to its original brightness, and then went out.  For a moment, there seemed to be a very dim white light where the red light had been… then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to my house, about a half block away, and looked for my binoculars.  By the time I found them and ran out to the back of my house, there were only five lights left in the sky.  In looking at them through the binoculars, I could still only see the lights, rather than what they were attached to.  My girlfriend quickly put on warm clothing to go outside, and by the time she got out there, she was able to see two of the lights that were left.  I then decided to try to video record the lights, and ran back into my house for the camera.  By the time I got back with the camera, all of the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes, I called the non-emergency police number asking if anyone else had seen, and reported, the lights.  While still on the phone with the dispatcher, a police officer called me asking what I had seen.  The officer told me that a woman across town had also seen the lights, and had also gotten pictures and video of them.  He said that what the other witness had seen, were five “copper colored” lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After talking with the police, my girlfriend and I went back out to the vacant lot to see if there were any more lights in the sky.  There were no more unusual lights, but there were several jets in the sky going back and forth in the area that the bright red lights had been in.  I spoke to another police officer the next morning, and he told me that he had seen two military jets flying together in that area of the sky that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the approximate positions of the bright red lights, in relation to themselves, that I saw: *   *   *    * *   *    *    *<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all seemed to be paired up, with a uniform distance between them, with the exception that one of the four in the middle group was a little farther away from its “wing man”.  The lights began disappearing from the top down, and within a few minutes of the last bright red light disappearing, there were jets in the sky going back and forth.  From the time I first saw the lights, to when the last one disappeared, was about seven to ten minutes.  I am presently attempting to contact the other witness in order to triangulate, to determine the distance and location of the lights.  It appeared that they were over a wilderness area, which I would like to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded.

An oval passed from above the car out to the horizon in about 2 seconds. I say oval, but I could tell it was actually the shape of a frisbee, but from my angle, it appeared to be an oval.  We were about a half an hour north of O&#39;Hare airport, but it was moving way to fast to be a plane.  And it was too big and had a solid white light that didn&#39;t blink or flare or leave a trail, so it couldn&#39;t have been a comet. It seemed to be about airplane height, I want to say 20,000 feet. But by the time it reached the horizon, it could have been anything higher than that.  If a plane travels 500-600 mph, I would say it was 4 to 6 times faster then that.  The best way to describe it was if I were laying on my back and a professional whipped a frisbee over my head.  Only difference is the object was clearly glowing and was very high in the air and huge. It was about the size of a skittle, maybe a little bigger from my perspective.  As I wrote, it happened very fast, but as soon as it happened, my passenger and I looked at each other and at the same time said, &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;.   I consider myself a fairly intelligent person and I cannot figure what it could have been, neither can my friend.  Thank you.<n>

I took a shot of it with my cell phone.  it was stationary so it was easy to shoot.  I thought it may just be a star but it was too bright and too low.  When I zoomed in on the picture I took it was triangular in shape!<n> <n><n> <n><n> He says that it has been appearing for the last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night on my way home from work around 7pm, I noticed it again.  It was very bright and very still almost like a giant flood light in the sky.  After awhile it started to move and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know that its not a star {I originally thought it was the planet Venus because of where it was in the sky}.<n>

In the parking lot i asked the people pushing the shopping carts what they thought it was, they said wow thats weird probably a secret drone or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then we left i arrived at home in N. Prov we noticed the object had moved to the northwest quite a distance as i staring at the object, another object shaped like a triangle with rouned edges kinda flew overhead dead silent and the entire bottom was illumating like trace lights red and greenish and even a purple shade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> that was it and i was wondering if anyone else saw it or if im nutts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<n>

The light is brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest and bigger in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light object begins to dim then three other lights to the left of it appeared.  They were small and dim.  A total of four lights all together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From left to right the colors are a dim white, a dim red, a dim orange and a dim white(the brightest light) that.  A few seconds later the farthest light became bright again as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other lights were not noticeable when the bright light would be at its brightest.  Then it would dim and then get bright again for about three more times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at around 18:31 the far right brightest light dimmed down and was in sync with the other lights.  All the lights begun to flash two to three times then all lights went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness waited five minutes and the lights did not reappear.  The witness goes back inside the witnesses work.  Five minutes later the witness goes outside again to check if the lights were anywhere but could not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The city the where the witness viewed the light object from is Monrovia, CA.  The area where the Light Objects or Light Spheres was seen is in the San Gabriel Mountains in the area four to eight miles north of Azusa, CA.  The heading from Monrovia would be North-North East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the witness point of view, the object was well above the top of the mountains.  The time frame when the Light Objects seen is 18:28 to 18:31.  The Light Objects or Light Spheres were in a straight line from the left to the right (NNW to SSE) as seen from the witness point of view.  There were a total of four lights seen including the brightest light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Brightest light color was a bluish to white light in the color temperature of 5500 to 6500 Kelvin.  The diameter of the bright Light Object was about 40-50% bigger than the planet Venus on the same night seen from the ground to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Light Objects or Light Spheres seem to have never moved from its position.  The witness stepped outside from the b! uilding the witness was in and the Light Objects or Light Spheres were already in position and did not seem to move only disappear after the event happened.  No noise was heard possibly due because of the distance from object and witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness was alone at the time of the event.  Pictures were taken but due to lighting conditions and the technology there are inconclusive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion is that the Light Objects or Light Spheres are unidentified.  The lights seemed to be together as one craft but the lights could be separate from each other.  There could be a possibility that the Light Objects or Light Spheres could be a helicopter but the way it behaved brings a doubt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note the witness is very knowledgeable in commercial and military aircraft.<n>

While Traveling south on Grade Road towards downtown Lake Stevens, I observed 3 distinct orange orb like structures, ascending towards the North-North East.  These 3 objects were oval and large in size and each changed into larger cigar shape at the base, relative to the landscape horizon and was moving in a deliberate synchronous fashion in a slanted vertical organized formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle orb stopped in midflight, flashed red and white in a rotating pattern at the base of the orb for 10 seconds then vanished,  The pattern of light emitting from the orb as it stopped looked as if it was a double triangular array, one on top of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first orb followed and also vanished.  The last orb in the vertical line of ascension rapidly continued to ascend until out of site of the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was witnessed under clear skies, and lasted approximately 30 seconds total in duration.<n>

It had 2 lines going across it, making the sphere appear to be divided into 3 sections.  Object was silent, no noticeable sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other info:  At the time of this sighting,the temp was around the mid 20&#39;s and there was no real wind to speak of.  The sun was already setting below the western horizon, but it was not dark yet and the sky was still blue.  The location i was at when i saw the object is approx. 5 miles ESE of Detroit Metro Airport and i did notice about 3 or 4 airplanes in the sky, but they were flying at such high altitudes that you could not even see the planes themselves and only knew they were up there by the contrails they were emitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i first saw the object in the sky i looked at it for 15 to 20 seconds then turned away and decided to grab my video camera out of the camera bag next to me.  This video camera powers up as soon as you flip the screen open, so in the 5 to 8 seconds it took me to grab it, open the lens cover and flip the screen open...i turned back toward the object and it was GONE!<n>

I was riding as a passenger, in the back seat, on the drivers side, I was looking across the freshly cut cotton fields for deer when I noticed a very large, silver/chrome colored orb hovering above the field.  I had been watching the sky this morning due to the many con-trails being left by the high flying aircraft in the area.  This was very different than the many aircraft I had seen, it was much larger, and closer than the high flying aircraft that were in the area.  It had no wings or lights that I could tell.  It was a very shiny, chrome-like orb, and much larger than any other object in the otherwise clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my brother that was in the front passengers seat.  He also saw the object and could not figure out what it was either.

A friend and I had walked up a hill admiring the stars and at the top we paused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both noticed a gliding curve with a chevron shape at the center.  The flying object was small but wide and looked as if it was a mere line. (at first I suspected it was a flock of birds in V formation).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it float above it made absolutely no noise and appeared to be very low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For 10 seconds or so my friend and I watched and discussed the possibilities of either birds flying south or a plane of some sort.  It couldn&#39;t have been birds because they weren&#39;t in a V formation and never once broke synchronization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also don&#39;t believe it was a plane because a anything flying that low and that slow would have to produce some sound.<n>

The backyard faces south.  I looked up in the sky at about 45 degrees towards the southeast and saw 12 orangish flickering lights moving through the sky towards the south.  At first I thought it looked like Santa’s sleigh and reindeers light up.  As the lights curved and moved upwards  towards the south I noticed that they disappeared one by one as they were directly over our garage which is south of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and yelled for everyone to hurry up and get outside and look at the sky.  My husband, Sam Powell, and my neighbor who was over visiting, Zebbie Wassom, came outside.  I counted 10 lights in the sky.  We all watched for a few minutes.  There was no noise.  I saw new lights emerge from the distant southeast at about 30 degrees in the sky.  They appeared more of a flaming red color.  The lights followed an arcing pattern through the sky. (Appearing in the southeast, moving northwest, moving west, moving southwest, then moving south and disappearing.  All this activity occurred in the southern part of the sky.) Some lights were further apart from each other.  Some lights were higher than others but not by more than about 5 degrees.  Some lights appeared to change speed slightly.  Some lights appeared to change direction slightly.  As the lights got closer they all appeared more of an orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all went back inside.  My husband got out the phone book.  Zebbie and I grabbed our cell phones and went back outside. It was 7:20 pm according to my cell phone as Zebbie called her husband who was at home across the street and told him to look out the window towards the south in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Zebbie went back inside shortly thereafter.  I continued watching until the last light was gone at 7:24 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, I counted about 15 lights in the sky at one time and about 24 lights total.   The lights were high up in the sky – not to be confused with airplanes coming in for approach to Spokane International Airport or Fairchild Air Force Base.  The lights appeared larger when they emerged from the distant southeast sky. When they were closer they were about the size of a regular star in the sky except they were bright and flickered.  The lights did not come down from the sky instead the moved across: in, around, and then out. The lights did not have a tail on them like a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t bother to try and record this event on my cell phone because I thought the clarity would be bad and besides it would be on the news with an explanation of what had happened. The rest of the evening and for a few days I watched  local TV news stations to see if anyone else saw it, but nothing was reported that day or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in her description of the object she and her husband witnessed.  Very high-quality witnesses, we believe, and high-quality reports.  PD))<n>

The sky was clear. While there we were looking around into the sky and the neighborhood.  Then my wife ((name deleted)), happened to look toward the southeast and notice all these lights popping out.  There had to be about a dozen or so when she said look at all those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be a bright fiery read in color and changing to an almost orange color.  I would guest they were not as far away as the stars.  We got as quiet as possible to notice if there was any sounds.  We noticed none. Then, the further they went to the northwest they would stop and move back and forth toward one another, like they were playing, then stopping and going.  They seem to be in some random formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the first several would disappear to the south of where I reside, then more would appear from the southeast. This display lasted from about 7:15 pm until about 7:25 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called three media stations, KREM-2; KXLY-4 and KHQ-6 and none of them seem to be interested in my conversation, at all.<n>

Why were we able to view it for so long sitting in one place, but then it vanishes in 10 seconds from the time that it started to shrink.  We both have very good eye sight.  I thought I&#39;d look up what it was and I found this page.  I spend a lot of time out in the country at night gazing at the stars while out hunting coyotes.  I can tell the difference between a jet, helicopter, ect.

As we were enjoying the sunset , we noticed a small in coming plane.  We live close to the Santa Paula airport.  Two bright lights appeared.  They seemed to be much farther distance from the plane.  I would describe them as much brighter than a star.  The light at the top moved north at a high rate of speed then vanished in the blue sky. The light at the bottom right of the photo just appeared, then vanished.  It was stagnant. Through my girlfriends photos we determined the lights were visible for approximately 60 seconds<n>

The thing I find puzzling about this object, is that there is so many lights in where I observe this object that it&#39;s the only visible thing in the sky besides the moon.  Also I have no equipment to get a good picture of it, yet the one time I use the google star map app and pointed the smart device I was using directly at it, the device said that there should be nothing there.  Only one time have I noticed something &#34;leaving&#34; and seem to disappear rather quickly after detaching from the object.  Also, for the most part it keeps in orbit with the moon, but sometimes it seems to just roam all over the sky.<n>

I live in Rome Georgia (45 mins North of Atlanta).  My home is located on top of Mt. Alto. A small (3000ft approx) mountain.  Two lane road with houses on both sides of the road.  Very nice views north or south.  As I was getting out of my truck I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star - but it looked &#34;too close&#34; to truly be a star.  Plus it was blinking like planets blink.  Sort of changing colors white-red-yellow but only slightly.  The changes were not extremely noticeable.  It was just twinkling - but again it looked too close and too bright to be a star.  It was about approx 35 degrees or so up in the sky.  Orion was up as well as the north star. The object was below Orions foot and to the left of the North Star.  It was an extremely cold and clear night.  No clouds whatsoever.  I decided to go get a pair of my binoculars - but could only find a! pair of my kids - which are basically just toys.  It actually made my view worse.  I decided to see what my phone would do.  I put it on video (Droid Razr Maxx) - Immediately I saw a distinct shape and set of lights in a row.  Looked like the classic saucer shape lights in a line.  I videod it like this for about 20 seconds or so and then zoomed in.  Once I zoomed in - it was incredible.  The object is HUGE.  Dozens of lights blinking - some random and some in a definite pattern.  The object then appeared to be cigar shaped with what appears to be a tall tail or fin on the far right side.  Lights would appear all along the object in different colors - red,green,white,yellow and in many different places along the object (in a line in front - and randomly through the center and then again in a line on the tail/fin).  It appears to be just MASSIVE.  I can only slightly make out the shape - but the lights are very obvious.  It sat in the sky for at least 4 or 5 hours. The obje! ct never moved in a traditional sense.  Once while videoing it! with my camera it shifted up in the sky about an inch or more INSTANTLY.  Also it moved four or five inches to the right in the sky one time and then back left - both times the movement was so fast it was almost like it just &#34;appeared&#34; in the new spot. I did not catch the right left movement on camera as I was changing the batteries. I videoed it for about 20+ mins on my regular video camera as well as my phone.  My wife came outside and watched it with me.  But it was late - after 11pm by this time and extremely cold.  I also noticed an unusual amount of static electricity in my house later that evening - that I have never noticed before and have not experienced since.  I have looked each night since the sighting but have not seen it appear again.  The object would easily be confused as a star to the naked eye.  I have a large amount of video of this object and as of the typing of this report I have turned the video in to MUFON and this organization for further investiga! tion!<n>

We turned onto O’Brien St and I was instantly drawn to two lights in front of me in the distance.  At first I thought they were car lights but soon realized they were up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that came to mind was a plane with its landing gear down and lights on. There just seemed to be something odd about them though.  There was no red and they weren’t blinking at all.  Just two bright white, almost blue lights.  As big as the lights were, if it were a plane I think I would have seen it moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I’m thinking a brand new cell tower.  As I got to where they were almost to my side up in the sky, I slowed the vehicle way down almost to a stop and looked for the tower itself.  Realizing it was way too dark to see a tower at night, I focused back up on the lights again. Now there were three lights, all the same, in a triangular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now at a complete stop in the middle of the road intrigued by these lights.  I decide to pull up off the road and am trying to do so without taking my eyes of the lights but have to look away to pull over.  When I look back there are now four lights in a nonsymmetrical diamond pattern.  Kind of like one end was stretched way out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am at a complete stop with my window down.  The lights are at a stand still too when all of a sudden they move a long distance in a second and stop again and then start slowly moving.  Now I know this is not a plane and I am thinking it’s not a helicopter.  I think if a helicopter were to move  like that the lights would have had to tilt.  They didn’t.  They always stayed in the same plain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife’s phone call wondering if everything was OK broke my gaze on the lights.  When I looked up for them again I couldn’t find them.  They were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This light rose in the air about 200 yards in front of me and a friend while we were parked in my car facing NORTHWEST.  This was around 5:40 EST.  In a populated area with intersections, restaurants and bargain centers.  The sun had gone down but it wasn’t totally dark yet.  The object seemed to have structure but the light was all that could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it first caught our attention it was rising from at least 50ft from the ground.  As it rose slowly it seemed to come closer to us but mainly going straight up.  It elevated around 500-600 ft then it stops suddenly and at that point we both were puzzled because this wasn’t normal flight maneuvers for anything I’ve seen in the sky and this was so close.  There were no sounds coming from it.  Now that it’s closer it appeared to me there were actually two red lights instead of one but both were bright and bled into each other.  They were side by side but seemed to both be on one object.  I couldn’t make it out clearly, but it looked like above the lights there was structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at that point seemed to slowly spin 180 degrees now showing white lights.  Then it moved to the left and right at different speeds stopping on a dime.  Very controlled and deliberate, as if showing off.  Not very fast, but too fast to start and stop, changing directions as it did.  Then, it shown red again and went away from us, we both got out of the car to get a better view and it lowered behind some trees maybe a quarter of a mile away.  I could see the red light looked to have landed in a clearing and out of view.  I kept looking and 45 seconds later it appeared again rising from the area it had lowered to.  It came back to the same area it was before in front of us.  It performed similar maneuvers again and moved very fast, up and down left and right.  Then it went away behind the trees again once more. I never saw it after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size is hard to estimate, maybe the size of a compact car.  The shape seemed saucer like but was not flat.  It moved in ways I’ve never seen before, very stable and strict.  It seemed to be controlled by intelligence.<n>

I used my binoculars and I saw what looked like an orb with fire in the center heading due south....and just as that one disappeared in the distance another appeared following the exact same path, and looked exactly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, and for the life of me can&#39;t think of anything that can fly man made that I can compare them to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Our first thought was that it was a shiny red balloon but it rose straight up quickly maybe 500 ft in the air and just stopped suddenly and hung there.  Just a solid red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved to the left a ways, then to the right.  It moved unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before.  Changing speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot guess how big it was.  It wasn&#39;t very big, maybe the size of a car.  The light also changed to white, as if it had turned around and I was looking at a different side to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out the car to get a better look.  It went away from me and lowered seemingly to the ground about a quarter of a mile from where it was before, and it got there quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the light go behind some trees in the distance.  I kept watching for it to rise again and it did.  It came back near the same area as before flying low and moving very deliberately and strict.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise and the area of the sighting is very busy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are busy intersections and many shops and strip malls.  I&#39;m sure others had to have seen it.<n>

After another minute they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to catch video of the three together but by accident only took a still shot and two of them are very clear in the picture.

My adult relative was concerned and distressed about a strange noise she heard on the night of Thursday, November 21, 201,3 at 11:35 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was in bed sleeping soundly when she unexpectedly awoke to a loud sound that was right outside her window.  It perplexed her and she seemed a little disturbed by the event.  She said the noise was like that of machine, or a metallic noise, that was very loud, close to her window.  She said the noise took on a certain high and low pitch and it started humming for a duration of 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if she got up or too look outside and said she did not.  I gathered from her statement that she might have been too scared to do so, so no craft or lights were witnessed if there were any.  We live in a small quiet neighborhood where six houses share a beautiful courtyard that is about 100 feet long by 30 feet wide.  The front of our house and bedroom windows face the courtyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My relative said the humming noise pulsated loud and said it sounded like it might have been hovering in the courtyard near our bedroom windows because she felt the pulsating vibrations through her window.  We live south of Paine Field and are used to (and recognize) all the airport and flight noise and activities, but she said it was nothing of the sort and this humming sound was unusual and too close.  She asked if I heard it and told her that I had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to bed at 10:30 p.m. that night and woke up around midnight, but did not hear anything.  My relative said that after 5 minutes of the noise, the sound abruptly stopped and everything was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did confess to her that as of the last few years, especially during the summer months, when I have my window open, that I have awoken to strange computer-like &#34;beeping noises&#34; in the early pre-dawn hours that I could never understand what or where they come from.  Perhaps, these incidents are related, but not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My relative is confident that something was causing or giving off this sound and that it may have been from an unidentified craft hovering in the courtyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, we both have been monitoring all nighttime activity for any strange incidents. We would like to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I always stop and take a good 360 degree look at the stars when we get beautiful clear nights like tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my northwest maybe two miles away I noticed 2 flashing red lights that where approximately a quarter mile or so apart from each other.  I also noticed that they were blinking in unison.  This would not have been anything strange, except for the fact that they were slowly moving away from me at a very low altitude (maybe 1500-2000 feet), and that they moved in perfect unison together which lead me to believe these two blinking red lights were connected to ONE craft!  It was very slowly traveling away from me.  Slower than conventional aircraft fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging by the distance between the two red lights, this thing must have been massive!!  I also get the feeling it maybe have been triangle shaped and I was seeing the rear part of the craft.  But there was no visible propulsion systems and no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled in a northwest course towards the Puget Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in aerospace building modern day commercial planes.  I have never seen anything that large, that flies like what I saw tonight.

11/21/13 19:45|Philadelphia|PA|Triangle|~5 minutes|Orange Objects Ascending Over Philadelphia|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107618.html|267|ndxe201311| Orange Objects Ascending Over Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening in question I was traveling northbound on 95 approaching the Aramingo avenue exit.  I saw to my right several slowly rising objects from the northeast in my peripheral vision.  I then focused my attention to the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted approximately 12-15 of them.  The objects appeared to be triangular in shape with a solid orange color.  There were no visible navigation, beacon, or strobe lights, which are required on all civilian aircraft, and usually on military aircraft as well.  I did not hear any sound from the objects, although I was traveling at highway speed and only briefly put the window down.  The objects slowly gained altitude.  I would estimate from approximately 150 ft AGL up to 12-1300ft AGL at which point I lost visual reference due to traveling in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to originate from an approximate heading of 040º magnetic on an outbound of approximately 235º toward the downtown area.  It appeared as if they remained in a tight formation of 2-3 craft in front, at a slightly higher altitude, 4 in a roughly arrow formation, and the remainder flew in sequence.  The overall formation reminded me of the uneven arrow which geese fly in when heading south for winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My passenger also witnessed the event and she continued to maintain visual reference while I returned my attention to driving.  I could see the objects in the rearview mirror for approximately 2 more miles until I exited the motorway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky conditions on the evening in question were approximately 8 miles visibility, no cloud bases, and a light (&amp;lt;5knots) wind.  There was no snow on the ground at the time, there was no snow falling at the time, nor were there reports of snowfall in the area.  I reviewed temporary flight restrictions, which would notify airmen of any launches or abnormal flight operations, and found none for the evening in question or the surrounding week.  My background is in aviation, and this is unlike anything I have seen in my career.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lack of sound and slow speed makes me of the opinion that it was not a formation of fixed wing aircraft.  The lack of sound, abnormal lighting, and elevation also makes me skeptical that it could be a helicopter fleet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have made this report several months after the fact only because I did not get around to it and also because I have recently seen several videos online, from Philadelphia, which show almost exactly what I saw.  Having seen those, my opinion is even more so that what I saw was indeed abnormal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/21/13 11:00|Honolulu|HI|Sphere|5 minutes|Orbs dropping larger orbs into the ocean.|12/5/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105067.html|272|ndxe201311| Orbs dropping larger orbs into the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday, November 21st, 2013 Sandy Beach, Oahu, Hawaii<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime between 11am and noon local time, my son and I were walking along Sandy Beach watching the bodysurfers when my son yelled, “Whoa, did you see that?”  I did not see anything while we were on the beach but my son, who is 13, was quite impressed with what he witnessed.  Below is his story in his own words:<n> <n><n> <n><n> “We were watching the bodysurfers surfing the waves.  I was standing near this big rock right by the ocean, looking out over the horizon when I saw an orb that was bright white, almost like a florescent light bulb but sphere shaped.  The orb was about as big as a grapefruit.  It had come from thin air, going very fast but slowed to a halted hover in a very small space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it slowed, it dropped an orb that looked the same as the other one but just bigger, like a soccer ball.  The bigger orb dropped in the water and made a small splash.  The small orb hovering in the air flew off and disappeared in a flash, literally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down at the water where the orb had fallen but there was nothing there even though I saw a little splash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked in the sky again to see if there were more orbs.  I scanned the horizon and saw more of these occurrences but they were further away.  The first sighting was very fast, probably two and a half to three seconds long.  The other sightings lasted longer because the orbs traveled further than my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after the last orb (the fifth or sixth one) dropped its load of a larger orb, the orbs all vanished. “<n>

I&#39;m not sure, but each light may have been a separate craft since the lights may have been moving slightly in relation to each other (as if they were not lights affixed to a single object).  But, I&#39;m not sure of this since they were hard to focus on, and my view of them was quickly obstructed by trees/houses as they flew behind them. If they were separate objects, they were definitely flying in a strict V shaped formation, like ducks/geese.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All aircraft I&#39;ve seen at night around here have at least one red light and a strobe light, never more than 3-4 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They came into the sky quickly and brightly.  They lined up in a row or formation and we saw 6 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately found a place to pull over to watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband turned on his video recorder on his phone and we both got out of the car to watch them.  There was another vehicle parked by us and the gentleman in it got out to observe them too.  They went from orange to a bright whitish color and then went dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden they started flashing different bright lights (red, yellow,white) and more appeared.  Then they took off in different di! rections rapidly.  As they were leaving they would flash brightly every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 of us were mesmerized by how they were flying off so fast and we could see their flash way off in the distance.  My husband did get them recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got home and uploaded it to the computer, we realized there were actually 10 of them.  We uploaded the video on youtube.com.  Please note in the video, we didn&#39;t capture the orange bright color.  We captured them after they went to the whitish color and flashing.<n>

Two on the bottom, one on top equidistant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later I saw intermittent white flashes that were quite far away.  There were a minimum of two dozen that were concentrated in the SE, covering an area about the width of my hand held out across the horizon.  They were low, about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon.  Then a single red light, the same as the first three reappeared in the same area of the sky as before between my location a the flashing lights.  It stayed for about 10 seconds then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept seeing the flashing lights spreading outward and upward along the horizon.  They would fade out, then reappear.  I could not count the number, there were many flickering in varios places in a larger and larger area, maybe 3 handwidths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They became less frequent and faded out.  At first I thought the were UFOs, then I realized that they were probably scrambled fighter jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 17:30, my dog barked.  There was a very low rumble for about 5 seconds.    I could count 5 jets, with the same kind of white flashing lights, traveling from east  to west in different locations to the south of me.  They were close enought to see that they were aircraft.  5 jets in the sky at the same time is unusual here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the correct date of the sighting was November 20th, not October 20th.

I had just come to the top of the big hill and was passing the Berlin exit on my right when I looked to my left and out over the city of Berlin I was what looked like up to 7 large (maybe the size of a pea if you were to hold one out in your hands at arms length) bright orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a few seconds as the light stayed stationary in an odd slightly uniform geometric shape, maybe something that would resemble the corners of say an octagon or possibly a six sided star then a few of the lights&#34; faded out,&#34; except three that stayed in a large triangular shape for maybe another second or two then they faded out as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the formation was maybe the size of ones fist, i.e. if you held out your fist, it would roughly cover the array of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reached for my phone to turn on the camera and try to get a picture, but they were gone by then.  The sighting lasted possibly 5-7 seconds roughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The skies were perfectly clear and bright with no clouds and no limit to ones visual range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that the direction I was looking in was South possibly South West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving, I tried to rationalize what it was, and the best I could come up with was that maybe it was a meteor burning up or something in space.  However, at approximately 5:05 pm EST, I arrived at the Williamstown exit and exited right off of I-89 south and turned left towards Williamstown, VT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked when I looked up and the lights were back in the same direction as before (roughly the same spot in the sky ).  This time the lights were in a sort of crescent moon line, not a straight line with the arc opening upwards towards the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly turned into a driveway and hoped out with my camera, however when my camera came on the lights faded out again.  This time there was 4 lights and they faded out at once, as far as I could tell, and there was a small light blinking, at roughly where they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then arrived home at roughly 5:20, and it was dark at this time.  I stayed outside looking for as long as I could, and noticed that there were two jets very high in the sky that were making huge circles in the sky overhead.  I could literally watch them make a he circle which took up about as much or the sky as I could see from my home.  They remained in the sky for as long as I stayed outside.<n>

So I walked to the side of the house and from the corner of my eye I started seeing something what appeared to come out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I was looking in the direction of what would be the side of it.  At first it looked like a radio tower up in the air and horizontal.  I could not see the object until it was just going past me which revealed the rear of it.  As the object was passing by the “rear” was coming into view and what looked like little red lights at first turned out to be large rectangular red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess with the dimensions is it was 200-300 feet wide x 20-30 feet tall but could not tell how deep it was.  It wasn’t until it stated passing me when I could really see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 rectangular lights a least 20 feet high by 50 feet wide. It looked like there may have been other lights that were not on or were dimmed but the 4 bright red lights were in the middle.  The red did not look like fire or rocket blast but like GIANT screens showing just red in perfect rectangles.  Not fire engine red but I guess fire red without the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole experience lasted about 5 minutes.  No mention of it on the news and I cannot find similar events online.<n>

Solid light and flashing it would would/is moving around the sky.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104644.html|309|ndxe201311| Bright light seen all day into the night.  Solid light and flashing it would would/is moving around the sky.  It is visible all across MA<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light has been here for quite some time.  It would normally be visible every other week and be intermittently in the sky until it disappeared.  Not moved away but the light would eventually dim out and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of this week it has been visible every single day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sight of it yesterday would have to I guess be around 01:00 am.  I went to sleep and woke up the next day only to see it has I was picking my son up from the bus as he got home.  I was taking pictures of chemtrails and when I went inside to look at the pics I could see the &#34;Orb&#34; or &#34;light source.&#34;  It stayed visible for the rest of the night.  It was visible from here all the way to Hyannis, Ma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not stationary.  It would move across the sky to the east then back west. It would move lower and then higher as well.  There was WAY too much movement for it to be anything that was part of our Solar System.  Around 7:00 pm it began to flash &amp; move. Intermittent flashes as it would dim out and then get brighter while it was doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past Month I have been cross referencing its location with star maps and every app I could download with augmented reality. Nothing is there. NOTHING.  Nothing to help me brush it off and say, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s just that there, nothing to worry about,&#34; but there is nothing there on the maps.  There are satellites in the vicinity at times but never in the exact location of the light source and they move on while the light source remains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid sky watcher.  I have never seen something be so prevalent and consistent while garnering Zero attention.  It does not stay in one place nor move like anything man made like a satellite or plane.  It flashes very bright and then dims very low, all the while moving around the sky disappearing and reappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen it during the day before though so whatever this is seems to be intensifying.  It is not Venus.  It is not ISON.  It is not ISS....<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were well over 100 people on Facebook talking about it.  It was out the other night and many people became scared during a downtown event in the city.  This is not normal.<n>

11/20/13 04:00|Brookhaven|MS|Light|1 hour|My employee and his wife witnessed two lights in the sky that lingered for most of an hour before disappearing.|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104611.html|312|ndxe201311| My employee and his wife witnessed two lights in the sky that lingered for most of an hour before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was witnessed by one of my employees and his wife while my employee was working the graveyard shift last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0400 US central time, my employee walked outside of the plant for a security check.  He observed due east of our location a pulsating light in the sky that at first appeared to be a star or planet.  From his perspective it was about the same size as a bright star or planet like Venus, but again, the light was pulsating from relatively dim to bright, back to dim then back to bright, etc.  The apparent altitude was about two fingers&#39; width above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After he had been watching it for about 20 minutes off and on (he was in and out of the plant checking operations) his wife arrived to bring him some food while on her way to work.  This was at about 0430.  They were both watching it when she spotted a second almost identical pulsating light that he hadn&#39;t previously seen move from the north side of the original object to its south side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the second object moved to the south side of the first object, the first object started to move higher into the sky, as though gaining altitude without moving in any other direction, forward, backward, or sideways.  He started thinking that the lights may have been helicopters, but he had the further impression that if they had been helos they were close enough that he could&#39;ve heard their engine or rotor noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first object increased its altitude about two to three times what it had been previously, it became stationary.  The one that had moved south of it was stationary the whole time the first object was moving.  After the first object once again became stationary for a few minutes, the second object to the south slowly descended until it was no longer visible above the horizon.  It was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes after the second object disappeared below the horizon, the first object started moving slowly to the south, gradually gaining speed until reaching an apparent speed comparable to what is observed of a jet aircraft at high altitude.  Within 30-45 seconds the object was no longer visible, having passed the southern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of observance was about 45 minutes to one hour.  During the entire time there was no discernible sound coming from either object.  Background noise from the plant was minimal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have recommended that the witnesses look again, and determine whether the objects they witnessed might have been &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, possibly the star, Sirius.

11/19/13 22:00|Livingston|TX|Other|30 minutes|We saw 3 objects in the sky.|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104599.html|313|ndxe201311| We saw 3 objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multi colored lights appeared over my pasture toward Livingston State Park. The first one was over the trees with 5 lights vertically aligned.  The lights were red and yellow.  While watching this object a second, smaller version appeared behind the first one.  I noticed another small object beginning to descend over my pasture, within 30 yards of my home.  I approached and tried to take a picture but it would not appear in the view finder.  The lights would not show.  I could hear a sound like a child&#39;s toy helicopter.  There was no actual helicopter chopping air sound just a steady whirring.  The object descended very slowly but I couldn&#39;t make out the object due to the darkness.  It appeared in the dark to resemble the shape of a dragonfly. It was so close that I became fearful trying to take a picture.  The object then lifted straight up and disappeared into the darkness after going south from my home.  I then turned my attention back to the large object! which had descended partially behind the tree line.  My boyfriend said he thought it was a cell tower, however; I explained that we would have noticed it by now since we are outside every evening. As we were discussing what it could be it disappeared with us looking directly at it.  The other smaller object then proceeded to float from south to north and back again before also disappearing.  This entire event lasted approximately 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I realized no blinking lights, just a bright, solid orange color.  It was moving steadily, but then a small blue light broke off and burned out.  Then the orange &#34;fireball&#34; appeared to slow down to an almost stop.  It moved in a slightly different direction, then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She came in and asked me to come outside to see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside barefoot into the cold and looked up to see 9 lights in the sky.  We were looking to the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were an orangish red color and circular.  There were no light tails, just the colored balls.  8 of them were grouped together, 4 on top and 4 on bottom flying south (left).  They were not in perfect formation.  The 9th craft was flying the opposite direction to the north (right).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute after observing 4 of the crafts flying south faded out quickly like they had started flying further west out of sight or just disappeared.  Similarly the one flying north had disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The remaining 4 flew slower still south a few more minutes.  The one going north that had gone away reappeared and changed course to go south.  The 4 others faded out like the first 4 had withing 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then tracked the one remaining that had re-appeared and turned south for 2 minutes.  It got brighter for a about 20 seconds like it might be getting closer then it did the same as the others.  It took about 10 seconds and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the skies for another 5 minutes and did not see another light.  I dont know how anyone outside in west chester at that time could miss it.  I would love to know if anyone else saw this or what it could be.  This experience was amazing to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a video with my wife&#39;s phone but it was pretty blurry.  I could provide it if wanted by this site&#39;s directors/investigators.<n>

11/19/13 20:00|Kansas City|MO|Fireball|30 minutes|Red flashing orb/fireball seen near Front St. in Kansas City, Missouri.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104699.html|318|ndxe201311| Red flashing orb/fireball seen near Front St. in Kansas City, Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving South on 435 from Liberty to Front Street exit to meet my ex and pick up my girls and noticed a red flashing light.  At first I thought it might just be a very bright light on a radio tower but as I got closer I could see it was not attached to anything and was 3 or 4 times higher than the towers around it.  I parked the car and watched to see if it was moving. It was moving very slowly straight across the sky and then would stop and move the other way.  It flashed on and off just like the lights on top of the towers.  I watched it for 5 minutes and then decided to get closer underneath it, so I drove to the train yard it was up above. It stopped flashing and was just a dim orangish, red color, and I could barely see it against all the street lights when I got close to it a couple minutes later.  I drove back to the spot I parked at and couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  A white light had appeared in that direction and looked like a plane coming in for a landing just to the north of Front St. and right off the highway.  I&#39;m not too familiar with the location but I know there is not an airport.  It is very industrial and has lots of trains and big warehouses around.  I don&#39;t know if it landed or not because it disappeared behind some warehouse building.  I told my ex about it on the phone but by the time he showed up it was all over.  I know others had to have seen it because the highway is right there, and I could see it coming down 35 and 435 from Liberty.  I could see it the whole 15 minutes I was driving down the busy highway.  I have seen fireballs before that were white and red and orange but none that blinked like this one and possibly landed.  There are a lot of UFOs around Kansas City and Branson area where my Grandma lives.<n>

It was a clear crystal night with no clouds in the sky.  There was a cluster of three orange spheres in a rectangular shape.  These spheres remained in a hovering position.  The spheres were very close together and maintained a hazy appearance.  On the right portion of the rectangle, there was a pulsating sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to go show our friend and not even two minutes later, coming back to the exact same spot, the lights were gone.<n>

After seeing strange, odd crafts flying during sunset I stayed and continued filming after it got dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first seen around 4 bright orange/red orbs, perfectly spherical and, not flickering or flashing like lanterns.  They were flying from north east to west.  I watched as one of them made a slow right turn away from others and all vanished soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have my cell on during the first set, the cell battery was dying and I had to use cigarette lighter to charge.  But then two more came in from same direction, flying next to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them made the same slow right turn away from me before disappearing.  The other stayed straight, then also disappeared.  Moments later I watched one fly in by itself.  Then another by itself, but this one was much closer than the others.  It came in just as fast as others, but slowed down while in flight.  There were a few more that came by, whole event lasted around 7-8minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one of the most amazing things I&#39;ve ever seen, I&#39;m glad I had my new cellphone to share this experience.  I am not happy how it came out, the video is great with amazing close-up.  But the camera while filming at night has a hard time focusing on light sources.  It looks like they are flickering or flashing but they were not.  They were steadily lit, they changed in Color slightly from red to orange to yellow.  But they were NOT flashing.  In my video I use another video to show examples of light sources at night while filming with cell, and you can see how street lights and other lights look through camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had many experiences since June of this year 2013, all of these experiences have taken place in close proximity to some very very large power lines that run across the Ohio river and through city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is just my theory, but I believe it has something to do with these power lines.  Maybe they steal or somehow harne! ss energy from lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be following up on this and have! found a PowerStation in close distance to where these orange orbs originated from.  But the weird part about this whole thing is minutes after filming these orange orbs, a large Blackhawk type helicopter was seen flying lower and faster than I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 32years old and have lived here my entire life, I have seen black helicopters before, but never this low and never this fast.  It was flying exactly straight towards where these orange orbs were seen flying from or where they possibly originated from.<n>

It was beside us on the right, twenty feet from the car.  It wove in and out of the trees at the same speed as we were traveling. (55-60MPH)  It blasted way up in the sky in front of us, (shooting left to get directly in front,) higher than the trees on the hills, then stopped and hovered for three seconds and then shot down, toward the right, behind the trees.  It was gone.  The whole thing last for thirty seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our cell phones didn&#39;t work for several minutes.  We slowed down and saw a deer on the side of the road.  She was a huge doe and seemed very disoriented.  She was looking across the road, into the woods and didn&#39;t notice our car.  The fur on the left side of her neck seemed roughed up, like it was wet and pushed up.  She was solid brown (no white) and there were no other deer around her.  We had to swerve around her and she did not move or look away from the woods.<n>

Normally when I come home and the lights from the car hit the chicken coop the chicken are out wanting to get fed, along with the cats and dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 1st thing I notice the only ones out where a couple cats. .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend got out and said what that is and pointed up.  I look up above the trees (a good estimate is 250 to 500 ft. off the top of the oaks) was a huge triangle shape object.  It was big the; tip of say the forward edge of the left side was by the pool and the leading edge of the right was over the trees in to the back yard.  I would say bigger than a C5A Galaxy even bigger that that big Russian heavy-lift plane I seen In Bosnia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could almost make out what appeared to be seams in the material but it was not shiny, duller and like carbon fiber.  The leading edge was rounded and there was no tail to say, (in today’s aircraft everything has a vertical stabilizer with a stabilizer or ailerons.  Sort of like a big T or a little t.  The anti-collision lights go on top, bottom, left and right.)  This had none of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a very big triangle, no sound what so ever came from it.  Moving at 60 knots or less I would think; me and my friend differ on this he said it took a few minutes to get over the house I think more like 5 before it was out over the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked under it trying to make out markings but it was just blending in with the sky so good the only way to tell the outline was it was blocking out the stars and what few clouds there where.  Every now and again I could almost make out what appeared to be a seam but it seems almost fluid as it would simply blend in again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ends had a reddish/pinkish glow but not strobes or rotating beacons.  I could not make out a cockpit.  It turned to the south east towards Moody air force base as if it was in a pattern but way too low.  As it did this I could see the back of it.  This is why I say it look like the big wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light on the back were from left to right and white not strobes but pulsing.  My friend said that a tight formation then as it banked he said john that 1 single object I said yea I know but I don’t know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it leveled out it appeared that a small object (this could have been a chase plane just appeared off to the left and it had the standard red and white strobes (T) shape but next to this object it look like a fly smaller that a T38 , or A10, but still no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to go about 6 to 8 miles and turn right (south) and keep going; my friend followed it in his van for a while but lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Funny thing the next day his C Crain Radio that he records news on for work, well he turn it on at work and all his file where erased.  Not just a few but all.  And at lunch he went to update it and all the file just came back.  Track of object:  Approched from north turned to the east after about 6 to 8 miles turned south.<n>

It appeared stationery, a few seconds later I came to a stop sign I saw it move very slowly to the right behind a hill in front of me.  I made a left hand turn drove about 15 seconds and then made a right turn and pulled over.  In the area a bit to the right of where I parked, where the lights should been I saw what I thought was a helicopter.  3 dim pinpricks of white light in a perfect triangle with a dim slow blinking red light ditectly in the center.  The triangle, from my perspective, was the size of a U.S. Quarter held at arms length moving about the same speed as a helicopter would.  It moved in a straight line away from me to the right of my parked car, as the triangle left I saw and heard a high flying large jet with its lights blinking very high above me and moving roughly in the opposite direction of the triangle.  I tried to take a video but my cell phone camera didn&#39;t even pick up the stars around the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see small private aircraft around here every day. Dane county airport/Truax Field is very near also so we&#39;re also very familiar with larger passenger jets and those very loud F16 fighters. We see hear the national guard&#39;s Blackhawks fly over on training flights from time to time and are likewise familiar with the very loud base thump of those aircraft as well, you hear a Blackhawk before you see it. This triangle was totaly silent, any airplane or helicopter at that distance would have been very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, size and distance are difficult for me to judge, but it was incredible. I&#39;ll never joke about this stuff again.<n>

On our way to the store, we came to a complete stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look in the sky and see 3 blue lights.  They seemed pretty low to the ground, but thought nothing of it.  They stayed pretty even and straight, so our minds went to the thought of it being a plane just flying really low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to the store, and went on with our night.  Coming home from the store, we looked up once again to see it in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing my planes don&#39;t fly this low, my mother requested I pull over.  I was able to pull out my Iphone before she got her phone up.  We sat there then recording it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we looked at it more, we began to see a squarish oval shape with the three lights evenly among the side of the &#34;plane&#34; as we recorded it more, it slowly started to move.  Slowly, it got faster, and moved towards the mountains.  We watched and recoreded it until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Video is forwarded to NUFORC, but it appears to be ambiguous.

My daughter has filed her own report, per instructions of Mr. Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5:55pm, my daughter and I decided to go the store, and as we turned onto the next block to leave, heading north, we spotted two solid blue lights, evenly spaced about 200ft apart, right in front of our view, but about a mile away.  There was a red flashing light next to one of the blue solid lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was moving very slowly to the north/northeast.  We figured it may be a normal aircraft, although we have never seen a craft, other than a helicopter, move that slow, so we ignored it and continued to the store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home from the store, approximately 6:48pm, I was looking out the car window, when I saw three green lights, triangular in shape, suspended about 300-350ft off the ground, staying in the same spot, again with one red flashing light next to one of the green lights.  It was just outside the window on the west side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my daughter to take the next road to the right, which has no lights, and when she asked why, I pointed to the lights.  She pulled over and I rolled the window down to take a video with my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter gave me her iphone, and I started to record.  Shortly after starting the recording, the object started to move away at a very slow speed, heading north/northeast. It started to move a little faster, but never just took off at a high rate of speed.  I recorded it until I couldn&#39;t see it on her phone any longer, at which time, we left and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been completely dumbfounded since seeing it, and must say that I am still not sure what I saw, but I&#39;ve never seen anything of this shape, with the ability to stay in one place, with absolutely no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have sent the video I took to Mr. Davenport, with ufo video by barnard as the subject, using the director@ufocenter.com address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, Albuquerque<n>

Equivalent to the size of the planet venus as seen on the horizon that night.<n>
11/19/13 17:10|Captiva|FL|Fireball|10 minutes|SIGHTING #30 – 11TH SIGHTING OF ORANGE-RED “FIREBALLS” IN A CLOSE BY STRUCTURED FORMATION|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104615.html|333|ndxe201311| SIGHTING #30 – 11TH SIGHTING OF ORANGE-RED “FIREBALLS” IN A CLOSE BY STRUCTURED FORMATION<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:10 p.m. I arrived at the beach where I regularly skywatch, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass, on the south end of Captiva Island, Florida.  The sky was slightly overcast and the full moon had not risen yet, so it was quite dark.  Since my last sighting late August, I had not been sky watching much since then because of health problems, but nonetheless have been out for short periods of time at least a dozen times since then, and saw nothing of consequence.  I was thinking that all of the concentrated action of the past summer was pretty much over until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:15 p.m. one of the :fireballs” came on briefly, due west of me, about 40 degrees up in the sky, and in front of clouds on the horizon.  It came on as they usually do, like on a dimmer switch.  From when it first showed up until when in went out was about 5 seconds.  A few minutes later, another fireball came on in the same fashion, just a bit to the left (south) of the first one.  It also went out after about 5 seconds.  These lights were a little bit larger than Venus – about the size of a pea at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, about 4 or 5 minutes later, I saw for the first time, a very small orange-red light “freefalling” about ¼ the speed of a falling meteor.  I first spotted it at about 60 degrees above the horizon, and it fell to about 35 degrees, and then just stopped and hovered.  Then it got very bright, as bright as Venus.  It seemed like it was not much more than a mile or so away from me, like the previous.  Then it too went out for a few seconds and then came back on.  It stayed on and another one came on just to the right of it, about a finger-width away and to the right.  Then the second one went out while the first stayed on, and a third one came on just to the right to where the second one went out.  After that, the one on the far left and the one on the far right went out for a short second, then came back on, followed by three more lights of the same color and intensity, in a very straight and vertical line, equidistant apart by a pinky finger width, directly below the light! on the right.  Then all the lights on the right went out briefly, and then came back on starting at the top, 1,2,3,4 – in a staged way.  With the light in the upper left staying on during this time, and the middle top one coming back on briefly, it liked something like a HUGE kind of box structure.  This entire event took about 3 minutes, and then all of the lights went out!  I would venture an educated guess that the “structure” was perhaps 1 but no more than 2 miles away from me, and around 1,000 to 1,500 feed above the Gulf of Mexico.  The whole experience gave me quite a fright both because of it’s size, closeness, and the fact that it was the first UFO activity I seen in my area in over 2 months.  I’m excited that they might be coming back!<n>

Above the tree line to the south, a metallic silver sphere was moving at a constant speed eastward. I continued watching the object, walking backwards, as I ascended uphill to gain a better view.  When I got to the top of the driveway, it continued as it had for a moment... then, paused for a view seconds in one place.  When it started back up, the speed was the same as it had been, but it became more and more transparent!  It wasn&#39;t moving further way, it was still appearing to be the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It eventually disappeared. The whole sighting lasted about 50-60 seconds.  I cannot figure out what it was- it was perfectly round and very fast so it couldn&#39;t be a plane.  No audible noise or vibrations accompanied it- everything was quiet and calm during this time.<n>

She said there was a single engine plane that had a shiny peg shape behind it.  She said it was shiny silver and looked like a cigeratte.  She is not one much for UFO but based on her description I sent her several images of a cigar shaped UFO from online.  She picked out this one and said this was the one was a lot like the one that was behind the mall engin plane.  She was driving around 3 mile road and Wyoming Way.   There is a small airport near by but since she is not a UFO person, for her to describe a sighting like this, I figured it was worth posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was between 1930 and 1945.  I&#39;m sure of the time because while headed to class I heard about the launch on the radio.  Class normally ends at 1930 but I left early (around 1915) to make sure I was out of the building before the launch took place.  I didn&#39;t see the launch, but as I was was preparing to turn into my neighborhood I saw a red orb like craft flying (I&#39;m not good with directions) so I&#39;ll have to use my home as a point of reference.  I&#39;m on the street heading toward my home and my home was on the right side of the street.   The craft approached from the far right of my home and was headed left and would have passed in front of me but it veered sharp right and ended directly in front but above me.  It wasn&#39;t flying very high...it was low and close enough for me to see that it was round and was red or from the rear was red.  There was no sound and it was moving very very fast.  It did not appear to have many lights, the object itself appeard to be red.<n>

It was like few seconds I could see that flash going towards north in very high speed.  I am quit fond of spotting meteors and other astronomical activities but never saw such bright fast moving light in the sky.  This all happened for like 5 sec but I am damn sure it was a UFO.<n>

It appeared to be hovering and have a set of extremely bright lights.  As it sat there, not moving, I took several photos of it (attached).  As I set up to shoot and began to focus, several bright lights going extremely fast and curling tightly, like a berserk firework, shot across my view finder.  They never appeared again.  I focused in on the bright lights, still stationary, and took a series of photos.  To my surprise, the light did not show up...only pictures of a strange blue and red orb.  See to believe.<n>

Since I am in Padang for already 1 month now, I feel oblige to watch the sky.  The shape of the craft is almost the same, oval with very bright lights attached to it.  I really feel that it is necessary to find out what they do here and what attract them to come.  If you have people in Indonesia may be can do the watching, to confirm my report.<n>

I asked her if she ever saw the planet Mars for it was clear. The sky was extremely clear.  I could see helicopters, planes, the stars.  It was beautiful. The orange orb was amongst the stars in the horizon.  I looked at this for several minutes and asked her to go outside and join me.  She lives 20 miles from me.  When she exited her home she could only see the full moon.  The entrance of house opens to the East and the way I was positioned in my driveway I was facing south.  This orange orb did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me she could not see it for the moon was full and bright.  I unfortunately could not see the moon so I kept looking and told her about seeing this planet early spring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden this orange ball starting shooting upward and fast, as if were a rocket.  My first thought was I was witnessing a shooting star.  From my vision it moved on an angle straight up to the left of my vision.  I followed this until it was angling over my house.  I was not particularly concerned for it was moving quite fast and was very high up in the sky.  The movement from the horizon in the south headed Northbound was quick and took less than a min and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son came from behind me and scared me, unfortunately not knowing what was going on I was over excited and puzzled at the same time.  Almost at a point of disbelief.  I told my friend I had to go and ran in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later went back out and share with my husband and re-enacted my steps.  I saw nothing further in the horizon but did see the planes and stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw only (1) orange orb that was sitting with the stars in the sky.<n>

There were stars out but these two lights caught my eye because they were bright and close together and they moved too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were keeping the formation of as they moved south over my house but must have been moving quickly as I accidentally took a picture first and then tried to video but they seem to fade off in the distance so quickly; about 10 seconds on a clear night with no trees or buildings in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back to look at the picture and video, I didn&#39;t see anything on the video as usual. However when my camera had taken a picture with the flash on, I was able to zoom in close enough to make out a disc shape of the two lights.  But the lights didn&#39;t look like lights this time but more like reflections<n>

There were few clouds in the sky and I was observing the color gradations of the sky when I noticed a strange bright object in the SSW sky.  It appeared to be like a comet with a tail, only it was hanging in the sky.  Color was like a yellowish and I couldn&#39;t tell if it might be a strangely symetrical cloud catching the sunset light.  The &#34;tail&#34; or point of the cone was pointing up and right (/).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still driving I scanned the horizon and noticed two more of these &#34;comet&#34; or cone objects, as well as a what appeared to be a LARGE bright star or planet- that is it was a bright cirle or sphere.  It was too big though, and the sky was in that last light where it is still too early for the first star to show.  All these objects were relatively low on the horizon, and the two other cones were oriented differently - one with the til pointing straight up, and the other pointing to the left (\),(opposite the one on the other side of the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited I-91 and entered the Lowes parking lot, which both lowered my perspective (being lower than the highway), and partially blocked my view because the building was high.  I maintained visual on the cone and sphere in the more westerly part of the sky.  I was able to ascertain that the cone was in motion bcause I parked with it visible between branches on a tree.  It was actually moving quite fast (down and left toward the horizon), and within a minute or so was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then fixed my vision on the bright sphere and watched it for a minute or two.  Suddenly it seemed to be getting smaller, and then disappeared completely from the clear sky.  It was a matter of 5-10 seconds from when it was static size to when it became invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the store for 5 minutes, and returned to the highway heading southbound once again.  This raised my perspective once again, and I was able to see the object on the right once again.  It had changed shape, gotten slightly larger (closer, atmospheric distortion??), and was lower on the horizon.  It now had a rather flat &#34;top&#34;, and a curved &#34;belly&#34;, still with a diagonal orientation (/).  I was only able to see it for another coupe minutes because I drove into the city and view was blocked by buildings.  I was on the phone with my girlfriend throughout the duration of the experience describing to her in real time what was happening.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d call that a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mystery objects have me intrigued, especially the one which &#34;shrank&#34; and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It had many lights on it and the lights were very visible, and so was the craft.  I tried to pull my phone out to record but there was than a bright light and a loud roar.  I looked back up and it was gone.  Than I got a text from NASA that there was some sort of &#39;delay&#39;.  That sounded very weird to me that there was this weird object at the original time.<n>

It was flickering between red and orange.  I live right next to the boardwalk off the ocean, it was headed in a full westward movement.  On the bottom of this orb, look like a white dome (like a half circle) it was a couple hundred feet in the air.  And quite big. For the first minute or two it was headed steadily westward.  And a pretty quick pace.  Then out of no where it looked like it stopped and hovered.  As it did the bottom white dome was no longer visible.  Then they moved faster and headed north.  And within less than a minute is had completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father is very big into space, as we have family that works for NASA and he is quite knowledgeable.

11/17/13 20:00|Burlington (Canada)|ON|Light|~10 minutes|Two amber lights appearing intermittently; one moving left to right disapearing and reappearing, the other falling in an arc.|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104598.html|366|ndxe201311| Two amber lights appearing intermittently; one moving left to right disapearing and reappearing, the other falling in an arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking a cigarette on my 8th floor balcony two nights ago and saw some strange amber lights out over the lake.  At the range I was standing it was impossible to tell what I was looking at or how far away it actually was, but I was certain it was over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was raining and visibility across the lake was poor, the lights on the other side being completely obscured.  I looked at the weather network website that evening and noticed the wind was blowing 50kmh with gusts of over 70kmh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the first amber light I thought it was an aircraft turning on its landing lights and circling in the storm.  I thought it was crazy for someone to be out flying in that weather.  The object moved left to right and disappeared as though the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then reappeared in roughly the same position it initially appeared and repeated what seemed like the same left to right pattern, at the same altitude before abruptly reversing left and descending on what seemed like roughly a 45 degree angle before disappearing again.  The way in which it abruptly went from moving right to moving left and the rate of descent was unnerving and suggested some sort of crash.  All this elapsed over approximately 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt unsettled by how the light had behaved in it&#39;s movements seeming unaircraft like, there were no flashing lights of any kind through out.  I called my Father to the balcony to witness should the light reappear and it did approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes later.  It reappeared at approximately the same altitude and both my father and I saw it move left to right disappear and reappear in the same initial and repeat the left right pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second light, the same colour and intensity as the first, appeared falling from the sky what seemed like a fair distance to the right of the first leaving what I thought could have been a smoke trail but was impossible to tell given darkness and poor weather.  This light appeared at roughly the same height as the other object, perhaps higher and fell in an arc from right to left disappearing low to the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so enthralled by strangeness of all this that I can&#39;t be sure when the first light disappeared, if it was before or after t! he second.  I asked my Dad, a retired detective, if he thought the second light was a flare.  He didn&#39;t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the indeterminate range of the encounter and the poor conditions it was hard to say how high off the ground these objects were.  My instinct was that it was above the tallest buildings in town, but not very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event did not take 10 minutes to elapse.  The amber colour was less orange than the street lights and looked more like fire.<n>

It was very foggy that night yet we could still see this object.  My wife thought it might hit a plane that was landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I passed the toll we could see a large tail of smoke in the foggy shy.

Both objects appeared very similar, appeared to follow the same trajectory, and both appeared to disappear from sight at similar locations despite being five minutes apart.  I was able to view both crafts with binoculars and take a short low-quality video of the second via an iPhone five.  I did not appear to be a plane or any aircraft I am familiar with nor did they appear to be a meteorite fireball.  The size of the objects would be similar to a low-flying aircraft up to 8 miles away.  Although the light from the objects was not flashing, the appearance did not seem steady, and towards the end of both observations, either travel too far for perception or almost appeared to burnout.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At one point the lights rotated circular separated slightly then regrouped with 3 on the top and 4 on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly felt that I was being watched and after snapping several photos decided to head inside out of fear.  I don&#39;t know why it scared me, but it did give me a creepy feeling and the hair on my arms and neck stood up straight.

If I faced north in my driveway, I saw them fly from right to left. They were closer than what an airplane flying by would appear like. From where I was standing, they were slightly bigger than the North star in appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came abruptly, as if out of no where from the horizon side, behind a small hill, in the formation of the Big Dipper. I thought at first this was a constellation, but upon my family observing closer while driving in the car, we realized the orbs were MOVING very steadily, and quite rapidly, towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first formation seemed to be in a diagonal, turning into the shape of the Big Dipper constellation, and then 4 more came out of the Northeast corner in the formation of a diagonal, one after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited till they disappeared - there was no color change. They maintained their orange hue until they all of a sudden disappeared with a final white light flickering. And they were gone. One more came out of the horizon and that too followed a diagonal path, then disappeared the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bench faces West, I was sitting on the South end facing north while he was on the North end facing south when I noticed something in the sky behind him, to the North.  It was a sphere shaped, bright orange glowing ball that moved rather slowly as compared to aircraft observed in the area.  I never wanted to post about this before, but since this is the third time I&#39;ve seen this phenomena this year, I decided to research to see if I was the only one who is seeing these things and now I’m here telling my story, reluctantly due to my profession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting took place on New Year’s Eve of this year and there were six objects that night, of the same description as previously mentioned but they appeared to be traveling in formations of two.  The first two came from the south at a very high rate of speed, moving north; one behind the other, at the same speed then appeared to stop over us, at the same time, almost like they were attached.  When those two stopped, two more came from the south in the same manner, appeared to be the same distance apart from each other as the first two and actually moved on a slightly north, north westerly direction and slowed to a stop while the third set came from the south in the same manner as the other two sets but was even more slightly to the north westerly direction and slowed to a stop as well.  By this time I had everyone’s attention to them and the objects slowly disappeared over us, all at the same time.  It was witnessed by almost everyone at my house that night, approxim! ately 8 to 10 people and this whole incident occurred within approximately 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting, I had only seen one of them but it was traveling south at a very high rate of speed and I watched it until it disappeared in the horizon.  I was the only one who observed that one and I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me but this sighting only lasted approximately 3 to 5 seconds.  Please note that the directions listed are approximate or in that general direction.  I hope I didn&#39;t confuse anyone with the details.  I would also like to add that I did see a Chinese lantern one night a few months ago that someone launched from the next street over from me and the lights I saw did not resemble the characteristics of the lantern at all.  The lights I saw were much much brighter and didn&#39;t flicker like the lantern did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only photo that we had was from a cell phone and was not very clear or showed anything more than a stationary light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to include as much information as I could remember or even describe in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our little group is comprised of seniors, aged 54 to 70.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The men had retired and we four ladies were chatting, when Susie said excitedly, &#34;what is that?!!&#34;  We all jumped up to see a fireball coming toward us from high over the dam.  As it came closer it stopped and hovered, almost as if it had seen us and hesitated, then reversed direction and disappeared quickly.  We thought it was going very fast or, perhaps, turned its lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all my 64 years I had never seen anything like it.<n>

These lights made shapes such as a triangle but that was due to them just flying in perfect unison as far as their speed.  They ranged across about 50 percent of the northern sky so the first and the last orb were very far apart.  the first lights started to fade and then after about 10 seconds went away and the rest started to fade as well from front to back.  Then a single red orb appeared from the western sky moving at the same speed and direction as the others.  When it was directly north from us it vanished as well.  A final red orb appeared from the western sky and did the same thing as it&#39;s predecessor.  After that the sky was clear.  There are absolutely no clouds around besides directly overhead so it they couldn&#39;t have just went behind a cloud to vanish.  My friend with me saw this and said that he saw white lights that vanished as! soon as I pulled my car over.  I did not see these as I was driving the car and was not able to stare at the formation.  I tried to take a pic with my phone but it would not pick up the lights that far away.  This was in West Des Moines in an area with plenty of lighting.  Time was 8:25 PM so it was dark.<n>

The light was an orb about 1 ft by 1 ft. the orb descended at a rapid pace and then disappeared.  A few seconds later I saw a flash of green light (lighter in color than the first light from the orb).  Directly after the flash, I noticed a white/gray light flashing and changing positions on some cows where it had landed.  The white/gray light had a solid beam from the source of it and when I could see it on the body of the cows it was making a line pattern.  At this time I was approx 50 yards away from the object and I could see that the flashing light was on top or a part of a square object that was floating 2 to 3 ft off the ground.  The object itself was probably 4 ft in length and 2 ft in width.  It appeared to be made of metal and was a smoky gray color.  The light coming from the object was certainly artificial but there was something v! ery unsettling about them.  My entire observation lasted approx 5 minutes.  When I saw it was floating, I turned the vehicle around and drove in the other direction down the same road I came from and drove for 2 miles.  I was very shaken because I had no logical explanation for what I had seen.  I am a truck driver that works in the oilfield so I had no choice but to return and resume my work about 20 minutes later.  I got back to the location of the sighting around 8:15 pm and it and the cows (approx 10) were gone.  I finished my work and left without seeing it again.  It is also worth noting that while I was observing it and fleeing from it, that it didn&#39;t seem to notice me or the semi truck I was driving.  While I was fleeing, I had a feeling of dread that if the object noticed me that it would not be good.   This sighting is the most exciting and scariest event of my life.  I don&#39;t have pics/video of the object because I fled when I got a good look at it.  I returned to the location regularly and will try to get at least a picture of it, so long as I have the courage to do so.<n>

Its location, seemingly, would have put it over the Atlantic Ocean with the towns of Narragansett and N. Kingston to its left.  It was moving the speed of a slow plane, but absent any blinking lights. It almost appeared to be a plane on fire.  No trail, however, was evident as such an event might generate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it go directly overhead on a NE trajectory toward Portsmouth, RI. And it was soundless.  A meteor?  Too slow.  An unmanned flame-driven hot air balloon of some kind? Too fast and steady in its trajectory.  There was little wind.  And its consistent horizontal path did not suggest a flare of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, a second object, similar in size, appeared following the same trajectory.  As I watched both recede toward the NE horizon, I called my wife to come outside to see if she could get a glimpse before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a third object appeared on the SW horizon, followed, yet again, by a fourth.  She could see what had caught my attention.  They passed directly overhead, spaced in much the same fashion as the previous two, about fifteen seconds apart (as they emerged over the horizon).  And each took about seventy seconds to pass from horizon point to horizon point.  And as the others, they were round in shape.  The light emanating from all was flame-like white orange...again, with no sound at all.  All four moved at a speed and trajectory that did not suggest floating objects.  My inability to ascertain the light source made altitude difficult to assess.  My best guess: four to eight thousand feet, because one could see a somewhat pronounced, not perfectly symmetrical flame-like flickering, but very bright.  But they could have been much higher, given their unfamiliarity. Nothing about these objects suggested a normal aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We speculated that folks traveling east across the Jamestown Bridge would have had a good view, and my wife elected to call the Jamestown Police.  We were curious if anyone else had reported sighting these objects, all of which passed in about an eight-minute time span.  The police had received no reports, but sent a young officer to whom we recounted what we had witnessed.<n>

But there was no smoke, they did not flicker and die as embers do, and they maintained altitude until they drifted out of view. Notice I do not say “flew” because they were very small and did not seem to be operating under any source of power.  Think “floating.”  I do not believe in extra-terrestrial life, let alone visitation, so I am searching for a scientific explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I, my wife and stepson saw a orange/red/white light sitting in the sky.  At first sight thought it was a star, but the more I watched it I noticed it was oscillating then it moved latterly across the sky probably a half mile in a second or two. then shot back to where it started.  After that it shot over the opposite direction probably the same distance and once again back to original starting point.  It then was oscillating and after a couple minuets began to fly straight towards my house in a very uncontrolled manner.

It looked like a skinny diamond with only really bright shinning lights at the corners.  It was very large as it seemed to be far and was moving faster than a plane and looked as if there was a light green bottom..  it moved fast as if it was landing in a straight line.  There are no none helicoptor bases or airports in that dirrection.<n>

I didn&#39;t know where to begin with that anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on highway 218 when I was approaching a stop light.  I noticed a light, which I thought was an airplane, in the sky to the east. It was in the blue, sun-blocking part of the windshield so it just looked like a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I hit the stop light I ducked my head for a better view.  I noticed there was a pale green light around whatever it was and it was shaped like a half circle, but not quite.  The end of each side stretched a little further back.  The thing itself was a dark color I couldn&#39;t make out anything on it because it was night.  This was also when I noticed the thing wasn&#39;t moving.  I turned off the radio and before I could really think the thing took took off heading north east.  It moved like nothing I have ever seen before and I don&#39;t really know how to explain it. I just glided off and it didn&#39;t even seem like it accelerated.  It was like it was just at full speed but there was no jerking effect.  The green color traced behind it a bit and the thing was gone within a couple seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking around at other cars to see if they saw.  I wanted to get out and ask if anyone saw that but the light turned green and I pushed this to the back of my mind basically.  Nothing you can really do about it.<n>

Berlin, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility was clear, and I observed stars and other aircraft during the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my car at the middle school parking lot, waiting to pick up my child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The school is located on a hill, and as I looked to the east, I noticed a formation of solid red lights.  They were far enough away to appear as small dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seemed to be 4 sets of 3 lights.  All were moving at the same speed.  (Objects moved slightly faster than a prop plane, but slower than I normally see jets travel at.)  No blinking lights were observed – just solid red.  They were in a triangular /chevron formation – 3 lights per triangle – so 4 triangles/chevrons.  Looked a bit like this:  &amp;lt; &amp;lt; &amp;lt; &amp;lt;, the points and ends being where the lights were located, but more horizontally oriented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched from my car for a few seconds, and then got out of my car to step up on the low wall of the planter in front of the school, to try to further observe the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the lights appeared to be at the same altitude, and equidistant from each other. All were moving together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was of a military convoy/formation of some sort – but no flashing lights were visible – just the solid red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the formation move slowly from south to north, approximately over the town of Cromwell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of the grouping of lights after they went behind the trees which blocked my view from the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed at least 3 other planes at the same time – at different altitudes and traveling in different directions one to the south west, one to the south east and one nearly directly overhead – and was able to hear noise from all 3 – but no noise from the convoy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximate duration of incident was about 2 minutes.  There were no other witnesses.<n>

On the evening of Friday 15th I &#39;d arrived at work and did what I usually do which is look up at the sky.  What I saw could best be described as an electric guitar, black, huge and just below the cloudline, and it was very cloudy this day because of approaching storms.  This is my second sighting within a year, that ive seen something strange and unexplainable gliding through the sky, and I am telling you these things are SILENT!  It flew over my head therefore I could see it was one solid object, at some point it appeared to hover in the distance once glided past me, I would say it could have been as much as two miles out and it still was visable as a little dot, so it had to be pretty huge, however it was very high.  There were two other witnesses to this, (coworkers), one of which is ex military and whom admits to having  witnessed a few of them in his lifetime, thought it might be balloons until I showed them the pic I took and a explained that it had flown above my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pic was taken from my LG Optimus 13 pix, and is very fuzzy.

I got this whole instance on video and it appeared to have a helicopter either chasing or circling the lights.

I&#39;m actually scared and am almost positive something very strategic and organized is going on right under everyones noses and no one is even giving it a second look even a first look in most cases.  Correct me if im wrong ! but as of this point in time all airborne objects must be moving in a linear direction in order to be a jet  and hovering objects like choppers cannot got to high up because of engine air starvation..... right?....well lately I have noticed that&#39;s NOT the case.<n>

I live in South Kansas City which is somewhat far from the airport so this caught my attention.  Aside from that, the light was pulsing from a low dim light to a bright red light with intervals of one second.  It pulsed like that the entire two minutes as it slowly moved directly over me…maybe 10,000-15,000 feet above?  It went almost in front of the half to full moon so it was very easy to see.  I’d describe it like a Jelly Fish.  The inner part of the jellyfish is where the glow was and I could clearly see an outer dome over it.  The object continued on the same trajectory and same speed over the course of the two minutes and there wasn’t a single noise associated with it.  Strangest thing I’ve ever seen.

They were traveling side by side then changed directing abruptly and continued their flight one in front of the other.  There were moving slightly faster and at a lower altitude then the average air plain we usually see in our area.  After several moments the two orbs once again abruptly changed direction, this time flying straight up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds they disappeared one directly after the other.  We could visibly see them fade.  They became smaller and dimmer before completely disappearing into the night sky.  There was complete silence in the sky.  These orbs made no sound.<n>

It was descending very quickly and coming right toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost track of it for a second as it passed over our roof, and just as it did we turned right from Wallace to Maple we caught sight of it again.  It was right outside the passenger side, where I was sitting, almost directly above us and very low.  I could see it perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangular craft with three bright white lights, one at each point.  They were sunk in a bit, like pot lights, and there was one small red light that was barely visible just behind one of the white lights (toward the inside).  The light pollution from the city lit up the bottom of the craft.  I could see it&#39;s shape so well that I could see the bevelled edges and the details on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part for me was how smooth and fast it moved.  In a matter of 1-2 minutes – the time it took us to turn onto Maple and the then turn onto the Westmorland Street Bridge – it went from being directly over us and clearly visible to being so far away it only appeared to be a single light in the distance.  The path it seemed to be travelling was roughly NW to SE (I saw it come from the Brookside area and lost sight of it over the river out Lincoln way).<n>
11/14/13 18:09|Marshfield|WI|Circle|1.5 minutes|Marshfield WI - 5 lit orange orbs in night sky which darted about then two darted away and three disappeared|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104466.html|457|ndxe201311| Marshfield WI - 5 lit orange orbs in night sky which darted about then two darted away and three disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the evening of November 14, 2013, my son and I were traveling south in the car on highway BR13 at the south end of Marshfield, WI.  We were pretty much south and out of city lighting.  He was driving.  I was in the front passenger seat.  It was 6:09pm CST.  The sun had set long ago, I believe at 4:31pm CST.  Sky was completely dark.  I could see a few stars.  The wind was fairly calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my side window and saw two large brilliant yellowish-gold orbs with bright white edges in the sky to the southwest at about my two o’clock position.  They were almost completely round with an ever so slight elliptical shape.  They were side-by-side with space between them equal to about twice each of their size.  I thought someone was shining lights up in the sky or something reflecting but there was no illumination path from anywhere on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, an identical third one appeared in line to the south of the first two; again, with space from the first two equal to about two times its size.  I thought someone had sent up lit candle balloons but I hadn’t seen anything ascend upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn’t taken my eyes off the first two when the third appeared.  These three appeared to hover in line in the sky then move ever so slightly to the north in unison, then back again, and then start to move around independently within what appeared to be yards of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They returned to their original in-line places and suddenly another one appeared to the south of the trio but this one stopped about three spaces away.  Then another appeared to the south of the fourth one, stopping one space away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights went out on the fourth and then back on.  All were the same color, shape, and size.  All five appeared to be lined up parallel to highway BR13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three orbs started darting around changing places and returned to their original line-up within a matter of maybe four seconds while the other two also darted around and returned to their places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the first three lit orbs moved quickly, what appeared to be a few yards, to the northwest; I could see the first one then change direction and quickly arch up then down and dart off fast to the west and disappear as the lights went out on the second and third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, the fourth and fifth lit orbs suddenly moved, what appeared to be a few yards, to the south then the f! ifth quickly arched up then down and continued on, darting off! fast to the south while the lights went out on the fourth one.  With that, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the first three orbs I commented on it to my son.  He was able to see the fourth and fifth through the front window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From start to finish, this all occurred within about 1.5 minutes.  Because it was dark, it is difficult to estimate the size of the orbs and their exact location above the ground.  I believe they had been hovering approximately over County Rd BB between S. Lincoln Ave and highway BR13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove perhaps another mile and turned around, driving back to the area as I wanted to double check if there was anything at all in the area that could have reflected some type of golden colored moving lights.  I saw none.  I also checked the small local airport to the north of this area finding it was quiet and not all lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued south then turning east at a nearby intersection.  At this point we were about 1/2 mile from where we had seen the orbs.  It’s about nine minutes later.  Using the cell phone, I called my husband to let him know what had just happened.  The phone was silent as usual for its connection moment and then there was no ringing sound.  I have been using cell phones since 1994.  Instead of a ringing, what I heard was something I had never heard before on a cell phone or anywhere else for that matter.  There were all sorts of treble clef blubb and blibb sounds going up, down, and swirling around at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s the best I can describe it although I can audibly reproduce it fairly well.  The sound did not stop.  I said “hello” twice just to be safe.  My son looked at me; I handed him the phone and he heard it, also saying “hello”.  The sound continued.  He disconnected the phone.  He had also never heard these sounds before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited about 20 seconds and called! my husband again.  The call went through to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our family if familiar with star gazing, observing satellites, etc. We&#39;ve seen unusual things before at home or when driving but nothing involving several orbs at once.<n>

I was driving so had to keep looking back at the road.  I&#39;m not sure if it was one craft or 6-10 single crafts in unison.  At first it looked like 2 lines parallel to each other diagonally, about 4 lights on the bottom and 3 above it then one above that.  I stared for probably 5 seconds then all the sudden it was gone then 3 lights appeared.  It disappeared again then i could only see one light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky, just seemed like a layer of cloud and fog that this UFO was leveled right between, and what i was seeing was it breaking through then moving back up.  The way it moved was magestical.  I remeber feeling like i knew what it was, i knew it was no human craft, it was flying so low, and so peacfully still as it turned.<n>

This occurred in Princeton, WV, while I was traveling southwest on highway 460, in the direction from Princeton toward Bluefield.  I was stopped at the traffic light, which seems like one of the longest waits for any traffic light.  I was the first car in line in the left lane.  This light is at one of the three exits from the highway to the town.  It was the Princeton exit located closest to Bluefield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to have something to do, I looked up in the sky and observed what I initially thought was a jet contrail.  It was up in sky on my left and was too short to be a contrail.  Wasn&#39;t fluffy but rather short and precise, as if it had been drawn by a ruler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe as it moved forward and began to descend diagonally at a fast pace, with a sharp descent. It was headed toward the flat top of a small mountain or very tall hill, approximately 3/10 of a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got close to the ground, maybe 500 yards in the air, it appeared to tilt so I could see the shape and thickness of the craft just for a few seconds, and then it disappeared completely.  It just grayed out like a protective covering went over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape when it tilted was modified triangle, with elongated dome on top.  Based on the shape shown for an instant, it possibly could have been an Air Force Stealth fighter, as I have seen one in 1990s, at an air show, near where they&#39;re based.  But there was something about its shape, platinum-like sheen, and quickness of movement that seemed completely unlike the Stealth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered what was on top of that hill/mountain.  When the light changed, and I proceeded through the intersection, I looked back in my side mirror, when I got enough distance away to see that high, and it looked like a regular house up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had gazed around while stopped at the light, and could see no one else looking up.  I concluded that the greatest likelihood was that this was an UFO.  No blimp could have looked like a precise line, nor could it have moved that quickly to descend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> \  this slash shows  the  direction and sharp angle of the descent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ps.  On dec 5 returning again from Princeton, I noted that the hill/mountain had been flattened on top with no remaining trees.  All other viewable terrain was untouched mountains covered with trees or else commercially developed below tree line.  Where the craft descended was the only available field away from people and buildings, and without mountains and trees.<n>

The color changed to black / gray. It started to fly very fast in perfect circles. I counted 3.  The sky was bright blue, it wasn&#39;t an airplane. It had no wings.  As I was amazed, not believing my eyes, the object flew inside a rain cloud.  I waited but it never came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

If I held my hand out at arm&#39;s length, the space between my thumb and finger would measure between 4.5 to 5 inches wide (it was HUGE!).  The green lights shimmered/glowed and seemed to have a random pattern of brightness, almost like a morse code.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dogs in the neighborhood starting barking loudly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights slowly went over my home.  I ran through the house to the front yard, but due to the number of large trees lining my street, I was unable to see it clearly, other than some glowing light between the high branches.  By the time I got to a clearer area, the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t report it right away, but was looking online hoping for confirmation.  I do hope if someone reads this and saw something that night, they will confirm my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All objects were exactly the same.  The only things that differed were their location and altitude. Many people exiting a Wednesday night church service saw them as well as those working late at the local school district.  At least 34 people saw them. There were definitely more than 10 of these objects.  All objects except one seemed to just hover in the sky.  One object did move slightly towards an airplane that was in the sky.<n>

I wondered if it could be an aircraft on fire.  The fireball did not move, then it winked out after seeming to flare up.  It next appeared off to the south of its previous location, and winked out almost immediately, followed by another very brief appearance even farther to the south.  It reminded me of how fireflies will light up in several different places as they travel.  20-30 seconds later it appeared farther to the north and much closer, repeating the previous pattern.  Avon Park Bombing Range is located in that general direction, and I wondered if it might be something having to do with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did see tiny (much, much smaller) white flashing lights of aircraft in three different locations in this general area, however, these seemed much farther away, and flying in predictable patterns, that is to say, as normal flight patterns for aircraft in that area. I drove several miles from my house then on my way to work, and saw these fireballs again in the same general area.  Several people in this area have told me about the &#34;Prairie Lights&#34; of the Kissimmee Prairie area, but I had not seen them until now.  I will call them UFOs simply because I have no idea what they actually are.<n>

I was eastbound, just shortly after Saltaire so I know it wasn&#39;t the radio towers that are closer to 7200 west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my phone and slowed down (as much as I dared) to try and get a picture. It didn&#39;t appear as though I captured the lights in the pic and the lights disappeared.  I didn&#39;t really think much about it afterwards until I was going through pictures, looking to delete what I didn&#39;t want.  I found the picture of the black night sky and zoomed in to try and remember what it was I was trying to capture.  In the picture I can clearly make out 4 horizontal red lights on the right and 3 on the left.  At the top near the lights on the right there is another red light with a white light next to it.  At the bottom near the left lights is a single white light.  In the picture, all of the lights are streaked.  I assume it is because I was still moving.<n>

Ran to look out my deck door when I witness something taking off and flying straight up in the sky. It got to a certain point and just stopped and stayed there..  There was noticeable blue &amp; white lights coming from the object.  After some time I saw a helicopter circling the sky then take off and leave.  When the helicopter came the object flew further up in the sky.  After some time it can back down some. Event started around 640 and is still ongoing . Object has been stationary for like 2 and a half hours.<n>

A round ball of light .  Like a very very bright star.  The brightest star you ever seen .  But it&#39;s not a star .  It&#39;s not a plane , helicopter , weather ballon , tea lantern, flare, fire works  etc. ect.  You get the point.   It&#39;s something very different.  Not seen before and hard to describe.  It&#39;s hard to judge size , speed and distance from ground.  Seems to moving at a constant speed and direction.  The light might be flickering because of the atmosphere??  Or the object is emitting different intensitys of light ?? Planes are flying around it!!  Small planes up to five at a time .  I was following it in my car with two other people never getting any closer to it .  It was getting farther and farther away .   Chased for about 15 km never catching up doing about 90 km/ hour .  Had to stop ran out of road .  Just watch with binoculars for another 10 mins.  It did not seem to move.  Then it was like someone flipped  ! a switch,  the light was gone ??  Or it stopped emitting light   Either way not visible with the binoculars ..  National Deffence not interested called and emailed. ????  Let me tell you.  If it gets close enough to my house I will shoot it down !!!!!  It&#39;s not from this planet.  There is no reason for it to be out there .  And with the total lack of care from National  Deffence .

My wife told me she could see a strange bright light in the western sky.  I told her it was probably the satellite that we have always seen in the western sky.  She told me to take a look anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out in my yard and this very bright object (about 10x a bright star) was  hovering more south and lower in the southwestern sky.  My wife had said it was slowly steadily dropping in altitude looking up to exit 6 ramp to I-89.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured to look at it from my bedroom window with binoculars to see above the trees obscuring my view.  When I looked out my bedroom window, I had a perfect view of this light just over the apartment building across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the distance to this light 1-2 miles.  Maybe less. maybe more.  Very hard to tell the distance but it was quite bright.  When I looked at this light with my binoculars it looked light a disk/oval ship with 5 windows that I could see.  It was like pulsating!  The aura of bright! light all around it.  I shouted for ((name deleted/wife)) to come confirm this as I really could&#39;nt believe my eyes.  I gave the binoculars to her,looked up and it was gone.  No trace.  Almost like it knew I spotted it.  It was very strange but my wife asures me that this object was airborne and not a land based object on the hill.<n>
11/13/13 17:35|Lake Havasu City|AZ|Disk|5 minute|Object flying in the cold jet stream air and not leaving a vapor trail from it's hot exhaust like other jets were leaving!|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104444.html|481|ndxe201311| Object flying in the cold jet stream air and not leaving a vapor trail from it&#39;s hot exhaust like other jets were leaving!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, 6 of us were watching the sunset at 17:35 on 11/13/13 my wife pointed out to me and said there&#39;s another one of those things like we seen last year!  It was a shiny disc/wing object flying over Lake Havasu from the S.E. traveling toward the West.  The Sun had not set but it disappeared behind the Western desert mountains.  The object was flying in the jet stream 35,000 to 40,000 feet in elevation.  One of the six people said it&#39;s just a jetliner (Lake Havasu is in a fly over pattern for aircraft flying to and from Phoenix, AZ. to L.A. and S.F.) I quickly quipped if that object is an aircraft why isn&#39;t leaving a contrail (hot white exhaust smoke hitting the cold air) like the other jets (there was four other aircraft in the area all four flying to the West as the object was) and why doesn&#39;t this object have strobe lights on like the other four aircraft in the area.  Another comment was maybe it&#39;s a star and I quickly pointed out the planet Venus, which was ! visible in the West and told them that Venus was the brightest light in the night sky for a star or planet and this object was 3 times brighter than Venus.  Another quipped it&#39;s just one of those U.S. Marine Fighter Jets going on a bombing run out in the Mojave Desert.  I am very familiar with the Marine Air Wing out of Yuma, AZ. (I&#39;m a Ex Marine) and there flying F-35B and I&#39;ve observed that they stay out of the commerical aircraft space when flying out on there bombing runs.  They fly half that distance in height and they always have just white strobe lights on.  Plus these objects were much larger than a fighter jet.  Someone else quipped it must be something out of Area 51 which is about 200 miles N.W. of us.  15 minutes later a second object flew over in the same flight path as the first.  The only difference in this aircraft from the prior one was it was more of a orange color that I assume was coming from the sunset.  I would like to note that I seen the same type object last year (I didn&#39;t report it until now) as it was flying behind and! overtook and flew between 2 jet airliners that were flying beside each other with or about 3 miles in between the 2 jetliners.  And again this aircraft didn&#39;t leave a contrail like the other two jets were leaving!  My wife and I witnessed both these sightings this year and last. I can&#39;t explain what I was seeing.<n>

November 13th, 2013.  It was approximately 4:15 PM and the sun was setting.  It was still very light outside even though the sun just started to set.  I was on my way to my grandmothers apartment same as I do almost every week to help her out with sme household stuff and just to talk and visit.  Normally I would have used public transportation to get there completely however due to construction I had to walk the last had mile there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Her apartment building is right across from Lake Michigan, I don&#39;t feel comfortable being anymore specific.  As I was walking down the street I looked out over the lake like usual to enjoy the view.  As I was looking I noticed as usual some planes going over.  Then, I saw this white object very close to the moon.  It drew my attention because it made no sound and had no exhaust trail behind it.  As I began to look closer I noticed it had no wings, or appeared not too.  This made me think it was one of those new &#34;drones&#34; police departments are using to monitor their districts.  So, I wanted to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried across the street to get a better view.  When I did I saw another pitch white cylinder shaped object also close to the moon moving in the sky.  I felt mesmerized.  I couldn&#39;t stop staring.  Once I saw th both I knew they were drones or planes or anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  I couldn&#39;t look away.  I heard cars driving by past me but everything felt like it slowed down.  I experience a surge of fear and adrenaline.  I stared at them moving slowly towards each other.  The moon seemed to be in the middle point between them.  When they got close to the moon they just disappeared.  I was staring right at them and instantly, they were just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in disbelief.  I ran back and forth, looking all around trying to see where they could have gone.  I couldn&#39;t see them anywhere.  I felt, strange.  I have no idea how to describe it.  After that I just sat on a bench and stared out onto the lake and the sky hoping they&#39;d come back for about 20 minutes but they never did.  I know that what I saw had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night sky was clear of clouds and I was able to see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just watching them before I fell asleep and I noticed that one of them was flashing.  I stand up and walk to my window and it was still flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I squint my eyes and it comes into view, the object seemed to be moving towards me, it was flashing white and red, erratic flashing that was and hard for me to get an exact eye on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t make out if it was one object or multiple, so I ran downstairs grabbed my binoculars.  When I came back up to look, the binoculars didn’t help any (too far away and made it fuzzy) so I went back to observing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I was able to make out a shape, it was triangular and the lights were no longer erratic and presented with three sided white and red blinking one in the middle. But then they began flashing again, but red light only.  They began rotating clockwise making what I can only describe as a star shape design up and down the length of the object.  As it flashed up and down one end it moved on to the next making a five sided design that looked like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By then it had stopped moving forward and stayed in the same spot for over an hour doing the star light display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking a video with my phone but my adrenaline was pumping hard making my hand so unsteady that I gave up after 10 seconds.  When I look at the video you can see the red lights but it’s blurry and at the time I was convinced it was too far away for me to take video of least of all with a camera phone so I stopped.  I was so shocked by what I was seeing that I was googling on my phone trying to see if there was a radio tower nearby (there’s not) because I’ve only been living here for over a year and wanted to determine if there was a rational explanation for what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I always believed in UFO’s I never imagined I would be seeing one from inside my bedroom!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will keep my eyes out and document better if I’m lucky enough to see one again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

N.E. towards the S. S.W. over a small town in Wa. State.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were a bit below the star line, they were flying at the same rate of speed and seemed to be at the exact same height.  Some were in triangle formation or in groups of 2 or 3 or more.  Some were lone but still flying at the same rate and equally distant apart.  They did not veer off from each other but stayed in formation from front to back, they just kept on going overhead for around two and one half hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my neighbor first noticed them she said there were thousands of them going overhead toward the south.  They were not in a real hurry but seemed to be going at a medium pace.  The moon was out, the sky partly cloudy with breaks so we could see them flying over, there was a slight breeze which moved the clouds around.  One of the women is in the healthcare field, the other is a teacher of healing courses, she also cares for unwanted horses.<n>

And then the first light that turned on shut off and the rest followed till there was no light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to see if I could make anything out but couldn&#39;t see anything.  It was low but above the trees.  The only thing that was different was that I could feel something.  As if a semi was driving by but no sound.  Just a low vibration of bass or something that I couldn&#39;t hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;ve seen lights moving in odd patterns out here before and I just figured it had to do with the airports in the area.  It is also common to see skydivers and odd looking planes as the Experimental Aircraft Association is not that far away.

To my surprise there were multiple orange lights floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both walked outside to get a better look and stood puzzled as 8–10 lights, moving independently seemed to be slowly ascending into the sky.  They were the same size, brightness and color and resembled very bright stars with an obvious orange hue.  They rose into the night sky in no particular formation and each disappeared once it reached a specific altitude, which was approx. 40 degrees upward from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving slowly enough for us to watch for several minutes and I even called her parents on the phone to tell them to go look.  They went outside just in time to see the last one ascend and disappear.

There were four lights, kind of in a diamond formation, with a trail of additional lights clustered beneath the first lights.  They kind of went from a reddish color to orange to yellow and finally, as they faded off across the sky in the distance, they got lighter in color, almost a whitish-yellow.  My brother also noticed a slow-moving airplane flying in the sky at the time, heading in the opposite direction of the lights.  We could not tell if the plane had seen the lights and was following them or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture of them with my cell phone and also to videotape them, but didn&#39;t get anything useful on the camera.  All I got was black sky and the lights from the neighbor&#39;s house across the street.  Maybe, if I had used my regular digital camera instead, I would have gotten better results.  Oh, well!  Because of the trees and houses partially blocking our view of the lights, one of my brothers and my niece took off in my niece&#39;s car, trying to follow the lights and to get a better look with binoculars.  They went all over the place, looking for a better view, but, by that time, the lights had already flown off into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

((Moon!!))|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104403.html|502|ndxe201311| UFO over San Juan Islands, Washington Nov. 12, 2013 -- Large White Light Globe Moving in Sky - VIDEO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a UFO last night over the San Juan Islands in Washington.  100% it was not anything from this planet.  It was a massive, massive &#34;globe&#34; in the sky and it was moving slowly down, and changed directions a few times in a 90 degree turn which no man made machine could do.  I&#39;d say it had to be at least the size of a football field if not several football fields.  The glow from it was intense white light and seem to have a glow around it.  It wasn&#39;t just moving down like a meteor or anything, it was flying with power, changing directions, down, up, left, and right.  It wasn&#39;t too far above the high clouds.  I&#39;m a believer now!  It wasn&#39;t from this planet!  I made some videos of it and posted them to Youtube.  Sorry about the shakiness of them, they were taken holding my cell phone, and I was also drunk off my ass at the time.  I googled it and another guy has a Youtube video up as well so it was real as i wasn&#39;t the only one who got a video of it!  Here are the links to my Youtube page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTzej49FrII<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juCTxhcaVvM<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpDu029NTU<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be nice if someone can tell me what the heck was it?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOUR ADDENDA FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1  It&#39;s not a hoax or the moon.  I took the video and saw it for myself as well as my mother.   The thing was moving.  The moon doesn&#39;t move.  The moon is also not that bright.  It also moved in 90  degree angles.   It was real.  I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  LOL.  No.  This might be what  you do for a living but it&#39;s not that big a deal to us.  I just sent you the report and video because you are the first one that popped up on Google and I thought someone interested in that stuff might like to see it.  Mom is almost 80 with Diabetes complications.  She comes out onto the balcony I think in video #3 and you can hear her getting angry because the cement floor is cold and at me.  You can hear her comment on it for yourself in the video.  I was a bit drunk at the time so excuse my commentary in the videos.  Whatever it was, it was real and very large and definitely moving in different directions.  I think in video #4 or #5 on my Youtube channel you can see it disappear completely and then come back.  The moon doesn&#39;t disappear last time I checked.  I only had my cell phone and I guess did a crappy job of filming it.  I&#39;ll see if it returns tonight and do a better job.  I&#39;m not a nut job and don&#39;t chase UFO&#39;s.  I saw something in the sky that wasn&#39;t from this planet or some secret craft that no-one is telling anyone about and took some videos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  I&#39;m on Orcas Island looking south.  It was about at 2 Oclock in the sky so would be over San Juan Island, but a lot further out  It was a very clear night.  Clearest I&#39;ve seen in a very long time.  A few clouds drifting which you see on the videos.  I talked with some of the local stores and showed the video on my phone and they didn&#39;t see anything.  I sent an email to Seattle King 5 news and Fox News.  The local convenient store owner said, yes it was a strange looking clear night that we haven&#39;t had in a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Googled it and this guy posted pretty much the same thing I saw.  He says it was in the Seattle area which is about 40 miles maybe by air?<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1nqxyEAJ9M&amp;feature=youtube_gdata<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, his Youtube is full of UFO stuff.  So, I&#39;m skeptical.  But, it was in the same night.  Could he be a UFO buff and just happen to see the same thing as me?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s not possible I&#39;m the only one.  My god, it was the biggest brightest light in the sky that should have not been there and was moving for 30 minutes in directions that stuff doesn&#39;t do.  Nothing does that!  There have to be others who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m watching the sky tonight right now.  About an hour from last nights time.  It&#39;s a little cloudy now.  No where as clear as last night.  No sign of a moon.  I&#39;ve started to question, could I have been that drunk and it was the moon and the clouds made it look like it was moving?  I still say no.  Mom says no.  I should have made the camera steady so it could prove the movement.  Tonight will be the proof.  The moon only moves so much from night to night and so in an hour I will see if there is a moon up there close to the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  Yep it was the moon.  I&#39;m apparently the biggest dumb ass in history!  I guess the clouds made it look like it was moving.  My apologies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END<n>

It was dense near the object and did not trail for long, as does an airline exhaust and did not &#39;shine&#39; white as an airline exhaust does.  I wanted to get a picture, but I only had my cell phone and I knew it would not be clear enough to justify pulling over to try, so I instead used the phone to call my boyfriend to look and verify what I was seeing. He was just a mile from where I was.  I did not get the call through to him, so he didn&#39;t get to witness it.  It than moved directly away from me rather than across the sky and that is where my occurrence ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

From my position it was moving from over Chatfield Dam, across Bowman and NE towards DIA.  It was moving at a uniform speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was not a plane, since it was so bright, like a planet, with the sun shining on it.  The light was pure and non-fluctuating.  It was moving at such a speed, that I was able to run into the house, grab some binoculars and get back out to look at it.  It had moved about 20 degrees across the sky.  When I focused on it, I was looking for the typical wing light that are on a plane.  I did not see any, just the pure white object moving through the sky.  I did not have any time to get my 800 power spotting scope to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound associated with the object.  Planes that usually fly this route leave an audible sound trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I routinely look at the sky in the early morning, which is why I found this object so interesting.  I immediately checked the Internet to see if this was the space station.  I could not confirm the location of the space station on any of the web sites I searched.<n>

We were on the 6th floor of the 10 story hotel with all rooms facing west towards the ocean.  Outside our room was a 10 foot long balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had slept most of the day, had a very late dinner and then a bath (no drinking or drugs were involved).  Both of us are veterinary professionals that work at an emergency clinic, oftentimes working long hours overnight, and are accustomed to being up late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 2:45 am when we decided to get to bed.  I decided that I would take one last look at the ocean before going to sleep.  It was raining, blustery and cold.  The sea’s waves were crashing.  As I stepped onto the balcony, I looked out west and saw a very elongated teardrop-looking object hovering in the air approximately 10-15 feet from the end of our balcony.  The night was dark, but the hotel had spotlights extending onto the beach.  This object appeared very dark-colored (maybe gray or black), about 12 inches long with a very rounded &#34;front&#34; end and a very sharp, long &#34;tail&#34;.  It also had a wide stripe of a faint greenish-yellow about 1/3 of the way from the tip of its nose.  There was a black circle (approximately 2 inches in diameter) in the middle of the stripe.  It made no noise, had no lights on it, nor did it have any mechanical moving parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered briefly in one spot, and then turned 90 degrees to face me.  It then turned again to its original sideways position, still hovering in one spot.  Next, the object (still in its sideways position looking like an elongated teardrop), began to move vertically in a very straight line up 10 feet, then down 20 feet, then up 5 feet, down 2 feet, and then up 20 feet, each time before moving up and down pausing at its original hover spot.  It then flew northeast over the hotel building.  All of this happened within 25-30 seconds.<n>

The beam so bright it lit my window up outside like day light, the light came from above the house, this caught my attention.  We have low power street lamps nothing that bright only illumination enough to see to reach our doors safely.  At first I thought oh maybe it is a helicopter so I listened, no helicopter sounds only a buzzing sound, then the light beam started to change colors, red, blue, back to white and pulse.  This caught me off guard as I had eliminated a possible helicopter by noise it was omitting, and the change of colors.  At this point it startled me by the sound alone.  When I got up to try and view the light source or see what what it was, as I reached the window there was a loud popping sound and whatever was there w! as gone like it never existed.   11/12/13 later in the day I contacted the UFO center, but before I wrote my account I called the Police Dispatcher no accidents, no helicopter in my area, and none out at that time.    This morning 11/13/13 I contacted the Municipal Departments all 3 numbers to the Groveport Areas, as well as Fox News they both verified no sirens, no helicopters, no accidents for the area and the time frame.   Several of my neighbors where gone for the long holiday weekend, and I have not heard any reports as it was they had shutters closed and were sleeping, or just brushed it off.   I am reporting the incident in case it backs up any other occurrence in the area and  in that time frame.  (I did keep records of the phone #&#39;s and times of the calls verifying there was no discernible reason for the phenomenon that occurred).<n>

They were definitely independent.  They were slightly moving about and weren&#39;t very far from us.  It seemed they began to rotate in the formation somewhat.  As we got closer one light seemed to be getting dim.  The other two got pretty close to one another then in the matter of a few seconds they moved west and gained altitude at an amazing pace.  They didn&#39;t make a sound.  They became so distant they ultimately disappeared. It probably only took 8-10 seconds to evacuate our location completely.  It truly wasn&#39;t normal. If they were some kind of craft I&#39;d say they were pretty small.  No bigger that a Mini Cooper.  But all we could see was light/ lights in the sky that were defnetly moving around silently.

They were parallel to each other and traveling at the same speed.  I ran inside and got my 3 other roomates came out and they continued moving south together.  There was no noise at all nor blinking lights like seen on every aircraft in the sky.  Then when the first two started fading out to the far south another two lights appeared in the same location as the first.  They followed the same flight path as the first two and by this time a neighbor had come out and witnessed the second pair. We could not hear any noise at all from them.  Then when those two were in the south 4 more of the same lights came from the exact location but they came one at a time along the first flight path.  The lights all disappeared when they got in the southern part of the sky.  I&#39;ve seen aircraft in the sky but this was definitely not a helicopter flares or airplanes.  I called 2 news stations and searched endlessly to see if any explanation could be found.<n>

They dimmed and glowed repeatedly, were sort of fuzzy tear drop shapes, very orange at the center and sort of a ghosty gray/blue surrounding.  They did a little  swing around and formed a curved line and moved over very smoothly, with no sound, towards the north east.  I can&#39;t tell how high they were because there was no identifiable object against which to compare them, though i don&#39;t think they were that high (maybe 1000 feet?).  They were well spread apart, a good few 100 feet i&#39;d say, and were in absolute unison once they made their line.  Then 6 of them disappeared, just winked out.  I pulled into the fire station parking lot to watch.  The remaining four kept moving NE and then they disappeared one by one.  It wasn&#39;t as if they dimmed towards the horizon; even though it was dark, I had a sense of the horizon and it was before that.  And they didn&#39;t dim out... they just disappeared.  And then there was a final one that came after the others had gone and it flew overhead going NE, then it also &#39;disappeared.&#39;  I wondered if it was a drone test, but i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a base nearby (though who knows), they were silent, and i think drones are supposed to fly without any sort of light... certainly none like those that i&#39;ve heard of.  And they flew so smoothly and fast.  Very very strange!<n>

The next night,11-11-13 at 6:15 PM I was in Bristol TN.  Near the Painter Creek Marina on south Holston lake.  I was with a friend outside looked up and saw it again!  I ask my friend what he thought it was.  He was in the process of telling me it was a satellite when it suddenly move toward us very quickly, then went away slightly and stopped.  It hovered for about a minute, then flew off very quickly!  While it hovered it made no sound, it looked like a very bright light about the size of a large plane, with a very bright light on top of it.  When it flew away it sounded like a jet plane.  I don&#39;t know what it was, maybe a drone?<n>

It was in front of me to my left in the sky and maintained that position in front of me up until about 16 km out of Ponoka.  I noticed it looked like it was slightly moving closer and farther during the drive, and was trying to figure out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 16 km out of ponoka, it had moved closer to the ground, brighter and to my very right side looking out of the passenger window.  I was going to take the Rimby exit to follow it to my right but when I got to the Turn off,  It was straight ahead of me and seemed less bright, like farther away.  I took my Ponoka exit (headed east) and I could see it behind me in my back window.

11/11/13 17:00|San Tan Valley|AZ|Light|2-3 hours|Bright white light hovering in southern Arizona night sky|11/20/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104355.html|530|ndxe201311| Bright white light hovering in southern Arizona night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 5th, 2013, I saw a bright white light to the south.  It was around 5pm, dusk with a few scattered clouds (a storm was coming in).  The light had a haze about it and I thought it was a really bright star at first or an airplane.  So I watched it for a 3-4 more minutes to see if it was a plane.  But it began to move erratically, it&#39;s behavior nothing like that of a plane nor star.  It appeared to be hovering, bobbing up and down.  Then it would fly up to the left, hover then float back down farther to the right. (distance was hard to tell, though it appeared to be far, but at the same time it almost seemed like it was right above the San Tan Mountains.)  After witnessing the strange behavior, I went inside to get out my astronomy binoculars, ruling out a plane, star or satellite.  Looking through the binoculars showed me the object was spherical, with bright gold lights encompassing the entire object and the lights appeared to be moving clockwise, which I suppose suggests the object was rotating, revolving as it hovered.  We would periodically check on the light every 30 minutes or so and still no change.  At around 8pm the object (while viewed from the astronomy binoculars) appeared to turn towards the south and fly off.  The light became dimmer and smaller until it completely disappeared.  Thinking that was strange and still not knowing what it could be, I dismissed it as nothing, perhaps the military or the coming storm was responsible.  But, I have now seen this object in the sky every night around the same time.  I am really curious as to what this could be.  The behavior is always the same, always in the same spot and staying there for 2-3 hours.<n>

One looked to be a military aircraft that was completely black and resembled a military-converted 747, however it was lacking any visible engines, and was completely silent in spite of it&#39;s proximity to our location.  Behind and to the port side of the larger craft was a very small black oval shaped craft, not much larger than the vertical stabilizer of the larger craft, that was keeping pace with it.  After the craft both had crossed the body of water, the larger craft increased in altitude and continued directly toward Mount Rainier.  The smaller craft suddenly changed direction and began heading East.  When the smaller craft changed heading, its profile never changed, it never exhibited any sound, or had any visible change of speed, only a visible change in direction.  The reason why the larger military-looking aircraft was suspicious as well is not only due to the fact that it was accompanied by the smaller unidentified craft, but that nobody in our group could identify what the larger craft actually was even though two of us currently work in aerospace.  We did agree that it looked similar to a military-converted 747 for long range radar (although it was lacking the usual top-mounted radar equipment), but that the lack of visible propulsion, the extra length and width to the fuselage, its low altitude and low airspeed and its shortened wingspan was an anomaly in itself.  This sighting happened on a busy dock in this town, during a time of day when it was light enough to see both profiles clearly.  There were more witnesses than 5, but the 5 in our particular group were the ones who agreed to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A sketch can be included of the craft and their positions, superimposed over an image of where they were sighted.  However, at the time of the sighting, nobody had a mobile phone that didn&#39;t have a dead battery.<n>

At first I thought it was a bird.  Like when it&#39;s dark and u see a bird above, black on black makes it hard to see.  But then I seen a row of lights, that&#39;s the only thing that made me keep flowing this accross the sky.  It was NOT a bird.  It was almost as if the lights were bairly on.  They was very dim, but enough that it wasn&#39;t black in black. (meaning black sky behind black object.  It took about 4 seconds to cover entire sky from West to East.

In it they say the universe is alive, mother earth is alive.  So I was talking to them.  I guess praying to them.  I asked for them to show me something, anything.  Give me something to believe in.  Show me your real.  And then I seem to. Quinidine?  Possibly.  And no I wasn&#39;t soo needing to see something my brain made it up.  I was hoping for like a shooting star or something like that.

My car was facing east (towards Tennessee) and the box was north of town.  It appeared to be about 1.5-2 miles above ground and maybe about 10 miles north of the Jonesboro.  The box (or dark gray spot) was traveling from west to east. And when I started paying attention, it went behind a building in my apartment complex (which broke my line of sight).  I stepped outside my car and noticed the box traveled back into my line of sight, going from east to west.  I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I was seeing.  I then noticed the box make a turn northwards, slow down, then accelerate and disappear (it didn’t fade into the distance, it just disappeared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the box because the ambient lighting of the city lit up the sky, and it was darker than the surrounding area.  Also, it did not have any marker lights (red, white, amber).  Lastly, the turn radius it had was too small for an airplane but too large for a helicopter.  Additionally, an exhaust/vapor trail was non-existent and the pulsating, whirring sound that you get when helicopters are traveling was not deciphered (which should be for a quiet Sunday night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The captain mentioned that we were passing Jacksonville just before, so I assume it was in the area, though I could tell it was not close to the aircraft.  It also appeared to be above the horizon (aka in the air) judging by the surrounding ground lights and sky though it was difficult to see it’s relative location exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not blink and was a solid red color initially.  After approximately 2 minutes, it seemed to subtly pulsate with red/orange coloration (no blinking).  The light then disappeared completely for about 30-45 seconds and reappeared for another minute more in a similar location.  It then disappeared again for about 15s and reappeared for another 30s (approx.) before disappearing completely.  The object seemed to fade in and out instead of 100% on/100% off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to stay in the same relative location, though it could have easily been traveling towards the plane.  It was a very bright object and had a distinct color, which is why I took particular notice.  I fly pretty frequently and I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen anything quite like it before.<n>

I noticed an orange flickering ball of light coming from the Northeast traveling Southwest.  There were no aircraft type lights; no headlights, no strobe lights, nothing red or green, just this orange ball that flickered the way a camp fire in the distance would appear.  It flew below the clouds, I&#39;m guessing at a height of 5,000 to 7,000 feet and traveled at a speed consistent with prop or jet aircraft on landing approach. Again, guessing about 150 to 300 miles per hour.  It did not leave any kind of trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing North and this object passed from my right to left.  The whole time, about 15-20 seconds, it never changed speed or direction, nor intensity of light.  Watching it come and go, the &#34;ball of fire&#34; appearance never changed; it appeared the same coming as it did going.  What made me think this was a noteworthy experience was the complete silence of the entire event.  I never heard a sound, when normally aircraft within this range of vision can be heard, especially when they have traveled psst my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this as confirmation should you receive a more detailed report and or video of this event.<n>

There was a cloud cover but no rain or wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noticed a large, bright, round, orange ball of light just under the cloud cover and about 1/2 mile away from me to the west.  The ball flickered like fire and barely moved forward casting an orange glow on the underside of the clouds above it.  When it moved it bobbled slightly instead of staying in a smooth trajectory.  It made absolutely no sound and was about 90% from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireball was approximately the size of a full moon.  The light began to fade and I realized it was moving up into the cloud cover and then disappeared.  The whole sighting lasted about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 66 year old retired person who has lived in the area of Joint Base Lewis McChord all my life and quite used to regular aircraft.

Then suddenly it changed directions.  It continued to change directions for about 5 minutes, and then it more or less settled in to drifting between 2 stars.  If you were to draw a line between the 2 stars, it would continuously drift across this centerline but also, it would move closer to one star then the other.  This was all in the eastern sky.  A second object appeared and flew by the first in a southerly direction till it disappeared.  A third object appeared, randomly changing directions.  It also flew south till it disappeared.  The 4th object flew by the drifting one in a southerly direction but didn’t disappear exactly. It was in plain sight.  Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and it was gone.  The 5th object flew off in a southerly direction as well, but faded till it was out of sight.  The 1st object is still there at 7:35 PM.  I haven’t seen any more yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was a clear sunny afternoon on Sunday, Nov. 10. around 4:30-5:00 and the sun was setting.  I often take pix of the sunset and was taking some of this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 5th picture I had taken, I glanced at my phone to see if the last one came out clearly and saw a red ball shaped object on it.  I went into my picture file to check it and the previous 4 pix and saw this same red ball on all five of the pictures but in different positions and when you zoom in on them you can see a dark line in the middle of the ball.  I thought at first maybe some type of reflection on the window since I was taking a picture of the sun which was directly to the west.  It was a bit chilly with a few cirrus clouds and the window was up.  When I looked at the last picture it showed a very definitive football shaped pinkish haze around the red ball.  If it weren&#39;t for this last picture I would chalk it up to something on the window, except possibly the different positions the ball is in on each photo.  They&#39;re actually quite good and not just a speck in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to send the pix in but don&#39;t know how to send them from my phone to your website or how to get them onto my computer from my phone.  I&#39;m a bit of a imbecile when it comes to stuff like that.  I can send them easily through a text message, but don&#39;t suppose that&#39;s possible on your end Peter as I&#39;m sure you have enough to do with this website without having to deal with text messages also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I could get any assistance with this, I&#39;d be grateful and more than happy to get these pictures to you.<n>

I expected for the object to pass the building, as an aircraft should, but it just didn’t happen or it may have changed direction staying on a North bound course where this building didn’t let me see any more of it.  I came inside the house wondering and commented the sighting with family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept wondering, not over five minutes later I went outside again and started staring at the same point I saw this for the first time, the I turned myself slightly to my right and saw about four or five objects of similar characteristics as the one described above travelling in a sort of formation from SE to NW direction, 2 above and 2 to 3 others below.  Only this time the sighting took almost 4 to 5 minutes to reach the same building and again by the time they reached the building, they just didn’t pass it and the objects disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed at the same spot for over 30 minutes looking to see if any of these objects appeared, but they didn’t.  On the mean time I got to see two jet aircraft (both seemed an airbus 320 or boeing 737) flying on approach to Lima’s International airport, a low altitude flying police helicopter and a balloon that may have been lost by a kid.  This provided me the altitude, speed, and flying pattern perspective of this type of flying devices and what I saw differed totally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m 41 years old with an engineering background, have participated in sale and installation of  Navaids systems for civil aviation such as a complete Northrop Grumman ASR 12 primary and secondary radar system, ILS, VOR, DME’s, etc.  I have travelled abroad and attended airshows all over, had the opportunity to see acrobatic formations made by such prestigious teams as the Blue Angels, and familiarized with almost all of the civil aircraft currently in service from small Cessnas to A380 which I recently saw approach in Miami, and this is something that really differed from any other thing sawn before in my life.<n>

When we got back to our house, a giant blue flash  occurred  in the sky.  It looked like heat lightnig in the middle of the summer.  But it&#39;s not summer and it wasn&#39;t storming and it was blue.  The flash happened three times. There was no noise.  Then, there was a faint noise that sounded like an old airplane.  It was coming straight.  But took a very sharp turn, I would say about 90 degrees, in the direction of the lights.  The aircraft did have wings and lights like a plane.  The plane was circling the area  and continued to make unusually sharp turns.  Them, it began to hover in the sky.  A searchlight then beamed down  from the airplane.<n>

In the sky across the street in the distance I saw a bright triangular light and a ball of light similar in size fell straight to the ground.  I continued to watch it for 30 minutes as it moved slightly to the left but didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  I watched as an airplane approached it and flew beneath it.  There were trees blocking the view of the plane so I waited for the plane to clear the trees but never did and slowly the UFO also went back to the right and behind the trees so I went back inside.  I went back outside about an hour later and noticed the triangular object was now in the sky behind my house and there appeared to be 2 more similar objects but they were more distant and one to the far right and one to the left farther in the distance.  I got my I-phone 4 and took pictures but all that could be seen is a very small single lighted object so I got my camera and took pictures with it also.  My cameras needed to be charged so I went back inside for an hour or so and when I went out for my next cigarette it was still there so I took pictures once again with both cameras and also video taped with both cameras.  It was still there went back inside at 3:30 am so I went to bed and when I woke I uploaded the pictures to my computer.  The pictures from my I-phone 4 only showed a tiny light but the shape changed slightly.  The photos from my other camera showed a round moon like objects in some of them.  The stars in the sky did not appear in the picture.  Nothing at all appeared in the videos just a black empty sky.<n>

The craft was small like a crop dusting plane but silent.  It was a light almost see through orange.  It was moving south east<n>

It was flying so low to the ground we thought it was going to crash and it was comin towards us then all of sudden it begin turning it was infront of us turning but it did not make a sound.  Underneath it were white lights goin horizontal and red lights going vertical.  We knew it was no plane and we were AMAZED so we got out the car and watched it float off as the lights kept blinking.  It turned so sharp and made no noise and was certainly not shaped like a plane.  We tried to get in the car and follow it but it seemed to disappear in the sky, it was very weird and all we could do was smile and talk about it.  I have never come in counter of a ufo but I am most certain that was a UFO!  What is so strange is that after we went back to where we seen the ufo and parked rhe car strange things begin to happen.  There was no wind at all and the gate by us begin to open and and would close but there was none there.  Then it would open slowly and close half way the open again and when we looked no one was there but there was a cat that stopped and stirred for a long time at the gate.  It was very weird so we both went home.<n>

My partner noticed 6 orange lights in the sky (four in a diamond shape and two more off to the side). He asked me if noticed the lights, and if so, if I had any idea what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to travel up I-5, I asked him to pull off the freeway so we could get a better look.  At this time, I looked up the number for the UFO sightings network.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner got out of the car while I made the phone call.  The objects were glowing  an orange color with blue and white twinkling lights on the bottom.  The objects moved from east to west and seemed to go out of sight when they hit a certain point in the sky.  By the time we parked (approximately 5-7 minutes after the first sighting, there were only three objects present.  They did not seem to travel in any specific order or formation, but continued to “drop” lights or sparks from the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the objects until we could not see them anymore.

That&#39;s twice now within 5 months!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed~ One clearly red fiery orb was hovering mid-altitude for several minutes over Overland Park, KS... Once again.  ~Same location (I-35 &amp; 435), and within an hour of the last sighting that I also posted on NUFORC (&amp; they posted on MUFON) on 6/7/13 @ 21:30.  Last time was a cluster of ~10 red orbs, but this one on 11/9/13 was alone, smaller and hovering, not cruising.  It also dissipated after observing it...  And once again, I saw it while driving south on I-35 just past 435 and to the east (towards Olathe).  And once again, when I first saw it I kept it in sight to quickly/easily weed-out all the other green/red/white flashing lighted, winged, propped, petrol-powered noisemakers (not Element 115 propulsion system).  When this became abundantly obvious, I again pulled my car over on the shoulder of the highway with the window down for the duration... Fascinated, and thankful it happened again for me.  It once again had no other running lights (port/star! board/taillight)... It seemed to be pulsating (flame-like), too, before vanishing into thin air.  Any other known identified flying objects in our airspace would continue to be visible with their clearly seen lights... Illuminating for good reason.  We save our cloaking devices for when it&#39;s truly needed... Not crowded airspace.  ;-}  I almost didn&#39;t post this sighting... Merely because I didn&#39;t want anyone to think I was just seeing things repeatedly.  In fact, after the last sighting, one of my close credible friends suggested I carry a camera and watch the skies... Just in case.  I told him I&#39;ve always watched the skies, but I&#39;ll never carry a camera just for that... Not obsessed with it, yet.  And, that I figured it was just a one-in-a-lifetime event.   He reminded me that they periodically frequent the same locations... I agreed.  That&#39;s two within the same year...  And it&#39;s only November.  I&#39;ve noticed several other postings on here in the same area, like my last documented report.  Another guy and his friends reported the same location sighting the last time on MUFON on 6/7/13 w/ same time-frame, and that was indeed relieving to me.  So, keep your chins up^ and minds open...  Forever.  It&#39;s just a matter of time, and time will tell.  Peace out&amp;gt;…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The following is a more complete description, with links to all 4 videos, but the originals are too large to attach here.  Feel free to append this to, or replace the original report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11/9/13  Inverness, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw approximately 10 bright orange objects passing from east to west, somewhat south of my location (Lat 28.8731 N  Long 82.3606 W).  All of the clips are really dark (sorry, shot at night), so they are best viewed full-screen, on a large monitor.  It will also help if the room is dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recorded a total of 4 videos, some, when viewed in the original format, display terrestrial reference points. However, video enhancement would probably show trees, and such, on all of the clips.  Each video is of different objects, with some clips showing multiple objects at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each video was shot using a Nokia 928 cellphone, with an 8MP camera.  They are all recorded at 1920x1080 resolution, at 30FPS.  The file names show the dates and times that each was recorded.  The earliest recording started at 19:44:56 EST, and the last started at 19:49:28 EST.  The cellphone was held in the vertical position (long side from top to bottom), so when viewed in a video player, the clips may appear sideways.  If viewed sideways, east will be at the bottom of the screen, and the top of the original clip will be to the left side of your screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects did not pass all at the same time, in any sort of &#34;formation&#34;.  They passed during a couple minute period, at somewhat varying separations, and they seemed to vary in distance, but they all did appear to be tracking on parallel courses.  To the naked eye, the objects were a fairly bright yellow-orange, and the general appearance did not appear to change with the viewing angle.  It looked the same approaching (from the east), when they were  even with me (looking directly south) and departing (to the west).  The trajectory of every object was straight, there were no sharp turns, or zig-zags.  Any perceived movements of that sort, in the videos, were due to my inability to hold the cellphone steady.  Where the objects appear to stay in one place, &#34;hovering&#34;, this is due to me doing a better job of panning with it, All objects continued moving at a steady pace, and did not stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:44:56  This video shows at least 3 objects.  The bright white light is the moon,  At some point, near the end, my neighbor&#39;s porch is seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:46:20  This video shows one object, passing over the roof line of the neighboring apartment.  The light colored area, near the top, at the start of the clip, is the eave of my apartment. The lighted area is on the neighbor&#39;s porch, the bright white light, in the upper left, near the end, is the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:48:36  This clip has no obvious points of reference, and also displays &#34;streaking&#34;.  The movement is due to me moving the cellphone, not amazing maneuvers.  I tried to pan with the object, as it crossed the sky, but that is not apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19:49:28  This one shows a single object.  It appears that I was fairly successful at keeping it centered, as it moved.  The object was definitely moving, from east to west, and fairly quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no apparent sound, associated with their passage, nor any debris tails (like with meteors or space junk burning up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were multiple witnesses to the event.  I was with someone, and I also heard other nearby voices, in the area, making statements about what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As suggested, I have uploaded all 4, uncompressed videos to the links shown below.  I am uncertain if YouTube does any processing or compression, after they get them.  I have the originals on my phone, and on a PC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/JPWowF2ZqBg  http://youtu.be/b_0uKoymZRo<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/WsK0nm8ml5Q  http://youtu.be/Ts67a3H8dKo<n>

It could have been a military training flight with the formations, but I am not sure.  The light they gave off I can only describe as looking like a dim orange street lamp color, but large and bright enough to be seen very easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it fly in a single direction for a few minutes, the front three lights split up and formed a small-medium sized triangle.  I lost sight of one of the lights in the back completely, and the other one was still moving in the direction of the other three at a slow pace.  The triangle hovered for roughly three minutes.  After those few minutes, the lights of all three simultaneously faded from bright to nothing, with a bit of flickering, lasting in total around 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in between the last sight of the back light and the fading of the three front ones, I lost sight of the last light behind a house.  I tried moving the car to a better location, but they were already gone.  That was everything I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was slowing down to actually get on 601 at a yield sign when my boyfriend pointed out bright orange lights in the sky.  I pulled over and we watched.  The objects were a little larger than a plane would be.  I counted and saw at least 30 of them.  At first I actually thought it could be an extremely odd and rare view of a constellation of some sort, but I soon realized this was not the case.  They were in formation moving west to east at a constant speed. Then, as if planned, they began entering a new formation.  They continued traveling and then I could not see them anymore.  I believe other people saw it because as I continued driving I saw another car stopped in the road.  I wish I could have recorded it or taken a picture, but our phones would not pick them up.<n>

It made no noise and was traveling at the same speed as a plane does when it&#39;s preparing to land at one of our area airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it crossed over head and further east north east of me it stayed at the same altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two minutes later I saw two more orange fireballs seemingly flying together at the same speed and altitude about two inches apart when I spread my thumb and index finger apart.  These two headed in the same direction but at about the point I couldn&#39;t see them any longer they seemed to get very close to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 2 minutes later a fourth one followed which was followed by a fifth and then a sixth went by again.  The fifth one sort of headed due north and then at a distance appeared to flame out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor witnessed the last one with me commenting that she had heard about the GOCE s! atellite that was due to enter our atmosphere.  She mentioned that it wasn&#39;t scheduled to enter our atmosphere until Sunday the 10th or Monday the 11th.  I went on to the computer and read that there was another satellite ready to enter our atmosphere on 11/9/2013.  I&#39;m not sure what these were because they didn&#39;t look like meteors that fall from the sky as you typically read about or see videos or pictures of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took four photos of the last one with my cell phone and one I was able to capture in zoom mode and it looks completely round and orange.<n>

The sky was solid overcast, very lightly snowing, and the sun had set at 15:00 local time, on the north Alaska coast.  I noticed an odd light shining through the overcast to the south, which caught my attention.  I kept watching it as I drove about ¼ mile south to an intersection, where I stopped and saw rays or beams of whitish/bluish light shining down through the overcast, as if a powerful searchlight was suspended above the clouds, shining down.  The light beam did not reach the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only the immediately surrounding clouds were lit, not a diffuse glow. I turned east at the intersection, and saw that the light seemed to stay in the same position. Intrigued, within a few hundred yards I turned off onto a side road, and positioned my truck so I could see the light and area around it clearly, put the vehicle in park and rolled my window down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t hear anything but my truck idling, and it looked like the light was slowly drifting east above the clouds.  At this point I remembered to take pictures with my cell phone, with my arms extended out my open window.  I took the first picture, and the flash went off, so I turned off the flash and took another picture.  By the time I took the second picture, the light had faded almost completely.  From when I first noticed the light in the clouds until this point took about 5-7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited a few more minutes, then drove east for about a mile, where I saw a bright light in the sky to the east, over another well-lit oil facility about 3 miles away.  As I looked at this brilliant point of light, which was brighter than Venus on a clear dark night, it faded away, either going through the clouds or having a dense cloud layer obscure it, or by simply going dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with our weather observer and found that the cloud layers were at 6,000’ 5/8 overcast, 9,000’ 6/8, and 15,000’ 7/8.  My angle to the light was about 30 degrees above the horizon, so I estimate the distance to the object at 12,000’.  My feeling at the time of the sighting was a mile to a mile and half distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally qualified, and reliable, witness.  PD))<n>

I cannot be 100% sure, but I believe it was the most extreme example of noctilucent clouds I have ever observed: very bright and very blue -- all the more so because I could only see them through gaps in multiple layers of dark, lower overcast that was moving fairly rapidly.  The effect was rare and odd, causing me to study it for a while to attempt to identify what it was exactly and verify that it was not simply the aurora.  Since Kuparuk is at latitude 70 North, the Sun slides down at a very oblique angle to the horizon and there are many hours of twilight.  This enhances the duration of twilight phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I give permission to provide my name and number to the other witness, because I also work at Kuparuk and would like to compare notes on this strange event.<n>

11/9/13 09:08|Stillwater|OK|Light|45 minutes|I saw 7 or 8 balls of white light in clear sky at 9:00 AM that were flying in non linear fashion with a strange zigzag trajectory to NE|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104343.html|596|ndxe201311| I saw 7 or 8 balls of white light in clear sky at 9:00 AM that were flying in non linear fashion with a strange zigzag trajectory to NE<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed some bright lights in clear sky at 9:00 AM. They looked looked stars. However immediately I dismissed that assumption since first they were moving and second the sun was in the sky and no stars were visible except these moving lights.  Then I thought they might be air planes but I have seen many air planes when I look at sly everyday at high altitude.  The body of airplane is clearly visible in those cases and I can see the wings. but these were just spot lights.  With unusual bright white. I am sure they were not planes or any conventional crafts.  Moreover, they used to move not in a straight line but in a irregular shape flying NE.  They were going back and forward joyously and left and right sometimes but generally flying north east.  First I saw one and then I noticed they are three and then I spotted 7 or 8 of them.  They were flying together.  They were very far.  I changed my position to see if they change position in the sky in comparison to tree tops in the scene. but their location was unchanged in comparison to my movement indicating that those objects were really high in the sky. I tried to fit every other explanation instead of UFO such as maybe they are white birds lighted with sun in the morning. But they were not birds. I look at birds in the sky everyday (I do relaxation 1 hour a day in open field) and I can recognize their body, wings etc. Moreover birds fly in a direction not such a zigzag pattern back and forward, sudden 90 degrees turn, such as these objects. Then I tried to see them as papers or objects taken by wind to high altitude but the way they moved was inconsistent with objects who are blown by winds. They did not swirled like the wind rotate the object. They suddenly changed their direction a few times with right angle turns within 5 seconds. It was obvious someone is controlling that craft or light bulb. I am a mechanical engineer, PhD, and I know a little about craft movement types. These obj! ects (lights) were not moving like a regular craft such as we ! have. I have never seen an object moving in sly like that. Their light was sometimes changing form white to light pink and then again to white. I am a very skeptic person and I tried so hard to convince myself they are not UFOs. However, I have to admit that what I saw does not fit any other possible explanation (They could not be birds, wind blown objects, planes, etc.) other than UFO.<n>

And way to big to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a couple of minutes got creeped out and went inside.  About 2 min later I went back out to the car to grab another bag and noticed it was no longer there.  This all took place in less than 10 minutes.<n>

We stopped and noticed 8 -10 metors in braud day light i called my son in S.E Roanoke and asked him it he seen them.  At home he went on the porch and said yes 8-10. we both also noticed jet aircraft were following a couple.  they went away and we thought there was 1 more that did not have a burn trail.  We were traveling I81 581 home from salem at 55-60 MPH and the light we thought was a meteor appeared brighter than any object in the sky.  When i got home the light was still in the sky.  It was the 2nd brightest object in the sky except for the moon.  The light appeared stationary and was not outside the atmosphere as normal stars are it was to low in the sky to be a star.  My father has witness the same light every evening since sept 2013 it appears at dusk stays 3-4 hrs and dis-appears. I contacted local media and ask if any report had been filed and was informed no.! I will monitor it tonight again and is it reappears i am going to the Roanoke star to get better view. Stars and planets do not disappear hrly on clear night and are bright enough on a cloudy night to puncture the low altitude clouds and form corna as this light does.<n>

They both were headed Southeast from the general direction of snowbird ski resort.  Keep in mind they looked like satilites and were nearly directly straight up from my location.  I lost interest and called my dogs. I looked up again as small patch of clouds covered the leading satilite.  On the other side of the cloud I saw more lights moving along the same path in a south east direction.  Once all the objects cleared the cloud the satilites were in a triangular formation.  The triangle was equilateral. In the middle of each flat of the triangle there was a satilite.  So in all there were six satilites, three at each point and one dividing each flat.  I believe this formation was in orbit and not in the atomosphere.  The formations size is unknown. But judging from the distance I would say the object had a base length of twenty miles and each leg was twenty miles.  Taking into account my visual angle the object ! took up a relatively small patch of sky.  After observing the object for a time I noticed a diamond moving with it and directly ahead of it.  Each point of the diamond had a light/ satilite at each point.  Two satilites trailed it waving back and forth like a tail.  This object appeared to have a light mist on its interior.  The second formation was about an 1/8 the size of the delta. I second guessed that the clouds moving may have tricked my eyes.  Possibly these were star formations and the clouds moving Northeast made them appear to be moving.  Upon thinking this I noticed the formations moving relative to the stars and the stars didn&#39;t pass through them.  The speed of the formations was slow but fast enough to cover the 50% of the sky I observed it move through before disappearing behind a cloud front.  I am in the aviation industry and I know that aircraft have green lights on right wing, red on the left and white on the tail.  All the lights were white. The size and behavior o! f these objects is unlike anything I&#39;ve seen.  The videos I too! k didn&#39;t show up.  Grab a camera don&#39;t use your iphone.  I can send an image if you think you can fix it.  It&#39;s just black screen<n>

This light formation is in the flight path of a major air traffic , many planes follow this path .  I watched and this light formation did not move . It consists of red lights, white  radiating , blue and a green . These lights seem to alternate and then can all be seen at once .  Sometimes there will be a lot of red . It is not moving . We thought next maybe a star burning out , but that is not the case .  We positioned it with a fixed object on the ground and would keep a look out on it .  For an hour it has not moved . then at 12:00 it started to shake and get bright and turned just a hair (looked like it was turning around) here within the 15 minutes it has moved approximately a 1/2 centimeter moving from the east to the west .  Thus making us think again its a star . But we have watched planes pass by it and disappear .  It is not a plane but it looks like one with its lights blinking and alternating .  We have binoculars and cameras and we cant get a fix or a good pic with camera too far away  .  It is still there .  It is approximately the same altitude as the planes . We have also seen several meteorites fall .   Would love to know if we are looking at the space station, a satellite , weather balloon , or do we actually have a UFO? there are 7 of us the neighbors and myself watching this thing .  I am 44 yrs old do not drink or smoke or do drugs .  I am very interested in this this object seeing as it is in the path of the flight trails of planes I watch all the time .  Say a plane departing Dallas and flying to Atlanta .  This is a fixed flight path for big airlines .  We are three hours above Little ROck and this is in the sky from Gassville would be a straight line toward  Jonesboro, toward Cordova MS.  and in  that straight line on a map . but it is moving slowly I mean a! n hour i t moves maybe less than an centimeter . towards the west . Lights are radiating and sometimes matte. My neighbors are all in their 20&#39;s and their mother who could barely see it . I will continue to watch it and see if it is  in the sky again , I have called the local weather station in Springfield MO to see if they have any weather balloons in the upper eastern part of Arkansas . But as it is right now this is not a plane we know that for sure . And the movement of this and the lights and its brightness is really or cant be compared to anything else .<n>

We also had a friend who was following us in her car. Both my friend &amp; I had noticed 3 bright lights flying low in the sky.  For a couple seconds we both didn&#39;t say anything, but there was something awfully parculiar that we both seemed to pick up on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, my friend lives near the Manchester airport, she&#39;s used to seeing airplanes all the time.  Airplanes have a blue &amp; a red light on them, this craft did not have them.  Secondly, the lights of an airplanes aren&#39;t perfectly flourescent &amp; white, but seem to have a yellow tint to them.  What we saws lights were whiter than any lights that we&#39;ve ever seen before.  There was one bigger brighter one in front, and two smaller ones not far behind in the back. We also keep in mind that we are near the airport, which brings me to my next point.  This bright lighted craft was flying low heading East in the direction of Derry.  And then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were baffled all the way until we got to our destination in Litchfield.  We had gotten out of our cars, and had asked our friend in the other car about it.  She said that she was thinking how weird it was as well and how odd and out of place it seemed.<n>

Shortly after 6:30 I was crossing a sports field and returning to the dorm.  I turned and looked over my shoulder at the moon and Jupiter (which was a little below the tree line) then I looked almost directly above me.  I noticed two stars, one of which was as bright as Jupiter.  I found this curious and became more intrigued when I noticed it moving.  I thought it was a plane because of the airport nearby but even the planes highest up can be heard eventually.  This made no noise, and had none of the usual lights you see on a plane.  The best I can describe it was like someone was holding a giant LED flashlight and pointing it towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds light went out the way an ember dies, yet I could still see it.

I seen this object as I was coming out of $ tree then @ light I turned right 2 follow.  This 1st view was like I was seeing it from the bottom @ an angle. Object had 4 red lights @ each pointed end of a diamond shape (I think).  I lost sight of it even pulling into Publics parking lot where I got out &amp; tried 2 find object again but could not.  I only looked around 4 maybe 1min.

All I can say is at this angle of view  &#34;Oh my God&#34;, this thing was huge and I was screaming.  It was like I was looking @ a back of this diamond shaped object, with either end having rows of round led looking lights with maybe 4 lines of round lights with 5 round lights in each row on either end &amp; all white.  In the center was a circle of round white lights with a circle of smaller lights within.  The very center of this set of round lights in a circular shape was dark with no lighting and the rows of lights @ each end also had a gap of darkness between them.   There is no way I was the only person to see this thing @ that intersection!  I then turned on 52 &amp; continued 2 follow while I did keep losing sight of it in the tree line as it traveled , I was able 2 see clearly again at that low bridge over swampy area b4 losing it again.  I decided to turn left @ the 1st light on rivers into that subdivision on Otranto between Stokes Honda &amp; gas station.  See I had 2 turn around bc I live in Moncks Corner so what the hell I road back into this subdivision to try to find it again &amp; did.

It was very well cloaked against the sky and stars.  Almost an apparition or a shadow.

Normally when aircraft fly over the house they fly in a north-south pattern, these lights were moving west to east which was unusual.   The lights were in a triangular shaped formation, it looked to be about seven to nine lights flying in the sky.  The lights moved slowly across the sky, within about 7 seconds they moved behind the tree in my front yard and then disappeared from my vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to locate the lights again and make sense of what I had seen when my vision again moved above the house to look at the stars in the city night sky.  I then saw another light, this one singular, move from south to north in the sky above my house.  Both of these lights were noticed in the direction of the Orion constellation.<n>

The sky was dark as there are no lights illuminating the coastal highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 7:49 pm as I passed the Sheffield Rd. exit, three parallel circular white lights trailing an orange streak suddenly blazed across the night sky and then burst with a flash of intense white light and then the arc of light rapidly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was from North to South, across the highway and out across the ocean, and lasted only about 10 seconds.  I thought, &#34;Oh my God a plane exploded and is going down,&#34; but there was no evidence of any crisis on the sea or in the sky following that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On reflection I found it strange, too, that there had been no sound given how intensely bright the streak and burst had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 57-year old female professor.

We waited to see what it did when other planes came close and the planes passed by as if there was nothing while it kept on following its elliptical trajectory...

The moon was lower in the horizon, and I looked straight up to look at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up, the light of one of those “stars” appeared to just “turn off.”  There was no movement at all involved with this “star,” and it appeared very distant in space like the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that was strange, and I kept looking up to see if the light would “turn back on.” Well, the light did “turn back on” about 10 seconds later, only  I would guess about 20 degrees due south/southeast from where I first saw it.  The light was back on only for about 5 seconds, then it was off again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking if I would see it again along the same trajectory, but I never saw it again.  Between these two sightings, there was no visible path, no blinking lights, no movement, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was so unusual about this sighting was that there was no motion involved when I saw the “star” those two times, and it appeared as distant as the other stars in the sky with similar light intensity and character.  In both instances, the light “just turned off,” and there was no visible path whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have admired the nighttime sky for many, many years and am familiar with what airplanes, satellites, the space station, the shuttle, etc. all look like when I look up, this is nothing like I have ever seen before.<n>

Two of them, very close together were moving slowly southward from the north and floated over the high school, Wadley High School.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are pine trees in the area so I walked up my driveway to get a better look. The first 2 had now moved further south and were going behind the trees.  At this time I saw another orange light moving at the same speed from the same direction as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend who lives on the next street behind me and told her to run outside and look toward the school. I told her I had seen the orange lights.  She and her son did go outside immediately and saw 3 of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While talking to her I was watching the third light. It stopped directly over the school and hovered for several seconds.  I would estimate 30 seconds.  Then from the north again came a 4th round orange light.  It was moving the same height and speed as the other three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4th light came directly to the third light which was still hovering.  As it neared the third light, the 3rd light began to fade.  Getting dimmer and dimmer.  This dimming took 20 - 30 second.  Just as the 4th light got to the position the 3rd light had been, it, the 4th light made a 90 degree turn, not stopping and headed slowly westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should have been able to hear motor noise, but did not.  All four lights were the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is experienced investigator.  PD))<n>

The moon was barely visible and was to the left of the object, both visible through the low level cloud cover.  This object did not follow a typical flight pattern for this area and was much too high in the atmosphere to be a conventional aircraft.  I looked like a typical movie style meteor entering the atmosphere but moved very slowly and didn’t dart through the sky as I have seen other meteors do in the past.  I tracked it as it moved across the sky for about 10-15 minutes and would wait as disappeared behind clouds and reappeared through openings and I was able to judge where it would re-emerge due to its very linear trajectory.  This was a distinct, large fireball with a dark mass towards the front and a bright yellow/orange tail trailing behind!  It that did not leave any contrails.  I would be very shocked if no one else in Northern Virginia saw this object.  It could have just been a large meteor but I thought I would write to you and report it anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks you for your time.<n>

We saw three orange glowing balls of fiery light over the Gulf waters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One was traveling West to East.  Another was traveling East to West above the first one.  A third was traveling just above the surface of the water East to West.  The first two vanished, leaving only the third one.  The third one began to climb upward in a slow arc.  It stopped and hovered for a moment and seemed to change colors to a more star like white color.  It rapidly accelerated away from us and disappeared into a pinpoint of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were reeling and trying to come to grips with what we had just seen, a fourth glowing orange orb appeared miles away and far off in the distance down on the Western end of! the beach, which would be Front Beach.

Sighting is silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous sightings were around August 31st near Lake Erie and October 5th in Mohican (Knox County).  Different times of night.  I have a video, but it’s not very clear as the object was moving too quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say it was a Chinese lantern but it was moving too fast and following the exact pattern, also I question as to why there would only be two each time.<n>

11/5/13 19:22|Vallejo|CA|Triangle|10-12 seconds|Triangle shaped craft with orange lights flew quickly and silently.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104209.html|661|ndxe201311| Triangle shaped craft with orange lights flew quickly and silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> November 5, 2013, UFO Sighting At approximately 19:22 hours,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the roof of the employee garage, headed to move my car (while I was on break) and grab a notebook for work.  As I walked toward my car, which was on the far end of the roof, I looked up and noticed something moving toward my direction in the sky.  At first it wasn&#39;t clear what it was.  As it approached, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly, and as it started to pass over me I noticed the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangular shaped craft, with dim orange-ish lights at each of the three points, and was dark in color (black?) as it matched the night sky.  I turned my body and followed the craft as it passed nearly directly over me.  I managed to shoot my arm out and measure the size with my thumb; the rear two lights were visible from both sides of my thumb.  The craft seemed to move in a straight line toward a North Easterly direction (From San Francisco toward the Sacramento area).  It took about 10-12 seconds to pass from when I first noticed it.  I didn&#39;t have time to get my phone camera on to take a shot, but I did call my co-worker and told her what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart was racing and I was trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It hit me that there was no sound from the craft. In fact, the area was rather quiet, and the wind was pretty calm.  There was no strobe light on the craft, and the dim orange colored lights were solid and didn&#39;t flash or blink.  It also struck me at how fast the craft was moving while not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not going to assume that this was an alien spacecraft based off of what I saw. I know there are new stealth craft being tested and there are several military bases in the area. But the size, speed, and lack of sound have me puzzled.  I&#39;ve lived near military bases all my life and have seen many different types of aircraft. I have several friends who are pilots and have been up close and personal with many modern and WWII era aircraft.  I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I returned to my car, to retrieve the notebook I forgot, after I moved it closer to my department.  I noticed a Cessna type aircraft fly almost directly over me (not as direct as the UFO did), but in a different direction than the UFO, and noticed several things:  The speed of the UFO was at least three times as fast as the Cessna type craft.  Stretching my thumb out at arm’s length again, I noticed the wingspan just barely cleared either side of my thumb, but the UFO was more than twice the altitude of the Cessna type craft.  There was a distinct sound from the engine of the Cessna type craft as it passed over me, which the UFO made no sound at all as it passed.  The Cessna type craft had strobes and marker lights (red and green on either wing), and I could see a dim light from the cabin (it was lit up pretty well).  I could tell that the Cessna type craft was white, whereas the UFO blended in with the sky, except for the orange lights.<n>

Objects were moving very slowly, very bight, seemed to have faint flicker almost like a burned out firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial 4 dimmed out of view I looked straight up to see a 5th.  My son quickly got out his ipod and got what we could on video but the video does not do it any justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My nearest guess would be a very slow moving space object barely catching the outer atmosphere and not completely burning up.<n>

He did not see the round bright object when he took the picture because he was driving at the time and only pointed and clicked twice.  What made him take the picture was the round cigar shape cloud in the upper left of the picture because it pierced the cloud in the center of the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This picture was taken with an I Pad while he drove.  This was about 5:30 PM during Daylight Savings Time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Picture on right was first picture and the left was the second picture taken.  The sun was to the bottom left of the picture and this was taken pointing to the West.  The other interesting thing about the bright object is that it has a contrail behind it so you can’t say it’s the sun reflecting off the I Pad lens.  He didn’t notice the bright object until he showed his wife the pictures later.  (I will submit the 2 pictures) taken<n>

I was outside with my father and mother,  When i looked up i saw 5 bright blue lights shaped like a Perfect Triangle.  I also was able to hear the rumbling noise and felt the earth beneath me shake.I saw it for a good 10 seconds, ran inside to get my phone to take a picture and by the time i went outside the sound went away and so did the craft.  When I walked back to the house I noticed the TV was turned off ( but it was on when i left the house to go take a look outside i had left the TV on)  This craft was bright, perfect triangle, it had a very loud rumbling noise but it was quick to get quite, and it stay right above a telephone pole near my house at a clear sky.<n>

They traveled in a perfectly straight line in a westward direction and abruptly came to a stop.   The shapes held that position for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared.   I attempted to bring them to my husband&#39;s attention, but he missed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later, he pointed out a singular triangular shape in the northern sky identical to the ones I had just seen.   It rapidly crossed the sky from west to east then zigzagged in a downward direction and disappeared.   My husband does not believe in UFOs but said he could not think of any other explanation than the possibility of an experimental military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked about it for a little while and then just sat and enjoyed the night.   Unbelievably, about twenty minutes later, a star-like flash of bright white light streaked from behind me heading in an upward northerly direction and quickly disappeared into the night.

Coincidentally, as we were looking in the sky I saw what I thought was a shooting star. Immediately after,<n> <n><n> <n><n> A red light appeared that I thought maybe was already there and didn&#39;t notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the light disappeared after 10 seconds and reappeared after about 5 seconds.  It did this about 3 times before my boyfriend decided to pull out his phone to take a video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as he was looking for his phone, I saw the red light move from one spot, to another, then another in the shape of a triangle and then disappeared for good.

I was driving towards the Lisha Kill nature preserve which was to my right.  I looked up to the sky to my right over the tree line and saw lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane because we have Albany International airport not too far away.  As I got closer I thought I can&#39;t be an airplane because it was stationary and low to the ground the object was maybe 50 feet above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was it must be a helicopter but as I got closer to the object I knew it was not a helicopter by its shape and the fact it was making no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car in the middle of the road and through a gap in the trees I could make out the object.  It had sky-blue lights on the ends of its wings and four lights underneath alternating red and white.  The lights gave off an illumination that was different from a light on a regular airplane, they were almost glowing but not like spotlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was small like the size of a car.  Its wings were shaped like bananas or like a three-dimensional triangle which were divided symmetrically by a similar shape on top of the center of the craft.  Underneath the craft were two protruding geometrical shapes that looked like rudders on an airplane but these pointed towards the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I stopped my car, the object hovered for a few seconds then very smoothly like a balloon floating through the air began to fly away from me deeper into the nature preserve.  The shape of the craft, the fact that it was in a location not easly accessible by people, its relation to the tree line, the way it glided through the sky, and the fact it made no sounds lead me to believe it was a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to follow the object by roads surrounding the preserve but to no avail.  I have to say I&#39;m a believer of ufo sightings I just never thought I would be privy to one.  I immediately went home and tried to draw the object I saw to the ! best of my abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a male in my early thirties and am always aware of my surroundings.  I know a thing or two about planes and this was not a plane.  There is Knolls Atomic Power laboratory near by and who knows what they&#39;re doing in those facilities.  The object I saw was unique and like nothing I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a camera phone but by the time I got over the awe the object was pulling away and I didn&#39;t have a good angle.<n>

They were in a V formation and moving quickly north of my house  .<n> <n><n> <n><n> They  were small compared to a full moon my mom, best friend ,brother and I watched them move north for approximately 5-6 minutes and my best friend tried to call her father and her phone wouldn’t work just static.

11/4/13 20:04|Escondido|CA|Unknown|8 minutes|Saw a craft ejecting red flares over the night sky in Southern California|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104140.html|689|ndxe201311| Saw a craft ejecting red flares over the night sky in Southern California<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, November 04, 2013, at approximately 20:04 hrs., my girlfriend and I walked out of our home to take our dog for a walk in the northwest part of the city of Escondido, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we walked outside, I noticed a reddish/amber light in the northwestern sky.  The light was so bright that I mentioned it to my girlfriend and said something to the effect of “I wonder if that’s Mars or Venus so bright tonight?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stopped to look at the object and we both noticed that it was moving.  We kept our eyes on it as we walked another 50 feet or so.  The light moved from our northwest to our southeast.  We both stopped walking, and I remarked at how bright the object was, but that it didn’t have any blinking lights on it (the kind I normally would associate with an aircraft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was flying in the southeast horizon, we clearly began to see red flare-like objects coming from the bright amber lighted craft.  The objects were glowing red, similar to the color and intensity of a roadside flare.  We saw approximately nine (9) of these “flares” come from the craft over a span of three (3) to five (5) minutes.  At least one of these flares broke apart into two independent “flares”.  We watched them fall downward under trees obscured our view of them.  They were still lit/glowing as they disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the last of these “flares”, the bright amber craft simply and suddenly “winked out” and disappeared from the sky.  It did not slowly fade away, nor did we see it fly away.  It was simply visible one moment, then gone the next.  It may be worth mentioning that we could not hear any jet or propeller noise from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt that what we had seen was odd enough that we contacted the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and described what we saw to them.  The SDSO connected us to the Northwest Region of the FAA.  I spoke with a lady named Karen who conferenced in a man named Charlie from San Diego Tracon (sp?).  Charlie was unaware of anything that should be dropping flares over San Diego County.  Karen suggested that I contact the UFO Center.  I spoke with Mr. Davenport who asked us to write a description of what we saw while the details were still fresh in our minds.  Mr. Davenport asked that we contact the National Weather Service for wind speed information.  We called the San Diego office of the National Weather Service, but could not reach a live person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hereby attest that everything I have said in this statement is the complete truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be both eloquent in his description of the sighting, and serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  PD))<n>

Once it entered into the clouds the light could be seen to be a blue and green pulsating ball of light with a trail of white smoke behind it which was so pale it looked like steam.  It moved so fast, and appeared to be so large I expected to feel the impact, but I felt nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later three to five search planes began circling the area where light crashed and remained searching for at least an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no report of this incident, and I appear to be alone in this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this event please step forward and provide a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

This time a second orange light appeared next to it and then they both disappeared.  One then reappeared and then 2 more appeared and then all 3 disappeared and didn&#39;t return.  They appeared to float slowly and then dart a bit before disappearing.  The whole thing lasted 3-4 minutes.<n>

The table consisted of 3 separate bright orange/yellow lights spherical in shape.  There was also a fourth &#34;craft&#34; moving behind it.  This fourth craft appear to attach itself to the triangular shape and from there the bottomed right craft slowly peeled.off and the lights disappeared.  It didn&#39;t appear to be an airplane because there were no flashing lights indicating so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have also witnessed this occurance while driving near Armada, MI.  We he no explanation for what these lights could possibly be.  The lights either completely vanish only to leave the fourth orb of light by itself for approximately a minute and then that too vanishes, or they all completely disappear together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a side note, both my fiance and I are hunters.  And since seeing there lights we have not seen any wildlife. Including birds and squirrels.<n>

It was a very blue sky crisp clear day, almost no clouds. It lasted for 2 to 3 minutes &amp; mostly stayed in one spot only drifting to the right very slightly. It seemed very big as we saw other planes cross the same area throughout the day &amp; ones that were lower to the ground you could make out in good detail.  So we do not believe there was any mistaking this ball of light for a plane or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every 8-10 seconds the light would either blink out &amp; disappear instantly then blink back in or fade to smaller then blink out completely then a couple seconds later blink right back into view.  2-3 minutes of this fading/blinking in &amp; out &amp; after the last disappearance it didn&#39;t come back, it just seemed to vanish &amp; we didn&#39;t see it anymore that day.  It almost seemed like a solid object but it was so bright white it was hard to decipher any distinct edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On examination of video that we took, to the lower right side of the object there seemed to be a much smaller round object floating with it &amp; zoomed out along with it as it disappeared.

Just found you via Google while looking to see if anyone else had seen what I saw.  I am doing this in Word like you asked.  Anyway, here goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday 11/04/2013, around 6:15 am, I was sitting in my car in the Sunoco gas station parking lot waiting for my old man to get me a coffee for the road.  This is the gas station right across the road from Geneva College playing field, and right behind the tool rental place, on Route 18 in Beaver Falls, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking east over the river when I saw this light.  It was red, blinking on and off, and I thought it might be a radio tower light.  But as the sky grew a little lighter, I could see there was no tower, wires nor anything the light could have been mounted on because the hills in the east were in relief against the sky and the light was higher up than the hills.  It was totally unmoving, except for the blinking.  The stars were moving as they normally do.  Then I saw little clouds pass behind this thing over the hills so I knew it must have been right above the river.  It started to blink with a slightly different speed and then it dropped straight down and then straight over to the right.  Then the light went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don’t know if this was anything like a UFO but I wanted to find out if anyone else saw it.  I am a 60+ year old woman and not some kind of nut who sees things.  We are new to that area having just got a retirement home there that we are working on, and I am thinking maybe it is something else, like a regular light in the area we don’t know about.  Just wanted to report this to see if anyone knows what this is.  That’s all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But to us it seemed that the size was too big as this object appeared to be miles away - perhaps 5+ miles.

It looked like orange balls of fire, about 30-40 feet off of the ground and hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The balls of fire were about 75 to 100 yards from where I was, but appeared to be about 8 inches to 1 foot in diameter.  I am sure that they were actually larger than that, based on the distance that I was viewing from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark at the time that I viewed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The image went behind some tree cover and when we came out on the other side it was gone.  I figured that it had consumed itself, but I didn’t actually witness that.<n>

The location very close to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some time and as we were going to video, they went up and disappeared.  I wondered if what we saw was four separate units following rather same pattern as if chasing each other or if it was one large round unit we could not see with four power sources.  So change that there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both bright, educated, mature individuals and neither of us has ever reported or seen anything like this.<n>

Me and my fiancee witnessed a bright object in the sky moving.  It is (was) located in the northwestern sky and at first glance looks just like a star.  Staring at it we noticed it moving slightly to the west or southwest direction, then all of a sudden it accelerated drastically and pulled a very tight 180 degree turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further observation of this UFO it continued to move left to right and in circles while slowing down and speeding up randomly.  It would also dim and brighten back up at times during all this.  That was 11/2/2013 and was visible once dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night (11/3/2013) we observe the same UFO doing the same sporadic behaviors in the same area of the sky.  I&#39;d bet its still there but can&#39;t confirm due do 100% cloud coverage tonight (11/4/2013) in my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first thought it was probably just a plane til it pulled that tight 180 I knew then that it wasn&#39;t. Also know it isn&#39;t a comet or such, because if so would not act in such a fashion.  Started to think it could possibly been a satellite but I was not sure.  So I have researched a lot about our satellite&#39;s such as how they work and move/orbit exactly.  After my satellite research I&#39;m convinced this UFO is not a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So what is this star looking object in the northwest sky moving sporadically night after night exactly?<n>

It would disappear and reappear along its same path but the last time it did it, the object moved very quickly in a flash.  So fast I thought there were 2 objects and then it disappeared not to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the hour since it happened there are a lot of planes circling around this area.

I watched it from my front steps for quite a while noticing that the planes or jets seamed to be flying in a big circle around the object. slowly it moved further and further away with the planes or jets in tow.  it then changed its direction to the west and slowly went out of sight along with the airplanes or jets. then about twenty minutes too a half hr later I stepped outside to see if I could see anything and I noticed there was a lot of planes or jets in sight again.  I looked to the east and saw the light again this time traveling very fast speeding to the north west along with all of the airplanes or jets traveling with it well behind heading roughly in the same direction this time there was many more planes or jets then there was the first time i had seen it.  it went out of sight very quickly this time within a minute and all the planes did to. then the sky was clear and i didn&#39;t see more then one or two planes in the next half hr. which was probably normal traffic<n>

The speed was much faster that what you see from a normal airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time I saw the sphere changed altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other colors or blinking lights. It was a constant orange glow.<n>

I was driving home from work just after 2am when I noticed something in the sky just ahead.  As I began to look closer, I could tell that, in fact, it was 3 objects, fairly close together.  They were all the same red/orange color, with no flashing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the objects was much larger than the other two.  I could not tell if that was caused by more distance or not. all these objects were moving slowly toward the southwest.  The two smaller appearing objects were on different trajectories from each other as well as the larger one.  I stopped my car beside the road and got out to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the larger object was continuing on its slow path when suddenly, the two smaller objects began to make seemingly erratic movements.  What seemed even more odd about this is that both would make their movements at the same time, start...stop...start...stop, very quickly and instantly at what seemed to be random directions.  After a few seconds of this action, the two smaller ones just blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the larger object continue on, and then jumped back into my car and tried to follow along the same direction, but the mountains and trees blocked my view.  I did not see any more action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time in my view was probably around 6 to 8 minutes.  I never did hear any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did make a photo on my cell phone, and it shows up as a light. No detail, but shows that SOMETHING was there.<n>

The duration was about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incident: I usually work a graveyard shift right next to the port of Long Beach, Ca.  It&#39;s fairly close to LAX and airplanes are constantly flying overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 0100hrs I was looking south at a 80 degree angle towards the pacific ocean when I saw what i thought was a shooting star.  It was clear night sky with no clouds.<n> <n><n> It had a distinct white and blue pulse that came down almost like diving into the ocean at a really fast speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen plenty of shooting stars in my life and this one did not fit the criteria.  What I thought was weird is that it did not came from the atmosphere, it started to light up around the average altitude the airplanes were flying through.  Another thing was it did not have a contrail most shooting stars have when they are burning through the atmosphere.  Which I though was odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really believed it was going to hit the ocean due to how close it got.  At about 1000-2000 feet right before it would&#39;ve made contact with earth it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This unidentified object was something I&#39;ve never seen before.  I could clearlt see the circular shape it had.<n>

They approached from the northwestern sky and began disappearing as they passed over Fordyce.  The entire light show only lasted five to ten minutes.  The lead orb was in place south of my rural town when my adult granddaughter called my attention to the light show in the sky.  One by one the lights went out as each orb reached near the  area where the lead white one was sitting stationery.  The sky was cloudless.<n>

The light seemed to gradually intensify slightly, and fade slightly, dissimilar to the flashing lights of typical aircraft.  This is what caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped for a few moments, approximately half a minute, and remained stationary.  It was far away, but I listened for helicopter sounds which I did not hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to begin moving away, as the light faded, and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds in the sky, but it seemed as though the light was below the clouds.<n>

The color was changing different hues of red and orange and would change brightness.  It then started moving very slow toward the south for about a minute and then turned and went east at a much faster speed directly away from me.  It then went out of view blocked by roof tops of the residential area. I could tell it was not very high, maybe a 1000&#39; feet because it went out of view quickly when it went easterly.  I waited about 3-4 minutes and it just reappeared again in the original location where I first saw it.  It could have been a different one because the first one was pretty far away to return this quick but I only saw one at a time.  I then ran back to the house which was about four houses away to get my 11 year-old daughter and my video camera.  We came back and it was g! one and waited about five minutes and the ball suddenly appeared again in the same easterly location where I first saw it.  I believe it was there but was just not lit. I attempted to video tape it but my dog was pulling on me and my camera does not have a view finder so you have to look at the monitor which was difficult to do.  I got a poor quality video of it thought. The ball then moved easterly again and the lights appeared to dim and then went out.  We waited about 5 minutes and did not see it again and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside my house up to the second story and looked easterly for about 10 minutes and did not see anything.  I figured whatever it was it was gone.  I left and came back about a minute later just out of curiosity and it was back directly across from my house at about a 60 degree angle and was very bright.  At the time, my daughter was on the telephone telling her friend who lives a short distance away, what we just saw and she told her it was back to go outside and look in the sky.  I ran outside with my kids and wife and started video taping.  The ball starting moving south and continued glowing and changing red and orange colors as if it was on fire.  It continued moving south at a slow pace stopping occasionally and dimmed and went black a few time for a few seconds and then the red came back.  It then moved quickly in a south easterly direction and then either the lights went completely out or sped away but I did not see it speed away, it was just gone or the lights went o! ut.  This viewing lasted about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the viewing, there was no noise and it was definitely not a plane because it would stop in its path and did not have flashing lights typical of an aircraft.  The whole sphere glowed and changed colors of red and orange.  I live over the flight path for the San Francisco Bay area and planes fly over at about 10,000&#39; but this sphere was at a much lower altitude.  I thought it may have been a balloon with some kind of light inside but it did not track a steady wind path and changed direction.  I have several videos of it and my daughter took a picture with her tablet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I called the Contra Costa Sheriff&#39;s Office to ask if anyone reported seeing lights in the sky and they had no reports.  I am also a police officer so what I&#39;m saying is what I saw.  Not saying it&#39;s extraterrestrial but it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Googled red lights over Discovery Bay and found two other incidents this year with similar sightings of a reddish orange hovering sphere.<n>

Found it kind of strange because they were very still and not moving.  They were suspended in the air.  It was dark a lot of stars in the sky; however these stood out like a sore thumb and they were suspended very close about maybe 20-30 feet above Tree level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter said mom do you see those lights. I said yes honey probably beacon lights or maybe a helicopter;  However as we observed the lights were not moving and weren&#39;t flashing they were about 8 to 9 of them in several angles and were very close.  There was no noise, no flashes, and they were not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom was in the passenger seat and I said mom, do you see the lights?  She said yes that&#39;s strange.  We arrived home dropped off my mother and my daughter and I returned to see if they were still there to make sure we were not losing our minds.  They were all gone.<n>

In order of my view I see the the intracoastal first, then the homes and then the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the rear of the homes I saw, rising from ground level a series of 6 large circular lights that were reddish orange in color.

Four black, or very darkly colored helicopters approached very quickly in an almost offset single file formation.  The bright headlight was on the front of the first helicopter, while the only light on the others were red colored taillights.  The three trailing the first helicopter were barely visible except for the taillights and portions of their shapes that could be seen when they passed over lighter/illuminated clouds.  They were flying south-east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that this is not an actual UFO sighting, but I could not find anything about this event online or in the news.  And I am uncertain where they would have been flying from or to..  I don’t know of any military installation nearby.

They were on the Ocean side of the highway. The first light was an airplane, but as we continued on the second and third lights appeared stationary and too close together to be aircraft.  The two lights were white and incandesent looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove past the lights, from the passenger side of the car, I watched as the closer light disapeared into the low cloud cover, and then the second light did as well.  I still wondered what they were, and was looking back toward where they had been a few seconds ago when one or both shot downward out of the clouds to the ground.  They did not fall to the ground but rocketed to the ground.  The only thing I have witnessed that was faster than the speed, is lightening.  The light/s created a broad zigzaggy trail visible for only a second.<n>

It got right over the top of a particular tree in my front yard.  The first photo taken was of the craft directly over the large tree, above my garden plot.  The sky was black and no craft could be seen, only the energy from it.  It was a circle of flaming fiery red that had a thin layer of emanating heat, bellowing around it that looked like delicate lace on the sides of the red fiery ball or flaming circle.  Another photo taken showed the fiery red circle with an almost white central section with 4 white lights.  It moved silently, looked to be about 4 feet in diameter and flat, then flew across the street, staying just above the trees.  You could feel the energy from it hitting your face and hands.  The after effects of this caused the hands to itch with the fingers turning reddish.  Then the craft appeared to detected our presence and started to fly off.  The craft accelerated quickly and left a trail of bright glowing blue.  Much like the color of the blue gas flame on your stove, but a little darker and almost florescent.  You could see the front of the blue image bending the air back, similar to photo&#39;s of projectiles like bullets going through the air.  Then it accelerated at a phenomenal speed, darting out of sight.  We&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, the observer thought he had a dream that 3 guys had been in his room, at least one coming in through the wall of his bedroom.  The next morning he had a horrible headache.  His camera was on his table, but the camera&#39;s chip was gone.  There were no photo&#39;s at all in the camera.  His journal book was still there, but all the pages for Saturday night had all been torn out.  Even though it gave him a headache, he tried to remember what seemed like a dream that Saturday night.  He said the men were handsomely dressed in black.  He drew a picture of the object they put on his head.  It resembled the shape of the skull cap priest use to wear.  Four little arms stretched out similar in shape to the priest&#39;s skull cap with spherical lights at the ends.  On top was an attached rectangle box.  The spherical lights, light up and he said could feel his body get real warm.  Then as they left, the leader was last and just before he vanished, he turned his head back, smiled and said, you&#39;ll be fine!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sunday, he had no memory of anything about Saturday and the strange craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the photo&#39;s taken were gone and all the pages he wrote about the event were missing.<n>

We had just seen a really long, bright meteorite and were hoping for more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden she sat up and exclaimed, &#34;What IS that??&#34;  I looked in the direction she was looking, approximately West, and caught movement immediately with my peripheral vision.  As we watched it I went through a mental check list.  Too big and fast to be a bird. To fast and straight-flying to be a balloon.  Too silent and close to be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it gliding silently past our rooftop, looking as though it was basically flying down the street we live on, it was blocking out stars and we could clearly see an outline created by the lights below reflecting off of what looked like a grey or silver underbelly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had the impression that there may have been some barely-glowing lights along the trailing edge, perhaps four, but it was so dimly-lit that I can&#39;t be sure of that at all.

She held her two thumbs and index fingers up and made the shape of an obtuse isosceles triangle, which was exactly what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to accurately gauge size, speed and distance, but our impression was that it was less than 500 yards away, probably 20-30ft from wingtip to wingtip, and moving 20-50mph.<n>

We were on highway 93, heading north just through Wickenburgh, Az, just past where the 60 turns into highway 93 (Around mile marker 171)  We saw a big single bright orangish/gold light in the sky - it caught our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, off to the left hand side [11 o&#39;clcok position in the horizon] - the one light horizontally multiplied into 3 and then 5 lights [very much reminiscent of the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; back in 1997 - but on a much smaller scale] and back to 1 and then ~ disappeared.  It happen again 30 seconds later off to the right-hand side [1 o&#39;clock position of the horizon].  Again, the 1 multiplied into 2, then 3, then 5 lights - back to 1 and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time my husband ((name deleted)), and I were really excited about what we saw so my 9 yr. old daughter, ((daughter&#39;s name deleted)), in the back seat was wanting to see it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment we decided try to find a place to pull the car off to the side of the road, hoping to  capture it on video.  While she was also looking out the window it happened one more time off to the far left side of our vehicle, probably the 9 o&#39;clock position on the horizon.  Unfortunately by the time we found a place to pull the truck over, the lights had vanished and didn&#39;t appear anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, we did see &amp; hear two incredibly fast move military jets moving in tandem in the sky.  We knew they were military because of the rate of speed, and the unmistakable roar they make.  They tore through the sky directly above where the lights had been and continued on south out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, it was over.  ((husband&#39;s name deleted)) and I looked for the next mile marker after we started down the road again and it was no. 190.  I am a nightly Coast to Coast listener so naturally I knew to notate all of these details so I could submit a report to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was our own personal &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; incident; which by the way we also saw back in 1997.  We were driving on the 202 Freeway at the time and observed the lights hanging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anway, that&#39;s our story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ((name deleted)) Phoenix, Az<n>

It was not moving.  We both said something about it to each other and immediately decided to exit as soon as possible to get closer towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This purple ball of light was only about 150 feet in the air.  As we came closer to it, we were about 300 feet away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we pulled over we noticed that it was three lights in a triangular formation and it started moving erratically, changing from white to purple.  My wife started to walk as close as she could before it shot straight down to the open field and then the purple light had vanished.  We thought it was gone so we continued driving down another road and that’s when I realized that it shot back up into the sky with the same purple triangular shape.  We then pulled over a second time into the actual neighborhood that we saw it hovering over. It was then that I decided to start recording.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was doing flips and moving from left to right repeatedly and it appeared as though it was flat.  Soon after another car driving down the road stopped and said that they noticed it hovering in their backyard and thought it was just some type of toy which couldn&#39;t be true because we saw it from the highway from a distance.  We continued to record and that’s when we decided to go in a little closer into the neighborhood.  As we drove down the street the object was completely gone, again, for the second time.  This is strange because the two times we tried moving in on it-it had disappeared.  This was the last time which we saw this object.<n>

It slowly kept moving in an Easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approx. 3-4 minutes, the light then faded away.  As I stared at the light, it appeared to pulsate slowly.  The light appeared to have a snowflake like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later, another light almost identical to the first one appeared and moved in the same manner as the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I noticed a 3rd bright light at approx. 120 degrees that seemed to be more white in color.  That light appeared to move slowly in my direction and then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That light lasted about  1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live within the flight path of the Boston/Manchester airport and am very used to seeing airplanes and I am quite confident that these were definitely not airplanes.  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

The first time I thought it was the light from a jet, but realized it was not later due to the motion.  I can clearly see this off my porch and tonight I can hear some people a street over out appearing to be looking up at it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my cell phone the 2nd time, but on video play it looks like a bright light in the sky.

I come here often and it was like nothing I or my boyfriend had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a flare, but it seemed to not be moving for some time (maybe 3 minutes) and then I thought it might be a ship on fire because that was the only thing that made sense and also because there seemed to be a haze around the lights... but the two orange fire looking balls never combined like a fire would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we notice they had gotten closer and were moving south and they were not in the water at all but floating about 50 feet above the water and horizon, moving faster than I have ever seen anything move.  They were defiantly two different things, but flying very close to each other. It was like something I have never seen before, and my boyfriend too.  There was no white, green or red light like typical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got faster and closer one flickered and just disappeared and the next orb followed suit within 3-4 seconds and that was it.

Each light was a individual light .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a hang glider pilot , and watching the movement , it looked like birds with a very high power ball of light attached.  At one moment the cluster turned into a column gaining altitude.  The show was amazing. Cars pulling off the road everywhere.  The main cluster moved to the west at about 1500 ft agl now and was out of sight towards the coast.  There was a few ball of lights on there own maybe half a mile behind the main group and trying to catch up.  I have never seen anything like it.  My best guess is some kind of a experiment. I think the lumen s of the lights was very high, very bright .  I am doing all i can now to find out what it was.  Amazing to say the lease.<n>

It was about 7 to 7:30pm.  My Wife, my three sons had left our home in Lake Elsinore and were heading to camp Pendleton to go camping with family for the weekend.  We were heading south on the I-15 approaching exit to HWY 74 and I was on speaker phone with my brother asking for directions when I noticed a line of lights in the eastern sky approaching from a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I began to mention them to my wife, the freeway came to almost a complete stop adjacent to the outlets mall.  People were pulling over on the sides of the freeway and as we crawled forward I could then see that the lights I saw were part of stream of lights crossing over the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over on the side of the freeway, and stepped just out of my vehicle, directly under the stream of lights.  The lights flashed but to me they seemed almost holographic.  Bluish-white sphere shaped approx. four to six feet in diameter (seemed to vary in size and distance)  The nearest ones to us were about 100 above us at their lowest point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved they seemed to flutter around almost like a group of butterflies, but in a deliberate direction; west.  When they flashed I could almost make out a silhouette of something inside the light orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up, describing the scene to my brother on the phone, my wife yelled, &#34;Oh my God, there are hundreds!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned towards the west and saw a huge swarm of them over Lake Elsinore that the stream seemed to be dumping into.  I hung up with my brother and called my neighbors, who went out to see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called my best friend, who went out and saw the lights as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I got back in my vehicle.  I wanted to take HWY 74 and follow the objects, but at this time my wife and children became very afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we decided to continue south, the long way so as to avoid the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife has some phone footage as well as my neighbors.  These things didn&#39;t seem to be aircraft, or spacecraft. they seemed organic, or alive, so to speak.<n>

The 3 lights were round and very bright, also somewhat large looking at them, and they formed a triangular position.  We all seen it and couldn&#39;t explain it.  We kept driving, and it disappeared when we looked back.  I go down that road everyday and always look in that area of the field, and have never found any other explanation for what we seen.

It was a hazy rainy early afternoon and we were cruising through Qutang Gorge towards Chongqing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was aiming my compact Lumix Panasonic camera on the red structure perched on the mountain side and decided to take some shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unknowingly, I captured an UFO by accident.  I was not aware of it until when I sort out my digital shots much later after returning home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On close examination, I believed that it is an UFO of an enormous size as compared to the red structure and the two peaks in terms of scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cannot be a sun flare or lens reflection as the background  mountains were misty and the shot was taken on an open ship deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cannot be a speck of dirt too as the circular craft looks lighted in yellow and huge in size.  There were no people present on the ship deck as it was raining. What sort of object is it remains a mystery. I am looking for a plausible explanation .<n> <n><n> <n><n> More details:  The shot was taken with a 24mm leica lens 3.8x zoom compact camera from the open ship deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area where the UFO appeared was a secluded  and an isolated region near the Qutang Gorge with no people found along the river bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no possibility of other planes found in the area as it is a moutainous region and risky to manoeuvre at low attitude.  It was also a hazy rainy afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The enormous object seem to be moving a very high speed as the next few photos  taken within second, were without the object.<n>

Just as I was about to point it out to my daughter I saw it move slightly upward and shoot into the clouds, disappearing very rapidly.  My daughter had seen the whole thing too.

Driving slowly down my road:  county road 24 I saw a bluish white light flashing over the hill coming from the north.  It flash about 4-6 times in about 90 seconds.  the next day my friend told me he saw the same thing at the same time, before I even told him about my experience.<n>

(in off chance i get to see a supernova).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking west from OSU campus i seen 3 objects flying straight south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i thought it was birds but the speed was way to fast and constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (was over 2x the speed of a commercial passenger plane) Also thought it might be some airplane but the shape of the formation, speed, and zero noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While flying straight south 2 of 3 lights (more like glow) where on the west side of formation like a triangle pointing east but its flying south.<n>

I noticed several(at least20) fireball like lights descending from the sky.  At first I thought they were stars. But they were orange and moving.  They all moved in formation. They were like a flock of birds. I watched until they all went below my fence line.  But then 3 of them ascended and got smaller until they disappeared. Then 1 more did the same.  And 1 at a time, they all did the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a little on my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.<n>
