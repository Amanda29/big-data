The light seemed to be moving in a more side to side manner than I have ever observed of a flare before. The light soon moved at an angle down, and to the north. I cannot be certain of wind conditions in that area, but there was a slight easterly breeze in San Timoteo canyon. The light also changed its color or tint from a more orange to a red as it moved down and to the north. I attempted to gain a better visual of the light using my telephoto lense on my digital camera, and managed to get a few photos of a rather unsatisfactory quality. I did not have a tripod, but I attempted to use the door of my truck. We lost sight of the light at around 00:05 on Sunday.<n>
6/30/07 23:30|Vaudreuil (Canada)|QC|Light|8 seconds|Unidentified Aerial red,blue,green lights seen in a cloud over Vaudreuil,Quebec near Montreal|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57641.html|2|ndxe200706| Unidentified Aerial red,blue,green lights seen in a cloud over Vaudreuil,Quebec near Montreal<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to Report an unidentified aerial phenomenon. On June 30,07 I witnessed along with a friend a very strange light emanating from a cloud near my house in Vaudreuil, Quebec within a few kms from Montreal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me start by saying I am very experienced with auroras (been tracking them for years) I am also an amateur astronomer, I have experience with aircraft and flight and have a sound knowledge of weather. What I saw along with my friend that night I cannot explain. I ruled out lights from a plane, fireworks, auroras, lightning and static discharge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11:30 pm, we just finished looking at the moon through my telescope and I was looking out at the night sky when I saw this cloud southeast from my home, it looked close and had just been over the house so I know it was a low cloud by the speed it was travelling. I thought it was pretty against the light of the almost full moon. All of a sudden, the cloud turned red with a little orange tint then pulsed to blue and then changed to green. It lit up the whole cloud telling me that whatever was creating this light was big. The light lasted about 4 seconds and turned off. I then yelled to my friend to come see what I just saw and miraculously the light re-appeared just in time for her to see it. The second view also lasted about 4 seconds and pulsed from red with orange tint to blue to green almost mechanically. Having seen it twice and having the same light pattern rules out a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been pondering coming forward for a while now but decided it was the right thing to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They seemed to travel in a large triangular trail almost around the moon.  We were only able to see two at a time.  One came above the trees while one seemed to speed up and exit the atmosphere.  They kept this up for about 30 minutes and eventually disappeared.<n>
6/30/07 23:00|Lac de la Sucrerie, Vendee (Canada)|QC|Unknown|15-20 minutes|I noticed a bright light on the northern horizon over Lac de la Sucrerie (46 degrees 07 minutes 00.23seconds North, 74 degrees 54 minut|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68387.html|4|ndxe200706| I noticed a bright light on the northern horizon over Lac de la Sucrerie (46 degrees 07 minutes 00.23seconds North, 74 degrees 54 minutes 11.88 seconds West) that I thought was a star, however it started to get brighter and bigger after a few minutes of staying still.  After a few more minutes the “star” began to lower and fluctuate in intensity.  This is when I realized it was a UFO.  As it got closer I could see a red and greenish glow under the object, which by now was moving slightly erratically left to right, up and down.  At this point it was in front of the mountain, about 50 feet above the lake, and about 1 kilometer in front of me.  It just stayed there, silently hovering above the lake for a couple of minutes, and then slowly rose back into the sky, and further behind and above the mountain until it was looking once again like a bright star, like venus looks like. The light grew with intensity, and then faded.  This happened a few times until it disappeared.  About half an hour later, I went back outside to see if it was there, and I felt a sort of vibration that vibrated the whole cottage, and even the ground, (kind of like an earthquake, but more of a vibration than a shaking), which was followed immediately by a sound high overhead like a fighter jet would make, but not quite as loud.  Unfortunately I did not have my video camera because I forgot it at home!  It would have been one of the best UFO videos ever!  I’m so sorry I forgot it!<n>
6/30/07 23:00|Terrell|TX|Triangle|5 to 10 seconds|Triangular object might have been new Stealth technology.  But who's?|1/5/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79056.html|5|ndxe200706| Triangular object might have been new Stealth technology.  But who&#39;s?<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2007, I was in my backyard talking to my husband, it was late at night.  It’s been my habit to check out the sky, especially since my first sighting in the 60’s.  But this one was totally different from that sighting which occurred sometime between the years of 1967-1969.  I pulled up a chaise lounger and as I got comfortable, something caught my eye on my left side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you know how when you’re driving and it’s a very hot day?  Sometimes the road ahead of you in the distance appears as if waves are coming off the road.  The waves are kind of invisible but you can see them almost moving, shimmering.  It’s hard for me to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked to my left, I saw a triangular shaped object, if you could call it that.   I say this because there wasn’t a solid object that you could see.  The only way that I know how to describe what I saw that night is to say it was a triangular shaped object and it appeared as if you could see right through it.  The entire triangular shape was moving across the night sky much like an airplane flies across the sky (but not that fast), and it wasn’t flying flat like you’d expect.  It was flying where I could see the entire triangle shape (facing me) so I guess you’d say it was on its side.  The pointed tip was pointed towards the southwest and that was the direction it was flying.  Its flight path would have been from the East to the Southwest.  Under other circumstances, you’d have to be directly under an object to see that it was a triangle shape, and if your level of sight was from the side, it might have appeared to be a flat object,  in other words, it would have lost ! its triangle shape to your view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object appeared like those shimmering heat waves, so I was able to make out a distinct triangular shape against the clear night sky.  But, I could see stars within the waves.  I don’t know if it was a reflection or if I was seeing them through the object.  I’m surprised that I even saw it at all, but I did.  It was moving at a steady pace and it was in my vision for at least 5 to 10 seconds.  By the time I realized what I was seeing and told my husband to look, it was gone out of my sight and moving towards town where there were more lights and that would have made it almost impossible to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if these sightings are our own government, another countries government or from another planet.  I guess it could even be some rich guy conducting his own experiments.   Maybe one day we’ll all know the answer.  But, I hope it’s a stealth technology of our government because just the thought of it is a little scary and pretty cool indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the woman who submitted this report, and she sounded to us to be an exceptionally objective and credible witness.  She indicates that the sighting occurred sometime during the summer of 2007.  PD))<n>

My 13 year old daughter and I were enjoying a bonfire and I had gone into the house for a moment to check on my younger son.   As I opened my slider to walk onto the deck I saw a bright redish-orange oblong or rectangular object in the North Western sky.  I asked my daughter to come up on the deck and she saw it too.  It was much lower in the sky than Venus and there was a full moon that night.  We watched the object move from left to right, and then the object was stationary for about 10-15 seconds.  There were no blinking lights, and no sounds so I was certain it was not a plane.  After about 10 seconds of it hovering, the object appeared to be getting smaller and appeared to go away from us until it was just a red speck in the sky.<n>

Yellow-orange flame like light however very large for something  moving so fast.  They were below cloud cover at first but one after the other they elevated above the clouds.  The whole episode lasted about ten or fifteen minutes. As soon as one disappeared into the clouds the next came to follow it in thesame flight pattern. No sound very, very eerie.<n>

At this time me and him were freaking and we went back into the truck and we watched for what seemed like hours, and the ships left in a streak of speed and when we looked at the clock it was 10:15, I guess when you are freaking out time passes alot slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One object appeared to have two lights that toggled back and forth.  Since distance could not be ascertained, I assumed that the lights came from a single object. The lights were white and moved together, slowly, toward the south. Further south, there was a single point of light that appeared to be a separate object.  That light was larger and brighter.  Briefly, a large flare (also white) seemed to follow the object. Although the flare implied speed, as if it were a tail of a comet, the object appeared to be moving slowly. The flare went away after a few seconds.  The objects slowly faded away as I watched them. They remained white and slow moving.  I attempted to shoot a video with my iPhone. The objects are visible but only as a very tiny speck against a black sky.  The lights appeared to be the height that a jet might fly but I had no way to estimate their size, distanc! e, or speed.  I heard no sound other than my dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/07 20:00|Waterford|PA|Cigar|4 minutes|((HOAX??))  my grandmother reported seeing a silver cigar shaped flying object over her country home…|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61994.html|14|ndxe200706| my grandmother reported seeing a silver cigar shaped flying object over her country home...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a grandson of my grandmothers. I don&#39;t ((fool)) around, and i&#39;m not one for wasting my time on time consuming websites like this one here. Anyhow... my grandmother is very religous and doesnt believe in hokus pokus ufo&#39;s nor aliens, or whatever the hell propaganda spotting of ufo&#39;s people of the world conjure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand i do, but im not one to let my mind run off in a frenzy over the thought, that hey, maybe we&#39;re not the only ones around. I believe in energy, positive and negative...<n> <n><n> <n><n> im not religous in any aspect, i only believe in what i believe, which is energy, and what is plasma, im liviing now and it is good, and if i die tomorrow, then oh well, as i must have served my purpose, we all die eventually, so death to me is just a new birth, a breakdown of molecules: evaporating, condesating, and mixing to form another form of some other kind of form: elements of the universe, something i think scientist&#39;s will never grasp, nor understand. I&#39;m not trying to sound nuts, I just go deep, and i don&#39;t care what anyone thinks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But last summer of 2007, my fiance and I went to visit my grandmother, like we do every sunday. It was late, like 7:30- 8, im pretty sure but dont take my word for it. She was in the kitchen, drinking coffee, we were there for about forty-five minutes and she said oh man! did I tell you... I took ((child&#39;s name deleted))  (who was only a year old at the time) outside to show her the stars when she pointed up and made a noise. She said (grandmother):There was this long silver cigar-shaped thing floating over the house, and it was moving very,very slow, and I stood out there for not even five minutes, when it disappeared over the tree lines. I got excited... and every now and then I think about that, so thats why I jumped online to try and figure this out or get some answers:spite of curiousity...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been into the stars because it fascinates myself, i always wonder what might be out there, i&#39;ve always felt trapped here on earth, and if i was filthy rich, id probab ly build something, to get away and to see the beautiful outside, even if i starved to death on my way to everywhere, at least i would die with a glimps of what i always have wanted to venture on into. Im not crazy, im just passionate, and i express my passion when i speak, or write, like ive just done. So you can take this as a complete hoax, and ill probably take u guys as complete assholes, seriously. U should check this out. If u want me to leave my name, and my grandmothers name and address, fine. that&#39;ll be no problem with me. Oh, for information, just so u know: she lives on 64 acres of land, i guess she lives in the valley of a small &#34;moutain&#34; or a really big hill, anyhow she&#39;s above sea level, compared to the actual city of erie. And on another note: When my mother was a little girl, maybe 5- or 6, her and her sister dissapeared into those woods, from the beginning of daylight to the dropping of it, my grandparents found them sitting talking into the air, to themselves. till this day my mom will tell you, that there was a large rock like thing floating right above the ground, and they were talking to eat, having a conversation with it, but she doesnt remember what it was about. to break this down even further: my mom is 46 years old now, and she&#39;s very cool, she&#39;s into these crystals or whatever the hell they are, her plants, and she&#39;s very spiritual on an energynote. her husbands an electrical engineer at g.e., and when it comes to those kind of things, he thinks shes pretty much nuts. you&#39;ll have to get ahold of her. like face to face. it&#39;s interesting. anyhow, i think ive said entirely way to much. so how the hell do i get ahold of you people, if a... i cant leave any info. about anyone, or myself? whats up with that? oh, and im not a treky or whatever the hell u call those freaks. im just a normal dude who thinks to! much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Me and my friend were watching a movie in my room.  My friend went to the window to have a cigarette and noticed a blackish object in the sky. He said it was very still when he first saw it but when I came over to look at it it moved very fast to my left. By the time I got my phone out to take a picture it had already moved half way across my window. It paused for a second a couple of times and seemed to drop down and then come back up into sight almost right away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped kind of like a triangle and was a dark metallic color. It didn&#39;t reflect the sun or glow or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was 2007, June 30 around 6:30 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think we were pretty close to it but I couldn&#39;t hear any sounds like I&#39;d expect a plane to make. I&#39;m not sure how fast it was moving I&#39;d guess that it was definitely faster than any airplane I ever saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologizer for the low quality of the photographs. The only camera we had was my cell phone and it was moving too fast for me to catch it in the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took these pictures, it disappeared behind the red building you see in the left corner of the pictures so I couldn&#39;t get another shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a diverse variety of cloud formations on the horizon and clouds were passing overhead.  The Southeastern sky was clear and blue except for some very shear cirrus clouds to the Northeast.  The conditions were very good: light Southerly winds, low humidity, excellent visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was starting to look Southeast when suddenly a bright light caught my eye.   I thought at first that it was a high flying plane reflecting the noon day sun.  There were several flashes of light that moved in a Northeastern direction in a nearly flat trajectory.  I saw a bright white spherical object traveling at a speed that can only be described as impossibly fast.  It appeared seemingly out of thin air and I was somewhat startled by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went from a high speed to slowing down and as it moved across the sky, it looked like it either flew into, or behind the cirrus clouds.  It also had an aura that became more pronounced when it interacted with the high level clouds.  It stopped for moment and then disappeared.  It happened very quickly, but I got a good look at it.  A strange feeling came over me as I realized that I had never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To further describe: I was sitting at sea level and I was looking skyward 45 to 50 degrees from the Southeast horizon.  It appeared as a bright light that also flashed a few times.  It looked like it was at a very high altitude, which would mean that what I saw had to be of substantial size.  It moved a good distance in what could have been no more than a second or two.  The spherical shape became more apparent when it slowed down, however it was still moving quickly.  When it stopped, it remained stationary momentarily, then it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was with me when this happened.  I tried to point it out to her, but she only got a glimpse of it.  It all happened so quickly, but the image is very clear in my mind.  I have no idea what this was, but I would love to hear an explanation.<n>

I was looking out a second-floor window of my house when I noticed a strange craft floating lazily across the sky.  It was orange, and looked like a blimp with the cockpit and tailfins removed.  It was huge - actually about the size of a blimp, but again with some features removed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This coupled with the fact that I have never seen any sort of zeppelin in my area before, made it clear that this was no craft I knew about.  I could see it for about two minutes before it was obstructed from view by my neighbors&#39; house.  It reappeared on the other side and eventually disappeared from my window.  No other strange phenomena was seen while observing the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was not a weather balloon, cloud, rocket, bird, or other explanable phenomenon.  It did not flicker, or appear to move, there was no apparent motion, trajectory, or drift.  It hovered for about 5 min.  Another observer independently verified what I saw.   A  similar  object with a distinct greenish tint  appeared from the right (east) and approached the original silver one, on an intersecting course, and then narrowly avoided it, and proceeded to turn &#34;around&#34; it in a clockwise arc.  I cannot estimate the size or distance, but comparison with passing aircraft indicated that this was VERY high.  After about 10 min it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected.  PD))<n>

It was circular and had lights all around it and was moving around all over the flace quite fast and erradicly and flying pretty low. We thought it disappeared for a minute and then it appeared right above us and I when I looked up I could see that it was silver and had lights circling it and was fairly big. It looked like any cheesy UFO you&#39;d see in a movie and I couldn&#39;t believe it was right above us!!! There were about six other people on the sidewalk that saw it too and we were all just staring up in amazement. My friend got scared and wanted to leave, so we drove away before we got to see where it went next. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before in my life and there&#39;s no way it could be anything else BUT a UFO!!!<n>

I first responded it looks to be the dig dipper but then look again and said they were too bright to be the big dipper. I said to him maybe its fire works. At that time we were only a minute away from the sighting. When I got there I got out of my car and stared at them for about 20 seconds until one of them finally moved out of sequence.The objects were round and the colors of the sun orange and white.I would say they were about 3 to 4 times bigger than the north star about like a 25 watt round bulb From my distance.There were six of them. I was about 200 feet from the objects. I would say they were about 50 feet to about 100 feet from the ground. The second lowest object moved east a few feet then moved rapidly west and out of site within 5 seconds .when the second moved west the other five objects moved directly upward and were out of site in a couple seconds .This all occurred west of Netune, Ohio above a corn field.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was going past Denny&#39;s a restraunt traffic was moving 5 feet per 2 minutes. I saw a Fenced area grass big field with a fence that says do not enter. Traffic started to started moving faster. I saw about 4 cop cars and a firetruck next to the fenced area that says do not enter. I saw all the police standing by the fence like they were scared to enter because it said do not enter. what I saw beyond that fence was a huge circle of burnt grass and smoke going in the air like some type of craft landed there. I drive back the next day and all the land is now cement parking lot that looks like it has been there for years like they changed the land or something. But the do not enter sign is still there on the fence. The land has changed. Unless I am going crazy or the Thing that landed there playing mind games with me showing me that it can chang land on how it looks to mess with me but you will never have proof of that. I told my boss at work I saw a perfect circle of smoke in that field &amp; a do not enter sign. I saw a grassed area on fire and now it is gona and turned into a do not enter parking lot and the parking lot looks like it has been there for over 50 years. I swear what i saw looked like a crafted landed ina a grass area now the grass area is gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As i lit my cigarette and casually smoked it i glanced into the sky.  There was a star shaped light that was illuminating brighter then anything else in the sky.  The reason i found this odd was because about a week earlier i saw something very similar with two of my friends.  The light was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.  If it were an airplane i would have seen some sort of red and blue lights ( as in safety hazard lights) which were not seen.  The light will slowly weave though star formations and will gradually decrease in illumination until it finally disappears.  I was amazed and bedazzled, which made me stay outside and watch the skies.  I was kindly rewarded with this ufo returning again following the exaxt same pattern.  If ANYONE can give me ANY kind of explanation please do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

6/28/07 23:00|Myrtle Beach|SC|Light|5-10 seconds each occurre|Red/orange lights over ocean appearing, moving horizontally, then disappearing|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57395.html|33|ndxe200706| Red/orange lights over ocean appearing, moving horizontally, then disappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> While on vacation, my wife and I both saw unidentified red and orange lights over the Atlantic Ocean from the beach and the balcony of our hotel room in Myrtle Beach, S.C.  We observed these lights June 24, 26, 27 and 28, 2007, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. (the one night exception we were not outside at night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights didn&#39;t appear in precisely the same spot, but were always about the same height (roughly 30-40 degrees above the horizon). They were red (more so earlier in the week) to a reddish-orange (more so later in the week). I would estimate the size to be larger and brighter than Mars; they were large enough that they had appeared to have a round shape to them, but weren&#39;t orbs, per se.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared in different numbers; there was always at least two, and at least once there was five. The lights would come into view, sometimes one at a time, sometimes almost simultaneously, and move on a horizontal plane (maybe with a very slight downward arc) either in the same direction or in opposite directions before fading out nearly simultaneously after 5-10 seconds. Generally, the lights would appear one at a time or almost in pairs, and move apart from the center, although it wasn&#39;t always symmetrical, and they didn&#39;t always disappear at the same instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared often in the same general location, but they would also appear at different spots. Once, the lights appeared in their “usual location,” then reappeared no more than two minutes later quite a distance away (20-30 degrees). We saw the lights more than once each night, probably as many as 5-6 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The particular nights we saw these lights, the moon was working its way toward full and there were few clouds, so the sky was quite bright, making it more interesting that these lights showed up so brightly. It was impossible to judge their distance, but it felt like they were distant; the fact that the moon was bright would mean these lights would have to be fairly bright to get through the light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeing as how were at the ocean and in a hotel with dozens of humming air conditioners, there was no sound connected to the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our hotel was beachfront, located on Ocean Boulevard more or less across from 27th Avenue South. We also saw the lights as we walked along the beach, and once heard someone near us say something to the effect of “Look at the airplane!”  As for possible explanations of the lights, they were certainly not airplanes. The airport was near our hotel, and we observed a number of planes taking off. But the lights appeared and disappeared randomly, and moved in different directions. We thought they could be signal flares, and since I&#39;m not a nautical type, I&#39;m not sure how such a thing works. However, I would expect signal flares to move up, not slowly horizontally, and not in different directions. Also, I don&#39;t know far away you could see signal flares. The color and intensity of the lights would remind you of fireworks viewed at fairly close range, but they didn&#39;t wink out quite like fireworks, instead seeming to fade from view. Additionally, they didn&#39;t “twinkle” the way a star does; instead, they were steady while they lasted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for other incidental notes, there were a number of military fighter jets taking off from the nearby airport each day, but these always took off during the daytime and usually turned inland, so I don&#39;t think they were addressing the lights in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for background, I am an editor/graphics person and my wife a high school teacher. I&#39;ve never claimed to have seen a UFO, but I was indeed a big fan of the X-Files, so you can make of that what you want.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They reappeared a second time about 15 minutes later in the exact same place.  We walked over the dunes to the beach and saw other strange clusters of lights in different locations throughout the sky that were much smaller or distant. The other lights would pulse sometimes in diagonal patterns or seemingly random clusters.  Some seemed to move or dart around while others seemed stationary. A military jet flew over the area then returned to wherever it came from. The orange lights reappeared a third time after 30 to 40 minutes with a very dramatic simultaneous pulse in two very distinct &#34;cigar&#34; shapes comprised of about 6 to 8 lights each.  A seemingly dramatic decrease in the temperature of the onshore breeze (could have been nervous chills) also occurred at roughly the same time.  Just after this final pulse, the activity of the other &#34;satellite&#34; lights increased significantly and then pretty much stopped after about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a number of people watching on the beach with us, one person actually made a video recording of the event.  He told us that they had witnessed these lights for three nights in a row occurring roughly ten o&#39;clock at night.  They were definitely not running lights on aircraft, weather balloons, flares, optical illusions, fireworks, or anything else that we could think of that could have created these lights.  I personally found the their appearance to be like the phosphorescence of a firefly or jellyfish, and not like the light from a bulb or something burning.  I hope the other people who witnessed this event will also report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our cabin is situated on top of a smaller mountain so that when looking out our sliding glass door the lights were even with us.  My first reaction was thinking someone put up a lift with largr orange lights on it.  Then the lights moved up the mountain and into the night sky.  One moved off quickly and the other 3 formed a triangle over the mountain.  They held that position briefly, then took off quickly one at a time.  There was a white flash under each as they took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light visible with the naked eye appeared redish or green or orange at points. We tried to focus on the object from the telescope and it appeared to have a darkish center. I went and got my camera, a Canon 30D with an attached 70-200mm lens. I took some photos of the object and some of a bright star to compare. The photos certainly didn&#39;t match. I caught in photos the object changing shades of color, red, orange, green were three colors I captured. The object appeared to be disc like. I still couldn&#39;t get too close with that lens so I added an extender to the lens making it 400mm. I saw the object as cigar shaped lights, I thought it was camera shake, so I took pictures of a star again to compare, the star picture was circular this was not. I appeared the object was possibly facing sideways sometimes and other times the bottom or top of the object appeared visible. I couldn&#39;t myself beleive what I was seeing I would certainly be interested in an explanation. What led me to write here was that I saw a news report of a U.F.O. in London that was spotted by an airline pilot from 40-miles out, the pilot concluded the object was a mile wide. the shape of what I saw seems to be comparable so I thought I&#39;d share the sighting. The object was still visible when I came in to write this, I took well over 200 photos of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 9pm, I saw a very odd shaped black object hovering in the sky.  I grabbed my binoculars and saw a black, liberty-bell shaped object with no wings, no lights, no props...no apparent means of propulsion.  It was about the height that a traffic helicopter flies, and about the same size, maybe smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside and walked due North on Melrose Ave. just parallel to I-5.  The object was now North of downtown Seattle, over the University District.  I took a photo of it, but it was just a speck at this distance.  There was a couple on the street looking at it too, they were perplexed and fascinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it just drifted away.  During the entire sighting, this object floated silently, and slowly, in plain view of all Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Black. Moving slow. I grabbed a pair of binoculars, because something was weird about it. Figured it would be a helicopter, but seemed to high up. When I looked at it with the binoculars, it had no specific shape. It was blobish and I thought I made out protrusions. A large honey bee came to mind first. Watched it for 20 minutes. Must have been moving slow or was super high up. Lost it in the clouds. It was very cloudy. Jet black shape. I have a porch and watch planes and helicopters all the time and it didn&#39;t look like either. I&#39;m pretty skeptical of this stuff. But, this seemed off. Could have been anything.

It&#39;s a sound I&#39;ve heard before around the same time of day, so I began to look for the bird.  I think its some type of falcon, because the times I&#39;ve seen it its been very high and then will dive quickly and be out of site in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not find the bird, but I looked North (approx) at about a 75 degree angle and saw a very visable black line with what looked like a tail.  As I observed the object I realized it wasn&#39;t moving.  Looking a little longer I realized it was moving slowly backward, but was very very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then told my neighbor to look and she saw it and immediately said it was a plane as well.  Then she was surprised as well to see it was m0ving backward.  At this point I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars. Finding the object, It was clearly NOT airplane, balloon, or anything else I&#39;ve heard could be spotted.  It looked like a stick, with one end, shorter and turned upwards.  It had a slight bow in the long section.  As I watched it it moved slowly North East and then dissappeared from site.  At one point it changed shape from the previously described stick, to a full half circle or bow shape.  It could have been the angle I was seeing it from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There were 3 adults and 2 children in the adjacent yard. We all saw a silent, dark gray object in the sky, it looked like it was a few miles away, just above the tree line. It was worm shaped, it looked kind of like a para-sail. It seemed to have three sections that were fairly straight, but combined together to make a shallow downward facing C shape - the open part of the C facing the ground. At first I thought it was a balloon or a kite, but it didn&#39;t behave like either. I ran into the house to find a camera, when I returned, it had moved to a new position, and had become much fainter. I watched it gradually, over a period of 2 - 3 minutes, grow fainter and fainter, until it vanished. It was also growing darker at the same time. It may have simply vanished into some clouds, but it was starting to grow dark outside, so it was hard to tell if there were clouds that it could have disappeared into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture with my cell phone camera-you can see something there, but it just looks like a blurry smudge. I took some pics with a digital camera, but unfortunately, i couldn&#39;t figure out how to turn the flash off. I also took some video with the digital camera, but by that time, the object had grown very faint, and it was growing dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did see and hear an aircraft approach the same area at great speed. I was unable to tell what kind of aircraft it might be, but it sounded like a military jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That there is a image of what is called a perfect spiral. It is placed on the dry lake bed and is 100s of yards long. If I&#39;m not mistaken this is a mathematical image. The image is outlined by roads, but there seems to be no reason for these roads being there other then to produce the image. In this same area are two long runways that are also on the lake bed and are the same color and appearance as the dirt its self, yet they have lines marked in the middle of each. This would indicate that these runways are not temporary. Dirt would need to be maintained daily. This does not seem to be happening because if it was we could easily see this going on. Not to mention the huge amounts of dust and or water and water trucks that that would be needed to keep the dust down. Both of witch would be easily detected. All of this seems to indicate that these runways and spiral are made permanent. Also there is in place and active and serious security. Vehicles also still go in and out of the base.

It was really twinkling, that is why I noticed it. I tried to ignore it, but curiosity got the best of me, so about 15 minutes later I went back outside to see what the &#34;star&#34; was doing...that is when I noticed the red and white flashing lights that were moving around the sky as if they were planes circling while waiting to land at the airport. The airports are too far away from where I was to have been the case. So I stood and watched while they decided to take a flight pattern to the north from south, as they did the night prior. The red and white lights never stopped and I could see them at least 30-40 miles away. Then they came back, just like the night before, but 2 of them went east while the other one stayed south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog and I were on a walk earlier that evening and all of a sudden she got spooked, like I&#39;ve never seen her ever do before. She just started walking as fast as she could looking and sniffing for something, but it was an aimless chase. She finally settled down about 5 or so minutes into the chase. When we got home she wouldn&#39;t go near the front door and that is her post day in and day out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said before...I am baffled and would love some answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The moon was almost full and the sky was mostly clear during the sighting and turned cloudy shortly after.  It was around 10:30 p.m.  We were admiring the night sky when we saw 5 orange lights appear one by one.  They were huge lights, bigger than any passing planes and much larger than the biggest stars.  They lit up one at a time with out any trails around them and without moving.  They lit up from left to right in an upwards facing bow pattern one by one.  Once all five were lit they turned off one by one in the reverse direction.  The lights were well above the horizon and appeared to the left of the moon.  The formation was huge in length and at least twice the size of the moon in the night sky.  The whole thing lasted only a few seconds.  The moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no visible shape behind the lights.  We then watched the sky for around 15 minutes to look for anything else without luck.  After this we rushed down to the beach to see if we could walk around and see if anyone else was talking about the lights.  As we got out to the beach a low flying fighter jet rushed to the north along the shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, 6/27, we watched briefly for the lights but saw nothing.  On 6/28, we decided to sit out on the balcony at 10 p.m.  The moon, even fuller than the preceding nights, illuminated a partly cloudy sky.  At 10:08 p.m., as we were gazing out at the ocean,  the same large orange lights appeared in the sky, this time there were 4 and they were in a ‘/’ diagonal shape.  Again, the moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no viable shape behind the lights. So, upon seeing them again, we called for my fiancé’s brother and his mother to come outside onto the balcony with us.  We waited, looking at the sky, hoping to show them the lights.  Over the next 30 minutes or so they showed up again a few times, but only one or two at a time.  Their locations varied each time they appeared.  Then they appeared directly in front of us.  There were 4 and they were in a ‘-_-_’ staggered pattern.  Immediately after they turned off, they same formation appeared again slightly above and to the left of the first.  Then after a few minutes had passed, another formation appeared.  This one was three lights in a ‘/’ diagonal pattern.  It looked slightly further away than the first but it was still significantly bigger than any planes or stars.  A few more minutes passed and we saw what looked like a plane or fighter jet heading in the same northwards direction towards where the lights had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in college and my fiancé and I are science buffs in our free time.  We are very skeptical people and always look for logical explanations to every situation.  This was totally beyond our explanation.  There was NOTHING visible behind the lights.  Each time they appeared in plain view in the light of the moon.  There were no trails like with a meteorite and the lights were not moving.  They did not dim, they simply went out. They were much bigger than any known man made aircraft.  The lights left all 4 of us utterly speechless.  We did look again at the same time on 6/29 but we saw nothing out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My son pointed out a pintpoint light that was traveling accross the sky, it looked like a sattelite. It was moving about as fast as a satellite. Then it stopped for a moment, and changed course and slowly faded as it took an erradic course in the opposite direction it was going. It was not a firework or a plane. The night was very clear and it was much to high for a plane/helicopter, and nothing stops and changes directions like that. But it was a true UFO, meaning unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/26/07 21:30|Loganville|GA|Light|1 to 2 minutes|Bright White Light, Northeast Georgia|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57358.html|54|ndxe200706| Bright White Light, Northeast Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 26, 2007 at approximately 21:30, my wife and I saw a strange light travel across part of the sky, changing significantly in brightness before fading out.  Sky conditions were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning in the East-Northeast sky (from the point I first noticed it) at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, the light traversed almost 50 degrees, heading South-Southwest before fading out of sight near South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the light, the brightness appeared to be close to a magnitude 1 star.  Shortly after I made visual contact, it slowly (close to 10 seconds) increased in brightness until it was at perhaps a magnitude of -5, noticeably brighter than Venus in the West.  As soon as it began to brighten, I alerted my wife who was sitting with her back turned to the object.  She also witnessed the brightening, though a few seconds after I did.  I was bright enough that I did not even have to point it out to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaching maximum brightness, it returned to the initial brightness in about 5 seconds, then faded out of sight in the South about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.  The entire sighting lasted less than 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reaction that I was very exited about was that I had just seen the International Space Station showing off one of its “flare” phenomenon due to the new huge solar array briefly catching the sunlight.  However, the next day I researched sighting opportunities in my area for the previous night.  The ISS was supposed to be low in the West, heading in a Northerly direction, never reaching more than 20 degrees above the horizon.  This is not even close to what we saw.  I do not know of any other satellite that could produce a reflection that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on what I saw, I am certain it was not an airplane – its trajectory placed it opposite the sun, and the light we saw was a reflection of some sort and very likely not artificial, and there was no “flashing” – the light was purely white from our perspective.  There was also no trail behind it, so I also do not think it was a meteor skipping off the atmosphere, but I’m not positive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not suggesting anything extra-terrestrial.  It was just a strange phenomenon that I have never seen, and cannot explain as I have ruled out my most logical explanations.  Perhaps a rocket stage firing, but we don’t launch rockets from north of Georgia towards the south that I’m aware of, and as I stated before I believe only the ISS is large enough to be that bright and it was not in the vicinity of the sighting.  I’d love any other possible explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work professionally as a performance analyst and consultant.  I am also an amateur astronomer and a private pilot (though not current).  My wife is an optician.<n>

It moved in a northward direction, but was quite faint and I found it difficult to track the object’s movement. I watched the object for between 30 seconds and 1 minute. The security light was on by our garage (impeding my ability to track the object), and as the object continued moving southward, I lost sight of it.  I walked over to the outdoor light and unplugged it to see if I could locate the object again, and after approx. 1 minute, I located the object a second time (however, it could have been a second object, as I did lose track of this object for approx. 1 minute.  The object was now tracking southward at was moving at approximately the same speed.  From my position, the object was traveling at a trajectory that was in-between the moon (to the southwest) and what I assumed to be Venus (to the southeast) – it being the brightest “star” in night sky.  After tracking the star-like object for approx. 30 seconds, out of the corner of my eye I spotted a shooting star – to my left (east). The shooting star shot rapidly across the sky and then disappeared, and I continued watching the star-like object as it continued on its’ southward journey for approx. another 30 seconds (although it may have been longer – perhaps a 1 minute) before losing sight of this object – i.e. in total, the object took between 1 and  1 ½ minutes to travel  across the sky from its’ original north position to where I lost sight of it in the southern sky.  Note: I did not track the object all the way to a southern horizon position – instead, it seemed to grow fainter until reaching a point where the object was no longer in sight.  I went inside and told my wife what I saw, and then went back outside to see if I could locate the object a third time – however, the object did not ! reappear .<n>

It was about 10:30 at night. I am pretty sure it was June 25 (Monday).  All of a sudden I saw this large ball of blue light emerge just above the tree line and zip across the highway. It had a smaller blue light at the very end of it  - I would say both lights were more at the tips of the craft rather than on the underside of it. I also noticed vertical grooves (evenly spaced) on it as it neared the other side of the highway before disappearing over the trees. I am assuming it is cigar-shaped but from the angle I saw it at - although, it could have been saucer shaped. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I drove a little ways down to get a better view where there weren’t any trees. I could see all the way to the horizon. There was nothing there. It made no sense. I have traveled this road on many occasions and I am used to seeing planes fly overhead and I always like to look at them as they fly off into the distance. I couldn’t even see any lights or anything at all out there. It was as if it never happened.  Overall, I’d say I saw the craft for about 10 - 15 seconds, if that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was nightime and no clouds and I thought to myself that I can&#39;t remember ever seeing them to stars like that together.  So I looked back up and it was moving way too fast to be any jet or plane.  It was moving toward the star.  At the time I though it was just a plane but realized it was moving too fast so I looked back up and it was gone.  From the time I seen it to the time it dissappeared was about ten seconds.  I&#39;v seen meteors fly by before but this was slow but too fast to be a jet.  I thought a satalite was falling.  But now that I think about it I don&#39;t see the star that it was flying towards either.  I think the star dissappeared too.  Let me go outside and check if I can see the star that it was flying towards.  No, I don&#39;t.  This is wierd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seriously think that if that wasn&#39;t a meteor that it had to of been a u.f.o.<n>

As they drew nearer I realized they were some sort of aircraft. They were very black in color, no associated noise. They seemed to be floating. They were close, but I could not make out a definite shape, no lights (still daylight out). Their flight pattern was south to north, then back again. In route two of them switched positions. Their was one leader and 3 trialing behind, almost in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid sky watcher and always study aircrafts, I can&#39;t explain what these were...I am baffled.<n>

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before work, I was sitting out side when I felt light headed and dizy (it was about 110 out side) when I just happened to look up at the moon that was out during the day. It was bright and sunny with a few light clouds. I saw what appeared as a star. It flickered with no pattern and was sometimes very bright.I thought It was my dizyness but Another appeared and moved from the high southern sky to the east. It started out above the clouds and swooped below them. A jet was traveling near by and gave me a good idea of how fast it was going. The object was much further than the jet but was traveling much faster. More star like objects appeared and flew in different directions disappearing and reappearing, flickering and flashing. It seemed like they where reflecting the sun light cause no light can be seen in the daylight that brightly. There were no wings or noticeable shape. When it didn’t reflect the sun, it seemed to disappear. This I think would be something you wouldn’t see without light reflecting on it. I ran inside my office and grabbed some co workers. They laughed at me and asked what I was smoking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just pointed up and said look. They ALL 7 saw them and we stood staring and pointing for a good 15 mins. They were hard to see till your eyes adjusted to them in the bright Arizona sun. But everyone knew they where NOT any aircraft we knew of. I can’t say how many there where do to the fact they would disappear. But at least 5. The objects didn’t seem any bigger than a small plain or hellicopter.When they finally went away, they followed the fist one that took off to the east. Moving from the high mid sky to the horizon and out of sight in about 20 seconds!<n>

At first I thought it was a star. It was really far up, so it looked like a star, but it was super bright and it moved way too much. It was way too fast and far to be a helicopter or a plane, also I spotted a plane heading in it’s direction. The light zigzagged in the same general area for the whole time I watched it. I then glanced around the sky and directly to the west of this light was another light. It was up in the sky at the same distance and was also zigzagging in the sky. The lights were directly across from each other one to the east and one to the west at the same height.

Strange, loud, pulsating, humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 2:00AM CST when I heard the first noise of the craft. At first it sounded like a normal aircraft in the distance. However, as it got closer, it began to sound very different then a normal aircraft. It sounded kind of like a tornado in the distance. Almost like a &#34;hum&#34; as well; it was very soft. Then it got very loud, and had almost a &#34;pulse&#34; within the sound. It was so loud I could feel it in my mattress. I got up and approached my window to see what it was, but by the time I got there... It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I layed in my bed, and just assumed it was a normal aircraft. Then, at about 2:20AM CST, I heard the sound again in the distance. This time I was prepared and immediatley went to my window. I stared out there for a good 5 seconds. The &#34;hum&#34; got louder and louder. I kept starring... and saw nothing. No lights, nothing. Finally, in my peripheral, I saw a large, dark object sort of casually fliying across the sky. And I followed it through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flying relitively low, as well as slow. And it had no lights at all. Because the craft had no lights, it was very hard for me to distinguish shape. It was kind of triangular, but still had other characteristics... which I can not completely describe. I attempted to take a photo; however, due to the light, the craft simply looked like a dark &#34;smudge&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flying towards a nearby USAF base. Could it be a some kind of &#34;stealth&#34;? I do not know that much about planes. Even if it is an actual plane, though, why would it be flying so low? The base is close, but not that close. Also, why was it flying so slow? And why wouldn&#39;t it have any lights? And I&#39;ve NEVER heard a plane sounds like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of now... The craft has flown by many times, off in the distance. And I&#39;m a little nervous. I just would like to know what it is, if that&#39;s possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both noticed a light from the west, hazy, like seen through clouds, except most of the sky was clear, it was joined by another.  The one continued on in a fairly straight path and disappeared.  The second circled for nearly 2 minutes fairly irregularly.  My first thought was that it was a spot light aimed at the clouds, but there were so FEW clouds.  It didn&#39;t go in a perfect circle either, nearly in an oval, but not always the same.  It was very strange, and like nothing either of us has seen or even ever heard about.

We were sitting there enjoying the breeze.  All of the sudden, a white light appeared in the sky.  It was too high above the horizon to be &#39;on&#39; the ocean, so, it was in flight.  The light was either stationary, or headed directly towards us.  It suddenly moved to the south and disappeared.  There was no sound.  We thought it might have been a flare, but, it was a white light.  Also, a flare would have originated from the water and moved up then down, slowly.  About 1 minute later, we saw another white light, to the north of that general area, at the same altitude.  It appeared for about 2 or 3 seconds then disappeared.  We were shocked at what we had just seen and went in to get the video camera.  We are in our mid-30&#39;s and never seen anything like this, nor reported anything like this before.  We heard a news story on Fox about similar sightings there and thought maybe we should add our voices to the various reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know, in early 2000, there were reports from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution about a section of the continental shelf on the east coast showing signs of seperation off the NC/SC coast.

It had a blue light near center, the core was a vertical white light and the glow was star like off all edges, like fingers, not the normal star nor was it an obvious aircraft because of it not moving for such an extended period of time, and it appeared too large for an aircraft, and  it was west of us here in Sonoma, it looked like it was over the town of Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa area.   It was huge and the bright lights both blue and white were something to see extending so far out of the core.  It hoverred and the lights went from extremely bright to nearly dissappearing and back again.  The glow made it nearly impossible to be an airplane and was deffinately not a hellicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was it??

On the way home, I noticed a flying circular disk with bright lights on the bottom outer rim.   It was about 6-20 feet in diameter, spinning and hovering from side to side, less than 50 yards from the ground.  I was about 100 yards from the object when I noticed it and I froze.  My girlfriend asked me what was wrong, and I told her to turn around at the next street after we had passed it.  As we drove up the hill, I got a closer look and saw that there was blue and red lights spinning around the outer rim at about 1 revolution every 5 seconds.  I told my girlfriend to make a right into the &#34;Strawberry Farms Golf Course&#34; to take a closer look, but she refused and we had to drive another mile before we could take another glimpse at it.  When we returned, the object had flown about 1/2 a mile away on top of a hill, and was very hard to spot.  I was going to take a picture, but could not get a clear shot from a moving vehicle, especially with a camera phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after sunset we were motoring slowing up the river, which is actually westbound watching the campers along the river close up their sites for the weekend since it was a Sunday night. Naturally as soon as the sun had gone down the air temperature became a little cooler and my partner went below to stay warm while I continued to slowly “chug” up the river enjoying the calm, cool weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately around 9:45-9:50 I was looking directly ahead of the boat. Just above the small hill there was a bright orange/reddish light. Since it was near the top of the hill, I didn’t give it much thought thinking it wasn’t anything special. I had just thought it was someone hosting a bonfire party to end the weekend. So I glanced away for a few seconds to see the camp sites along the river and when I returned looking forward the light had definitely increased in altitude. This caused me to wonder what it was since it was an odd color. It was EXACTLY the same color as a camp fire, a very big and brilliant camp fire in the sky. It surpassed in size and brilliance any other lights in the sky including airplanes, stars, planets, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I thought “How strange? Normally an airplane would not be an orange color!” I pulled back the throttle of the boat into neutral and examined this strange light. It raised directly above the western horizon in altitude and followed an arch like course directly over top of us. As it approached it gained more and more altitude. Which was strange because I thought if it was a plane, like I have seen many times before, the altitude would not increase so drastically. I could tell the altitude was increasing because as it came closer to us overhead, it became dimmer and dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t make out any type of shape except it looked like a camp fire in the sky. Orange/Reddish color with no exact shape. I was concentrating to see if there were any red or green airplane lights on it or if it emitted any sound, which it didn’t. At one point it was directly over head, still traveling in a west to east course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so intrigued by it that I quickly ran downstairs to grab my binoculars, but by the time I got back up on deck it had disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have seen satellites and even the space shuttle shortly after sunset with a naked eye, but every time I have seen these they were going east to west because the setting sun below the horizon is reflecting off of the higher altitude craft. But in this situation it was moving west to east and surely I could not see any reflection from the sun off of the dark side of the craft. So I know it was emitting it’s own light source and was not a reflection. Also it was not a meteorite since it was gaining in altitude and it had a constant speed across the sky which was somewhat fast for a plane, but slow for a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in UFO’s and many of my family members have seen them around central Pennsylvania over the years. My brother, mother, aunt, and others all have seen them, so I grew up with the belief that they do exist, but not until that night did I actually see something that I can’t explain.<n>

It was moving straight and headed from Plymouth, CT. toward Southington, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is about the best Way for me to describe its direction.

I viewed them with binoculars and managed to get a photo of one of the lights. The lights were barrel shaped, bright yellow in color, and had a orange-red belt running across their middle. The lights hovered for approximately 10 minutes before slowly descending below the horizon. They did not appear to be very far away, 5 to 10 miles maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited about ten minutes longer hoping to see them again. Then, the lights slowly rose above the horizon again and hovered for about another ten minutes before they descended below the horizon for a second time. I stayed up about another half hour but the lights did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place out in the east central Wyoming countryside, 8 miles from town, in an area that is remote and sparsely populated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed similar lights in this location several years ago at about the same time of year. Could this be an astral phenomenon?<n>

I remember thinking the weather was pretty clear and comfortable that night.  Probably between 60 to 75 degrees fahrenheit.  I left the gas station and around 1 1/2 miles later I was at a series of sharp curves just prior to entering a wooded area on my road.  As I came around the bend I saw the triangular craft with solid orange orbs at the points and a blinking light in the middle hovering around 50 to 75 ft. over the tops of the trees.  I guess the object was around 100 to 200 ft. long and half as wide.  The appearance of it made me first freeze then my mind began to race.  I stopped my car as soon as possible and was able to prevent myself from being located directly below the object.  Looking up at the underneath of it I was a little afraid and definetly in shock.  What was to happen next as it quickly became clear to me that the technology my eyes were looking at was without a doubt capable of being fatal too me or anything around it.  I also had a slight feeling of lost time.  I was probably sitting in my car with it parked in the middle of the road staring at this craft for about 8 mins., desperately trying to wrap my mind around the dark colored objects underneath on the bottom of it along with the brightness of the orange orbs.  I tried but couldn&#39;t recognize any of the ships parts from other mechanical objects i recognize which just continued to startle but later amaze me.  At about the four mins. remaining mark I realized it hovered there and I&#39;d heard entirely no sounds from the ship.  The object was so clearly differently composed from anything I had ever seen before I continued to realize. It wasn&#39;t making any noticeable sounds but how?  It should have been impossible for that to be true due to the size of the craft and how close I was located to it I should&#39;ve heard it.  I then once again tried to recognize any of the objects on the outside underneath of the craft to help me understand how this object cou! ld float there so idly and seemingly effortlessly.  At this point I guess I had been looking at the craft in fear and amazement for about 12 mins. It then moved away and out of my eye sight maneuvering in a &#34;z&#34; like pattern incredibly fast and was gone without a trace.  I assume it had to be faster than the speed of light.<n>

My oldest daughter noticed a flash of light in the sky near the Taurus constellation.  It was located to the left of the constellation moving to the right in the sky.  It’s normal appearance was that of a medium bright star, it then flashed brighter, and in a second appeared to have moved lower next to the star Aldebaran.  My daughter couldn’t locate it with the pair of binoculars we had, and she quickly gave it to me.  As I tried to locate it, I heard my son say it flashed again.  My oldest daughter told me that it was near the top of the right most star in the constellation.  It had apparently changed direction upward from the middle of the constellation.  I quickly found it with the naked eye, and then looked in the binoculars.  It appeared to be at least as high as an orbiting satellite and still moving across the sky to the right.  It appeared to have changed speeds and slowed down.  As I watched it through the binoculars, it flashed brighter again, moved a little bit more in a straight line, picking up speed and then quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What puzzled me about the object is that I first saw two white round solid lights on it.  But when it changed directions I saw three solid white lights and could clearly see it was triangular shaped.  I drove faster to try and find a clearing so I could use my phone camcorder but it disappeared out of sight!  The time frame from me speeding up and finding a place to park was about ten seconds.  I know that this object was definitely not a plane, blimp, or helicopter!  I have worked in law enforcement and the military.  Further note my car stereo was off and my windows were down.  If it had been a plane or helicopter I would have been able to hear it!   Once again this was a dark hovering triangular shaped craft.  This is not the first time I have seen ufo&#39;s!  I have seen others on 4 other ocassions.  I just have not reported them, but this time I could not keep from reporting this.<n>

I threw the lens cap off and snapped three shots.

I was viewing the moon with my telescope when I seen an round object crossing the moon&#39;s light going east. The object had no visible strobe or any other permanent lights. I seen a total five round objects that night,but not all at the same time. They were several minuets apart. One round object went west across the moon. The objects were a dark silhouette against the moon&#39;s light. That night the moon was approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon. I was at that time facing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Facing the west of my house, my wife, kids and me were getting ready to go inside after expending some time at my mom&#39;s.  Lately I&#39;ve been interested in the UFO phenomena, so I pay attention to the sky more now than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve spotted a glowing red light at about 45 degrees in front of my house, what looked like a plane flying in our direction but after a closer observation realized it was just one light and not two, or any blinking light at all, like planes normally have.  I told my oldest son it was a helicopter but the light never changes size and now it looked like it was going up and not towards us.  My son suggested a rocket but we normally see the shuttle take off from our back yard facing the Kennedy Space Center east of Saint Cloud, FL.  Everyone went inside and I stayed to watch what was up with this light.  The glowing light was like the tail of a rocket but without the smoky trail.  I thought, I also saw a blinking white like near the object twice.  It was obvious it was neither an airplane nor helicopter.  It was going straight up and then it was turning right, but not in a wide turn.  It was turning right sharply but slow and it went thru a cloud making it glow as it passed thru.  Once behind the clouds I couldn&#39;t see it anymore so I went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object continued glowing bright green dropping below the cloud layer until it reached the tree line at which time it was obscured. I am unable to estimate the objects distance or the speed at which it was traveling as I was also moving.  I saw an object similar to this  just two nights ago which I have reported separately.<n>

I had just ended the conversation and was getting ready to go inside when I looked up into the East/Southeast sky and noticed two stars.  In between the stars was what I thought was another brilliant star.  It was extremely bright, that is what caught my eye. I watched it for less than a minute and was getting ready to look down and come inside when &#34;it&#34; moved.  It was not a satellite, we see satellites out here all the time and this object was much larger and not has high as a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright object began moving a little north so I thought it was a jetliner coming in to land with its landing lights on.  (we are live along a jet highway in the sky and see many airplanes on a daily basis).  But then I realized if it was a jet it was too high to be coming in and the lights were nothing like I had very seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then slowly started moving to the east/southeast.  I became very curious because I knew jetliners did not have &#34;landing lights&#34; on the back on the planes.  There were no flashing strobes to correctly identify it has an airplane either.  I also know airplanes don’t fly backwards.  I heard no rumble of engines as we normally do when an airplane is passing by.  Even when the plane is at it’s altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet we still here it fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my back door and yelled for my husband to come look and tell me what it might be.  He was perplexed as I was.  He knows a lot about airplanes, civilian and military.  My two boys saw it as well.  We watched for about 30 seconds as the bright orb moved away from us and then all of a sudden it picked up speed and within a matter of five seconds or so it was out of our site.    We stood there with our mouths open and then looked at each other and my husband said &#34;did we just see what we think I saw?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced anything like this.  I know now I will keep my eyes open a little wider out here in the country.<n>

Around 8:30 pm, we stopped at the belvedere near the Central Heating Plant to look at the Boston skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching a Lufthansa Airbus 340 climbing out of Logan to the North of us, we all noticed almost overhead a peculiar black object that at first looked like a delta wing aircraft, with no lights and silent. It was going from West to East at an altitude of no more than 2,000 feet (It flew under the broken cloud cover). I estimate speed at perhaps 100 MPH. As it passed overhead the object appeared to be changing shape into a cross and rotating around its center. It was the size of a quarter held at arms&#39;lenght.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2-3 minutes of watching it, we lost it from view in the darker eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was completely stationary and initially looked like a very bright planet shining in the clear blue sky, but soon became extremely intense, then fade away and turn to a barely visible cigar shape, before returning to a bright white light. For about 45 minutes we watched it fade in and out intensely. It seemed enormous in comparison to the planes flying in and out of Newark Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Above the trees, in a clear blue sky, she saw a large, white, cigar-shaped object that was just above the tree-line. She said it did not resemble the body of an airplane. After sitting motionless for a second, it moved off to the east. She hurried downstairs to look outside, but it was gone. She estimates it was no farther away than a mile and was perhaps 50-100 feet long. This is not her first UFO sighting; we posted her first sighing on 2/13/03. Also, all of our pet animals are acting queerly today. Our placid zebra finches have been SCREAMING, a sound I have never heard from them before, my daughter&#39;s rabbit scratched and bit her (never has before), and, most strangely of all, our sweet yellow lab growled and bit her when she went to pet her head.

6/23/07 14:00|Washougal|WA|Formation|3 hours|100's of orbs|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57291.html|107|ndxe200706| 100&#39;s of orbs<n> <n><n> <n><n> camping on the side of mountain right by dougan falls. looking up at stars and realized that they were moving shifting and dimming. one that appeared to be a star was leading the formations. the &#34;leader&#34; came together with two other dimmed ones and made a formation of a triangle then others next to it brightened and made a triangle formation but different from the other. we locked ourselves in the truck cab. then i realized the lights through the trees coming down lower occasionaly. after about two hours the light could be seen in the rear veiw mirrors behind the truck looking to be about the size of medicine balls. me and my witness feel as if they were playing with us and appeared to be &#34;playing&#34; games with each other as well.  the orbs were very bright white at the lightest and the closer ones seemed to take on a diamond shape when white and blue as an orb. soon as daylight hit there was no sight of them and became cloudy . I also saw two what looked like shooting stars come towards the &#34;leader&#34; from two different directions from the same distance within a minute period.  also when they formed the triangles i noticed that there was a dark haze and the triangle looked like a ship itself they moved and tilted together in sinc. very amazing. the lights also flickered and when they were not in formation especialy the &#34;leader moved arouned like a fly or an insect. the weirest thing is that i had a dream about this before it happedned and that there are strange markings like hand prints and prints that look like the bumps on a basketball in the dust on the back of the truck right now .my brother was in the back of it sleeping while this was happening . also the &#34;leader&#34; was right above us in the clearing it seemed. i also noticed people going down the moutain in there vehicles when the orbs became closer to the mountain. i am not sure but i think there was other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a frisbee, but with more careful observation i could see this object looked like it was made of a black metal and extremely smooth. it floated through the sky. above one of two churches. It floated through the sky without any weight and at a very slow speed.

6/22/07 23:15|Lausanne (Switzerland)||Sphere|Unknown|Strange dots noticed upon inspection of photos of a lightning storm|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57359.html|112|ndxe200706| Strange dots noticed upon inspection of photos of a lightning storm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi,  I was just looking through some photos of a lightning storm that I took on the 22.06.07 in Switzerland when I noticed some strange dots on a few of them. The attached photos were taken from my 3rd floor balcony on 200 asa film with a 35mm reflex camera with a 28/70mm zoom on a tripod facing West with a shutter time of about 3-5 secs and the crane in the image is about 100-120 metres distant. The images come off a CD which was made with the development. The photos were taken between 11.20pm and midnight so when there is no lightning the sky is black black black, so I did not see anything when I took the photos. I have only removed some noise and the jpeg motif from these images in the way of retouching. (the set of retouched photos from that storm can be seen here<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.flickr.com/photos/9400459@N03/sets/72157600519687915<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looking for the points of interest look at the photos at 200% In 07 the point of interest is on the right hand side of the photo to the left of the balcony on the edge of the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 13 look to the right and above the crane weight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 24 it&#39;s halfway between the crane tip and the top of the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 32 look directly above the crane stand two thirds the distance from the crane to the top of the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think 07, 34 and 32 are clearest but they are small in all photos. I&#39;ve ruled out a speck on the lens or mirror as a cause, because a roll of 36 exposure film was used in about 30-40 mins, the camera moved only once and one or two adjustments to the zoom and the specks appear in different places but not on every photo. If it were an emulsion spot it would appear as a splodge not a pixellated dot with the same pixel intensity as the rest of the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What do you think?  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwards four excellent photos of lightning bolts.  The objects he alludes to above are very small, indistinct specks, which we are unable to identify.  They may be birds, or perhaps trash, but we cannot be certain.  PD))<n>

And the two witnesses living a mile apart could see 4 fast moving lights (north, south, east and west) that would move, bump each other and go back apart.  It was like the spokes on a wheel.  The lights would make a small turn and go back into the center of the &#39;wheel&#39;. When the lights would &#39;bump&#39; (in the center) they would stay lit.  It was absolutely nothing like a search light. From the ground using the naked eye, it appeared that the lights were about 4 -5 feet in diameter. The lights were a soft white with lots of movement inside of the actual light. There was no sound at all.<n>

Lights go from very dim to extremely bright<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting on our dock on the Potomac river near the small town of Bedington, WV we observed numerous small and medium white lights that traveled in the same pattern. We have watched these events for over 5 years. These lights sometimes seem to get extremely bright, almost like an afterburner on a jet fighter. They are extremely high in the sky and the lights do NOT blink. They are steady and there is no sound. They travel at an extreme speed. We have ruled out the passenger plane theory, even though we are in the flight path for Dulles airport in Virginia because of the strange movements these objects sometimes make. They never change color, the light just goes from very dim to very bright. I cannot tell you the shape because of the height they were traveling and the fact it was dark. We have tried to video tape these lights but they are simply too high in the sky to show up on video. We would love to fing someone close to where we live to do a little more research on what these strange, fast and nimble crafts are. I would appreciate any info you can provide as I feel we are watching the UFO highway above our house, which is located in the country!! So perfect for watching events like these.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked kinda the way Mars looks at this time a year. It then started to move from the south  to north.just a little bit faster than a plane would move. It&#39;s altitude was about 15,000 feet, it had more of a glow to it, not anything like a plane.  As it passed over i waited to hear for the sound that you usually hewar after a jet goes by, but nothing. Thats not the only time i&#39;ve witnessed other starange lights in the sky in this area.<n>

Ok, I was laying on the golf course with 2 friends and one of them turned to me and said what is that? I looked up and there were 2 flashing white lights moving parallel to eachother. One light would flash for a half of a second as thenother turned off for a half of a second. I know for a fact that it was not an airplane because there was no noise and I could not see the object between the lights (if there was one). They were moving about 2 times the speed of an average airplane would move in the sky. They seemed about the same altitude that an airplane would travel. I am still in shock of what happened and i cannot get it out of my mind. Can some one give me some clarification on what exactly this could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a passenger jet with its bright lights on but it was not in the usual flight path going to the Santa Barbara Airport, and then I noticed it wasn’t moving closer as a jet should have been.  It just stayed over the mountains.   I thought maybe it was headlights from a car on Gibraltar Road but it could not have been a car because of the size of the light and the distance it was.  Then another light showed up but it wasn’t as big or as bright and it also lingered. Then the brighter light disappeared for a few seconds then it reappeared.  I watched for 20 minutes or more but could not reconcile in my mind what the heck it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/22/07 21:40|Ventura|CA|Chevron|4 seconds|V shaped  soundless aircraft|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57246.html|119|ndxe200706| V shaped  soundless aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> While standing on my patio I saw a &#34;V&#34; shaped set of lights pass by an an un-determinable altitude pass by and disappear in about 4 seconds after I noticed it. There was no wind and visibility was extreme clear. There were stars out in the background nothing in the sky that would obscure visibility. There were also a few dissapating Con Trails at higher altitudes. The best description I can offer is that it looked very much like the image I found depicted on the top of this page.  It was a &#34;V&#34; shaped set of low intensity lights with 1 at the point, and 4 or 5 on each leg of a symmetrical shaped &#34;V&#34;. It disapeared after about 4 seconds which was not obscured by any ground objects or the horizon.  What confused me is that there was no sound, and that there was plenty of background light which would provide a view of the vehicle the lights were a part of, and there was nothing. It was simply a formation of low intensity lights, shaped in an angle that no aircraft (commercial or military) I know of.  For the record... I&#39;m not a believer in extra terrestial life or aliens from another planet. I&#39;ve also seen plenty of waterfowl formations at night and can assure you that idea has no merit in my opinion.   I would be more apt to chalk it up to a secret reconnasiance type of craft that has not been made public yet. Stranger things have happened.....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving southbound on Route 59 turning right onto a service road that runs into Seil Road where I eventually stopped so we could get a better look.  I looked at the time and it was 4:58 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my eye was a bright reflection in the sky over the southbound I-55 traffic.  It was a completely cloudy day and the clouds were not moving.  What sun there was peeking through the clouds had obviously reflected off of this UFO. I thought it was a huge blimp at first however, it was completely covered with white coulds and as it travelled slowly west it changed its shape, expanded and disappeared into the surrounding clouds.  I did not hear any sounds from this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the bright reflection had not caught my eye and my grandson had not witnessed this as well, I would have talked myself out of seeing this.  But I truly did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/22/07 12:30|Torrance|CA|Light|20 Minutes|Los Angeles - Bright lights seen by 4 witnesses during shuttle reentry.  12-15 bright lights moved around the sky for 20 minutes.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57239.html|121|ndxe200706| Los Angeles - Bright lights seen by 4 witnesses during shuttle reentry.  12-15 bright lights moved around the sky for 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From approximately 12:30pm-1pm on Friday, June 22, two of us left lunch to try to hear the sonic boom the space shuttle was to create as it entered the atmosphere.  The shuttle was set to land at 12:49pm at Edward’s Airforce Base, northeast of our location in Torrance, California.  We trained our eyes to the north in hopes of catching a glimpse of the shuttle (however improbable that might have been).  At 12:45 we hadn’t heard the boom so we went into the restaurant and turned on CNN.  The shuttle had yet to land so we went back outside.  When we looked to the north we saw what appeared to be 3 very bright lights following a dark object.  We assumed that we were looking at escort planes following the shuttle.  For about 2 minutes the lights followed the dark object in a triangle formation.  Suddenly 3 more lights appeared.  Several seconds later 3 more lights appeared and so on.  At one point there were about 15 very bright lights in the sky.  Two other people walked over and watched in amazement as these lights moved.  Most of them were moving from north to south but some appeared to alter their course, moving east and west.  After several minutes all but 3 lights disappeared, as did the dark object.  One light stayed fixed in the same position while two others passed overhead (at what appeared to be a very high altitude).  We thought that maybe something terrible had happened to the shuttle and we were looking at pieces of debris. We rushed back inside to see that the shuttle had safely landed.  When we went back outside the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible Explanations:  1) The lights could have been shiny balloons.  However:  -Some of the lights changed direction moving west and east.  Most were moving southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was a sunny day and these objects were very bright in the sky.  The two that passed overhead were still bright as they passed near the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Some appeared to be moving in a triangle formation.  They split apart then came back together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -They did not appear to be rising nor losing their intensity over time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The lights did not flicker like balloons would as they rotate in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) The lights could have been airplanes. However:  -They were all the same size the whole time we observed them.  Even the lights that went overhead appeared to be the same size as the ones further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -They did not move like airplanes.  One stayed completely stationary throughout the 10-15 minutes we watched them.  Some moved quickly, others slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Two groups of 3 appeared and disappeared in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -They were not reflective like airplanes.  Other planes going to and from LAX flew by and would only reflect light for several seconds at a time.  The two strange lights that passed between us and the sun stayed illuminated the whole time.  All of them were much brighter than you would expect from normal airplane reflections.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) It could have been debris/fuel/waste from the shuttle.  However:  -The lights did not fade over time like you would expect to see from debris burning up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -They did not leave a trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Some lights were moving quickly while the single one remained stationary.  Some also appeared to fly in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four of us that witnessed the event.  The only rational explanation we could come up with is that they were shiny, helium filled balloons.  I’ve seen balloons in the sky before and, because of the reasons I outlined earlier, I truly don’t believe in this hypothesis.  It is also a very strange coincidence that this would have happened at the same time and place the shuttle would have been reentering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see anything like this?<n>

We watched these lights for a minute, and a third one lit up and the thing flipped over, and was doing all these crazy flips. Then, it flew over the freeway towards I5North and it went into this field and looked like it had landed, but you could still see the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly they came back up, hovering, and started spinning like a top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flipped over and came back over the freeway to I5South, and by this time it was behind us. My boyfriend told me to get his digital video camera out, and as I was looking for it, the thing turned on it&#39;s side and flared up its lights and looked as if it was coming after his car. I decided to forget about the camera and just told him to drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not saying anything about aliens or other life forms - there could have been a very logical explanation for what we saw....but as of right now, I don&#39;t know what that is. So I can only define it as an unidentified flying object,which is exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was a large ball of silver-blue-white  light with a spasrkling surface.  It had a small trail of the same colored light.  It was visible to us at an angle of about 30 degrees above the ground in a falling trajectory of about 30 degrees relative to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During our observation the ball of light appeared to disappear behind some high hills in front of us in the area of Cascade Resevoir (N44-31-27 degrees x W116-02-59 degrees). If it had hit the gound we would have expected there to be a flash or very bright light in that direction - we did not see anything but it&#39;s diappearance behind the hill. The local Sheriff had several reports and sent a deputy to look for the object. The deputy did not find anything. It was not reported in the newspaper nor on TV, and the large airport tower to the south saw nothing in the air nor on its radar (they said).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It has red, green and blue strobing light on it. It was definitely not an airplanes as it was doing manouvers which most conventional aircraft are not even close on doing it. It suddenly picks up speed and then slows down, extremely quick with a blink of eye. We couldnt really figure out the size of this thing. It was hovering there for couple of minutes making absolutely no sound whatso ever. Even a police patrol car stopped over and was amazed by what this thing was. After 15 minutes, it just dissappeared in front of us with a blink of eye. It has pulsating light on it, i clearly remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had the impression it was going down in a slight right turn towards the earth (shadow?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its direction in more detail was when seen from my position: From close to the right moon surface towards the right (first horizontally) in a slightly changing direction (downward curvature) from like on a 16-min to an 18-min course (with moon as clockface), in the end with a slight even more downward (20-min) course when it disappeared as if switched off. Its roughly general direction was like opposed, i.e. facing the flight direction (under an estimated 12 degree angle) of the Shuttle/ISS as expected by me from the ESA “star map” (which at exactly the same time must have been in that area (approx. over Malaga, Spain), yet lower than my horizon (I assume that’s why I didn’t see it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The so far unidentified object had the almost exact appearance of Venus by size and colour and was somewhat brighter than Venus was at that moment, it seemed to be ‘much closer’ in distance; no blinking lights, no re-appearance. The duration of its appearance was close to 4 seconds. In terms of ‘length’ of its course visible to me: It appeared out of the dark at little distance right of the moon’s right curvature (where I was staring at) to continue as a bright light for a distance that I would describe as being half of the distance I could recognize between Saturn and Venus from my position at that moment, with approx. 80% of its initial length in a 17-min directional mode, the rest directed more downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving side to side and all over the place really. It was a cloudy night so no stars were visible and its movement was too strange to have been any kind of human made craft or satellite. Its brightness was like that of a star and the light kept dimming and coming back such as a dying light bulb. As I turned my head to phone my friend to look out his window to see it also I turned my head back and it was gone. It was not there earlier as I looked out the same window maybe 5min before and there was no lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about a third as bright as Venus and maybe about 2/3 the size.  It looked like a star, definitely had an altitude greater than any of the aircraft I&#39;d seen.  Just a bright, white light. What was odd to me was that it moved at a much greater speed than any of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it coming from the southern horizon, moving smooth and fast, it disappeared over the northern horizon only 10 seconds later. I&#39;ve never seen anything that high cover that much ground in such a short amount of time.  I thought possibly satellite, but south to north?  Weird.   The other weird thing is that every plane I&#39;ve ever seen had at least some sort of blinking lights, even if only one.

It sounded like they had come from the direction of Jackson, MI (northwest of my location) and flew onward, in the direction of Brooklyn, to the southeast.   I didn&#39;t actually see them, only heard, what seemed to be, several loud, powerful helicopter engines (the whoop-whoop sound was easily noticibale)  At 8:00 EST I heard more heliocpters behind my home and they seemed to sit over the swamp behind my home.   There are several horse pastures surrounding this swamp and this realization made me concerned that there was possible animal mutilations occurring in my neighborhood.   I felt this because while hearing the helicopters come and go, I began to feel like I was being watched.  I&#39;ve had that same feeling while in the presence of the UFO phenomenon.  The helicopters left after a few minutes but I don&#39;t recall in which direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:05 I hear them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I ran for the camera as I wanted to get a photo or two.   I know that I may have to jump in my car to get a good look at them as there are many trees in my yard and neighborhood.   They departed before I could get my Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 out and 2x telephoto lens attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a bit unnerved by the helicopters and began to feel the overpowering need to take photographs outdoors.   Around 8:30 I went outdoors with camera and tripod in hand.   I set up to shoot some stills of the moon and try out the manual settings on this digital SLR.   I snapped a few images of the moon while having problems with the tripod.   I detached the camera body from the tripod and began snapping off dozens of photos into the air,just above the tree line to the NE.   I can&#39;t explain why...I just began to shoot images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two images attached, &#34;disc&#34; and &#34;cigar-close&#34;, were shot around 8:30pm on 21 June 2007.   I saw a small, black disc flying erratically in the sky, like a balloon in turbulant wind...but under much more control.    It was flying from west to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo with the cigar shaped image was one of many images taken during a &#39;manual burst&#39; of dozens of images.   The image preceding the one with the cigar and the one after contain no objects in the sky but were taken within an extremely short time (1 to 5 seconds between images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that both images employed 8x zoom (the camera has a 12x internal zoom) and a 2x telephoto lens.   I found a setting that worked for me and left it on manual so that I could retain the digital f-stop and shutter speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email the two photos of odd craft soon.<n>

WQe had just finished relaxing and eating and were headed back to our motel room in town driving east when we saw five sort of shimering objects on the horizon .shimering spots of light like flames in thr distance. At first I thought it was a fire on the side of Rabbit Peak  and even started to call 911 to report the fire I thought was high upon the mountain, but then the lights went out and reappeared as only two larger bright lights a little farther to the south on the horizon and a little higher up in the sky but still close to the horizon. looking east they stayed stationary like the 5 lights for about 2 minutes and then they also faded away.It was too dark to tell if they were high on the mountain or just above the mountains ridge line. they were seen is uninhabited very rugged terrain and the lights could not have been campers because they were too far away to be that bright by campers and it was 110 degrees that day. no one would have been up there and because it was dark I couldnt tell if the lights originated on the mountan or above the ridge line in the sky. My wife and I both saw them They were not planes because they did not move but also they did not blink like plane lights but shimmered like glowing hovering flames or pulses of light<n>

I was looking at the moon cresent and noticed two whitelights or bright reflections equidistant from each other at the same height. At first I thought they were balloons. I quickly realized they werent when these two round shapes started to move southwest at a slow speed. After about seven minutes of floating in that direction, we noticed a flicker of reflection,1 as if it rolled from the top end of a cigar shaped craft at one end( round white shape), and made its way round and round until it dicsipated at the other end(round white shape). After it hit the other end, there was what seemed like a long bent foil piece falling down as the two white shapes continued to move southwest still equidistant at the same speed. I observed the falling object and compare it to bent foil. It almost as if someone had bent a piece of rectangular foil several times in equal sections, then slightly unbent it. This is the most accurate description  I can give if someone trys to imagine a falling slightly unbent piece of foil and the reflctions from the sun it gives off as it falls end over end. The object stopped halfway down from the other craft? and what I thought were the suns reflections turned to a slow pulsing glow. About one every 2-3 seconds.It is at this time that the object starte to move horizontally but slighty up and down as it proceeded to move out of view behind some building towards the Northeast end of the city. I got the chills when this happened yesterday. I also called the local news station, but they transferred me to someones voicemail. I couldnt focus my cellphone camera far enough to capture it. I had no camcorder or other camera with me. I also checked to see if it might had been the shuttle detaching from the ISS, but nope that was delayed. I hope that there were other witness because passerrs by seemed oblivious to the event.2<n>

It was &amp;quot;Huge&amp;quot; and round in shape and was as dark as the midnight sky except for the lights underneath.I could definately not see the top of this humungous monstrocity of a &amp;quot;Space Vehicle&amp;quot; as was told to me by my report of it to &amp;quot;MUFON&amp;quot; that it was; a U.F.O sighting! ! All I could do was stare in amazement at this U.F.O. parked in my backyard sky! &amp;quot;This has got to be a Hoax&amp;quot; and someone playing a mind game with me! Someone making a very expensive movie also came to mind that night! This is definately not &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; as I looked for a beam radiating a hologram and could see none.It was so close as if I picked up a rock and threw it at it would have hit it.It was the most amazing thing that I have ever seen or experienced and something that will remain in my memory!Except now I don&#39;t recall the color of the &amp;quot;lights&amp;quot; on it.Blue and red and yellow-I think!And there were three or four-I think! I almost immediately wanted to put it out of my mind that night as I was feeling the best I&#39;ve ever felt physicaly and mentaly in a long time and a peacefulness like no other time in my life and did not want to spoil that feeling by a &amp;quot;sighting&amp;quot;! A sighting that I never asked to see or dreamed of seeing or whatever th! e case or cause might have been! I went to bed after standing ! and look ing at it!Why me?? and why after all these years would I have to experience this enomaly?Me??Not good with people as one of my friends that could not play guitar in public,not good with people due to whatever reason.Shy introverted people and another reason that I tried to dismiss the event as to not have to explain to anybody or deal with &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; emotions in any way.So my friend and I had this in common,now he has passed on and never to see or talk to again! As with most important and influential people in my life and just drift away from me!People I don&#39;t care for seem to be always there!Just like that &amp;quot;God-damned&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Spaceship&amp;quot;!!Writing about it may or may not &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; and reporting it took a lot of guts!Where&#39;s the &amp;quot;Glory&amp;quot; in that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It caught my eye and as I watched it got bigger, as I kept driving the long light turned into three distinctive lights. Imagine a triangle and there was a light on the tip, and one light on the center of each side. The lights were extremely large, like the BP logo. I stopped my car when I was right under it and turned down my music there was no noise coming from it, it also wasn&#39;t moving, and if it was moving it was moving so slow that the eye couldn&#39;t tell. Comparing 10 degrees in the sky to the width of my fist, the object was approximately 70 degrees high. I was traveling east and as I was traveling the object moved very slowly 50 degrees north, and then back again. I can&#39;t really say how big it was but I do remember the width of the object going over the sides of the two lane road. Once I realized what it was I drove away and when I looked back it was gone. The whole way down the road I felt like I was being watched, and I got physical effects from the whole experience, my arms when numb and my jaw was chattering I felt icy-hot sweaty palms. It was an extremely large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a lovely evening, clear skies in all directions.   He faced East, I turned to look at the moon hanging in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noticed a very very bright object moving out of the west, moving very fast.   I began to ask my husband if it was probably a satellite, because I could not see any type of blinking as with most airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We squinted, trying to decipher if there was blinking or not,  but he saw no blinking either. Right then we both noticed a second very bright object following at the exact same speed, in the exact same direction as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the ground, the bright objects would have appeared about 8-10 inches apart, so I don’t know what the actual distance would calculate to be,   but they were in unison , appearing as if the second object were being towed along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We deliberated for a minute or two, concluding, that for satellites,  they were flying at a really low elevation ,  looking like they were inside our atmosphere,  not orbiting outside of it;   And they were so bright,  as compared to most satellites which are usually only as bright as the stars &amp; moving across the sky at a slow but steady rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are very reasonable, logical people.   It was our instinct to dismiss the objects as some logical device which was operating normally in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However,  standing there….. suggesting, squinting, contemplating the possibilities of what they were,  we suddenly saw the first object fade quickly and disappear completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both astounded at this point.     Questioning why and where it could have gone,   watching the second object follow the same path,  &amp; at the exact same place in the sky,……it too faded very quickly and disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now we were absolutely confused at what in the world we could be seeing.              The sky was completely clear &amp;  the objects were gone, just like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They traveled out of the western sky in unison, and disappeared into the Southwestern sky at the same place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We talked excitedly and returned inside after a few moments.   My husband headed to bed.   I sat down to watch some Tv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 1am,  I was too curious to sleep without knowing, so I called Rickenbacher Airport, and was transferred to airport operations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I explained to the man on the phone, and he confirmed that he also saw the objects in the sky at that time.   He remembered seeing them because he too noticed how fast they were traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had no actual confirmation,   but assumed the first object we saw was the international space station,  because it ‘probably’ has its solar panels out right now.  I said okay,   and mentioned again that they seemed so close,   too close to be floating outside of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him what was trailing it so far behind the object at the same speed, and he said he did not know what that could have been.     He told me they appeared to disappear  because at a certain point on the horizon, the sunlight does not reach the object anymore and it appears to disappear.     I accepted this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband brought up the point that the objects were no where near the horizon,   they were way up in the sky, almost overhead.    Im sure it is possible though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father keeps  suggesting it was the Space station and that the object behind it was probably the space shuttle which would be docked on it or very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However,   the distance even from our view was already too far for the objects to be docked together,  let alone what the actual distance would be up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He also supported the disappearing horizon theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I thought about it later  I realized Rickenbacher is a military installation.   I had called them thinking they would be a better authority than Port Columbus,    but now I realize, if there were anything unidentified up there,    a military installation would be the last to confirm it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And so we left it at that.        No answers for the boatload of questions in our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen now that a Pilot flying over the English Channel last week, along with his passengers, all witnessed a very large Unidentified craft outside of their windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it moved out of site,  the pilot stated that a second object appeared 5 minutes later.  I do not know whether the two sightings are related but I see an amazing coincidence between the timing and actual objects seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS? PD))<n>
6/20/07 23:00|San Juan Bautista|CA|Fireball|2 minutes|In the dead of night a bright orb rose from the ground, changed colors, appeared to grow in size, and teleported away|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79612.html|146|ndxe200706| In the dead of night a bright orb rose from the ground, changed colors, appeared to grow in size, and teleported away<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred late at night and right off of highway 101 in San Juan Bautista, CA.  While parked off of the road at the local highschool which I was still attending, a flash of light illuminated the entire sky in the direction of a local agricultural business across the street and it made the area seem like it was being viewed through nightvision goggles; unseen structures on the ground miles away became visible as if the sun were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the flash (which seemed to be an lime green)and originating from the field a glowing and undefined sphere of light rose into the sky.  When the sky was lit up the sphere was not visible.  After the area turned black again was when the sphere glew, became visible and floated upwards until it was about a mile high in the sky.  It shone and hovered in the same spot for about 30 seconds.  The sphere itself was initially a light yellowish color but it graudually changed to other orange and redish hues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After changing colors the light shone brighter and grew even larger in size for an instant and then vanished.  On the ground and no more than a quarter of a mile away when it first took off it seemed to be about the size of a softball but once in the sky and at least a mile away its light expaneded to what was the size of a basketball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same object vanished instantly and then reappeared far off to the west over what would be near Watsonville (about 20 miles away) and then teleported again to the south near Salinas. (another 20 or so miles away)  There was never any trail of light.  After about another 30 seconds or so of this it came back to its original hovering spot, paused for a brief moment, and then raced towards the west again and upwards at a low angle.  Within 5 seconds it was no longer visible but unlike the other instances the final time it took off it did not teleport; it seemed as if it were taking its time to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s cliche, but while watching the object in truely felt as if the three of us were also being observed.  It was a very surreal experience, the kind that you want to dismiss as imaginary almost immediately.  What made the ordeal undeniable was the fact that all three witnessess saw and explained seeing the exact same thing many months afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One object leading, one following, on what looked to be the same course. The second object was not close to the first. Objects were very high in the sky. Objects came from the northwest traveling south east. Objects were observed for approx 1-2 minutes as they crossed the sky. About 3/4 of the way across the sky, the first objects bright white light began to dim to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to nothing, no lights at all. Hard to tell exactly, but it did look like that when the second object got to the same place in the sky where the first object had started to dim, the second objects bright white light started to dim also, going to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to no lights at all. The area of the sky where the lights blinked off was constantly observed for approx 10-15 minutes after the lights went off, and no lights/activity was noticed. Not being an expert, but knowing what the commercial jets look like at night that fly in this area, all have some form of blinking traffic lights. I cannot see these as being commercial planes. Probably military???, but why would they turn off their lights completely?  I just thought this abnormal behavior for 2 airplanes flying together at night, and may be this might be of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They were both moving in the same direction, approximately southeast. There was no sound associated with the objects. I looked closely and saw no other colored lights, such as red or green that I have seen with high flying aircraft, with the two lighted objects. The visibility of the two lighted objects faded and was lost while the objects were still high in the sky. I of course am very curious concerning what I was looking at. I am no nonsense person. I only report the facts. I am a 17 year employee of the federal government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD))<n>

The moon was a little under a half moon and barely any clouds in the sky that evening. The moon was bright enough to cast a baby blue hue across the sky, lighting it up as if it we moments before daybreak. Theres a star that usually accompanies the moon in the warm season, its Venus or Saturn or some huge star that is always close to the moon normally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason, I looked up to see these two hanging in the light blue night…only to find that the star that usually is there by the moon..is now moving at a slow but constant pace. Then looking below it…is another star…a little to the left and below it in the sky moving at the same speed. These weren’t planes or anything man made. It gave me the initial feeling that I was moving and they were not. So I used another star near by as a point of reference, and thought, “Surely those stars won’t pass one another!!!” But yet they did.  The sky was lit to the point where I could plainly see air planes, commercial jet traffic easily and ID them without a doubt. These two moving objects didn’t not have any “outer” structure….and appeared to be so high up…that they weren’t even in our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slowly they made their way up to the top of the sky…then the lead object began climbing. The light emitted from these two were the same if you were looking at the North Star, or a planet in the sky…bright white, but the size of a star. No flashing…no changing color…no erratic movement.  As they climbed, I could tell that they were leaving or going higher because their light began to dim.  Within about 20 seconds of this climb, they both disappeared into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m really hoping that someone else saw this. I’m not a huge believer in this kind of stuff, but this was really something amazing.<n>

Around 10:30pm I noticed something in the sky, it was a large black triangle with 2 bright white lights on the back points.  This large craft floated overhead in kind of a horseshoe like move then it went off slowly, to the right in a straight line. It didn&#39;t make any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for a few minutes, during this time my friends and I were trying to figure out if it was military, a UFO, or something else.  We were very excited either way.  We kept watching this craft go to the right of us, then it seemed to pause, the lights seemed to get brighter... then all of the sudden the white lights turned to orange and the entire craft disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the 3 of us determined this thing was definitely a UFO.  I am not saying that this craft must be extraterrestrial, but if it is man made it is being kept a secret from the public.  In any case I got really creeped out by seeing it had my friends take me home shortly afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the pond that we were at, was very close to a small airport in Muncie IN<n>

I calculated the distance to be hundreds of meters judging by the size. But when I followed the object with my eyes it was moving to the left, in the sky. It was on top of my bedroom roof, four meters from my eyes. And then as it moved away from me it was straight in front of the first floor of my neighbor’s house, whose wall is 10 meters away. It trajectory was at an angle of 10 degrees to the horizontal, dipped to horizontal flight after 4 meters and then ascended quickly and vanished. I calculated its size 4 cm in diameter, perfect sphere with white light and its flight lasted 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have got one question. What was it?<n>

These two white lights were traveling across the sky from the NW to the SE, one in front of the other remaining fairly constant as they traveled across the sky.  The light intensity varied slightly.  As the lights past to the south of us they rapidly faded out of sight.  There was no flashing lights or anything to indicate a plane, no streaking of light to indicate a shooting star. It was the most interesting encounter yet to be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I watch planes fly over head ever night; we have seen shooting stars in our backyard.

They remained motionless for 25 minutes.  I pulled off the highway and took a couple pictures on my cell phone.  While I was pulled off the road and out of my car, I saw several military flares being dropped above the lights - they were smaller in size, not as bright, and faded out in 5-10 seconds.

It had a definite shape and was only observed for a matter of 5 to 6 seconds. It&#39;s speed was such that it disappeared from view in the sky well before it reached the horizon. It is impossible for me to estimate it&#39;s altitude but it appeared to be less than that of an overflying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This location is approx. 3 nautical miles from John C.

I was taking pictures of the mountains to the west of where I was standing when I noticed this distant object flying around erratically and I attempted to get a couple of shots of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took the photos I completely forgot about them because at the time I didn&#39;t have any thought of a UFO on my mind. It was too distant and it appeared to be something like a bouquet of mylar balloons getting blown in the wind in a sort of counter-clockwise rolling motion. I didn&#39;t load or look at any of my vacation photos in my notebook PC until returned to our camp trailer in Maine again in early August. When I got to look at the one that contains the object, I suddenly remembered why I took the shot and zoomed in on it to see if I could make out what the object was I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the second photo, which was taken 3 seconds later, there was no object that appears anywhere in the frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was using a Canon PowerShot A540, without the zoom on, and was holding it at about a foot in front of my face. I have no idea where the object went after the first shot was taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that the ridge in the foreground, just below the object, was about 2/5 of a mile away from where I was standing and that the object was much further away than I had intitially thought, possibly a mile from where I was. I would put it&#39;s size at about 35-50 feet in diameter. I also noticed when I zoom in on the object in the photo, there appears to be some sort of vertical rod on the top of it. Others I&#39;ve shown the photo to, have noticed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time frame of my sighting lasted about ten seconds from when I first spotted it, took the two photos, and was no longer able to see it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and his girlfriend where in the same parking lot, but where about 100 feet from where I was. The sighting didn&#39;t excite me and I didn&#39;t even mention it to them. As I said, it was distant and it never struck me at the time as possibly being a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Who would have thought they&#39;d ever be presented with the opportunity to get a shot of one in their lifetime? At the time, I just took the photos as a curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe it&#39;s a bird, with wings upraised.  However, PD))<n>

It was really large; so large that If I held up my hand, that would not be enough to hide the entire craft from my view.  The position of the lights were one fore and one aft.  The lights looked exactly like the other stars; small, white and steady.  The lights were not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD))<n>

Two smaller bright lights broke off from the bigger light and moved left across the sky following behind a flashing red light to another bright light that had a ring of haze around it.  The flashing red light flew right through the other bright light, but the two smaller ones disappeared into the bright light with the haze around it.  Once the smaller lights disappeared; the flashing red light sped off and then it too disappeared.  Two minutes later a flashing yellow light appeared.  When looking at these lights they formed a triangle in the sky.  The bright light beneath the moon went out and then came back on when an airplane flew near it.  All the observers were enjoying the nice weather and talking outside their apartments.  None of these observers were under any kind of influence of either drugs or alcohol.  At least two of the observers have open minds that we are not alone in the universe and it could be UFO’s that they saw.  None of the observers have ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching the evening sky grow dark.  The sun set around 9ish.  When I first started viewing the night sky a sliver of a moon and a bright star to the right were visible if you are facing the pacific ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the darkness increased I became aware of two brighter objects appearing between the moon and the bright star.  At first I thought they were stars that were further away and needed more darkness to be seen.  That was until they started to move.  They took off from over the ocean headed southeast at a fairly decent pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point I have caught my boyfriends attention because I practically had my face planted in the windshield. It was at this point I asked the question to no one in particular and to myself out loud &#34;What in the hell is that?&#34;  My boyfriend noticed what I was seeing and we both started exiting the car, him to get the camcorder out of the trunk I already had my camera in hand and was ready to take pictures.  I started shooting as soon as I could but didn&#39;t think I was getting anything so I kept looking over the camera to make sure I was pointing it in the right direction.  Meanwhile my boyfriend was getting the camcorder trying to capture what we were seeing.  While I was trying to capture the still shots I witnessed a triangular shaped silver object appear 40 to 50 feet above my head going to the right or northwardly up the beach no sound accompanied any of these objects.  When I gave up in my attempts to get pictures and turned back to my boyfriend to see if he was getting it on film I witnessed them disappear into the southeastern sky.  May be a minute later we witnessed two light seemingly further away and dimmer flying a bit further apart flying from the SW to the NE.  We are not sure if they were the same two or two new ones. We watched the sky for about another half an hour and witnessed nothing else at that location.  We finally headed back to our motel room about a quarter mile from the original sigh ting.  We discussed what each had seen my boyfriend confirmed the two bright lights I had seen but he says he saw a third light I didn&#39;t see forming a triangle shape with the first two but he reports that he didn&#39;t witness the triangular silver object that I seen headed north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We spent the rest of that evening watching the skies off the oregon coast and an orange glow of what looked to be something burning on the horizon where the sky meets the ocean.  We don&#39;t know what we saw that night. We both agree it was like nothing we have ever seen before.  However we did capture video of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD))<n>

The both had just a single bright white light and moved at a high rate of speed faster then a plane would be moving.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 0n 06-19-07 at approximately 10:00 PM I observed the strangest thing I had ever seen. Two fairly bright white lights moving in tandem in the northern sky above Denver Colorado. The two lights were the size and intensity of the bright star Sirius. The night was beautiful and clear, the moon was hanging large and low on the horizon. These objects or object turned southeast and flew directly over my house and then suddenly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing at my open rear door of my house when the sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention, As usual with any low flying aircraft, I would go outside to watch for it. As soon as I stepped out onto my rear deck my attention was diverted to two bright lights approaching from the north. At first I thought the lights were stars and stationary, but then I soon realized they were moving in my direction. They were moving slowly in tandem as if two planes were flying in formation, one in front of the other. This struck me as very odd so I continued to watch them. The two lights were approaching me from a slight angle and they never once deviated laterally from their position. They continued heading in my direction. I stood there trying to understand what it was that I was looking at. As it over flew my house, I ran through the house and called for my teenage son to come to the front door to observe this as well. The two of us stood watching this thing cruise overhead silently and almost effortlessly. We both stood motionless trying to understand what it was we were watching. Within a few seconds the two lights flashed off in unison and it was all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be close; however, it had no discernable shape. The object made absolutely no sound. The space and distance between the two lights can be measured by extending one full arm length and turning your hand at a 90 degree angle. one hand length. The area in which this thing traveled penetrated heavily regulated airspace, (class Bravo airspace) for DIA. This portion of class B airspace has a floor of 8000 feet MSL and a ceiling of 14,500 MSL. The object was in this air space and had also flown in between Centennial (KAPA) and Buckley AFB airspace. All three are manned by radar.  I am an instrument rated Private Pilot and I think I have a pretty good understanding of what airplanes look and sound like. This was no airplane, as this object had none of the required position lights / navigation lights or strobes that one would recognize as local aviation. The object was not a small dimly lit fast moving satellite, nor was it a commonly observed meteor streaking across our celestial heavenly body, and no, it was no weather balloon. I don’t know what this thing was that my son and I observed, but it left a bad taste in our mouths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I watched the object travel a bit further when what I saw confirmed to me that this was not ordinary both the lights dimmed out slowly right in front of my eyes until I could not see them anymore, they were totally gone.

We believe it was two lights on one craft. The lights came from the West and traveled SE before they just disappeared.  I went to MUFON and reported it, and learned within 24 hours the same objects were seen in Nevada, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Colorado, California, Wyoming and by us here in Oregon.  The time zone we are in, pacific and the times the other sightings were reported indicates that there were more than one of these crafts.  It has to be huge...to us, we were assuming it was 2 objects, but we did entertain the notion that it was ONE big craft with two lights by the way it moved and the lights stayed so steady and perfectly spaced.  No sound, no blinking lights.<n>

They were quite low to the horizon, and we thought that they were planets at first.  However, we figured that two planets would not be shining so brightly so close together.  The two lights were just hovering in the air, and then one of them starting moving east very slowly.  As this light moved its light slowly dimmed until it disappeared (about twenty seconds in duration).  However, the other light continued hovering for another minute or two.  This light then moved in the same direction as the first and dimmed even faster.  Both yellow lights that were extremely bright and were suspended in the sky suddenly vanished into the sky.  This is one of the most peculiar and unexplainable things that I have ever seen, and all four of us are certain that these were not helicopters and certainly not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went into the house to get my camera (SONY DCS585).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have the camera set on night vision, so the pictures I took are really dark.  I downloaded them and brightened them.  To my amazement, all kinds of &#34;objects&#34; showed on the screen.  I DID NOT see any of these images while observing the night sky. The sequence of the picture numbers are 02133, 02134 and 02136.  02135 showed nothing out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time I took the pictures is from 8:54-8:55pm CT (which is in the property of the picture information).

I saw no lights but it was completely black and all the edges were strait lines. The main body looked triangular and the other one or two objects were moving either below it or above it because the entire shape would change shapes but I could tell it had to be more than one unit.  It moved really slow through the air.  We watched it as long as we could.  We never heard a sound from the thing.  The smaller units would casually move a little but the main triangle never moved a different direction.  I have seen lots of farmers burn their fields and this didn&#39;t look anything like that.  It wasn&#39;t a kite.  It wasn&#39;t a balloon.  I thought from the start that it was about 500 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And just as it seemed that they were going to disappear behind the mountain, it was there that the lights just dimmed out and seemed like they were shooting up and to the left a bit before they just vanished.

We had just returned from Hibbing, Minnesota where we were shopping.  We were about to relax and have a drink. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the sky which was almost totally clear and blue, except for clouds near the horizon.  Basically , it wa a totally clear sky, bright with sunlight.  Windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was checking on her flowers.  I saw 3 white spots in the sky slightly southwest of vertical (toward Duluth).  I thought they might be fighter airplanes which do pass over at times.  And I thought they could be white birds.  However these objects were very, very high or at least appeared to be and I could not see any definition in the shape as you might with a bird or plane.  My girlfriend thought they appeared triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first sight these spots were in a straight line and proceeding to the Northwest  by West.  I thought I might have seen a tether, but I may have simply interpreted the regular in line motion as tethered.  I was thinking of baloons.  But the fact was I knew that the objects did not appear as baloons or aircraft or birds.  The three spots were not shiny.  They were dead white.  They proceeded in a straight line as though on the wind.  I think the wind was in the opposite direction.  Very soon after first sight the objects moved in relation to each other, first appearing in the shape of an &#34;L&#34; with two fairly close together, almost touching.  But as the movement went on the three objects took positions at the vertices of a perfect equalateral triangle.  The triangle did not rotate.  There was no sound.  The motion was very steady as you see in a flight of birds.  As the white spots moved more to the Northwest, they stopped.  Abruptly.  The motion seemed kind of chaotic at that point, but reorginized and then began moving more or less straight south. It was then that the spots disappeared.  On first sight, with the objects in line, the appearance was quite different, but I would say the distance between the two outer objects or spots and the center was about the same as the distance between the points of the triangel shape later assumed.   If the points were tied together, the changing shape might have been that of triangle being rotated so that I just saw it from a different angle.  In the middle of this incident I got a cell phone call from my daughter about band practice.  That distracted me as I tried to get her to go and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Duluth Air National Guard security service at 5:45, a half hour after the sighting because maybe they had it on radar.  Of course, I didn&#39;t get any information and really, I was happy just to report what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that the thing I saw was white.  Dead white. Not shiny.  It didn&#39;t change direction quickly although it may have been going very fast.  It must have disappeared instantly.  I don&#39;t know how high it was.  Certainly higher than birds flying.  And. . . I have never seen any thing like it and I have never made a report before.  I am 67 years old.<n>

To the west of me, just above the tree line, I saw a small flashing white light moving across the sky at a fast rate. About 6 seconds later it stopped and went dark. After about 2 seconds it illuminated again and zoomed out of the sky at a very, very fast speed and disappeared. It was one object. I am 15 years old and I attend Briar Woods High School. I am a wrestler and a lifeguard at my local pool.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be a star and was visible for over 30 minutes. As I watched the object as i traveled it began to get closer and closer and i realized it wasnt mars or a star or planet. It then began to change from red to white so I reached for my phone to call my girlfriend and as it started to ring the object sped up changed directions and dissapered. I kept traveling westbound and approxemently 15 minutes later i went to check my driver side mirror and in the clearing hovering low over the ground was a large triangle shaped object with 3 solid lights. I did not witness the object after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My eyes are drawn to something out of place in the sky above sheep mountain. I stare at the light for a moment, trying to tell if it is a star or not, and then it starts to &#34;zigzag&#34; in a diagonal direction towards the desert floor. upon completing several complete zig-zags, it shoots off and does a very hard bank upwards in a vector seemingly aimed at a point very high in altitude above the test site. This is the first &#34;white dot/sphere&#34; I&#39;ve seen above this area of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to tell the distance this object was away from me, but I would guess it was over the very forward edge of the restricted airspace in front of the Nevada Test Site and the other military instillations located behind Sheep Mountain  Also, immediately after the light disappeared, I noticed two (airforce?) planes with very powerful strobes fly along sheep mountain towards Nellis Airforce Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Getting out of the car back home about 15 minutes later I saw the object begin moving east on a straight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was solid white with no blinking lights like planes have.  In fact, there was a jet (it did have blinking lights) in the same area going in the opposite direction and by comparison the object was moving much faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got inside, grabbed the binoculars, and got back outside, the object had moved out of sight.<n>

Stop , hover, roll, fast, slow. They were unbelievable.We have nothing that is that quick. I was playing a round of night golf with my son, who spotted them. He was so scared, he still is shaking. The way they moved was awesome, but what really was great were their lights. Brillant colors, all in circles, around the craft.Way brighter than any airplane lights, or for any lights I have ever seen period. They are what really have my mind thinking something is not right here. Because we just don&#39;t have that technology yet.Whatever was in the sky tonight wasn&#39;t one of ours.People will laugh, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it might be some balloons in the sky, but they did not bob and weave like balloons I&#39;ve watched float away. It sat still for about 3-4 minutes, then began moving very slowly to the south. It had no lights, and as it very slowly moved it seemed to also be moving up and away so that it became smaller and smaller. I was franticly trying to get my digital camera to work, but the batteries were dead, and every time I looked down at it, I could barely find the object again against the darkening sky. Finally it just drift completely out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Oddly enough, the coyotes were howling wildly until the object appeared. I looked up and just above the ridge near the Gold Mill was a very intense yellowish light, similar to a street light (yellow form). We watched the light and then shone a flashlight towards it and as we did the object rotated towards us and two lights were visible, though it appeared they were both attached to the same object. The object was no more than a quarter mile from our location, just outside the B-loop bathrooms. The object didn’t move or leave the area and hovered just above the ground with a dim light projecting below it in a search-like pattern. We both thought it might be a helicopter but when we realized how close it was and that it was making no noise we were puzzled. I realized I had my video camera with me back at the campsite and we both ran and got the video camera and my wife, brought them back up the hill and started taping. I was shaking badly but managed to get several minutes of video of the object which is clearly visible and close. At one point the object appeared to lower and then a single light came in view in the very place the object was before, it rotated and two lights became visible. We watched this thing for nearly 10 minutes and then it dropped below the hill. An orange glow could still be seen for several minutes. We walked back to the campsite, very confused about what we saw and quite honestly terrified. The orange glow reappeared on the horizon around 9:45 and we left the campground for a hotel. We are not, or were not UFO believers, but I cannot explain the totally silent object that we saw tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

All of this is guess work because I doubt I saw it for more than 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not hazy.  It was very bright and clear.  It appeared to me to not be very wide on its circumference, to have a slightly angled up surface about 1/3rd of the way toward the center and then flat to the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I exclaimed about it to my wife who was riding in the back seat of our C177 TRG.

I am interested in airplanes, and we live about 40 minutes away from Sky Harbor International Airport. I like to look at the different planes flying over our heads when I hear them, but when I was looking at a plane, I saw a white speck about an inch away from the sun according to me standing on the ground. It looked like a star and was really high. It didn&#39;t seem to move at all for about 30 minutes. I showed my dad, and he didn&#39;t know what it was. When we got home, I found a pair of binoculars and tried to observe the object from our backyard. I couldn&#39;t make out what it totally looked like because the binoculars kept moving a little. But I could tell it didn&#39;t look like a weather balloon or an aircraft. By then, it actually was moving but at a very very slow pace. It now seemed about 3-4 inches away from the sun. I then got our telescope out and tried to focus on it. When I got it, the image was really blurry but now up close it had a goldish shade to it. I picked up my binoculars again and looked at it, and it looked the same as before. Then when I tried to focus the telescope on it again, I couldn&#39;t find it again, but it was still in the sky. Me and my dad have witnessed a similar object about a year ago, but was in a different part of the sky. Who knows, maybe it was the same UFO revisiting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to turn in the sky when I first saw it, but as I kept watching it remained stationary for some time neither going forward nor backward.   We were driving so the object kept moving in the window and I had to really make an effort to pick it back up in the sky.   It was a clear blue sky with no clouds at all.   We exited to get gas and I lost it on the exit ramp and when we finally stopped about two minutes later, there was nothing in the sky at all.  It should be noted that there was NO air traffic in the sky at the time and there wasn&#39;t for some time after.  I did some looking online and my object looks exactly like the one posted for the incident outside of Stratford, CT on March 18th.  There is photo posted at http://ufoinfo.com/sightings/usa/070318.shtml.  It was cigar shaped and white with no other distingushing characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They did this three times, then came within 25 to 30 yards of the ship on an angle, and went back off the stern.  At first I thought they could be sea gulls with the light of the ship reflecting off of them, but when they came close and went off the stern, I could see that they were not birds, but dull lighted globes, or spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Also there is a small craft airport about 5 miles from my house in the opposite direction from O&#39;Hare. We also sometimes have helicopters fly by, at low altitude, as needed for the &#34;Flight for Life&#34; program for emergencies (example; car accidents). The reason I&#39;m telling all this is because being a star gazer, I know the usual crafts that fly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 23:00 hours I was letting my dogs out. It was a very warm and humid night with a very slight haze, no moon visible, but the brighter stars were visible. I could see the Big Dipper, so the slight haze wasn&#39;t much of a factor. Suddenly from the Northwest a very bright white light appeared in the sky. At first I thought it was an approaching &#34;Flight for Life&#34; helicopter. As the light passed over, at about the altitude you would see the copters fly, but there was absolutely no noise. There were no usual blinking red lights. The object continued flying to the Southeast, but then abruptly shot straight up into the sky at an accelerated speed before disappearing from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after it shot straight up, there appeared to be heavy cloud cover near the area it shot up at. When I checked the skies again about 30 Min. later, the sky was just slightly hazy once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say the observation time lasted about 35 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It suddenly appeared, lasted about 6 seconds and dissappeared after that.  It looked similar to white trails made by commercial air planes, but was black in colour and very sharp, not blurred like the white trails (looked like a beam or laser almost).  The odd thing is how it just suddenly appeared and dissappeared again within 6 seconds. It started from the east end of the sky and ended towards the west. The line didn&#39;t start to appear and become longer, it appeared entirely all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 seconds after it vanished, we saw a commercial plane that just came out of nowhere, starting to make a white trail, but the plane started by doing a very very sharp turn next to where the black trail started and then it flew back in regular linear trail...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just weird to see this plane pop-up out of nowhere, doing a very sharp turn (for a commercial air plane) and starting to leave a white trail instead of having a linear trail already following behind it.  The plane seemed very high in the sky(35,000ft+), not like in just took off from an airport .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anybody else seen these black trails in the sky? My girlfriend thinks it&#39;s normal and was probably made by a plane, but I told her how does a trail just suddenly appear out of nowhere and disappear again and on top of that, why haven&#39;t we seen blacktrails in the past (5, 10 or 15 years ago) ?

All the cat&#39;s in the area were following this somewhat invisible shape moving past our house. The only reason we saw it was we were gardening in our backyard. We could see the shadow it made through the slits of the fence but not when we looked directly at it over the fence. We have seen and heard cloud cover come in over the airport in minutes time and heard high pitched sounds during those cloud covered times.

And we all watched 2 F-16 fighter jets fly overhead in a alert formation which is unusual in this area . Shortly after the jets came a solid black helicopter flying west in the same direction . Then the jets passed by another 5 or 6 times heading west as well . This all took place inbetween 10 am and 11 am , I havent heard of any airshows going on in my area and thought maybe they could have been scrambled for a reason . If there were any sightings in my area around this time and were reported this may be the reason for this .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I know this as i looked at the clock several times. It was travelling at speed for a brief time then stopped and hovered. it had a central light bigger than the other lights and it pulsated at irregular intervals and at varying brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell it was spherical by the lights on either side of the central light. After about five minutes it drifted slowly south and became a tiny star like dot as it moved. During the encounter i stood up and stared, blinked ect so as i knew i wasn&#39;t imagining. The central light also moved from side to side creating an eerie sensation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that potentially i was being observed emotionally as i had aroused from a dream several minutes earlier and had been highly emotional and had cried. After this i looked out the window and there was the ufo. So perhaps they were formulating thoughts and actions however that would seem pathetic and ridiculous. However it did seem that they were attempting to get my attention for whatever reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Probable hoax.  PD))<n>

I went out onto my deck to drink a cup of coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small white light flashed in the distance (about the size and brightness of a star) – just a flash that lasted about ½ second. This light flashed at least 40 to 50 times and appeared almost random in the location it appeared in the eastern sky.  The duration of the time in between flashes also appeared random.  But from one blink to the next, which would have been only a few seconds, many, many miles would have been traversed. The path of the flashes was not at all straight – and it could not have been an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes after the lights stopped, a military jet flew overhead at relatively low altitude.  Although I live on the flight path of our county airport, I have never seen a military jet fly here - it was very loud and I&#39;ve never heard such a sound at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??

Quite often we go out for walks late at night and this is when we started noticing them.  They caught our attention because they aren’t like the other stars in the sky.  Different coloured lights flash very quickly (red, green, yellow, blue etc.) it’s hard to make out the exact colours because they change so rapidly.  They hover, moving up down left right very fast. A lot of the time they stay still in one spot then slowly move up or to the left, displaying no pattern.  I’m sure that they’re not planes or any craft that’s known to man.  I’ve spotted them a lot recently and it creeps me out. I’m going to save up for a telescope so I can get a better look at these mysterious hovering objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was defined and circular in shape appearing as if on fire or all lit up in a redish color. It made no sound as we watched it for at least 2 minutes.  As we watched it,it seemed to drift away and seemed to get smaller and smaller, then disappear. We do not know if it went behind a cloud, fizzled out, or just moved too far away.

I and my family including a wife and a 03½ year old daughter were going to the country’s capital Islamabad by road for vacation holidays. We started our journey from Lahore at about 05:30PM and had to travel a distance of 400 Km to reach the destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Taking two stopovers in the middle of the journey and approx. 45 Km from the destination, a strange phenomenon occurred during traveling at a speed of 120 Km/h when I suddenly picked up a red blinking light at an altitude of approx. 200ft, moving fast from east to west at a speed of a taking off passenger jet. We were traveling north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought that it’s an aero plane and for the attraction of my daughter who was sitting behind us on the baby seat, I said to her look there’s an aero plane in the skies. But as it approached more closely on the Motorway, it didn’t look like an aero plane to me and my wife. It was an orange colored object with a saucer shape and a red blinking light at the bottom and a glowing purple light around its circumference making an arc. I immediately slowed down my vehicle and brought it to 80 Km/h and recorded time on my watch as 09:30PM local time. As it further approached, we observed that it was spinning too fast more than the speed of acceleration. The first sentence my daughter said when she saw it, was &#34;Mom, I have seen it in the Chicken Little movie.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lowered my window to hear any sound as I was expecting a roaring sound from such a close distance but nothing was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had an eye contact with the object for more than 10 Seconds before it disappeared and we could not find its red blinking light neither the purple arc light any more.<n>

I have had an interest in military aircraft since the age of 14, I&#39;m now 32. I know the signature patterns of aircraft and helicopter strobes  and flight dynamics so the identification of an aircraft I can make instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an amateur astronomer for over 10 years and own my own 10&#34; Newtonian telescope with observatory so even the faintest satelite or space anomaly I can identify. To put it short, my eyes are quite well trained and not as easily fooled as the untrained eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a keen interest for most of my life with Ufology and have read many  if not most of the ufo literature available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read many case reports and sightings so I know what  could be easily described as a ufo when a logical explanation is available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heres my sighting,   I was standing by my patio door having a cigarette and my wife had just gone in  the bath, whilst smoking I noticed a black  object in the sky approx 3 miles away from  my home, at first it could be confused with  a hawk hovering at close range, but over a heavy populated area at approx 3 miles,  I think not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the object as my mind  was trying to rationalise what I was seeing to an object I could relate to, i couldn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black, no lights no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be oval shaped and on ocassions changed to a triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visibility was very good, clear sky with a few rain clouds to the horizon and a few brillant white clouds which were being illuminated by the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for an estimated 1 min 30 secs before accepting that this could be a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a 9 month old daughter and when she was born we decided to purchase a digital hard drive camcorder to film her growing up. I decided to fetch this knowing  more than likely that when i return the object will have disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned with the camera and noticed the object was still there, only now it was on the move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I powered up my camera and started to film the object. The digital display on the camera is approx 3 inches in size so I couldn&#39;t tell if i had the object in view or even in focus, but i continued to film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved over the trees and towards  the horizon and finally disapeared behind a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ideal reactions would have been to notify the local police of a potential unidentified object within a flight path and even contact air traffic control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reading as many ufo books as i have i know how important recordable data is, but strange enough i did what most general public do, i thought how strange and just sat down going over in my mind what i had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only plausable thing i did was to email Timothy Good straight away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the obect was quite far away, with a trained eye i could just about identify its shapes. We decided to watch the video to see if you could see the little dot in the sky and to our amazment we captued 2 mis 32 secs of the ordeal, and the footage  is very clear<n>

Four bright red lights in the southwest caught my eye. The lights looked like they were fused together yet you could see their individual round shape. They were horizontal in the sky and did not move, glow or strobe. I was telling my friend about it and that this was the first time I had ever seen anything like a UFO. I got and walked toward the fence and the lights went out like someone had turned off the switch. I did not see any dark image around the lights like a craft. I wish I had taken a picture with my cell phone but I was too excited and shocked since this was the first time I had ever experienced something unfamilar to me in the sky. A plane shortly after the lights went out flew in the same area and I was freightened by the size of the lights. I have been told by another that his friends, one living southwest and northeast of me saw the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had left work and had stopped at WalMart on 75th street to pick up a few things. When I came back out the front of the storm was just passing over so I got my camera out and took a few photos. They were on my camera a couple of months before I put them on my computer. When I was looking at them, one of the photos immediately caught my eye that there was an object on it and my first thought was &#34;What is that&#34; ! I zoomed in on the object thonking that it may be an airplane but there is definitely no wings or a tail fin. It appears to be either cigar shaped or disc shaped and either descending out of the storm or flying into it. I will supply you with the photo.

I noticed it when I was scanning the skies for other aircraft, like a good pilot should do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But something struck me as odd about this thing, beause it appeared to be flying. At first glance I thought maybe it was just a metal barn or something, but as I went along it stayed in the exact location on my left on the horizon, about 700-1000 feet away is my best guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I knew it was something that was airborne. And then I thought it might be a glider, because of its extremly smooth flight, but then I saw no fusalage, like a normal aircraft would have. And thats when I knew there was something very strange about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It maintained its realitive postion on my left on or very near the horizon. There were no speed changes, I tried to gain on it by putting in full throttle to get up beside it but it just stayed the same distance the whole time.  I tried to gain some altitude to get a more 3-D image of it but it climbed when I climbed. I did a dutch roll (tipped the wings back and forth while keeping the nose in the same postion, not changing course) facing it, just to let it know I was aware of it, and it did not respond, just staying horizontal and keeping the same distance (I was going around 90-95). Like I said, I could not really get on &#39;top&#39; of it to see a great 3-D image of it but I got a pretty good look at it and I would say it had to be a disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept questioning myself the entire time thinking &#34;is this really what I think it is?&#34; and then when I got over lake seminole I could see it above the lake and I knew it was in the air and REAL, no me seeing things. There were several boats and p eople out on the lake so I KNOW someone else had to see it, as we were over the middle of the lake, and it was a Saturday in the middle of summer at aound 1:20 in the afternoon, so there was lots of activity below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did glance down at my altitide meter and it read 2000 feet, and this was in the middle of the encounter. I could have lots or gained a hundered feet or so from the begining or end of the sighting but 2000 is the average alititude I&#39;d say. I would glance away from the object from time to time to scan the horizon for other aircraft but I never say any.  And when I was over lake seminole I radiod in at Quincy airport that I was over lake seminole and that there was a unidentified flying craft flying with me over the lake, hoping someone might come out to see for themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes on it till we got over the lake and then I glanced away from it back towards Quincy for only a brief half second and then glanced back toward where the object usually was and it was gone. No sign of it. I was kinda ticked at myself for not keeping my eye on it and letting it &#39;get away&#39;. But it had stayed with me so long that I was feeling complacent and kinda felt comfortable that it was going to stay there. And I also noted that 30 seconds o a minute after I lost it it started to rain lightly, as I notcied drops on my canopy. The best physical visual I can give you is if you a quarter away to you on your left at eye level. Thats what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me as I would like to know if anyone else has come forward from the lake below or whatnot.<n>

There was a rainstorm rolling in and the black object seemed to be just beneath. As it moved closer I was thinking bird or balloon, but I noticed it keep a direct path and even speed. It stayed directly on path over my building, about 150 feet up. It was flat and round, I could see that because as it traveled it seemed to tip over, revealing how thin it was, then back to flat. Then upon passing by my building and a few more, it stopped and hovered, then turned a semi circle to the right. I freaked at this point because it was going against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then resumed course away from me and I was at risk of loosing sight of it so I ran up to the roof to watch it. It was gone upon my arrival and I stayed for maybe 10 minutes looking for it. I returned downstairs to my deck. Upon return I looked all around and over to the right about 2 blocks down the object was back paralleled with my building and moving east bound again. Meaning, it had circled back, gotten behind me and down the street, and resumed a straight course while I was in transit from the roof. Unless it was another object. If so it was identical. Ive been watching for the past hour and have seen nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The car appeared to be abandoned with all four doors open, lights on, and the engine running.  The driver was found laying on the side of the road by law enforcement officers.  No word as to the condition of the driver.  Not 20 min. later, another transmission was intercepted from the Truth or Consequences Sheriff&#39;s office concerning a Jeep left in the middle of the north bound lanes of I-25, mile post 53, lights on, doors open, and engine running.  This time the driver was in the drivers seat, and the investigating officer reported he was in a very strange state of mind!  Be advised, the State Patrol was also involved in this investigation, and both drivers were transported to hospitals in the areas involved.<n>

It was the brightest object in the sky, brighter than Venus or Mars, white, very high. Clearly some kind of flying craft. I could not determine a particular shape, other than it resembled very bright star. It did not shoot across the sky, or flare or flash. The speed was constant. There was no sound, and no blinking lights. I spotted it at once as I walked out my back door, facing south. It was moving steadily eastward and upward. It did not disappear over the horizon. It faded from view into the night sky at about 80 degrees SE (I think that is the correct measure). If one looked straight up, then south down to about 80 degrees, then west to about 40 degrees, that is where I first spotted it. I followed it east to about 80 degrees, and that is where it faded into the clear sky fairly rapidly. I would estimate the sighting lasted roughly ten seconds. I would like to know if anyone else saw this. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was solid in shape, it made no sound and had many lights on the bottom of it.  Blue and white lights.  It was very large, bigger then a house. It flew just over tree tops and seemed to move with such glide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not be seen after going over the tree&#39;s. We kept driving for maybe 20 seconds to reach a opening of the trees.  When we reached a opening over a small lake they were gone. We had a good view of the sky now and there was nothing. they left as fast as they appeared. Neighbors said they were probable stelth aircrafts, I&#39;m not convinced.  But maybe.  It was a amazing experience I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/15/07 22:45|Elk River|MN||30-45 Seconds|Light that appeared, hovered, and promptly disappeared with no sound emitted at all.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73735.html|254|ndxe200706| Light that appeared, hovered, and promptly disappeared with no sound emitted at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just anchored the boat for some late night fishing. Within about a minute of our arrival on our favorite spot, a light became visible moving at a (relataively)slow speed. At first, it appeared to be nothing more than a bright satellite or other man made space object. But it soon became apparent that it was something more. The light grew increasingly intense, and our engine that had been running stopped abruptly. The light grew even more intense and the water and nearby forest was lit almost as brightly as it would have been during the day. The object moved across the forest and stopped, appearing to hover. All three of us were in a state of shock. The object emitted a near-blinding light. The object then proceeded slowly across the botom side of the lake and vanished just as quickly as it had appeared. We immediately left the lake and went back to our cabin. All three have sworn to silence, this is the first time that this information has been shared.! At first, I believed that this was an intense iridium flare and it only appeared to be getting closer because the diameter of the phenomenon was increasing. But I can confidently say that this was not an illusion and that the object was at a low altitude and very near to our position.  A hill visible about two miles from the lake was lit up entirely so that proves that the light was in between us and the hill. I have no idea what this was. It moved swiftly, slowed and hovered momentarily, then disappeared. There was no sound that was emitted from the object, and no trail left by it. No one else that we could see was on the lake but I am sure that a few othersmust have seen it. Two aircraft were nearby, one was an unidentifiable high-flying jet. The other was a small single or dual engined propeller aircraft approximately 3-4 miles away that appeared about five minutes after the object vanished. To note: I have always dismissed stories of extra-terrestrial beings and UFOs as! irrational and ludicrous. Therefore I am not considering this! inciden t to be a visit by some green skinned alien from outer space. I Believe that this WAS however some man-made craft or some extremely rare natural phenomenon. Scenario A seems more probably because the &#34;maneuvers&#34; the object performed seemed crisp and defined unlike something that would be a natural occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To summarize: The object first appeared to be am Iridium Flare or something of that kind. Next, the object became increaringly brighter to a pont where it was difficult to look at directly, The light was white, and white only. The object then leveld off near the lake at a low altitude; 2000 feet or less. Absolutely no sound whatsoever was emitted from the object. It then proceeded to move across the forest, and stopped near the lake. It hovered there, then moved across the southern portion of the lake. As it was in motion it disappeared in an istant. Gone, just like that. I have absolutely no explanation for this. At first it appeared to be an iridium flare, but the rest of the incident proves that it could not be. It was very low to the ground and moved silently. I follow aviation closely and know that the government produces advanced aircraft. But putting a massive light on a silent and stealthy airframe would make absolutely no sense. What in the hell could this be?<n>

My husband, who was driving, spotted a very bright light in the Western sky-almost looked like a spotlight.  It all of the sudden started flying over the highway and over our car.  We pulled over to the side of the highway and stopped.  There was no noise.  As it went over us, we noticed a very bright light at each point (3).  The craft was triangular shape and very big.  As it went over us, it had a red light going back and forth on the back of the craft.  It descended and disappeared into the trees.  Again, it made NO noise!  I called KOMU-8 TV station on the following Monday to see if anyone had reported anything similar.  The gentleman said that no one had.  I also called KMIZ-10, but the man I spoke to was very rude and I felt I was wasting his time.  I did no further follow up.

Then I noticed a smaller light flying on the same trajectory in front of the first light.  I thought it was cool to see two satellites at once.  At the time I didn&#39;t really think anything was any more extraordinary than that except for the fact that these two lights were traveling from south/east to north/west and any satellites I&#39;ve ever witnessed always traveled from south to north.  So I watched them until they became faint in the horizon then I looked overhead again and saw two more lights moving along the same flight plane as the first two but these two lights were very close together and were not moving in a straight line like the first two.  They seemed to be playing with each other, dancing around each other, and they were slightly larger than the first two.  They glowed a bit like the cherry of a cigarette, only a bit more pale.  I watched them! until they grew faint in the sky, then I looked back to where they had come from in the sky and I saw a line of these same lights moving across the sky.  I think there must have been about 25 to 30 of these lights together, very tightly spaced.  I watched for a second and then realizing that what I was seeing had to be UFO&#39;s I ran into the house to get my son.  He didn&#39;t seem to be as excited about it as I was but we stood and watched until they faded into the horizon. The line of lights behaved like the second set of lights that I saw. There were smaller and larger lights and they all seemed to be moving around each other.  I don&#39;t know much about how ball lighting behaves but if ball lightning doesn&#39;t move in basically a straight line like a formation then I don&#39;t know what these things were that I saw.  I know it wasn&#39;t any kind of aircraft or balloons, or meteors or comets or anything else that could be explained.

It looked like a funnel cloud about 100 feet tall and was approaching us from a northwest direction.  It was white/grey in color.  There were no visible lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving fairly fast.  I used my night vision goggles to get a better look at it.  I could then see two steady lights.  One light was at the bottom of the funnel and the other about halfway up the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed overhead, it looked more like a cone.  Once it passed us, it headed into a southeast direction, then immediately south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a third light moving towards the object at a greater rate of speed with my night vision goggles in the same direction; both moving south from Baghdad.  The object and lights then began to fade out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if this was a UFO or the International Space Station, since they began working on it I believe the same day. I&#39;m sure there were other people who saw it here also. It was dark and wish I could have taken pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  According to the schedule for the ISS, posted at www.Heavens-above.com, it was not visible from Iraq from June 9th to June 17th.  Hence, the object could not have been the ISS, which does not look cone-shaped.  PD))<n>

I was looking from a 6th story balcony from  the marriott ocean club in kaanapali, maui, and I was looking at this one colorful star ( it had red around the white dim lite and a greenish coming from the sides )  at the very top of the one mt.and the object  that i thought was a brite star or planet maybe -  started to move,it headed  down the mt. parallel to the mt.  where there are no roads, it came straight down slowly and then stopped and emitted a bright white lite ( not like a lite house - it wasnt a beam and didnt lite up an area around it that  I could see around it- as i was maybe a few miles (1-2) at most away from the base of the mountain)  but the lite was so big it glowed  a brite lite with a red fringe on it and green like sticks coming out of the sides in lites and then the bight lite went out and then it did the same thing three or four times in one spot as it stayed in one spot as it did that ( that was quite a time to be in one place for a plane or helicopter and the lite was really bright from such a distance and quite large for that distnace but the lite came from the middle of the object and didnt move around or anything it just glowed , but i could look at it but turned away to make sure of what i was seeing as i looked back at it  went out and then on again more than once , then it moved further straight down the mt. not glowing anymore but still you could see the main colors of it- it stopped and i wasnt sure where it was on the mt exactly but in the morning i could see it was most likely just above or around the high tension wires that are along the side of the mt. sideways . there arent any houses there and no road that leads up the mt. and there is a golf course below  the high tension wires but i dont k! now how far away the object was from the wires or the golf course . so it had to be somewhere abover the golf course and above where the wires are. It was dark on the mt but gets more lit up closer to the golf course and there is some constuction of a new marriott to the left side of the golf course but at 8pm it is highly unlikely anyone was working from 8pm on that nite. I did see some cars coming along a road up there near the construction but again dont know the distance from where i saw the object finally stop and the golf course or the road the cars were on. I DO know that from where the object started from on top of the mt there are no roads that lead down from the top of the mt. where this object came from . I found it amazing no one would notice such a bright lite coming off the mt. so high up and i was amazed that it was so bright when it was glowing on and off but it was high up the mt at that time but it was not a helicopter as they dont have such big lites on them and I wouldnt  think they fly after 8pm that high on the mt in the dark  and what ever it was certainly didnt move like a plane or helicopter. This object stopped in one place for quite a while maybe five minutes as it gave out the glowing  bright lite on and then went black and then on again and then off a few times. what would do that ?? i have no explanation of what it was , but what looked like a star at first way at the top of the mt. or  above the mt. moved straight down and then  what stops and glows on and off and then moves down and stops by high tension wires????. well,at that point  we had been up watching this for about an hour and when it finally just stopped and stayed in one spot somewhere above those high tension wires i watched as i had gone into my bed  with the shades of the balcony pulled all the way open so we could see it from our beds , my aunt was with me the whole time and we fell asleep staring at it as it just stayed in that last place for twenty minutes or more . a ufo ? i am not one to speculate and took all ki! nds of p erspectives of the mt the next morning and there is no road from the top of the mt. where it started from to where it first stopped and although they  are building houses much further down the mt near the others ,this object did not go to the point of where the lites were so we could see it better . I know it was something unusual and was told by the maui news who i called the next day (to find out if anyone else saw this) that on and off people do call aobut lites in Maui. Maui is a vortex by the way. I was also told by someone at the observatories that expeditions on foot have been made up the west maui mts and they found a pyramid of what they think is of alien origin some where up there - the mts are about 7000 ft high i think -?? does anyone know about that pyramid they found or was that a secret ???? I am not a person who imagines things or makes more out of something than what it is but this was not anything like I have ever seen before and I  kept trying to find something that it could be other than an unidentified flying object. I could just kick my self for not getting my camera but it was so unusual I couldnt stop watching it and getting your camera isn&#39;t something you just think of until afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

I was traveling east on the bridge over the 5 and 1 dam, and was stopped at the 1st stop light on the viaduct, which goes over the Cedar River, under interstate I-380, for a red light.  I looked over towards the Quaker Oats factory, and I saw something over the river, with the sun hitting it, and glinting off of the surface, which had to be metal, because of the bright reflection of sunlight bouncing off of it.  The light obscured the exact shape of the object, but I assumed it had some type of flat surfaces, although it appeared to be in a round or oval general shape, because at first I thought it was a balloon.  But the way the sun reflected off of it, and the fact that the glinting moved slightly-like the object tilted here and there, slightly, while staying in the same place, led me to believe it had some angular sides, culminating in a geometrical round or oval s! hape.  I knew it was not a balloon, because it stayed in the exact same place, and the only movement was this slight tilting around that I only knew of because of the sun glint moving around like off of flat surfaces that are tilting around randomly, but only slightly.   It may have been several hundred feet or more, away from me, and several hundred feet or more, above the river.  It was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter.  I looked around to see if any other drivers saw it, but they were looking straight ahead, when the shape was off to our left, plus I think the interstate overpass above us blocked their view, but I could see it because I was on the left hand side in the left lane (a one-way).  When the light changed, I circled around the 1st chance I got, but the shape was gone.  It seems similar to the post where someone saw something on 4-17-2008, because of the reflection, and that it was staying in one spot.  My mind could not and can not make sense of what it was, as I have never seen anything like it before of after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The flash looked like a fiery ball that then seperated into two blue-ish fireballs that appeared to chase each other in a tight circle in the very spot the &#34;explosion&#34; happened.The fireballs had long tails that form a circle when the chased each other. The fireballs continued to circle one another faster adn faster and closer and closer until they came together and exploded again in a larger blue-ish explosion. The fireballs then seperated, each going opposite directions, one appearing to burn out and the other compressing into a tiny star-like ball. The star-like object continued its path across the sky, looking much like a satellite, until it could no longer be seen. There were three other people with me, but they only saw what appeared to be the satellite crossing the sky. The entire episode concerning the firball-like objects lasted a mere 6-7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It wasn&#39;t moving.  I tried to photograph it, however the stage lighting caused too much of a glare.  The orange light was long, oval and on a slant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fixated on the light in the sky waiting for it to move, however it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting thing is that this isn&#39;t the first time I have seen this exact shape and color hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same thing a year ago in Norwalk, CT (nearby Rowayton).<n> <n><n> <n><n> And only 4 months ago, I spotted it again from the plane that I was flying home from Florida in one evening.  I videotaped the orange light from the plane with my digital camera.  This particular light was again orange, same shape, but not on a slant.  I&#39;d be happy to send the video it if you&#39;d like me to.  I tried to talk myself into thinking it was part of the moon showing, however it just didn&#39;t make any sense based on where we were.<n>

I sat down next to her on the bed preparing to explain away some story of witches or dragons when she told me this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that she was in a room with a giant &#34;hornet,&#34; but it wasn’t really a hornet but more like a mixture of a cricket and hornet. &#34;Like a praying mantis thing but taller.&#34;  She also said that there were other creatures, &#34;shorter, like three and a half feet tall.&#34; They didn’t look like insects but they didn’t look like people to her either. She also described them as having &#34;very black eyes.&#34;  She also noticed that shorter creatures where wearing shoes/boots &#34;like the kind basketball players wear.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She recalls lying down while they put some sort of tube or instrument in her ears; she also said that it was the reason for the &#34;bad taste in her mouth.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point she started to resist, she said that she fought off two of them, and then awoke in her bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to put aside my fear and concern and assured her that this was nothing more than a bad dream, but it sounds more like a typical abduction story.

I saw two bright white lights close together in the sky in the distance above the highway. There was also a much smaller, faint, flashing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer I noticed it was not moving or moving very slowly. I began to slow down and as we drove under it. I looked up again and I saw three white lights in a triangle shape. I have no estimate how large or how high it was. All I can say is that it was not low to the ground and was high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend got a better look than I did because I was driving. She rolled down her window and stuck her head out. She said it she could see a clear triangle shaped object flying North with a bright white light on each corner. I say it was moving slowly, but she says it wasn&#39;t moving that slow. Still, it was not as fast as a conventional plane. She also says the two lights appeared to join together into single object and formed the triangle. However, I believe that was just an illusion caused by the angle we were diving at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept looking back as we drove away and it was still there moving away. It did not make any sudden or quick moves when we were watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was plenty of traffic around and the Florida Turnpike was nearby, so there had to be many witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was close to midnight, the weather was fair, and there were almost no clouds in the sky. We live outside of town in a very rural area, with few other houses nearby. My father stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and let our dog answer nature’s call. I was inside and did not witness the event, but the doors and windows were open, so I could hear whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being outside for ten minutes, the dog started to bark in the direction of the woods behind our house. Then, a gigantic craft appeared from behind the tall trees in our back yard. It was roughly one-hundred-fifty yards long, fifty yards wide, and Y-shaped. The craft was flying two-hundred yards above the ground. It was accompanied by a very deep, low-frequency rumble/hum. Moving very slowly from west to south-east, it was clearly visible for five minutes, and eventually moved off out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father then came inside and gave me a description of this craft. The dog was still shaking and refused to go outside for the next few days. My father is a skilled outdoorsman, and has excellent eyesight, especially at night. The craft was below the clouds, so his view was unobstructed. The next week, my father and I were both inside the house. We had the doors open. Around midnight, we heard the same deep sound this craft made, moving over our house. Again it moved from the west to the south-east. We did not witness it this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/14/07 23:30|South Bend|IN|Light|45 MINUTES|We saw a huge light with a large craft behind it, low in the sky for about 20 minutes, then it slowly moved northwest|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57102.html|279|ndxe200706| We saw a huge light with a large craft behind it, low in the sky for about 20 minutes, then it slowly moved northwest<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were sitting in her back yard at about 11:30 pm on June 14, 2007. She noticed a large, very bright, white light in the sky and told me to look at it, wondering if it was a star.  This was in the western night sky.  I immediately said that was something unusual.  We positioned ourselves to face the light directly and watched it for nearly an hour.  We originally thought it might be a star, but it was too large and bright.  I told her that it made me nervous.  Was it a helicopter?  Or, a plane?  It was motionless for so long, that it could be neither.  Maybe it was a blimp, but a blimp wouldn&#39;t be out at this time of night and doesn&#39;t have a light coming out of the front of it.  It was obvious that a craft of some sort was behind the light.  We called our father, who was at his house nearly a mile west of us.  He and our step-mother went into the driveway and looked at the light.  He said he believed that it was Jupiter - that the planet was low in the western sky now.  We continued to watch the light and nearly 20 minutes later, it began moving in a northwesterly direction.  Our niece came out during this time and watched it with us.  Our brother came by and said it had to have been a hot air balloon flying at night.  This was not possible because the light was too large and the craft was behind the light, as opposed to above it. Also, the light wasn&#39;t a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light began slowly moving and became smaller as it headed northwest.  Within another 2o to 30 minutes, it was gone below the trees.  It was so unusual, though, because it hovered in one place (we wondered if it was over the Golden Dome of Notre Dame, as it looked like it was above the campus).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way it could have been a star because of the way it moved and because of the direction it took.  All the other stars in the sky, which were obviously so much farther away, didn&#39;t visibly move in the sky like this light did.  It was different from the movement of the moon, as the path and speed of movement were very inconsistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we looked at the light at first, it looked like a giant 5-point star.  There is a street light that shines in the trees near where we saw the light.  What we saw was much  bigger than the size of the street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called a local television station and asked if anyone had called in this sighting. He told me that we were the first.  I am wondering if any Notre Dame students saw it, as it appeared to be above the area of the campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I parked behind my apt and was walking around the side of my building.  I decided to stop and take a leak before I went inside (hey I&#39;m in Wyoming!).  I was doing my business and looking at the stars when I noticed to the NW a bright light.  To me it looked like an airplane as it was low in the sky and moving toward my direction.  It is hard to say how far away it was, but a guess would be around 5-10 miles.  Thinking it was an airplane I thought it was odd that I didn&#39;t see any blinking nav lights on it, so I countinued to watch it.  After around 3-5 seconds of watching it began to change trajectory and began going up at what must have been a high rate of speed.  The light went through a color progression changing from the white light to white/orange,orange,orange/red, red then disappeared.  The upward movement traveled of a span of around 2.5-3&#34; of sky.  I stayed outside for several minutes afterward waiting to see if more lights appeared or this one returned and saw nothing.  The night itself was beautiful, no clouds and very dark with many stars that help to tract it trajectory upward.  I am definately looking at the sky with more meaning these days!!!<n>

It almost looked stationary but after watching it for a minute or so I realized it was coming closer as it appeared to be raising higher on the horizon. This apparent movement is what really held my interest. As I wathched this light coming closer it suddenly and very rapidly moved to the right (northwest?). This movement covered a significant portion of the horizon but from my vantage point I was still basically facing west. After this apparent 90 degree turn and movement the light just sat stationary on the horizon. From this point the object did another 90 appearing to move straight down. This put it behind the tree tops on my horizon. It then seemed to bob around for a minute or so before making another sharp fast movement directly up. This once again put the light above the tree tops. Again this thing bobbed around for a few moments before its last big move. This final movement started from a close to stationary point above the treetops on the horizon , it steadily moved to the right again ,this time at about a 40 degree angle downward until it disappeared behind the trees then the horizon. The light did bob up behing those trees a few more times but never made another clear appearance. I checked my watch during this last sequence behind the trees,it read 2244hrs. I estimate this entire viewing lasted 4 or 5 minutes. I was not drinking , I do not do drugs , and I am on no major prescription drugs. The light was white in color and brighter than anything else in the western sky. From my location no sound could be heard coming from this light. I believe that thing was at least several miles away from my position. PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM RESUBMITTING THIS REPORT BECAUSE AFTER HITTING THE SUBMIT REPORT BUTTON I REALIZED THAT I HAD PUT TODAY&#39;S DATE IN THE EVENT DATE WHEN I ACTUALLY HAD THIS EXPERIENCE LAST NIGHT ON 14 Jun 07.

At first I thought it was Venus, but it was much too bright and almost looked diamond shaped. Below it I noticed a smaller twinkling orange &#34;star&#34; which  kept hoovering from side to side. Then suddenly  it bolted up toward the west. It continued to do this until it stopped abruptly and began to shoot down while completly orange like a fireball. The largerlight  light seemed to be moving almost as if circling. It seemed to be revolving.  Changing from big and bright to getting a little smaller, but still bright, then finally shining  brighter and having sharp points like a triangle.  It continued to do this for about an hour. The entire occurrence lasted about 2 1/2 hours moving slowly northwest until it finally disappeared completly from sight .  It was the most phenomenal thing I&#39;ve ever seen!<n>

It was a bright white light (with a slight yellow tint). I thought it was an approaching aircraft with its landing lights on, so we parked and watched it for a while. The light didn’t move as expected, instead it just hung in there in the sky so we decided to drive in it&#39;s direction. The light seemed to go from very bright to dim and back again. This wasn&#39;t the normal &#39;twinkle&#39; of a star, it was much slower, and the light was not pulsing in a normal interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove west towards the light. While driving we started thinking that it was Mars, but this thing was too big to be a planet. When we parked, I found a tower with red lights about a mile away to use as a point of reference, and the light we had been tracking was much higher than the top red light of the tower. Over the course of 30 minutes, the white light moved lower and lower (We could not see the light moving, but comparing it to the point of reference, we could tell it had moved). It would get so faint that it would &#39;disappear&#39; from our sight and then seconds later be back at full brightness. We saw a plane go by and when the plane got near the light, the light completely vanished. About 45 seconds later the light was back. By 12:00am, the light was below the lowest light on the tower (there were 4 lights). It seemed like it was getting further away, flying in a West NorthWest direction. All of the sudden, it was gone. It came back, as small as a pinprick and it could hardly be seen. Then, it was gone, for good this time. We waited a few more minutes and didn&#39;t see it so we drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was fairly far away and was not moving. It was much too high in the sky to be a helicopter. I called my parents out to look at the object. Already I was convinced this must be a UFO, because it was suspended in the sky and the lights were oddly very bright considering the distance of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father brought his binoculars outside. When looking through the binoculars, I could make out three distinctive large windows which the light seemed to be coming from. I however could not make out the definite shape of the object, so I assuming that the object was darkly colored, as it was blending into the night sky. The perception of the three consecutive windows did however suggest that the object was circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my mother and father and I watched the object for at least 5 minutes, taking pictures and such. Eventually, the object got smaller as it moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside smoking a cigarette. I happen to gaze up in the sky towards my neighbors house when I saw a bright, neon green light shoot across the sky at a rapid rate. My first thought was that it may have been a spotlight because we have casinos near by. I noticed that there was no light trail to the ground and that the object seemed to be BEHIND the thin layer of clouds. I looked for it to loop back in case it was a spotlight, but nothing ever came. I stayed out looking for it to come back or ANYTHING, but nothing ever came. There was NO NOISE to suggest it was a plane or any type of aircraft. It flew in the general direction of the air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I began to watch what i thought was a plane in the eastern sky. It had different colored lights that were flashing(red, blue, yellow and green) When I tried to determine direction of flight I noticed that it was stationary for the most part, but then it would make sudden erratic movements in all different directions. I thought I must be seeing things, so I waited for my husband to come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he cane out to the deck I asked him if he saw the &#34;plane&#34; to the east. When he saw it I asked him to watch it for a minute. He flies planes, so I figured he could explain what it was I was seeing. After watching it for a few minutes he asked me to bring him his binoculars so he could get a better look. By this time our daughter wanted to know what we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pointed out the lights to her, and by this time the lights were changing shape too, and we all saw what appeared to be colored &#34;orbs?&#34; shooting off sporatically in different directions.We noticed that there appeared to be a simular light formation on the horizon, also in the east, and another to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend who lives not far called about this time and asked what I was doing, I told her I was watching a ufo, she laughed, accused me of being on drugs, but went outside to see this ufo. I told her to look east, and find the plane, which she did, and I told her to just watch it. Her daughter came outside with her, and then her son too. This is when we all saw a flash in the sky, like  lightening lights up the sky, with out thunder, but very bright for just an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched this light show for almost an hour before the main light formation seemed to be splitting into two sections, first blue then red, but the whole time getting farther and farther apart until we couldnt see them any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw planes flying last night too, but it was almost like they were unaware of the light formation, which is strange since we live not too far from a military airbase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then an hour or so later, we experienced power outages and power surges lasting only a few seconds, but enough to cause a blow out of surge protector for one of our computers. Dont know that it was related at all, just kind of coincidental.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object did not have any wings and appeared to be glowing a white radiant white light all around it even in broad daylight it was very bright. As it proceeded north it began to disapear slowly into the blue sky. I was watching commercial airliners all over during this time and this was not a airliner I am sure of that much. However it seemed to be about the same size as one but with no wings or markings. Airliners don&#39;t glow except when the sunlight is reflecting off of them. This was not the case however.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about 3 miles in front of me on the south of the highway and appeared to be shaped like an aircraft (minus the wings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not understand why an aircraft would be so low and so far from the airport, but figured it could be some strange personal aircraft over a residential area.  As I approached (nearing the State Street exit), multiple vehicles on the highway were braking to look at the strange object.  Once within a ½ mile of the object, I knew it was not an aircraft (at least not a “normal” one).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a torpedo: silver and shiny with “fins” on one end, but no noticeable “cockpit” areas. (I think there may have been a very skinny “window like” opening on the bottom.)   After this closer inspection, I thought that it could be &#34;a skinny blimp&#34; or &#34;weather balloon&#34;, but again, there were no noticeable windows NOR an engine or propellers.  Additionally, there were no flashing lights and it held completely stationary in the sky. There was NO MOVEMENT at all despite tree blowing in the breeze. As I passed it perpendicularly on the highway, I studied the space below the craft for a tether, but saw no indication that it was attached to the ground. As I merged onto I-15 (northbound), I looked in my rearview mirror and was still able to see the craft hovering in what appeared to be the same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that the object was about 75-100 feet above the ground and approximately 20-25 feet long.  This was around 7:35 am Mountain on June 13, 2007.  My co-worker said that there was no such object in the sky when she drove the same path approximately 30 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I realized they were not stars they started to gather in a linear formation.  I ran into the house and woke up a second witness to watch what was occuring.  The second witness went and got a video recorder to film the event taking place.  The objects then started to disappear backwards into the darkness of the night sky.  The objects colors didn&#39;t flicker or change color. The whole sighting lasted approx 6 minutes until 23:36. There was no sound that humans could but the area animals were reacting , no trailers from behind the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He pointed out the multiple (probably a dozen) Red/Orange lights in the NNW sky which seemed to be moving randomly about, but obviously together in one section of the sky.   All five of the vehicle&#39;s occupants got out and witnessed the lights while standing outside of the vehicle.  The sky was otherwise very dark. While the movement of the lights seemed somewhat random, there was also a cohesiveness to them that indicated that there was a connection of some sort between them.  They were not moving in any logical pattern, nor were they moving in such a way that could be explained by the normal flight paths of typical aircraft. They hovered and moved up, down and sideways across what appeared to be great distances in a very short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not aware of a military facility near Walla Walla, but we believe that the first possibility to rule out would be airborne flares.

I was smoking a cig. looking up at the sky in the northern direction.  I could see many stars in the sky when all of a sudden a star like light appeared out of nowhere.  At first I thought it was an airplane because it looked too low to be a star.  Then I noticed  how fast it was moving and thought to myself that it was moving awful fast for an air plane.  It was moving in an horizontal direction, I believe towards the west.  Then I thought it might me some sort of military jet because of its speed and camp Grayling only being about a 30min car ride or so.  Then all of a sudden the light started to produce trailers that looked like large sparks.  Then I thought I was going to see a plane crash and then the light just disappeared.  I saw no sign of it nor could I locate it in the sky.  The only explanation  I could come up with was maybe a comet but it would seem that if it were we would have know about it before hand.

Being an amateur astronomer I knew there was no star at that location. The magnitude of the light was similar to Venus and about half the size. It remained stationary.

It appeared to be a couple of miles away at a 20º angle. At first glance, I thought it was a plane, but when it didn’t move, I got my binoculars for a better look. What I saw was remarkable. To the naked eye, it appeared that it was an object with lights on it and was stationary. When I looked at it through the binoculars, I saw an object, made of red, green, and golden lights. They jumped around and changed shapes. At first it was circular, then elongated, then it stretched from side to side, then it extended into an arch, zig zagging, spiraling. Back and forth the lights changed shapes. I wondered at that point if my hands were shaking causing this to happen, so I steadied my arms on the deck railing. The lights continued to transform into all different shapes. What was interesting was that the lights were very bright, almost neon in nature. I called for my husband to take a look, and he was perplexed as to what it might be. I don’t know what we saw last night, but it was extraordinary. We watched this for about five minutes, then the clouds rolled in obscuring our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing the star, Antares, which is in the SE sky, currently, at approximately 20 degrees angle of elevation.

I tried to ignore the sound until several minutes had passed and it still had not subsided.  I decided to investigate and went out on my 2nd floor balcony, which faces northwest, only to find nothing within my viewing range and the sound fading to nothing.  Directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away.  The two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them.  I have a good view of the northwest sky and an extremely bright star (I’m not sure what it’s called, but it isn’t the north star because it moves beyond my viewing area late at night.)  I decided to smoke a cigarette while I was outside, and after several minutes I could see two objects in the distance, which I thought were planes because I could see red and white lights.  I continued to smoke until I noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight, the silhouette I observed appeared to be a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it.  I did not hear any sound or see any headlights or green lights, and I my adrenaline was pumping as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  I live near SFO Airport, so planes are regularly flying overhead.  I then noticed that the second set of lights also appeared to be on a sphere shaped craft and both craft were flying in the same direction at approximately the same altitude.  I watched as both craft appeared to fly in a straight line due south until they passed out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lit up another cigarette, I reflected on what had occurred and attempted to logically explain what I had seen.  Not even two minutes later, something else caught my eye further north.  A triangular craft that appeared to be slightly larger than the spheres came into view from behind a tree.  It looked black (but it was difficult to tell with the twilight fading) and it had the same red and white lights, but the white lights seemed to be arranged in a rectangle from my viewpoint.  I didn’t notice any sound, although I may have been too distracted to notice.  I watched it head slowly toward the direction of the two spheres flight path.  As it passed out of view, I frantically tried to call friends that lived south of me, but none of them picked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I genuinely hope that someone else saw this or can explain what I did see, because after talking with my friends, I know that I won’t be able to talk to people about this without some kind of corroboration.  I have no photos and no other witnesses where present, just an unbelievable story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Definite movement against the stars and below the moon.  I had spotted it first because of it brightness and clarity of shape at night.  Unfortunately.... there was a report on CNN that the International Space Station could be seen with the naked eye that week at certain times in N. America.  After checking the NASA website for time and location, I was shocked to see the object for the rest of the week in the same approximate location with the exception of one very cloudy night.  Same lights behaving the same manner.  It was at first weird, but very cool nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a dark - metallic look to it, and appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  It moved in a perfect straight line across the sky, when it was towards the middle of the horizon, it looped around and made a small , perfect, circular  motion and then continued on its normal flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the elevation it was at, it had to have been far faster than any aircraft, however, it wasn&#39;t so fast that it was a blur.  It cleared the entire horizon in about 60-90 seconds.  There was no blinking or flashing, no sounds, and no exhaust.  The sky was perfectly clear so I could observe it very well.  Also, although it was circular, when it was directly above my view, I notice it did have slightly contoured edges.  Kind of like a more compact, and curved boomerang, however, the &#34;wings&#34; or triangualr shape was very subtle and could only be observed when it was directly overhead.<n>

I took my digital camera and binoculars along.  It was between 09:30 and 10:00 a.m.  On the way to the river, I had to insert new batteries into the camera, but I didn&#39;t update the time, as you can see in the picture it shows in the afternoon.  I put my camera atop the binoculars, looking through the binoculars making sure there were no birds in my view and taking random shots of the sky.  When I uploaded them on my computer, this round object was in one of the shots.  It didin&#39;t appear in any other shot.  I didn&#39;t see the object with my binoculars or without them.  There was no sound or lights.  It was a clear day with a few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They look like bright stars, but move incredibly fast (changing direction suddenly).  We did research on the internet and some speculated that they were the ISS and/or satellites, however neither of these are applicable simply because of their rapid movement and extreme course changes.  I have no idea if we are seeing these due to our proximity to White Sands Missile Range, and this is mere coincidental speculation anyway.  My wife used our admittedly lower quality telescope, and the objects moved so fast they were leaving a &#39;streak&#39; and very difficult to track and focus.  We are and have been avid skywatchers since childhood.  While I would like to find a perfectly logical answer to this, the simple truth is that in my 54 years I have never observed anything like this.  The &#39;stars&#39; are unusually bright.  What my wife did glimpse is that the object looked round at first, and then changed shape (at this time she could not be more specific, however we will continue to watch and hopefully be able to provide more information).  A higher quality telescope will be in the future as well.  The most interesting of these objects appeared left of the moon last summer (June).  These objects are the last to vanish from the dawn sky, lasting much longer than the stars.  Any further commentary would be speculative which is not the purpose of this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In a partial sleep, I heard my husband clearly call my name. I quickly got out of bed and went up to check on him but he was sound asleep. I came back downstairs and as I got back into bed I saw a flashing light in the corner of the guestroom window. At first I thought it was lightning but I knew I hadn&#39;t heard any thunder and that a storm was not expected. I went to the window and pulled back the shade and stood in front of it and in the rear pasture (about 500 feet away) I saw very large flashing white lights and it seemed there were smaller lights that were trajected out from the larger lights that were flashing at a faster rate.  (From looking at photos on the internet of UFO sitings, it may been not flashing lights but a craft turning fast -- though they appeared to be flashing.)There was no sound at all. It seemed to be a craft but I couldn&#39;t see a craft -- only lights --if the lights were attached to something, it seems that the craft should have been round. I guess my first thought was that it was a helicopter but I soon knew this couldn&#39;t be the case as it was much too large and didn&#39;t make any sound at all. It moved across the pasture and closer to the house and at the end of the pasture (about 300 feet away) it appeared to come down and to try to land. It was only at this point I became frightened.  But then it quickly raised up into the air again and went off behind the house where I couldn&#39;t see it any longer. The smaller flashing faster lights continued to be on the side of the house where my window was for another 5 to 8 seconds. I went to the back of the house but by the time I arrived there, I could see no more lights and was too scared to go outside. The next day I went out to the pasture but saw no evidence of anything that was visible from a landing or an attempted landing. My impression was that it wanted to land, somehow detected me, and then decided not to! land. P erhaps an electrical or energy field that it created by being so close is what made me hear my husband&#39;s voice wake me up. It was clearly not my husband who was fast asleep upstairs and I still don&#39;t know why I woke up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t contact authorities in the area as it is rural and no one wants the local authorities to think they might be crazy. I&#39;ve not been able to find any reported sightings in this area on that day other than a possible one in Canada and a possible one in Connecticut, but nothing nearby. And I &#39;ve not been able yet to find a description of a UFO siting that sounds like what I saw. There are not that many sitings in this area of upstate New York anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was trying to find the big dipper, when I noticed that there were two stars, that didn’t quite fit in. It was only a fraction of a second before the two unidentifiable stars were in motion. When I noticed that there were two stars that were moving, I thought that perhaps hallucinating because I was tired from being up so late. I studied the objects in motion for a brief moment when I realized that there was a third star not too far ahead of the two, also in motion. The two stars were moving at the same speed, in the same direction. The third star (in front of the two) was also moving at the same speed, in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my 3 friends who were out there with me to take a look and pointed them in the direction, and they were just as amazed as I when we realized that as the “stars” were moving through the sky, that the actual stars in the sky, disappeared, and the reappeared after the moving “stars” had passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When placing an imaginary line to get a shape of the moving “stars”, you were looking at a triangle. The triangle was enormous. It was moving at an extremely slow speed, and was obviously a solid object, because as previously stated, the actual stars in the sky, disappeared as the object flew over the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend insisted that there was some army-base near by and that it was an aircraft. I had to disagree because the object was larger than any aircraft we have in the area, and said that its 1 o’clock in the morning, and that there are no army-bases testing aircrafts in the local neighborhoods in the middle of the night! Also, aircrafts give off three different colored flashing lights; one red, one blue and one clear (bright). Aircrafts don’t fly in sync unless doing a performance, which we don’t have in this area. Aircrafts also don’t fly in the same direction for more than a few seconds until they fall out of line because they are going to different places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object took about 10 seconds to be out of sight, but that was only because it flew so far into the distance, and we weren’t able to see past the surrounding area. The direction it flew was NNE, towards some of the back roads. (There is an airbase located in the area, however the object was larger than the base itself.)  Using google earth, I am able give you enough information to get a visual of how large the object was.  If you can get yourself to;  Pointer    37°46’32.34” N    89°15.05.45” W elev. 397ft streaming 100%  eye alt 4455ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will give you an image of the airbase.

The object was increasingly more bright with each flash after about 8 minutes before slowly dying out and then stopping.  For the next couple of minutes it slowly flashed every 3 or so minutes, and then stopped at about 1:10AM Pacific time.  The shape was an egg.  It was a little longer than wide.  They moved slowly across the sky extremely slowly (if at all). There was 1, possibly 2 or 3. But there was 1 for sure, other smaller flashes were close to the brightest object that flashed. It was not very high in the sky.  The flash was distant.  It was a very big flash.  First I thought it was a plane, but the flash was too big and too bright to be a plane.<n>

The light would blink brightly on and off from the same location. Then I would see nothing until it faded back into sight with the intensity of a bright star (as bright as Venus) but very focused in intensity as if a giant spotlight was pointed downwards. It glowed for about 4 seconds with an intensity similar to a bright white halogen light but very powerfull since it appeared the object was very high. I got the impression it was very high up but I was unable to tell for sure how high. My first impression of the altitude was about 40,000 or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10 minutes later in the same direction a spotted a fast moving ball of light that shot across the sky from the east to the west. It was visible for only a  a second. It went the speed of a slower meteorite but showed none of the common characteristics such as  breaking up in the atmosphere and changing colors and flickering until it fades. This object had a white glow with a hint of green and blue but it happened so fast I can&#39;t totally be sure of the precise color. I am very sure this was not a shooting star because it&#39;s size would have created a fireball of some form it was very even in Luminescence and seemed to be unaffected by the atmosphere or was up too high for any air friction.<n>

He says hey look at that. I looked and it almost looked like to me a shadow like u.f.o but it was a balloon. 20 minutes later he goes whats that in the sky and it looked like a candle like light bulb going as fast as a balloon floating in the sky we saw ealier and was very,very high in the sky. I like what is that, I was looking trying to get what ever it was attention saying stop and trees were blocking the view when my camera phone was focusing. Tree ending up blocking my view. So could not take picture. All the sudden my friend said it&#39;s only a plane and I was looking I am like thats no plane I started scream stop,come over here, and then tree blocked the view and then I went in my front yard and I was like holy cow it was still moving I still had my cellphone and tried to take another picture and it was a open view no trees this time to block the view. Then it looked like it slightly bursted when it hit a light shaded cloud. My friend was like did you see that I never saw anything like that. Then I siad lets wait here it might be back. Then my friend said forget about it it&#39;s gone. I reported stuff I saw in the past. What I think what this stuff is are goverment experiments or Holograms. If it was really a U.F.O. I think it was following the balloon like it was studying it. I took a picture of the cloud it hit. Like as if maybe there a vortex to bring the light back to the dimmension it came from. I think it noticed that I was gonna try to take a picture of it so it burst once it hit cloud. I saw a shadowman with snake tongue in the past. I saw a 1950&#39;s type U.F.O. before. I saw liquid moving all around the sky. I am sick of seeing this stuff. Everyone I tell don&#39;t beleive what i saw. I saw other minor stuff also. When the goverment gonna stop with this. I know I am not crazy. I am just gonna blame it on the goverment. Lots of people report this stuff all the time. I was scared a little t! hinking once that light burst like that is that they went to land somewhere. I saw a movie called Night skies 4 weeks ago what gave me that idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see a few stars in the sky; and it was slightly larger than the stars.  I didn&#39;t point it out to anyone else, even though there were a few people seated near me.  The music was quite loud, and I would have had to shout.

At first I assumed these were large soaring birds such as eagles or vultures, but as they moved across the sky from south to north, I could tell that they were too large and symmetrical to be birds, and that their movement was too even.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed by at their closest point to my view (directly to the east from my building) I was able to look at them with binoculars, and could make out what seemed to be 4 lobes, somewhat shaped like a compacted clover shape, which made an overall diamond silhouette with rounded corners.  Given the lowering light, and that the objects were backlit against a brighter sky, I couldn&#39;t see any surface details.  I called my wife in from another room, and she was able to see enough to realize that these weren&#39;t birds, or (commonly seen) aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I counted 3 definite objects of this description, and a possible 4th as well.  However, this 4th object I did not see until the group had traveled much further to the north, and had become too distant (small in perspective) to be sure it was of the same type.  Of the 3 I have more certainty about, 2 were closer together, with the 3rd about double the distance again ahead and slightly above the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects&#39; movement was rather fast, but very smooth and silent and steady to the north.  While the movement of these objects seemed somewhat balloon-like, the complex shape keeps me from any definite identification.  I did some Google image searching for weather and radar balloons, but did not see anything remotely similar to what I saw in the sky.  I also have not seen any other mention or explanation in the local media.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not witness any lights, odd movement, or other classical &#34;UFO&#34; behavior from these objects, but they are flying objects that are unidentified nonetheless.<n>

Our area has a large lake with mountains surrounding the lake.  The lake is at an altitude of 1130 feet above sea level (according to Google Earth) and our home is about 1710 feet above sea level, or 580 feet above the lake due west of Kelowna and the bridge crossing the lake to the west side.  I cannot get a cloud level, but the mountains in the area are about 5,000 feet above sea level in the area where the object was moving towards and the clouds were well above that level.  I will try to find the bottom of the cloud level should anybody be interested, but have tried and only received answering services from weather, TV, radio phone numbers called.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I went onto our deck and watched this object for about two minutes as it flew in a northerly direction, stopping many times, flying left, right, up and down in an erratic pattern as it moved north heading over Kelowna and off into the distance, going into the clouds, and coming back out, and finally disappearing into the distance behind the clouds.  My wife watched it through binoculars while I took 4 still pictures and one video.  You can see the object in several of the still shots and in the video, but not too good.  My camera is a Cannon Power Shot SD550.  I’ve drilled down on the computer to see the object closer in the still shots and there appears to be a triangle shape inside the round sphere.  The object was very, very shinny, and the weather conditions was mostly cloud cover, and only a little area where sun came through, however it looked as those the object was a mirror reflecting the sunlight that was not there.  It’s apparent size was smaller than the moon at over head by less than half that size, but larger than any other object we’ve ever seen such as Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or any such objects.  It appeared to be considerably larger than a small aircraft when it was over Kelowna, something which we are used to seeing in that direction as that was the direction of the airport.   However, it did not go towards the airport, flying finally in a NE direction. In our opinion it was flying many times faster than any aircraft flies through the valley, including commercial jets or private jets, and as I said, in a jerking motion.  There was no noise that we could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have called the local radio and TV station and will continue to do so, but so far have only received recorded messages.  We have never ever reported things like this, and this is the first one my wife has seen, but not the first one I’ve seen.  I’ve never reported any other such things to anybody.  I am 62 years old, retired, well traveled, having owned many businesses, and I’m not prone to imagine such things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,  ((names and address deleted)) Place Kelowna, BC  P.S.

It was about the size of the full moon at zenith and quite bright with a white star-like spot at center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be moving so I ran inside to get my binoculars and was amazed to discover a lanceolate shape cutting across the &#39;cloud&#39;.  Satelites were cutting through the binocular field of view and it seemed to be about the same elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought was that something had gone very wrong onboard a sattelite, but it kept moving to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 60 minutes it continued on a northern trajectory until it passed through Cassiopeia, by which time the circular cloud was long gone and the lanceolate shape of its contrail was becoming quite diffuse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that it took an hour to travel that &#39;small&#39; distance makes me wonder what the heck I was looking at!<n>

Playing baseball in east Scarborough (20 minutes east of Toronto) near Pickering at a park very close to lake Ontario. I spotted the object from the outfield, looking east toward Pickering. I got the attention of about 10 to 15 of my friends, non of which take the subject of Ufos seriously. Although it was difficult to pinpoint, the object seemed to be about 5-10 kms east of us, along the shoreline, maybe a little further north. My guess was that it was somewhere near the Pickering power plant. It &#34;sat&#34; in one spot for the remainder of the time we were at the park which was about 15 minutes. From where we were the object was about 1/2 of an inch long, by about an 1/8 of an inch tall, and seemed to be only a few hundred feet above ground. The object seemed to be more rectangular than disc shaped. It was black in color. It was absolutley not a plane, a helicopter, a bird, a balloon, or a kite. It was a very clear afternoon with only a few clouds in the sky. Although the object was not very large, once spotted, it stuck out like a sore thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We ended up in a park just down the street from my ex&#39;s house, just hanging out.  It&#39;d been a really relaxing night, and in Buckeye, you can see the night sky a ton better than in Avondale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My ex noticed it first-- a really bright star kind of zigzagging in place, then my buddy saw it and they were both able to describe what was going on, so I knew he wasn&#39;t making it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all looked up and watched it for a while.  It was really far up, so it looked like a star, but it was super bright and it moved way too much.  It was way too far to be a helicopter or a plane, and even though a shuttle had launched a few days ago, it moved way too fast to be one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw two &#39;shooting stars&#39; that night, both within a few minutes of each other.<n>

Moving fast and straight from E-SE to W-NW at high alt<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2320 hrs., I was on the back deck of my house observing a beautifully clear sky.  I noticed a commercial aircraft making its decent and approach to St. Louis Lambert Field.  The airport is approximately 30 miles NW of my home.  It appeared the aircraft was heading to runway 30L at Lambert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The commercial aircraft had its nose light on, when I noticed a light that at first appeared to be a spot light in the sky.  It was moving fairly rapidly and straight.  I thought it looked like a flight of geese, in a similar formation.  Then I realized it was not changing shape like geese do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a triangle shape of lights that were not very bright.  One side seemed longer than the other and had a straight line of lights on the tail end.  It was silent and blocked out the light from stars it passed in front of.  It moved at a rapid pace faster than the commercial aircraft that would have been to it&#39;s left.  Had the pilots seen the object, it would have been viewed by the co-pilot at about a 1 o&#39;clock high position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unknown object then passed above the commercial aircraft and continued on a 290 course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent 20 years in the United States Air Force with over 5000 flight hours and know this was no aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and found him to be quite sober-minded.

After about 15 minutes of watching I noticed something coming out from behind the trees.  It was bright green in color with a red line going down the center of it horizontally, which also seemed to be some re-circulating light.  It was moving very slowly through the area where I had seen the fireworks and after this object appeared the fireworks ceased to fired.

I observed an object moving from the E/NE which looked like a plane at high altitube, or about 20-30k feet.  It traveled a short distance and then condensed to a tiny dot and then changed direction as if it was heading straight out of our atmosphere at a very high rate of speed. I was able to follow it for a few seconds but then it was out of sight. Less than 10 seconds late I observed the exact same thing;  same directions, same speeds, same stange occurance.

It continued a slow ascent away from us to the SE direction.  It would flicker from an almost imperceptible light until it flared up again like the light a star would give after dark.

While following the path of one plane I noticed a silver dot in the sky of which the plane had just flown under.  Having seen this perspective I was able to observe the silver dot hovering in a motionless position high above land then disappear in what appeared to be an ascet out of the blue sky and out of sight; straight upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This piqued my curriosity and I questioned if what I had seen was real.  30 minutes later an orange or copper colored dot appeared which seemed to be more observable than the silver object I observed earlier.  The orange dot was hovering when suddenly two white dots appeared into sight.  The three objects hovered motionless for some moments then swayed back and forth.  Hovering in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial thoughts were that I was seeing Mars(orange or copper color) and two neighboring stars.  I was skeptical only to the fact that I&#39;ve never observed stars in the daytime much less Mars.  It also seemed that the formation was shifting from a right triangle to an obtuse triangle which took away any assumptions of planets and stars appearing stationary during the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures of the sky using my camera phone.  The quality of the camera I don&#39;t think is good enough to have captured these objects digitally.  However if someone would like to examine them I took 5 or so pictures of the sky.  I also walked over to a life guard and pointed out what I was observing.  He had no explanation of what these objects were but did see them as well once I pointed them out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later the objects flew off in what appeared to be heading south in the sky.  Their departures were very swift and disappeared in what seemed to last less than a second.  I approached the life guard again and had asked if he still saw the objects in the sky.  He answered no and stated he saw the one object fly off.  As we tried to make sense of what we had just witnessed, another small white object started to appear.  This turned out to be a seagull&#39;s down feather descending onto the beach.  Our eyes had not been fooled.  These were not jets, clouds, or feathers.  Instead they mimicked the hours and hours of footage found documenting UFO&#39;s.  Which tells me that anyone with a trained eye can spot them.  They&#39;ve been around for a long time and will continue to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My mother confirmed the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked my mother to the car, and when I looked back, the light had disappeared entirely.  This instance was extraordinary in that there were no ordinary lights to be seen anywhere.  Moreover, the cloud cover allowed no other stars to be seen.  The night was exceptionally dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw the object, I believed it to be a star.  However, after further inspection, I believed it to be far too large and far too bright to be an ordinary star.  In addition, I believe that if it had been a star, it would have been shrouded by the cloud cover, and, as a result, would not have been visible at all, or would have been quite dull.  It was apparent that this object was beneath the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even more, the light seemed to be slightly pulsing. I stood and watched it for about ten seconds.

Our house sits one half mile off of a county road.  I was walking our driveway tonight as I do several times a week. As I was heading east a sphere of light appeared to come in from &#34;hyperspace&#34; to a normal flying speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading west faster than an airplane, but slower than a jet.  I would estimate my distance at about a half a mile away. I stopped to watch.  There was no sound. Where our house is located is a flight path for the local airport.  So I know that sound always &#34;follows&#34; an airplane. There was no sound ever. Then all of the local dogs in our area started barking. You can hear barking dogs from miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light started heading north, I kept looking for the light to change in intensity or disappear the way headlights would change on an airplane at different angles.

I noticed something revolving behind a tree like a child&#39;s top you spin on the floor.  I watched it for a few minutes, as I watched it I noticed it was moving back &amp; forth West to East.  It came out from behind the tree that was obstructing my view, I was amazed to see the shape of this object.  It was a bright silver and it was revolving mostly in the middle of the craft.  It was shaped sorta like an egg, but more or less flattened from the top. It hovered in the same spot for about 8 to 10 minutes. It was moving back &amp; forth for about maybe 3-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my camcorder &amp; filmed it while the view of it was still in my sight. It seemed to be staying ( hovering ) in one spot.  It was just sitting there hovering a brilliant shine off it.  I think the sun&#39;s rays was making it more shiny &amp; gave it more detail.  I went to grab another tape for the camcord, when I went back to film it.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this incident a few more incidents has happened.In the same area that I had observed my first sighting.  I was driving on Nevada Avenue 10-days after my sighting.  I noticed a craft moving from West to East over the mountain &amp; then move back from East to West at a very calm speed.  It keeped going in the direction towards Alamosa Colorado (Northwest).   In 2007 when Colorado was hit by a massive snow storm for Christmas 2007 &amp; the New Year of 2008.  Several witnesses including myself observed a craft hovering Northwest of Trinidad, over a-little town known as Hoehne 10-miles out of Trinidad.  The craft seemed to be studying our weather that fell on our town.  It hovered in the same spot for about 3-5 minutes.  It moved East to West, then it was gone.  The area I had seen the first sighting is closed off to the public.  No one is allowed up there, only certain vehicles &amp; people are permitted up there.  I was curious to go up &amp; see if I could find anything from the first sighting.  But they didn&#39;t allow me up there.  I will be submitting my video on youtube later this summer of 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While 3 of us were asleep, me and my 2 other friends lay awake talking. The tent was a 6 man tent with two wings, both having a sloping roof with a window. I happened to glance out of the window at around 1:00 AM, that is not exact but it is between 1:00 and 2:00. I saw a star, a bright star. I brought myself closer to the window, and my two friends neared also. The star was moving. At first it looked like a meteorite or shooting star, but they are both short-lived in the atmosphere but this light stayed longer. It started to move left slowly, then it sped up, then it stopped. Then it moved up and down fast a few times, then sped up again. Then slowly it grew darker and smaller, as if it was moving away from us. Then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As soon as I shut the door I noticed a bright light moving high in the western sky.  I initially dismissed it as a commercial airplane but the size and speed caught my attention.  It was moving faster than any satellite I have ever seen, and extremely bright.  Light was larger than a star and extremely bright; at least a magnitude -4 or -5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood in the driveway it passed from west to east almost directly overhead.  I have not seen a commercial airplane cruise at such a speed, and it was most definitely not a satellite of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Light was so bright I assumed for a moment it must be a small, quick plane with it’s landing lights on or a  helicopter, but as it passed overhead it began to zig and zag erratically, maintaining a fast course to the general east.  There were no sounds of prop or jet engines whatsoever.  It crossed from west to east in roughly 30-45 seconds, beginning to fade at around a minute and finally winking out high on the horizon.  There were no visible secondary beacons or green/red signals of any kind the entire time, not even as it passed to the east--just one single bright light on a shifting course.  Duration could not have been more than 90 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this around 1:00 AM Friday? I cannot explain what that light was. I am of sound mind and have better than average vision. I work in the aerospace field, and this was not any aircraft I could identify. I was not swaying on my feet; the light was definitely moving in an erratic manner. The magnitude remained constant until it began to pass lower into the eastern horizon. I could not make out any sort of structure at any time; it was too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can liken it too would be a double-sized Jupiter traveling across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1:06AM, I stepped back outside facing east. There were no aircraft I could see or hear, but within seconds a small burst of light caught my attention. I spotted a fast satellite moving south to north, flashing every few seconds. Before I could track that one for long I spotted another flashing satellite moving north to south. Both passed close to each other right overhead.  I have seen flashing satellites before, and are usually about magnitude +2; both of these were emitting far brighter flashes than that, I’ve never seen anything like it! It was almost more of a strobe. As soon as the first two passed each other I spotted a third, moving roughly SE to NW. All three seemed to be traveling fast for a satellites but I’m not an expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably nothing, but I still found it interesting to spot three strange satellites barely 15 minutes after sighting such a strange light in the sky.  I also understand that some satellites will flash reflect light, but still.  The clouds drew over within another 20 minutes.  I stepped out twice to smoke before 2:25 AM, and incredibly each time in a break in the overcast, directly overhead, I spotted another brightly flashing satellite moving south to north, just like the others. Weird!<n>

It felt out of place so I kept an eye on it.  On the opposite side of the horizon there was a star near what is typically the brightest star in the sky that was blinking red and green and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was now keeping an eye on the big out of place one and the one that was giving off three colors. Neither moved at all and during a span of 40 min I managed to see 2 meteors streak across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 40 min I started looking at all of the stars through my binoculars to see if any other ones gave off any green or red.  When I was finished scanning the less neck cramping stars I focused on a bright star directly overhead, then all of sudden it started moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to track it as it picked up speed got smaller and disappeared.  From the time it started moving it was gone in about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Completely in shock I turned around to see that the very bright out of place star that I kept an eye on for 40 min was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star with red and green never went anywhere so I&#39;m sure there is a logical explanation for that one.<n>

So it may have been something from Boeing -- who knows. But after six months living here, this is unlike anything we’ve seen, and we see a lot of flying craft passing over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:45 p.m. a flashing white light caught my eye.  It looked like a strobe light and was moving north to south quickly. I thought at first it was a police light but realized it was in the air, not on a street on Mercer Island as first thought.  My husband and I went out onto our back deck to get a better look, and the light suddenly reversed direction, moving from south to north.  My husband said, &#34;Oh my god, look how fast it&#39;s going!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light moved as if it were coming toward us (west).  Then it moved southwest over our house and disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was sounded like a plane, not a helicopter, but there were none of the blue or red flashing lights you usually see on plane wings; it was just a white light that would come completely on, the go completely off, so you couldn&#39;t see it at all in the split-second that the light was off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after this light disappeared, two planes appeared to the north and the difference was marked -- their lights appeared more yellow and they appeared to be moving much slower than whatever else we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, it was different, so there it is.

I saw two large lights at either end, as in wingtips, but oddly they were not flashing nor were they the green and red normal flight lights. Rather, there was a large white light on one end and the other end was a very odd amber-tinged white light.  Most striking was the intense flashing white strobe light underneath the craft with another one, smaller, also white, in back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I viewed the silent craft from behind I was stunned to see three oblong green lighted areas, subdued in color, but a lime green.  Never have I seen this type of lighting on any aircraft.  These lights, plus the odd gliding way the craft moved, convinced me that it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my bike around and headed north to follow the craft.  I took a road down to the water&#39;s edge so I could view the extremely bright flashing strobes of the craft as it glided over the Jamestown bridge and watched it as it went toward the old Quonsett Naval Air Station area, now used by the Air National Guard and private enterprises.  The craft was far too big, too low, and too slow to be anything conventional, disregarding the odd lighting on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similar craft over the Perryville, RI, area two years ago, but the lighting was different on it.  The same low, silent, gliding motion was present.  Someone surely must have seen this object as there was lots of traffic, both cars and boats in the water.<n>

I was standing at a console along with an being which was a vistor from another planet. I asked him how did they manover the craft and he showed me a panel with square controls and I was allowed to turn the one he pointed out, to my surprise we made an abrute right angle turn but I felt no motion what so ever in the craft. I then asked what did they use for purpollision and he showed me a clear tank filled with some type of clear liquid which bubbled from the centre outward. There were two being standing on either side of this unit. The unit appeared to be maybe two feet in higth and one foot in diameter. It was sitting on some type of table, but I cound not see any support for the table top. It just sort of hovered there you might say. This is the last thing I remember about the dream.

After being out there a short time I heard him yell for me. Annoyed that I had to get up and go out back (I was tired from working all day) to see what he wanted I was stunned when I approached him and he was pointing at a brite white object in the sky. He explained to me he had spotted the object and was watching it and noticed there were no flashing lights like a plane or helicoptor have on the outside, and the object seemed to be perfectly round in shape and all white (like a perfectly round ball of light). It was flying at a really high altitude, but still very visable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband does not believe in aliens and he thinks UFO&#39;s are probally just new top secret aircraft by the government.  However when 2 fighter jets scrambled and began after the object he called me out to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the white object in the clear night sky and I watched it streak across the sky in a straight path.  After the jets took off  (we live close to the airport) it went off it&#39;s then straight path and began to rapidly zig zag from one point to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, no known aircraft I know about could be moving like that. We watched the objects and the jets as long as we could, till the trees got in our way, and we then ran to the front of the house and stood in the middle of the road. By the time we got to the front we could still see the 2 fighter jets but the object they were pursuing was now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background on us: I am a medical assistant for well known doctor in Fresno.

What we saw was essentially the same as described by the other witness. The lights were observed in the WSW at approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. I was able to observe the lights through binoculars and they appeared to be two separate rectangular lights spaced closely together. I was also able to discern a third, faint, strobing light near the two rectangular lights. When the lights faded out the rectangular light on the right went out followed immediately by the rectangular light on the left. During the time of this observation through the binoculars there were three separate sets of these lights spaced evenly on the horizontal. The lights apparent size was that of pea held at arms length. It was impossible to estimate the altitude of the lights. No noise was heard, however the sound of the surf would almost definitely masked the sound of any distant aircraft. At the time I thought that they were possibly the exhaust of jet fighter aircraft as the aircraft were flying at level flight at an angle directly away from my position, however the lights reappeared three or four times in approximately the same position over a period of several minutes. This, in my mind, rules out that hypothesis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, a single light appeared slightly to the south of the original lights at roughly the same angle above the horizon. The light remained stationary for approximately 2 seconds and then expelled a similar light from the left (my left) which quickly descended approximately three times the width of the original light as if it were in free fall then both lights faded out simultaneously. Initially, I thought that this might have been a flare dropped from an aircraft, however the short duration of the light is not a characteristic of a military-type flare. One or two minutes later another similar light appeared in roughly the same position as the one previously described. About one second after it appeared the light seemed to streak to my left (east) a short distance and then quickly faded out. When the object moved it produced streaks of light behind it (opposite the direction of travel). That marked the end of the observation. Nothing further was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Captain in the Army with 18 years of service, have served in combat and I have a B.S. in geology. The other witness has served in the military, is a combat veteran and has a degree in and currently practices law. We both agreed that what we witnessed was unlike anything ever observed by either of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It is about 10:23 P.M. on June 06, 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both educators with Masters Degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am describing an object that my husband and myself both see in the sky that has very bright pulsating lights that appear to have a shape not unlike a cross.  Long thin irregular  beam-like tenical shapes radiate out in several directions with one of the beam-like shapes splitting on the end not unlike a strand of hair with a split end.  The beam-like shape with the split end appears on the left side of the aircraft as we are viewing it looking up into the sky.  It is fascinating to look at.  The craft has a muted haze around it and is moving very very slow in what seems to be a westward direction.  Red lights appear on the top side of the craft then disappear and then blue lights appear near to the red light area and disappear as well.  They appear to be attached to something my husband describes as tenicals hanging down.  The aircraft appears to be quite huge.  The bottom has dark shapes and helps to identify a middle shape that at certain times appears rounded.  It appears to have sides that slope upward from the bottom which at certain angles appear box-like in shape.   A red light appeared on the bottom that seemed to run in what looked like a section down the middle of its bottom.  The light appears to be 20 times brighter than our normal heavenly stars.  The craft appears visually to be large enough to hold at least 20 stars inside it.  It is huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times the aircraft seemed to be hovering and tilting a little.  It also appeared to move toward us smoothly and quickly for a short distance then it would appear to stop moving towards us and continue in a westward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that our normal heavenly stars appeared to be dim in comparison to the intense bright light coming the aircraft.  It was almost as if the aircraft was using the light from the stars to make its own light bright and the normal star’s lights to dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion the strange aircraft was interesting and fascinating to look at and watch because it was so unusual in the light shapes and the various light activity as it hovered and slowly moved in the sky.  It moved so slowly at times that it appeared to be standing still in the sky.  My husband and nor I have ever seen anything like it.  It was incredible.  Even though no true detail could be seen like one would be able to see if it were daylight and the aircraft were to be close or whatever it was amazing to experience the indicated shapes through light and dark shapes.  I would like to know what it was.  It was a neat experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Husband watched it for about an hour after I came inside to report it.  He said that it was still there when he came in and seemed to still be moving slowly in a westward direction.  We are located east of the city of Morehead Kentucky in the country.  Morehead Kentucky is located in Southeastern Kentucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of a celestial body, we suspect.  PD))<n>

He pointed it out to the rest of us thinking at first that it could be some sort of spotlight from a helicopter or plane. Within a minute or two the light suddenly dissapeared and reappeared in seconds above the coast line to the right of it&#39;s original location. This flashing from left to right went on for approx. 5 or more minutes. There was no sound, no flashes, no type of trail as though from any form or flare or fired round. The lights stopped for a couple of minutes and then reappeared more extravagent. I personally witnessed the light appear over the ocean and then another orb seemed to stretch out of the original. The cloned orange orb moved faster than light to the far right and then in a quick spinning type motion the light stretched and lines appeared in it. Those went away and then suddenly 4 different ones appeared with the last one to remain being in the same spot as the one that had spun. That one two spun and they all vanished. This lasted from the time we noticed it for about 34 minutes central time. There were no planes, no helicopters, no jets, etc. and no sound at all. I never believed in anything and am still not sure of what it could have been except that of a UFO considering the fact that we can not identify it. The beach was full of crab hunters, so others who may not have been focused upon the beach could have witnessed this as well. We did observe these through bonoculars, however by the time we thought to grab a camera the lights stopped. I guess our word is all we have though the lights stayed long enough to get plenty of pictures, I think we were all more stunned than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

I looked up and saw a round, very, very bright light moving in a northeasterly direction.  I watched for a few seconds observing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights, no strobing lights, no identifying lights as seen on the many planes that fly in our skies at night from the local airport.  There was no trail of any kind either.  It appeared to be a light - not something on fire or burning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly went to the porch, opened the door and called to my 14 yr old grandson to come look.  He came out and observed the object as well.  He said, &#34;Gram, get your camera!&#34;  I said, &#34;What is that?  It is so bright and moving so fast.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light never changed in brightness or appearance as it approached me, passed over us, or moved away from us.  It appeared to be traveling at a low altitude and at a very high speed.  There was no sound to be heard as this object approached, flew over us and flew away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we lost sight of it beyond the trees, my grandson was observing it with the binoculars:  I said, &#34;Look there is a plane headed in its direction (the plane was heading north and was in the eastern sky).  The plane had to have been at a much higher altitude as it appeared as a pin dot to us, but you could clearly make out the red flashing lights.  The unknown object was very large in size in comparison to the plane and to the stars that were out at the time. I have never seen anything like this before in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other note:  The object seemed to zig-zag a few times as it was moving away from us.  This was a very odd experience.<n>

The light was brilliant, it reminded me of a glowing gem. I was thinking that I should go and get my telescope when it suddenly began to get dimmer. A short while later it was barely noticeable and it looked like a very distant orange star. It did not seem to be moving at all. It was about 10 or 15 seconds from dazzling light to nothing. Just as it winked out, the Police chopper, Air 1, flew past my location going North. I noticed that it also has an orange light on it along with the blinking blue and red flashers. It also makes quite a bit of noise, the object I saw did not make any sound at all. I had the feeling that it simply just turned out it&#39;s light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I use the vehicle headlights to illuminate the front door while locking the office on particular dark nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking immediately west I noticed what appeared to be the landing lights of an aircraft approaching the Eau Claire airport.  Note, the office is right under a normal flight path for Northwest Airline flights coming from the Twin Cities and it is very common to see the landing lights used on their approaches to Eau Claire.  In any case I attributed the exceptionally bright light to that of an aircraft on approach.  The light was due west at an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and coming slowly east on a trajectory that would have put it right over the office on River Road in less than a minute.  I watched it for a few seconds and did not see anything out of the ordinary but I did notice there was no sound coming from the area of the light.  With approaching aircraft it is normal to hear them a minute before one is able to make a visual.  But it was late, I was tired, and I thought nothing more of it until I started my drive home it seemed to alter its course rapidly.  Leaving east out of the driveway the object essentially stopped for a brief second or two and changed course to north-northwest course and began lowering in altitude.  I turned north on a cut-off road to Highway 170 and watched as the craft moved slowly northwest and dropped in altitude on slightly as it was still much higher than the surrounding hills.  I turned west on Hwy 170 and watched the craft moving in the direction towards the Wheeler radio tower.  Total drive of about 2 miles and a time of about 4 minutes.  As I turned into my house driveway I lost site of the object behind a row of tall pine trees and a hill.  I entered my house, scrambled for a few minutes tying to find a pair of binoculars – to no avail.  So I got my girlfriend to come with out in the field to see if we could locate the object.  As we rounded the blocking hill we easily made visual contact with the craft again.  At this time the light was farther away but still very bright and more red flickering taking place.  The location appeared to be slightly sou! th of th e radio tower and about 1,000 to 2,000 feet higher than the top of the tower (the tower is about 1,000 ft.).  I must qualify that the craft appeared to be near the tower, it could have been farther west of the tower but it more likely was nearby.  As we watched for several minutes it appeared as if it was not moving.  Then it decided to start slowly lowering sometimes straight down and sometimes with erratic zigzag patterns.  Eventually it was at the same height reference of the Wheeler tower and stayed there for a few minutes.  Then it started to lower again and this time it moved slightly more north in what appeared to be very close proximity to the tower itself. Eventually it dropped to a point where we could only see it at random through trees and hills.  In the last few minutes of visual it seemed as though the object was on the ground moving around between trees.  The motions as it was on, or near, the ground were slightly erratic and we had to shift positions frequently to keep it in sight.  Finally about midnight or slightly after we lost all visual sight. Her and I watched the light for about 15 to 20 minutes.

When I was standing there, suddenly I saw some flashing in the sky.  When I look up in the sky I saw one elongated cloud and around 3 white somewhat round lights were flashing and moving interchanging positions behind that cloud.  It was like white lights size of Full Moon.  Though the day was cloudy on that side of the sky (southeast) only this cloud was there.  It was like if somebody is moving flashlight on the wall or the lights moving on the dance floor.  It was white diffused lights and they were all the time moving exactly behind the cloud and even they reach the edge of the cloud but never seen outside in clear sky.  We were watching it for aroud 20 minutes.  All the time the lights were moving. when cloud size was chaged because of wind or may be some other reason the lights were adjusting the movement according to new boundry of the cloud.  We rule out the possibility of lightening as no sound and the light does not look like lightening at all or it never looked like plane as there were 3 lights moving behind the cloud. We even saw planes coming and going. We observed this at 60-80 degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For sure it was somewhat strange experience. I am observing sky many times.  Most of the time I am working afternoon shift so while coming home I am used to watch night sky.

A friend of mine who is staying at the house was standing near our shop building, which is approximately 50 yards from the main house, looking into the sky.  When I approached him, he asked if I saw anything flying low and silent on my way there.  I had not seen anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described a pair of non-flashing lights, red and blue, on opposing ends of the ‘craft.’ It flew on an east-to-west bearing, and quickly altered direction to the north and dimmed to non-visible.  The total duration was 2-4 minutes and was approximately 1 mile away at its closest point to his position.  He also commented that animals in the neighborhood were acting peculiar in that the horses next door were in a state of unrest and that dogs all around the area were barking loudly, many at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5 minutes of my arrival, two bright lights appeared in polar-opposite positions to each other, one to the northwest, and the other to the southeast.  Each one brightened and dimmed at no certain interval and independently of one another.  Each one also seemed to ‘flicker’ and several times changed from a reddish hue to a bluish or greenish tone.   Additionally, there were three short ‘flashes’ from the northernmost ‘object.’  It may be important to note that two of the 4 observers of this event confirmed that there may have been two distinct lights on the northern object, or possibly two objects.  These two ‘objects’ seemed to be on an approximate inclination (relative to our position) of 40°.  The distance from my location could not be determined; therefore I cannot be certain about the approximate height of the object from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total duration of this event was around 25 minutes.  By 11:10 PM (2310 hours), neither object was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notes:  Weather Conditions: Clear, full visibility.  75° F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lighting Conditions: Dark, no city street light interference.  Location south of Midland, Texas city limits approximately 7 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might be worth noting that in 3 different locations which I can pinpoint by map, local police and sheriff patrol units were sitting beside the road.  Also, after leaving the location of our sighting, my friend told me that two patrol units were driving around the area.<n>

With darkness nearing, the storm was slowly drifting my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly caught a movement to my left, and looked just as an extremely bright white orb came cruising in from the SW, approaching the storm.  It moved fast, but began to slow down as it approached the storm.  As soon as I thought it had stopped, it moved north along the western edge of the storm IN AN ARC, taking about two or three seconds to cover at least 5 miles.  Then, as soon as it looked like it had stopped, it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed.  It stunned me because of how the brightness was so much more intense than any plane lighting I’ve seen before, then stunned me by how it moved.  Wow.  But that wasn’t all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I could still see stars overhead of me (the storm hadn’t blocked them out yet), a smaller, dim orange/red orb just appeared beneath the high crest of the creeping cel.  It was like a light had just come on.  The thing was, it just hovered there for a good minute, motionless, maybe a couple thousand feet up and a mile to my NE.  The storm moved over and around it, so I finally lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, a lot of planes appeared in the area immediately after I lost sight of the last object, and I could later see a chopper flying around shining a spotlight up into the clouds!  Quite an unexpected treat.  The first light in particular, though, made me feel very uncomfortable.  It was only a little closer and lower than the second one, and it didn’t move, nor look, like anything I’ve seen before.<n>

We are flying somewhere over New Mexico.  At the time the pictures were taken we were flying at 29,000 feet and the outside temp. was -62 F degree the pilot said.  I never actually saw anything outside my window and it was not until we returned home to Oklahoma and I uploaded that pictures onto my laptop that I noticed something entering from the top of the screen at a downward angle.  In the next picture the object is in full view and has leveled out and actually looks like it is keeping up with the airplane.  I still have the pictures and would really like someone to look at them.  These are some crazy pictures and I have had a couple of people look at them and no one can explain anything to me.  Please someone contact me back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to want to travel unoticed.  It could have easily been mistaken for a star or the moon. Stars don&#39;t move and the moon doesn&#39;t move in an hour.

I only lived there for about 2.5 months. I was renting a room in a house. I did not have a car, but I bought a bus pass to get around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On many nights, I would leave around the same time, and take a walk to a local 7-11 store to get a soda or candy bar. It was a good half mile to mile walk. I occasionally would glance to the sky and look at the stars on my walks. One evening, I did just that, but this time was different. I noticed a real bright star that stood out from the other stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking South towards Washington Street, but my head was facing to the West while walking (Rancho street), toward this object in the sky. I was looking at it for about 5 or so seconds, and all of a sudden it zipped at a 75-80 degrees using an acute angle. When I say zipped, I mean it appeared to leave the Earth within a few seconds (blink of an eye). I am not good with angles: so I will say it zipped nearly straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far away to describe what kind of object it was. I did notice a light trail that was whitish/blue that it left behind. This trail dissapeared within a few seconds as well, but gave me a good idea of its path. It was clear that this object (physical or non-physical) had unreal speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident proves to me there is either something else out there in this universe, or man has developed something amazing. I surely side to the former.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The fishing place was packed full of people, probably of about fifty people because every fishing spot was taken up by someone fishing from underneath the bridge to the other end of the breaker wall where the road pavement ends which is about two hundred feet from point to point.  We arrived at the fishing place at about 4:00PM.  The sky was clear, and it was very windy.  It wasn&#39;t too hot because of the wind.  At that time, not too many people were catching fish.  The tide was going out into the Gulf, and quicker as each hour passing thus creating a swift current in the boating channel.  Around 8:00PM, darkness  began.  Stars also began appearing.  When it got dark, the fish bites became more regular rather then far between.  I was fixated on this large star located due east, probably a planet because it was so large.  Around 9:00PM while glancing now and then at this large star, I noticed  star like object appear near the large star. At first, I thought another star was appearing as the night time sky above was slowly rotated over us.  My thoughts then changed to possibly a plane approaching us, but if it was a plane, it wasn&#39;t the normal white light that a plane normally projects forward as it fly in the sky.  At one point while I was watching this object get closer to our position which I estimated the object was at least five miles away, I thought I saw it jitter up and down.  I squint with my eyes thinking maybe the wind was tossing me around a little thus causing me to see this object jiggling up and down slightly.  That didn&#39;t help, the object still appeared to be jiggling around almost as in sharp jerks of up, down, and sideways motion.  I called out to my friend who was intensely fishing, &#34;Do you see that star&#34;?  She was almost ignoring me when she finally look up at me and saw me pointing to the star like object, then she glanced at the star like object. I then said, &#34;I think it! s an UFO &#34;.  She looked at it for a few seconds then went back fishing not saying a word since a fish was tugging at her pole which she caught. When I first saw this object, it was about the same size as the star like planet, but slightly smaller.  Then something very odd happen which I now changed my mind of it being a star or plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was probably about two or three miles away at about 5,000 feet in altitude from our position when it made a wide turn to the north.  If it was a plane, technically, I shouldn&#39;t have longer seen its headlights.  Not only that, I should have seen its strobe lights flashing to indicate that it was a plane.  No identification lights were seen.  And it still look like a star.  The altitude the object was at was extremely way too low for it to be a satellite.  The alarm bells went off inside me: UFO.  I always carry a camera in my car and luckily, the battery was still charged, and I haven&#39;t used up all of the digital space.  I quickly walked to the car and grab the camera. I could have quickly took some pictures in automatic mode, but I didn&#39;t trust that the camera would take a picture in that mode, especially with the flash possibly occurring and distorting the picture.  I quickly search for the night time mode of available light on my camera knowing that I should get a  picture in that mode, but forgot about the shutter speed, it was too was slow.  I found the object in the sky now looking at its backside which it is also getting further away from me at the speed of a slow moving jet.  I took the first picture shot and I was stun because the shutter was staying opened too long, so I tried as best as I could to hold the camera steady.  After about a second, the stutter closed.  I was really worried that the shutter would stay open for about five seconds.  Anybody who has ever tried to take night picture could probably tell you what will happen if you hold the camera while the shutter is too slow.  I had no time to change the mode, so I took another picture holding the camera as steady as possible.  I was able to get four pictures before I could no longer see the object in the monitor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was taking the pictures, one of the fishermen look at me and then looked at the direction I was taking the picture.  He noticed the object and asked me, &#34;What is it&#34;?  I replied, &#34;Probably an UFO&#34;.  He looked back at it again then looked at me strangely then continue on fishing.  For the rest of the night, he just ignored me as if I was a fruit cake or a nut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People, I just don&#39;t understand while some people can&#39;t believe that UFO&#39;s can be possible.  Some worried that by believing UFO&#39;s are possible may affect their religious beliefs.  I&#39;m religious, but it hasn&#39;t affect by beliefs.  As one person said to me, &#34;I&#39;ll believe UFO&#39;s are real when one lands on my front door steps and knocks on my front door.&#34;  I&#39;m not a fruit cake, but a very well educated person with a open mind, not closed as of some people.  Something is flying in our skies, and its not just a plane, balloons, kites, meteorites, birds, etc.   And the government needs to get involved in explaining some of these flying object because I beginning to think they are UFOs.   Picture of what I have taken that night is being sent via email. Not great pictures, but it something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.  PD))<n>

After a couple of minutes the object changed course and began to head north, the direction of the park. By changing course, I got a better description of the object. The object was shaped like two circles stuck together with two holes in the center of each circle. The color of the object was gray and made no noise and had no lights or markings. I estimate the object being at least 15 feet in length and flying at approximately six hundred feet. I continued watching the object fly north until it was out of view.

The objects were alot brighter than stars but closer than stars and alot farther away than planes. The move very fluidly not very fast, they move as smooth as a mouse on a computer screen. In the formation there were always two objects that stayed close together one object would interchange positions wiht an object flying from the left or the right, we watched this from 11:30 pm until about 2:00 am, I clearly asked everyone to discribe to me what they were seeing and we all saw this THESE WERE NOT PLANES. I thought it was amazing to see until one actually came close the only way I can describe the one that came close is irregular light can not say what color but I knew it was not a plane because there was no sound of an engine but as it floated past we could here a burst of air, the odd thing is that the burst of air that seemed to be making it go forward was a long way behind it maybe 1/8 of a mile,it was not very high in the air and we could clearly hear the burst of air, it sat in front of us then was gone in an instant when it left it was like a haze not a color I can describe. I took the kids in the tent and we did not come back out until the next morning. Everyone that was with me can verify everything. What we saw were not planes. We camped on a beach direcly across from Mcniel Island, we could see Mcniel Island from where we stood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not UFO&#39;s, if they were visible for 3 hours, we suspect.

I&#39;ve traveled through there at night many times and have never seen it before or after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding as a passenger northbound along Interstate 5.  ((name deleted)) the driver also witnessed this light of sorts in the sky.  I&#39;ve managed to pin point two possible dates that this occured.  We are a part of a semi pro ((deleted)) team, he a ((position deleted)) and me the ((position deleted)) and we were coming back from a game.  It was either 3/17/07 or 4/14/07 according to last years schedule.  It was pretty weird and weird enough for me to commit mile marker 63 to memory, however I don&#39;t know whether it started or ended on that number.  I can tell you we are both well traveled and have never seen anything like this.  ((name deleted)) and I discussed it the other day as I told him I wrote you....he just shook his head...&#34;that was wierd.&#34;  At the time I thought perhaps we&#39;d hear something about it on the news or something, but nothing came of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks ago I heard a guy by the name of Ralph Meaney ((local Seattle UFO investigator)) speak about UFO&#39;s and spoke with him briefly prior to the speech.  Something he showed me persuaded me to report this incident.  I can tell you that both ((name deleted)) and I are normal everyday guys that simply saw something weird and would like to know if perhaps somebody else reported this....surely somebody else saw it, and what it was.  We&#39;re both well traveled and haven&#39;t ever seen anything like this before.  You know what&#39;s really amazing about this is that we&#39;ve went to Oregon many times in our lives and never seen this before?  He&#39;s 45 and I am am 40.  I have vivid recollection about it so if you need anything else let me know.<n>

We observed the object for approximately 2 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in the direction the jets were headed. While watching the object, a third jet appeared - again following the exact same eastern path. When the third jet appeared to come within a very close proximity to the object, the object then changed course, and began to head south, directly above us, toward Port Angeles, Washington. We were able to continue to follow the object for a few more moments, until it eventually disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we believed the object to be a balloon, or a cluster of balloons with something dragging beneath it, as it appeared to be drifting on an easternly wind current - however, when the object suddenly changed direction, and seemed to increase in altitude, we were less convinced that it was a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the sky next to the moon was a small silver glowing round object that caught my eye.  As i stood there and watched, a neighbor saw me and said they have been there for a few hours.  She told me there was a &#34;fireball&#34; type of thing in the sky that lasted a few minutes and everyone in the area by the pool had witnessed.  Then it disappeared and these Little glowing balls appeared.  i looked for a few minutes and went into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day i got a call that &#34;they&#34; were in the sky again.  it was about 1 pm.  So i went outside and next to the moon was the same glowing object.  By now I&#39;m getting interested!!  So i started watching and tracking these things.  They seem to have a distinct pattern in the sky.  Usually appearing near the image of the moon, moving west, then moving north to particular point in the sky then disappearing.  This went on for several days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to a friends house about 1/2 mile away and told them about the silver objects.  they came out and we waited and they would literally just appear out of nowhere.  So we watched for a few minutes, and some of their neighbors came out and we were all watching.  Then out of nowhere there was this &#34;giant luminescent green round thing&#34; floating by.  It was round but flat as if you cut it out of paper and held it up in the sky.  it wasn&#39;t round like a ball, but just circular.  It was larger then the moon in the sky, but not next to it.  it appeared to be above up. it was really hard to tell how far away it was.  Once this Green thing appeared, 3 small silver ones appeared.  it was the most silver ones i had seen at one time in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it disappeared one silver ball appeared next to the green one at about 1 o&#39;clock position, and moved around it to about the 5&#39;oclock position before it faded.  Then as quickly as it appeared it vanished, (it lasted about 15 seconds) and only the silver one remained.  We watched for a few more minutes hoping the Giant green thing would come back but i never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few months later i did see one small silver object, i tracked it for a few minutes till it disappeared and went in.  i haven&#39;t seen anything else in a few months.  A side note, the silver objects moved very slow, appeared very high in the sky and seemed to wiggle slightly.  i never saw anything after dark and they did seem to glow and not reflect light. i never got the feeling while watching one that i was actually moving, but it was covering sky.  i do have a few minutes of video of the silver objects, but i don&#39;t know how to load it from the video camera to the computer.  Unfortunately, i didn&#39;t get the green object on film.<n>

I was sitting in a chair in my backyard brushing my dogs and talking on my cell phone occasionally.  I took a break and leaned back in my chair scanning the southern sky for a few minutes when what I first thought was a plane entered my view.  This object flew in a straight line from my western point to an eastern point in about 6 seconds.  The object looked like a commercial plane (say 727 size) from underneath it. As this object was flying across my view the underbelly of it was lite up (white metallic looking) which I thought was probably from the way the sun was hitting it from underneath as dusk was approaching. In my estimation the object was flying at a lower altitude (10,000 to 15,000 feet) as I could tell the body resembled that of a plane&#39;s size.  Two things really stood out at this time:  first, this object had no wings (I repeated this several times to myself) and second, it had none of the underbelly lights (red/green) that you would see on a commercial airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To say truthfully, I was shocked and kept saying how can this be a plane as it doesn&#39;t have any wings.  I stepped outside of my backyard area to attempt to listen for any noise as it began to go out of my view to the east, but I live in a condo and there were 3 airconditioners running within a 20 ft area of me so I couldn&#39;t hear anything other than the a/c.  I live on the flight paths to both the N.O. International and Regional airports and see planes around me all the time and have never seen one flying without wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After work (around 12:00am) we would often visit a construction site (subdivision in progress just some black-topped coldisacks but no houses) off of the Taylorsville lake damn road. We went here to be alone together for a while before we went home (lived with her mom so this was our alone time ;) around 1 am we both noticed what looked like car headlights in the sky ahead of us. we soon noticed 3 pair of the lights flying in a strait line. They seemed really low 80 meters (just a little above the tree tops) and the lights were way more intense than anything I&#39;ve ever seen on any aircraft. this would not be that unusual if there was some sort of sound but there was &#34;NO SOUND AT ALL&#34; and the lights would hover in one spot for minutes before moving. they all came from the same direction in total there was about 15 of them came in packs of 3 to 5 . They all seemed to come from the direction of the lake and end up going toward Louisville. They would all travel strait until they reached one point just about directly above us where they would separate travel in different directions then they would meet back up to begin traveling in a strait line again toward Louisville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe it was a SILENT helicopter with two very large super bright spot lights mounted on the bottom. I could not see the shape of the craft because the lights were so bright. I must say the weirdness came from the craft feeling like it was 80 meters above me hovering and there was NO SOUND AT ALL all you can here is crickets and the occasional car in the distance. The crafts seemed to move a constant slow paced speed other than when they were completely hovering still. You can hear everything thing in this area because everything echos anyone that lives in this area will tell you the same (you can hear a car coming 10 minutes before it gets close to you.) But I could not hear the slightest sound from this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad which lives in the backwoods (Grays run road) about 5 minutes from this sighting said he has seen these crafts on more than one occasion hovering above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
