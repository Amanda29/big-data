My friend was beside me. We were looking up at the sky because it was a clear day with a beautiful blue sky. It was cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Way up in the air to the left, a large silvery blue cigar shape appeared in the sky. It moved to the left in the sky, disappeared and then appeared again straight ahead. It disappeared again and then reappeared again to the right. It then disappeared again and that was it. It was very large but up high at the same time. There was no sound. My friend and i were a little dimbstruck. By the time we yelled at the others to look the Cigar shape was gone. It was metallic. The sun was shining on it and light was bouncing on it just as it would if a big silver cigar were there and the sun were shining on it. It was definitely not an airplane of any kind. If I saw a jumbo jet in the sky from the same distance away this cigar shape was bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents told me it must have been a weather balloon but I&#39;ve never seen a weather balloon that looked like what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
