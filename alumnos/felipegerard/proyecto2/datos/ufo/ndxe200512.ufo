El objeto era luminoso color amarillo-naranja con movimiento aparentemente errático. La fotografia mostró el objeto pero al incrementar el tamaño y realizar modificaciones en el brillo y el contraste, se observan centenares de esferas opacas con bordes iluminados quizasporel resplandor de la luz urbana. Además se observan objetos solidos, aparentemente metalicos fungiformes de color azul-violeta y plateados. Creo que lafoto es impresionante y deseo compartirlas con Ustedes para dilucidar el misterio.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ther was a bit of very high almost see through cloud and as they started to go overhead they were above the cloud.  There was no sound and no variation from there formation.. Like an arrow 1 then 1 behind then 1 at 45 degrees to the left and 1 at 45 degrees to the right 0  0     0  0  A friend of mine took a photo, but only got 1 object looked like 2 orange barrels joined together.   At 12:30 am  we saw the same objects again on the western horizon but this time they were all in a line behind each other, travelling from south to north..  At no time did the colour orange change, did not blink, flash or fade they just dissapeared into the distance on both occasion&#39;s<n>

As the objects flew towards us they started to change their formation from a triangle to a straight line and flew over us and headed west until they disappeared.  This objects made the Mexican newspapers but not the American press.  We are so close to military bases in Yuma AZ. so we are not sure if the sphere were American or Mexican planes or genuine UFO’S.  The sighting was seen by us for about 7-8 minutes with at least ten people being present and witnessing the spheres.  They range in appearance to be round bright red and glowing and at some point become would dim at other times just disappear and reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took a picture but have not developed the film yet.They were perfectly alined in a triangle and I thought it was one solid object at first until, I saw that they started to blink, move away from eachother and one disapeared. Two were left in the sky and one started to go down as if was a falling star but never went all the way down before it disapeared. The sky was very clear and dark. Yesterday, 01/05/06 around 19:15 there was another sighting. Now there were five of them moving across the sky slowly and I noticed there was an aircraft flying close by those red objects. There was a lot of people watching the sky. I went to the local police station and the dispatcher and an officer were outside looking at the sky and I asked them if they knew what they were and said that they had gotten a lot of calls and did not know what they were. They slowly started to disapear one by one the same way the ones from December 31, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Duration: 2 to 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 6:00 PM my wife and I came out of our barn and saw a light in clouds to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was white and could be seen dimming, and becoming brighter. The object exited the clouds, growing slowly in brightness until it was in the clear starry sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The slow brightening of the object showed how low the object was. A jet would have instantly appeared. This object was in the low surrounding clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traversed from west to east, at about a 40-45 degrees above the horizon. We were facing north north west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no blinking lights. It was white in color. The brightness remained constant upon exiting the clouds up until it disappeared into another cloud blank to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound. It was very quiet out. Our property had just flooded and we could hear wate trickling 50 yards away. We waited a few minutes but heard no sounds of a jet or a Cessna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked for an exterior structure around the orb as it passed across the many stars. The stars remained constant. It was only a sphere with a slight haze surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was consistent with a jet at 30,000 feet, and much faster than a Cessna. We live within 3 miles of the local airport, so we are familiar with their night time speeds and flight patterns. Thsi was not a Cessna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object also had what I call a &#34;bob and weave&#34; motion to it. It did not fly in a completely straight trajectory. It seemed to have a slight bounce to it, though not noticable unless it was in close proximity to nearby stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very happy with this sighting. It is the first time that my wife and I have seen one together. The entire event lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like 2 green lights that were on some sort of vessel that dropped vertically down in the sky.  Where I saw the object it was cloudy, so it couldn&#39;t have been a shooting star.  It proceeded to drop straight down and then suddenly dissapeared.  Seconds later I saw what appeared to be a shooting star going in the same direction as I saw the green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I scanned the sky slightly west of the zenith, I noticed this steady bright light moving silently at a rapid even pace toward the ENE.  With the binoculars, it was a sphere, evenly and brightly illuminated, sharp and clear with no running or navigational lights. It was slightly smaller than Venus and only a magnitude dimmer, and appeared to be self-illuminated. I watched it until it began to dim steadily from a white light to a faint reddish color, then nothing. It took about four or five seconds to go from bright to being blacked out. The dimming seemed to encompass the object evenly.  Altitude, speed and size of the object...difficult to judge. Physical dimension was 1/32 inch viewing the scale from 12 inches. My guess is the object was at 30k ft. or better, est speed 600 to 800 mph., possibly faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I&#39;m a 10 year veteran of the Air Force in Communications Maintenance and I am employed as Machine Maint.

It seemed to be very close to the ground. By that I mean no lower than 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a while, it seemed to just stand still. Maybe for a second or two.  I kept track of the time because I was watching a show on TV that had just ran the opening credits but hadn&#39;t started yet when I decided to look for the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I just stood there, then suddenly noticed the paper wasn&#39;t there, and I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but I went back inside and my TV show was nearly half over--fifteen minutes had past, and I just thought I was outside for two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever this thing was, at this point, it flared up like a torch and veered off to the west at a rapid speed.  Then the light just blicked out, like when a lightbulb burns out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think too much about it first, but I noticed that I was trembling.  My arms and my legs. To an extent, I still am trembling.<n>

We came out of the front door and just got to the end of our driveway.  I mostly always have a look at the night sky over Brisbane and the stars because it is so clear all the time.  I looked up and my eye was immediately caught by a bright light moving upwards and to the left at speed. I tracked the object as it moved and the light became less bright as it ascended upwards. Then it faded into a mere speck of light but stayed completely still again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 65 degrees and was white in colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then watched as it got brighter again and looked as if it was on it&#39;s way back down again. It then moved down and to the right at an incomprehensible speed covering a significant distance in an instant, before coming to an abrupt dead stop (not a controlled gradual slowdown).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my wife what I&#39;d seen and together we watched the object go bright and then fade and then go bright again, all the time it darted from side to side, up and down in a series of eratic instant movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it from 10.30pm until 11.20 It stayed there until at least midnight, after that we went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife went inside complaining of a sore neck after watching this thing for 50 minutes.  I looked around the sky and seen another object which was around 30 degrees this time.  It was orange coloured and much closer I guessed since the light was bigger and far more noticeable.  It too was getting bright, then getting faded again and was engaging in the same sort of eratic dancing manouveres as the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time I had a good point of reference.  There was a telegraph pole to the left of the object and I stood watching from a fixed position while the object disappeared behind my line of sight behind the telegraph pole and then re-emerged again.  It also moved up and down some estimated 10 degrees in altitude all throughout the time we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third smaller light could be seen in a different portion of the sky. It too had the same charectaristics of the other two and I also had a palm tree as a point of reference.  It moved slowly but significantly to the left of the palm tree over an hour long period.<n>

UFO&#39;S  Initially at about 815 pm, I looked in sky while closing curtins, I thought the bright star that is usually in our south view night sky, looked an orange colour. Then all of a sudden there were 2 orange ball shapes, about 10 sec later another appeared from below horison, they traveled up, stopped, one circled other, then 2 more came up, they made a square formation, then about every 10 to 20 seconds another orange ball appeared.  At one point there were 5 together still, then eventually they dispersed and either flew south or faded into sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I DID TAKE PICTURES and called a neighbour,who also saw them, she also had company who saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pictures do not show the red ball shape, however some show the shape similar to that of a mosquito, within a smokey area.Other pictures show what looks like a swirlling of smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared above trees of an island, which is on the Saint Marys River, where we live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can see a night marker of the shipping channel, in pictures that show ufos, that marker is about 3 kilometers away. In photos they seem closer than the markers to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside on deck and could not hear any noise from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our son told us on Dec 24 in evening, that he saw an &#34;orange Ball&#34; in sky same area also, however we did not get pictures of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across our waterway is a very sparcely populated area of USA &#34;Upper peninsula of Michigan&#34;<n>

As i looked up i thought it was a satelite, but as i looked closer I could see the lights were on an object which was stationary in the sky just to the south of our location.

They were flying in formation but seemed to cross each other as they were moving forward. They were round, almost oval in shape. There was no sound. An airplane was in sight but going in the opposite direction. They were visible for about 2 minutes. The other strange thing is they did not just continue out of site, they just disappeared. I was playing golf at the time at Meadowlake golf club in escondido, ca. I was standing in the 10th fairway looking towards the green, the objects came out of the N/E direction and went in a N/W direction.They did not have any wings or tails like normal aircraft. I live close to Camp Pandelton and see formations of helicopters quite regularlly. These objects were moving about in their formation too quickly to be considered helicopters.This is my first witness any strange objects that I cannnot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When leaving the gas station I noticed a bright amber/yellow light due east of me heading to the east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness meant &#34;west.&#34;  Please see note below.  PD)) There were no blinking or marker lights as would be seen on a conventional aircraft. The object would brighten briefly and then in the air below the object, an identical amber light would appear and descend toward the ground then fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was repeated several times as the main object kept heading away from me on a straight and level course. One of the objects that appeared below the main object, descended and then made a right angle turn and moved north before fading out. It was hard to estimate altitude on this object but I would guess it was below 5,000 feet. The main object continued to head east until it faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, I filed a report of a sighting in Glendale, Arizona with you on Thursday, December 29, 2005 at 22:37:21. I had the sighting around 3:30am and did not fill out the report until late that evening. I had worked a 10 hour shift that day and was quite tired when I filled out the report. I hope you post the report when you update your data base but, I made a mistake on it that I was hoping you would correct as I want the report to be accurate. Because I was so tired when I filled out the report I got the direction of the sighting backwards. The object(s) I saw were moving WEST and not east as I stated in the report.<n> <n><n> Thank you,   ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

My son and I drove out there and parked the car.  We witnessed approximately 8 lights in a circular formation that would rotate, come together in the middle and the back out in a circle and rotate again.  This happened in a pattern.  The lights were in a cloud, so there was no visible signs of a craft, but there seemed to be no spotlights or store signs that could have caused this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it entering the clouds and it went through the clouds, leaving a light trail behind it. it looked like it had a controlled speed, like it wasn&#39;t just falling through the sky to the earth like space debri.The light came through the clouds and made a sharp zig zag about half the distance from the bottom of the clouds to the trees from where I was standing{diappeared behind the trees. When the blue light zig zagged, it maintained the same speed as if were travelling in a straight line. It did not travel in a straight line, it travelled in the same manner as a lightning bolt zig zag. After it zig zagged, I tapped my brothers shoulder and told him to tell me what that was, he said &#34; I don&#39;t know&#34; ... &#34;A space ship I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ride in helicopters alot and around here, the clouds are usually about 300- 400 feet above the trees when there is a complete overcast. I figure the object landed or hit the ground or was doing some king of evasive manuver to avoid detection, who knows, but thats my first time seeing something like that. two other guys also saw it from 75- 100 feet away and we talked to them a few minutes later. We blurted out the time simutaneously and said the same time a couple minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

This light had no flicker, nor movement of any kind. Self-illuminated? That was my thought about it. Thquality of this lightimmediately struck me as a bit odd, and it stood out from the rest of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching it, I thought I heard jet engines, which I did. Another aircraft passed by, crossing the other vehicle&#39;s path, though clearly not at the same altitude. This is when I took special notice...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the jet appeared to get closer to the path of the first craft, the first craft came to a complete stop...totally stationary...and it sat like this for 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the jet had traveled for about 6 seconds, across the path and beyond, the first vehicle returned to motion and continued on its way. At this time, there was no audible sound from that area of the sky, or anywhere else in the sky...eerily silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this vehicle continued on, I watched it for another 5 seconds or so...as I did this, its color changed from the white light it was emitting, to a reddish orange color. Once the color changed ocurred, it streaked out of sight...yes, it accelerated from the speed it had been maintaining to &#34;gone in a second&#34;. No contrail, no sound...just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and immediately told my husband, who agreed that I should file this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to let you know, I have filed a couple of reports in the past with NUFORC. I am an avid skywatcher, so I tend to notice things that are odd, or out of place.<n>

Easily seen by all on this part of IH 35. There were no wrecks but very slow traffic. I called my husband on cell phone. When I was past the object and about to turn right onto Slaughter I saw a helicopter moving extremely fast heading North toward the object. Whe I got home I found a phone number of who one should call and got an anwsering machine. I left a message. But was not called back to confirm info. Then called a friend who was visiting her daughter in NC and who had seen one 3/10/1994 also in Austin of the same description and told her about it.  Until I saw it for myself I didn&#39;t really believe her.Astonished that it wasn&#39;t on the front page of newspaper the next day. Not that I bothered to look.<n>

We both moved back in our  chairs  because it looked as if it were coming at us. Then it stopped and  went back up and got smaller and then  shot off to the south and then just disappeared.

White circle lights each corner, red and blue flashing lights on the rear edge (singular lights one of each) and i believe it was a flashing red (?) light towards the front(?) or maybe center(?)  Honestly dont remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I question if this was a known aircraft or if it was it possibly a  UFO? I dont want to be somone who each time they see lights in the sky they are crying UFO!!! I know there have been a lot of reports of triangular craft. I made a report of seeing a orb last month (Nov 26th?), so seeing this, this month has me skeptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, i heard noise from it;  Sounded like it could have been a normal craft, though it wasnt as loud as i would expect. But again, i do not pay a great deal of attention to planes etc in my area.It was Approx the size of my thumb nail, give or take. I am not sure what direction it was heading?  I would appreciate it if somone would contact me, and let me know if this could have been, or if it is just a regular airplane common to the US. I really dont want to be another crack pot enthusiast. I believe very seriouly in the UFO phenonema, just not sure  what the Govt has flying thru the skys, or where the aviation technology has led to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sorry that I am not giving better info, i was mentally tearing apart what i was seeing in comparison to what others have reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would appreciate further contact thru my email, and if necessary i can provide further info.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked almost white to me and a blueish color to my husband.  We both said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; at the exact same time.  It was moving much faster than an aircraft would.  I was waiting for a large explosion or sound upon impact but we never saw anything like that.  It just seemed to disappear.  I really thought it had to be an aircraft crashing to the ground but it was just too large and bright.  My husband and I have seen a meteor shower up close and it was nothing like that.  Not a shooting star.  We are puzzled as to what it could have been.  I looked everywhere to see if others had reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were very low to the ground, seeming to be keeping a quicker pace than my vehicle (chrystler sebring, in case you were wondering).  A loud hum was heard over the noise of the music on my radio.  I saw a very bright green beam of light, like a tractor beam from Star Trek, shooting out of the tip of the space craft.  The space craft was shaped with a long shaft and two flashing red and blue lights protruding from the base of the craft itself.  White lights spiraled around the cylindrical shaft.  After the beam had disappeared the space craft glew in a golden color and disappeared in thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the sky in front of us, we saw two VERY bright lights....too bright to be stars or planets.  They were in perfect alignment...one above the other...but pretty far apart.  We continued to watch them as we were driving toward them.  They appeared to not be moving at first.  Then as we got closer, the bottom one veered off slightly toward the North, while the top one continued it&#39;s path overhead.  When we passed under it...I noticed it was moving very slowly.  It was shaped like a plane.  The configuration of lights were two square white lights in the front...two square white lights below them (like a box) and a red and a green light on either &#34;wing&#34; tip.  As we drove on...the other one passed overhead.  It was very similar to the first except for there were only 3 square white lights...in a &#34;triangular&#34; pattern with the same red and green light on each wingtip.  Could very well have been airplanes, but they seemed to be going extremely slow and for as low as they were flying, they were very quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed that they were spread too far apart to be a normal aircraft strobe lights. There were 2 white pulsing lights in tandem and then 1 red light that was fixed in what appeared to be the front of this object. I could not actually see the object but could see the lights and they moved together like they were attached. These lights were low in the sky and below the normal flight line of normal aircraft on approach to ORD ( there were many other aircraft in the sky at the time and this object must have been noticed by other planes ). What really made me stop was the fact that they just stopped and then turned like they were on some sort of swivel. They then started heading east at a rapid speed and made another swivel turn to the south when I lost sight of them behind the tree/building line. When the object turned I never lost sight of the lights ( they were never obscured like a plane banking) and they turned on a level plane...The two white lights got wider apart and the red light actually moved to the middle of the 2 white lights and then the object seemed to move away from me. If I had to guess a distance I would say 1-5 miles away and below the normal flight height of approaching aircraft into Ohare over Lombard. This object seemed to be 3-4 times as large as a normal passenger jet .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had one bright light in the middle and a smaller light directly above the bright light and three small lights in a horizontal row below the birght light, giving it a triangular arrangement of the lights.  I woke my little sister up to prove to myself that I was not dreaming or halucinating.  We watched the object for about an hour before returning to bed around 5:00 am.  It seemed to be shooting flares to either side and the light changed from white to red and green or blue.  It was rather far away, but it was obvious that it was moving in a pattern that was not consistent with that of an airplane or helecopter.  At times it would dart in a diagonal direction and then bounce around then dart in another direction and bounce some more.  The light grew brighter then dimmed several times while we were watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We assumed it was a car, but there was no cars to be found. The object was coming twords us at an incredibly fast pace for about 7 seconds and then it started to drop down while still coming our way. It was starting to drop twords tree&#39;s and was hard to be seen. We could still see parts of its neonish color when it vanished. It seemed to be far away from us, but the size of the object was pretty big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First time that we had experianced something like that.

It was raining very lightly, but just below the cloud cover I saw a strange orange-ish light in the shape of a teardrop.  Now, I thought this was very odd, because while there is a small airport near my house, it was a cloudy night and I couldn&#39;t imagine any small plane flying that early in the morning in such poor weather.  The light wasn&#39;t moving, and I watched it for about 15 seconds before I ran inside to grab my video camera.  It took me about 3 minutes to prepare the camera inside, and by the time I came back outside, the rain had intensified and the light was gone.  I could hear no distinct noise from it, and had no strange feelings or emotions during or after the incident (other than excitement, obviously).

It was an unusally bright star, far brighter than any planet we&#39;d seen before.  It had a sort of spherical quality, but it shone so brightly that it seemed to have many points. There also seemed to be a blue aura around it, which would sometimes change to pink.  As we stared up at the star, it suddenly made a rapid movement at high speed across the sky (south)and stopped.  It happened so quickly that we didn&#39;t quite believe it at first.  A few seconds later it did it again... an extremely rapid movement across the sky (south again) coming to a dead stop.  Then it slowly moved to a position lower on the horizon.  It became slightly less bright.  It was still for a few more moments and then it began to slowly move up and down in random circular motions, almost as if it was floating or dancing.  This lasted for about five minutes.  Then dark clouds rolled in and obscured our view.  The sighting lasted for about ten minutes altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Lights in a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfreind and I were heading to my father&#39;s house where I grew up to celebrate the holidays.  We were traveling south on Mt. Philo Road in Charlotte when he noticed a large bright yellowish light in the sky to the right of Mt. Philo.  He asked me what I thought it was. I wasn&#39;t sure, I told him it might be a planet rising and we would have to ask my father if there were any rising at this time of year. He asked me if it was some kind of radio tower or something of that nature.  It seemed too high in the sky to be a tower like that, and too bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began to descend a large hill where the road heads toward the Mt. Philo state park when my boyfreind noticed a very small and dim blue light to left bright one.  At this point he mentioned that he thought it may be a helicopter when all of a sudden the bright yellowish light dimmed out and between where it had been and the dim blue one was, three or four large orange/gold dimmer lights flickered on and off with no rhyme or reason.  We both exclaimed &#34;Whoa, do you see that??.&#34;  As we approached it further, there was no sign of it moving from its original location.  We nearly passed underneath it on the road, about 50 feet from the intersection of the state park rd.  I would say it wasn&#39;t more than 200 feet in the air above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we passed it, I noticed three super bright white lights in an upside down triangle formation.  After that, I lost sight of it because someone was following us closely and it became difficult to see past their headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at my father&#39;s house, we explained what we had seen.

Speed seemed much faster than airliners, direction of travel coupled with location of sun in relation to my location, the lights should&#39;nt have been reflections from the sun nor as bright, as I had not seen even a glint off the airliners or any marker/landing lights. The craft was silent and the 4 airliners where quite audible and exhaust trials visble.<n>

My roommate received a camera this x-mass, and used his camera to take three pictures. The first two times the ufo, was traveling pretty close to the ground (or it would seem to be traveling closer to the ground, because the light was bigger and shinier). However, the ufo in the pictures is the same color as the first two I saw, also it made no sound or have blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was this formation or cluster of bright celestial bodies travelling almost in a curvilinear manner. There was the &#39;head star&#39; leading so many other smaller &#39;stars&#39; forming something like the body. Their brightness was not as intense as the &#39;head star&#39;. In addition to that there was also a kind of spray of those &#39;stars&#39; to the side of the formation forming something like the wing of this object. I stood and was really awed by this sight making me to draw the attention of a passerby who i noted as the witness. She was also confounded but what else could one say other than to register this sighting as an unidentified flying object?<n>

I was star-gazing when I noticed a very bright light. It was an odd blueish white, quite brilliant. It was steady and had absolutely no flicker to it. As I focused on it, I noticed that it was moving slowly, as I have seen satalites move in the past. Then it sped up and traveled a short distance and disappeared completely!  I have seen hundreds of falling stars, many satalites moving in the night sky and countless planes, but this was totally different. The movement coupled with the brightness of the object are outside anything I have ever experienced. I was in shock for quite a while and still shake my head in amazment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All I remember is that thic incidence either happened on the 24th, 25th, or 26th of December, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving the town center of Conover and driving on 1st Street West towards Interstate I-40.  As I looked out of the car windshield I got a mental shock as I thought a aircraft-crash is going to happen. It &#34;looked like&#34; in the first moment like a fighter plane with triangular solid shape (no distinctive wings) in a sort of stealthy transparent grey, flying straight down (totally vertical) from maybe one mile above ground (when I started to see it). I thought it will fly straight into the ground, at extremely high speed. I guess a speed of at least 1000-2000 mph.  I was in shock at this point and made a significant &#34;sigh&#34; that my female friend said: &#34;WHAT???!&#34;. I  couldn&#39;t answer; my thought was: &#34;it&#39;s going to crash!&#34;... But in that moment, maybe 600 feet above ground, it made a very sharp right-angular turn away from us, into a horizontal flight pattern, climbing up in an approximately 30 degree angle. But &#34;the object&#34; disappeared SUDDENLY after about one second into &#34;nothing&#34;. No trail, nothing.  Due to being in the car I can not say if there was a sound; I heared no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation: No conventional technology aircraft could have made a sort of 90 degree turn at THAT speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The G-force of that turn would have been incredible (impossible to a human pilot) by earthly standards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sudden disappearance was not just a fast fading out of sight, it was a SUDDEN;  disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a private pilot&#39;s licence.

The speed that they were moving must&#39;ve been incredebil takeing in consideration the distance and the altitude these objects were flying.  I like to watch the plains flying on the sky and I know that for the eye they seem to be very slow and in the same time I know they are flying with the speed of 550-600 miles per hour. These objects were 15-20 times faster then any airplane and were doing 180 degrees manovers from left to right and from right to left. I don&#39;t even know if I can call them objects because all I&#39;ve seen was just very bright, shiny, silvery lights or maybe reflections of light.

It was all yellow lighted with red vertical lines all around the sides and it had an orange light in the middle of the top and in the middle of the bottom. It hovered over the house. And then it was still then it got down lower and went over the neighbors house. Then I looked up and it disappeared and it was gone. I didn&#39;t see the object no more. It made no sound. It was partly cloudy. I looked around the house and I still didn&#39;t see it no more. It was gone. I was wondering what this object was I saw and where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Very good perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside doing some last minute things for Christmas.  When I initially noticed the object it just seemed to appear on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in a mountainous region.  I was observing this object on a VERY clear night night with almost unlimited visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed on the horizon on a mountain ridge across from my residence.  I approximate the distance from myself to the object at 1 mile.  From my view point, I was looking across the artificial horizon created by the mountain against the sky.  Beyond the mountain, there was illumination created by a local shopping center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was certainly in the air.  It was approximately 150 ft in the air over the ridge.  It just stayed there.  There was no movement as an aircraft would behave. I know the aircraft traffic patterns in our location and this was way out of those normal patterns and very low.  It had no defining navigation lights.  It had a very odd shape.  It seemed to change shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illumination coming from the object was very aura like.  It had an electric, clear, sort of blue color to it. It seemed to change colors slightly as I observed some slight red and orange but overall the electric blue. The object descended into the tree line and moved in an almost hover like fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was left to right movement moving slowly along the top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finallly, it descended into the tree line and I could move to look between the trees and could catch glimpses of the illumination coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fly remote controlled airplanes and I am an aviation buff.

12/23/05 19:00|Morehead|KY|Circle|10 Minutes|Strange light seen west of Morehead, Kentucky on December 23, 2005.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48446.html|68|ndxe200512| Strange light seen west of Morehead, Kentucky on December 23, 2005.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I spotted a very BRIGHT circular object, as we were pulling out of the driveway to our home starting at approximately 1900 hrs.  The object was very high in the sky, at approximately 10-20 thousand feet.  It appeared to be hovering or &#34;orbiting&#34; in the same spot.  This object was bright light yellow to white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially I thought it might have been a planet such as Mars or Venus.  However, after observing it, I ascertained that it was way too large, and bright to be either planet.  It appeared to be a big around as a Quarter turned on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was hovering over an area approximately South, Southeast from my vicinity (Sharkey), and it appeared as though it were over Montgomery County (Mt. Sterling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my wife and I turned out of the subdivision where we live, and traveled south on KY 801 towards the community of Farmers, we could see this object with no problem whatsoever.  We just kept looking at(not a good thing to do while driving) it and when I arrived approximately 1/4 mile North of the West bound on ramp to Interstate 64, I decided to pull over to the side of the road.  We continued to sit and watch in amazement, while this large object remained stationary in approximately the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a very methodical and logical man, and so I decided to rule out ALL possible explanations.  As I mentioned earlier, I ruled out a star, or planet, as it was too large and too bright to be either.  I then ruled out a fixed wing aircraft, as it had NO strobes, or beacons.  I also ruled out a fixed wing AC with a landing light on, as it never left the altitude OR heading to proceed to base, and would not have been able to hover.  I then ruled out rotary winged aircraft, using a spotlight, as it was too high to have used one effectively for ground searches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, the object stayed this way for at least 15 minutes, after which, we decided to proceed on our way.  However, it was in the sky at least another 15 minutes, as my wife continued to monitor it after we turned East onto US 60 towards Morehead.  Once we arrived at approximately Big Perry, we could no longer see the object, due to the vegetation and elevation.  Unfortunately my wife FORGOT that she had her digital camera with us, and didn&#39;t take a few photo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, we arrived back on KY 801 about 30 minutes later, after traveling West on I-64, and saw no trace of this &#34;light in the sky&#34;, ruling out virtually ALL possiblity that we saw a planet or star earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not a high-altitude aircraft, with a contrail behind it, being illuminated by the setting Sun, we do not know what the witnesses observed.

There were minimal natural cloud formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used my 5.0 megapixel Minolta digital camera to photograph the trails as well as at least 3 high altitude jets leaving the vast linear pattern of chemtrails. The planes were flying from E. to W.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I observed what I thought was a daytime star which was unusually vivid.  Not having a great deal of celestial interest (or knowledge), I didn&#39;t think much of it and focussed on the chemtrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took several photos of the chemtrails and downloaded them to my computer.  When I zoomed in on the &#34;planet&#34; it turned out to be a sphere with highlights and shading.  I did not take particular note of how long it was present in the early afternoon sky but I did remember that it was in a fixed position for at least a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be more than happy to send any or all of the photos I took that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that those &#34;chemtrails&#34; were, in fact, contrails.

I was sitting out on my deck and I saw something move across the sky it was a bottle shaped object it had metal all around it and it just kept on going and going it was about 15,000 feet up in the sky. I saw it way up over the trees it got over a cloud and when it came out I saw it again and then it just kept on going and I didn&#39;t see it no more and it was gone. I was sitting on my deck drinking a coke when I saw this thing it was fairly clear but partly cloudy. I don&#39;t know what this object was that I saw. It wasn&#39;t a plane or a weather balloon or a star in the sky. I don&#39;t know where it came from but I saw it move in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to the sky in the SW direction and saw what appeared to be a extremely bright giant (white) fireball decending at a rapid rate of speed towards earth.  If i had to guess I looked like it crashed no more than 5 to 10 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are trees and houses obstucting view so I couldnt see an impact but im sure it came down. Ive seen meteors that burn up in the atmosphere but this thing came strait down and I did not witness it burn out. There was no sound of crash either. Then later that same day at about 18:30 I was in the same spot and noticed an extremely bright light lingering over that same area. I figured it to be a plane on final appraoch as we have an airport to the east of us. I watched it hover go up,down, and sideways till finally It decended below the tree line. I have had other encounters with such lights and this looked very familiar.<n>

The lights never crossed paths and the light did not radiate out of the clouds.  All 4 lights moved in their own  exact same circle over and over, never crossing and maintaining the same speed.  My daughter stated she noticed them with the person she was with had dropped her off.

Observed in night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decided to take a late night trip trip to the local WalMart for some last minute holiday shopping.  We were driving East on Potter Road when we (my 19 year old daughter and I) noticed somethng bright orangish-red high in the sky above us moving South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had an irregular shape at first which made it diffiult to conclude what it was.  It reminded me of a windsock.  Wide on one end and a tail like wavy thing on the other end.  It seemed to glow from within and it was huge and high.  Much too large and high to be a wind sock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a right onto Aviation Road (traveling East)and saw it again briefly.  But it&#39;s shape had changed.  We lost it and saw it again just past the I-87 overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was remarkable.  This HUGE ROUND GLOWING thing that seemed to be moving away at a remarkable speed.  It looked like something was partially covering it, maybe clouds.  But the thing was so enormous my daughter remarked it looked like a planet exploding.  We were completely freaked out and in awe.  We knew this wasn&#39;t natural.  We attempted to follow it, but it was moving away at such a high speed and it just suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> his was the most remarkable thing I have ever experienced!!!!  HUGE object, very HIGH in the SKY, moving at HIGH SPEED.  Glowing from inside like a fireball reddish-orange in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called the Sheriff&#39;s Department to see if anyone else reported anything (nope).<n>

I was on a bus going from Phoenix AZ to Durango Mexico,with my mother and younger sister. I don&#39;t know exactly where we were, but I know we had pasted the border. I was sitting by the window, looking at the sky. I seen a blue sky with light purple clouds and maybe other colors. I seen what I thought was a small cloud in a clear area of the sky. I quickly realized it was a UFO just like you see on TV,it was the same color of the clouds(light purple) I did not see any lights  on it. I stared at it for maybe 15 seconds, when I looked away to tell my mother. I look back to the sky with my mother but I could not find it again, it seemed like my mother wasn&#39;t going to get to see it. After maybe a minute of searching the sky and explaining what I seen , my mother wasn&#39;t to sure. so I started searching still on my own, maybe a minute and a half later I seen three UFOs just like! the first one. They were in a triangle formation I stare at them for about 20 seconds when I looked away to tell my mother again, but that was the last time I seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

12/21/05 05:50|Dublin|VA|Unknown|5 mins.|Anomalous light seen above well traveled highway in early morning hours|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48440.html|91|ndxe200512| Anomalous light seen above well traveled highway in early morning hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> This appears to be a recurring  sighting, as I have seen this object twice. It seems to be the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, I am an amateur ufologist and that is why I am somewhat hesitant to report what I have been seeing.  I do not want it to be assumed that I am just another wacko.  I have went out into the back yard many times, wanting to see a ufo but have never seen anything that strange-just alot of commercial or military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, my first sighting of this object actually occurred on 11/22/05.  My girlfriend works at a local grocery store on midnight shift.  I pick her up from work at 6:00 am everyday that she works.  I usually leave the house around 5:30 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on U.S. Rt. 11 as I usually do from the town of Pulaski, through the town of Dublin, to Radford where my girlfriend works.  On route to pick her up, as I approached the town of Dublin, I noticed a golden colored light in the western sky.  I assumed it was Venus, although it seemed unusually bright and I had never noticed a light in the sky that had a &#34;golden&#34; hue. (Mars usually appears to have an orangeish or reddish hue and does&#39;nt sparkle or twinkle as this object does).  I thought to myself that this could be a star, but it just looked &#34;unusual&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was crystal clear and of course, at this time of morning it was still not yet daylight. The light appeared to be stationary. I got to the parking lot of the grocery store and looked in the general direction that I had seen the &#34;light&#34;, however, the lights in the parking lot were too bright and therefore obscured my view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I picked my girlfriend up and we proceeded on Rt. 11 toward home. I had told her what I had seen and asked her to look around in the sky. As we approached Dublin, we saw the light again. It looked like it was in the same position. We could not discern a clear &#34;shape&#34;, just a sparkling golden light. As we got closer to the light it looked as if it had iridescent qualities to it. We kept an eye on it and as we were headed in the opposite direction as when I initially saw it on my left, it was now to our right. As I was driving, I could not continually watch the light as my girlfriend could, but I saw what I can best describe as a &#34;white or silvery ball&#34; drop from the object. My girlfriend subsequently saw a total of 3 or 4 of these &#34;balls&#34; or &#34;spheres&#34; drop from the object. Again I was driving and could not continuously view the object. As we got closer, the object seemed to get larger and seemed to be directly overhead (directly above Rt. 11) as if it had moved from being on our right. I still could not discern a defined shape to the object, although my girlfriend said that it indeed seemed to have a &#34;saucer&#34; shape. To me, it seemed that the object had a changing or morphing shape. We eventually passed right under the object and as we did I had somewhat of an uncomfortable, foreboding feeling. As I was afraid I was going to cause a traffic accident trying to observe the object, I pulled over at a grocery store parking lot in the town of Dublin about a couple hundred feet up from where we had passed under the object. I turned the car around so that I was facing the direction where we had just seen the object and to our astonishment, it seemed to have disappeared. Since that time, I have kept my eyes peeled but saw nothing like it until the morning of 12/21/05 at 5:50 am on my way to pick my girlfriend up from work I saw the &#34;golden light&#34; again as I was approaching the town of Dublin. But this time as I got closer to the object the golden appearance of the light dissipated and became two seperate lights, one being white and flashing or strobing. The other light was on the other &#34;end?&#34; of the object and was a steady red color. The sky was super clear and I also noted that the object was to the east, opposite of the position I had seen it on the previous occassion. I proceeded down Rt. 11 to pick my girlfriend up in Radford. I had to wait on her to get off work as she did not get off work at exactly 6:00 am. I attempted to spot the object but as before, the parking lot lights&#39; brightness obscured my view of the sky. We went through the drive-thru at the McDonald&#39;s which is very close to my girlfriend&#39;s work to pick up breakfast to take home. I informed her that I had seen a &#34;UFO&#34; again and asked her to keep her eyes peeled. As we approached the town of Dublin I could see the &#34;golden light&#34;. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she confirmed. As we got into the town of Dublin and closer to the object, it again did not appear to be &#34;golden&#34; anymore. Again I saw a white flashing or strobing light on one &#34;end&#34; and a steady red light on the other &#34;end&#34;. However, this time there appeared to be small white lights (steady) in between the strobing light and the steady red light. My girlfriend also confirmed what I was observing. The object was still in an easterly position and was on my left as it had been on my right on the way to Radford. I again pulled over at the same grocery store lot as I had done previously on 11/22/05 and pulled the car back around to point in the general direction of the object. But this time we could still see the object and it once again looked golden in hue. We observed it for only a few seconds before it started to move toward the now rising sun on the eastern horizon. We observed the object moving in this direction until it moved behind a building in front of us and we could no longer see it. The object did not seem to be moving very fast, but was moving nonetheless. I almost forgot to mention that it only seemed to be about 500 feet above the ground both times I have observed this object. I would find it hard to believe that no one else has observed this anomalous light in this general area, as Rt. 11 is a heavily traveled highway, even in early hours of the morning, as people are commuting to work. Possibly no one else is looking toward the skies as they are pre-occupied with their commute to work? Anyhow, thanks for your time---I tried to be as detailed w/descriptions as possible. Thanks again.<n>

The light was a pale shade of white and constant, and it appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction, at irregular speed. I was now looking at the object through 10x50 binoculars, always keep a set in my car for work related activities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could make out a shape that resembled a sort of triangle, but with no definite shape, but occasionally, I could make out three distinct white lights on each &#39;point&#39; of this triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Funny thing about this object was that there was no noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this thing for a total of about 5 minutes, a car with two older men in their 60&#39;s pulled off the road in front of me and quickly backed up to where I was standing. They were both extremely excited and wanted to look through my binoculars, which I turned over to them almost immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, the object was still visible with the naked eye, but not as clear as a couple of minutes earlier. After about one minute, I could not see the object, either because it was too far away, or because it had traveled into the somewhat low cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two guys and I all agreed on what we had seen, as being something of a triangle with no noise, and again, I cannot even begin to estimate the size of the thing because I could not judge the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold a Commercial Pilots license with instrument and seaplane/multi=engine ratings and have been flying since 1976, and former CFI and CFI-II. I know what aircraft look like and their flight characteristics, etc. This was no ordinary aircraft, ordinary aircraft cannot stop in mid flight and change directions almost simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that&#39;s all I have to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to talk with any other people that may have observed this object, and hopefully somebody snapped a pic or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/20/05 17:25|Golden|CO|Light|hour and a half on and of|MUFON/COLORADO REPORT:   9 obj's that appeared to be bright hovering lights, then lit up, dimmed, moved to the E and began blinking.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48401.html|95|ndxe200512| 9 objects that appeared to be bright hovering lights, then lit up, dimmed, moved to the east and began blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were watching TV when around 5:27 he went out to the balcony of my apartment for a smoke.  I live up on a hill on the border of Golden and Lakewood that overlooks Denver and its suburbs to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He knocked on the window for me to come and look at something.  I am a MUFON Investigator so I watch the skies often.  He pointed out a bright greenish light in the sky to the NNE.  It was just sitting there perfectly still.  I thought it looked very strange so I grabbed my binoculars.  He then pointed out that there were actually 4 objects.  All of them were still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That looked even more interesting so I grabbed my video camera.  Once I got out there with the camera they began moving.  When I got my camera on them there were three left.  The forth had moved off to the east.  When I began video taping one object began to move off to the east, and one to the west.  The one to the west then came back moving to the east.  Then while filming the remaining light, which was perfectly still, just its right and above it another light lit up.  Soon after, the bottom light lit up very brightly.  When it got very bright, it appeared like an angled disk shape.  It then began to move to the east like the rest and dim out.  All of them did this when they flew easy and as they got dimmer they also began to blink.  The remaining light did the same thing.  It began to get extremely bright, and then it began moving east.   Here again it would get dimmer and begin to blink.  This can all be seen on the tape.  As it moved to the east, I noticed yet another light appear the same place the last one had appeared.  This one was dimmer and began move to the east blinking immediately.  When the tress got in the way I stopped filming.  However, we could see at least two of the light off in the distance over Denver.  Then after a few minutes they began to fade too dim to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I called the Director of Investigations to let him know what we saw.  That call was made at about 5:55. While on the call at about 6:15, my friend could see another light appearing in the same spot they had appeared before.  I got off the phone and went back with the camera, however right when I got the camera on it, it faded very dim.  My friend saw another one of them over Denver that was lighting up very bright again.  Again once I got the camera on it, it faded out.  Because I thought they might be reacting to the camera I put it away.  A couple minutes later another light appeared where the others had.  This time, this one stayed still.  It looked like it actually was two light side by side.  As it sat there another light began to light just below it to the left.  The light appearing looked very disk shaped through the binoculars.  After 30 seconds or so as it finally seemed to be finished appearing or whatever it was doing and they both moved to the east.  One headed east over Denver, the other seemed to keep a regular distance from us and moved in an arc to the east with us in the middle.  Once it got due south of us, it just seemed to hover out there.  We then noticed one out over Denver.  This one seemed to be east of downtown and it had two lights, one at either end.  It moved south and appeared very large for as far away it was.  I would say about half the size of a dime at arms length.  The light towards the front was brighter, and eventually the light at the back began to pulse.  It eventually dimmed out.  We could see one of the light heading east still, but after a couple minutes it began to get too dim also.  At this point the light to the south was no longer visible either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total we saw nine of these objects and got seven on tape.  You can look for yourself, but it does not appear that these objects had the characteristics of any known craft.  The closest would be a helicopter, but that would not explain why some appeared to come out of no where, and why they seemed solid at first.  It also would not explain the apparent disk shape.  Two other things I would like to note, although they seem extraordinary is that they seemed to react to being video taped, and they seemed to intentionally blink to mimic airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting such an excellent report.

I believe it was 20-30 yards from the interstate at a radio tower altitude.  Low flying and slow moving.  Several helicopters or planes were in the area. My wife and I witnessed the object for at least 3 minutes. Three lights made the triangle shape were very bright and circular. I believe in the middle of the triangle was a smaller triangle with smaller lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Tonight, I looked up because a big light in the sky caught my eye (about the size of a pea, but in an egg formation).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought to myself, &#34;Wow, what a huge star, or maybe it is a planet.&#34;  Then I kept looking because I thought it might be moving upwards. Then a few seconds later, it closed in and the light was gone.  It is very strange to see this happen twice in only five days.<n>

(this was around 6pm Sunday evening).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden,  I happend to look out the window and then I saw this big huge bright light up in the sky!  It was NOT moving at all! It stood up there for about 15 minutes.  My taxi-cab had already came, and I was already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not too sure which way the front of my cousin&#39;s house was facing, because I only go there once a year for Christmas. Everytime whenever I go my cousin&#39; house,  It is alway cloudy, cold and gloomy outside. I have not told anyone especially my cousins, because they were all to busy getting drunk by being stress out for a future planned wedding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I was not drinking, because I am NOT much of a drinker.<n>

I would say that it was at first approx. 15,000 ft. and rose to another 20,000ft. when it split into tolights of eaqual brightness.  Both lights then rose anoth1 or 2 thousand feet when they disapared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have flown Pipers and Cessnas since I was a youngster so I am pretty sure about the altitude.  This was not a peice(s) of alumium foil since the flashing stayed at a equal rate of time and when it did split into two flashes they were both flashing at the same time but flying away from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they both reached approx. 22,000 ft. they both stoped flashing at the exact same time.  The lights looked oval in shape.<n>

I was heading outbound on the St Johns River entering Trout River Cut on a NE course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was poor all day with rain and wind and the weather at the time of this sighting not exactly perfect with rain squalls and wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned into the cut I could make out one white light up ahead about a mile and a half off of my bow slightly to starboard.  I figured it was probably a small vessel that I would keep an eye on.  As I got a little closer I notice two lights, one on top of the other, like the mast lights of a tug with a tow so I gave a security call on my VHF with no response.  I checked my radar but it was obscured with the rain and was, &#34; all greened out&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be stationary about a mile or so ahead of me and seemed to be at or just above water level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later I was becoming concerned about having to meet a tow in this narrow channel in this kind of weather, so I decided to shine my spotlight at the lights.  I did this to make the other vessel aware that I was heading in its direction and to also try and see if I could tell what kind of &#34;boat&#34; I was about to meet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I hit the lights with my spotlight it made a Bee-line right for me at a pretty good pace.  I immediately turned off my spotlight and thought &#34; Oh great, I just blinded a Navy Helicopter pilot from Mayport&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as the light came closer more white lights appeared kinda in a line with the center light brighter and the lights out to the side of it dimmer.  I got this weird chill up my spine and thought &#34;Holly Crap its a $@#!@^% UFO!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It passed  my tug down the starboard side at about a 40 degree upward angle.  It was probably about 200 feet off of the water heading rapidly SW.  As it passed I could make out a dark triangle silhouette with 6 to 8 white lights in a V shape on the underside.  It was fairly large , about the size of a bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as it passed and the silhouette against the low clouds looked almost saucer like from the back.  In few seconds it was gone heading towards downtown Jacksonville.  I never heard a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have ran tugs for a while and have never seen anything like this.  I have never believed in little green men or any of that other stuff but this shook me up.  I had 3 other crewmen on the tug with me but 2 of them where off watch and sleeping and my engineer was making his rounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It spooked me so much I had my engineer sit with me in the wheelhouse the rest of the trip.  I did not tell him why, just that the weather was bad.  He could tell I was shook up and I brushed it off for fear of him thinking I was seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve heard other mariners say they have seen things but I always didn&#39;t really give it much mind until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got home I went online to look for information and am amazed at all of the similar sightings.  I now have a new prospective and I&#39;m a little uneasy about what I might run across while I&#39;m at sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Now for viewing I get a northward peep and I&#39;m able to spot polaris for alignment.  It was one of those cold, slightly windy nights so I would stay out for a few minutes and observe, and then come in the slider to warm up for a couple minutes and go outside again. (because I was close to the warmth and wasn&#39;t dressed really properly)   On about the third time I went outside and looked up I got a glimpse of three objects, moving very quickly from north-south zoom over our townhouse complex. I saw the objects for perhaps 2 seconds as they passed through my FOV visually. I ran upstairs and out the front door but at the speed they were travelling I knew I&#39;d never catch a glimpse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I know I observed about these objects:  1. There was three of them 2. They were all travelling at the same speed 3. Two of them were closer then the third in the formation 4. There was no blinking lights 5. They made NO sound as they passed overhead 6. They had a orangish glow about them 7. They flew very fast 8. Altitude was NOT determinable   Now because I see planes ALL the time in this area I know exactly what one looks like, and these objects were NOT anything like an airplane. I was very skeptical about the existence of &#34;REAL&#34; UFO&#39;s, and now I&#39;m not so sure they don&#39;t exist.......just kind of freaked me out.....<n>

It&#39;s very cold out, probably in the minus degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look to my left and there is a huge glowing light in the sky at tree level less than a mile as the crow flies.  I am looking at it for about 10-15 seconds and then say go in and get video camera. I do and very quickly go out and start filming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is huge at first in my viewfinder then recede on it&#39;s own like it knew right away I had a camera.  My hands are shaking a bit but I am keeping camera as steady as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the entire sighting till it fades away I always have the object in the viewfinder. It appears to rotate and is really a very large object. It recedes back away from the viewfinder at a gradual rate until it just disappears by fading out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happens in about 2 minutes. I have the closeup button pressed all the way within a second or two of beginning filming and it stays like that till it completely fades out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 7:40 pm I went out again and saw a plane in the same vicinity as the object I had just filmed so I filmed that, then pointed the camera around for reference and showed the huge moon (in the completely opposite direction of the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where my home is when I use the compass if north is 360, E is 90, S is 180 and W 270, then the object was at about 240 and the moon at about 30.  I felt like the object knew I was there or even knew I was going to go outside then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on the Reservation close to the base of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how to email the video to you but I would like to.  I would like to see it slowed down a lot to see the detailed rotation movement and fade out. It was really very unusual and exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen these huge lights, but this may be the best film I have taken of one of these fading out on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time of year it gets dark around 5:10 pm, but the last couple nights have been bright because the moon is near full, so the landscape glows with the moon rays. There are no structures on the ridge where the light hovered.  Regards, ((name deleted))<n>

But noticed it was moving slightly towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We slowed then stopped the car as it was coming over us. Then she turned the radio off and the windows down as it was pretty much going right over the top of us.  It was very large in size very quiet and the light coming off it was brite enough to cast an image of itself.  It was triangular shaped with red lights down the sides and it seemed to be flying about 100 feet taller than the tallest tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it left us we new this was something like we have never seen so we tried to follow it but the tree line cut us off.  And when we could see the sky again it wasnt there.  I did see a brite light way off in the distance but in another direction but I dont Know if it was the same craft.<n>

It was huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both spotted it at the same time.  It was bright, changing color yellows, reds, blues, and greens.  It has a tail trailing it like you would expect with a comet.  It lasted a good 6 seconds before it fizzled out but, in the time it takes to say, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; it suddenly sparked back up from the same spot it was last seen at and continued its course for another 2 or 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We weren’t quite sure what to make of it and thought we would hear something about it somewhere but never did.

I was at a nearby neighbors house with some friends.  We were in the backyard we were grilling italian sausage on the outdoor grills out in the backyard.  And we were on the patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 3 circle UFOS.  All three circle UFOS were round and on the inside of the bottom they had red, yellow, and pink lights and they emitted orange beams.  Then all three circle UFOS were a roquefort blue (what I mean by a roquefort blue they looked like roquefort and blue cheese salad dressing they had light blue lights and the lights on the inside of the bottom looked like ROQUEFORT SALAD DRESSING and light blue lights) all three UFOS were a roquefort blue and on the inside of the bottom they had roquefort blue lights then all three circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then all three circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red and orange lights mainly red lights and they emitted roquefort blue beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all three of these circle UFOS disappeared.  Then 2 triangler UFOS showed up they were white lighted and had red dots at every corner then blue lighted with pink dots at every corner then yellow lighted with red dots at every corner and they emitted red and yellow beams and left a trial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they disappeard then a huge cone UFO showed up it was red on the top and yellow on the bottom then it disappeard.  All 6 of these UFOS. The 3 circle UFOS, the 2 triangler UFOS, and the cone UFO were going toward the ocean to folley beach when they disappeared I guess they crashed out in the ocean.

Suddenly the entire sky lit up for one second like daylight but totally green, as if through a green filter. The very next second, all the power in the neighborhood went off and then came back on instantly.  My instinct was to expect a noise or boom, thinking it may have been an explosion, but there was no sound.  My dogs seemed disturbed for about an hour after the flash, but everything else seemed normal.  My son was upstairs in his bedroom and said he noticed a green light flash into his room on his curtain.  He thinks he may have seen an object cross the sky, but was unsure.  I think we may be the only two people in town who saw it, though others noticed the brief power outage.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was outside on apartment balcony hanging laundry (which always puts me in a position looking out &amp; upward, with view of the sky).  Without a prior sound or warning, almost directly above in sky, suddenly a huge WHITE bright ball takes shape &amp; then bam! a loud explosion. The entire event was at most 2 seconds. It was just so odd. My husband who was walking home from the train station was about 2 blocks away from home, when he seen it.  No pre or after-shock noise, no pre or post lightning &amp; certainly no rains.  I was very shaken by it.  As well as disturbed.  My husband after walking into apartment was puzzled too. (Note: he would tell you he has never seen an UFO or even believes in them.  When I tell him about the few times I have seen UFOs, he looks at me like I saw &#34;a thing wrong.&#34;) I was shaking because it was so unusual.  No further strange weather that night and nothing on the news about strange weather, etc.   Nothing about explosions.  Itami airport is near and I thought perhaps a plane exploded? Although that would be odd ... this was a sudden white orb of LIGHT! just BAM! then gone. No light trails in sky. (Like when you look at the sun.)  I have seen lots of electrical storms, and bad weather, but never seen anything like this.  A perfect round orb of white &#34;light&#34; ... no blue emissions ... just white!  I do not know if weather &#34;fireballs&#34; can be white, rather huge, stationery, &amp; result in nothing more than bang! and no after-effects. And I do not know if this is of consequence to report. I will have husband use online map of area to mark where this occured and email later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  After finding a link about BTs, then a link to this site, remembering my own encounter with one other person of a BT in the late 90s, in Missouri O-Fallon HWY 70 area, for whatever reason, I began to think and wonder &#34;wow you know, you never see or read reports in Japan news about UFOs&#34; (well at least I do not yet ... Ive only been living here for about 8 months) and I wondered about BTs here.  When this event of the ball of white whatever-it-was happened, I kept thinking &#34;did a BT just arrive?!&#34;  I wanted to post the sighting but thought it would be of no need, perhaps.  Then, last night, I find the report of a BT near Kyoto!?!  Thus my decision to post this, and ANY other &#34;event&#34; should any occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After posting this report, I will make my BT report &amp; silver orb reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for a comprehensive, on-going database.

No sound cause I pulled over near a boat ramp to see. It just hit me when I read the sighting from the posting from orlando. I blew it off and never thought about it till now. I remember it like it was yesterday. They just hovered over the water in those lakes at the seminole/brevard county lines out in the swamp.I was going west and they were on my left side about 11 o&#39;clock about 5,000 ft.from the water and just sitting in the sky.I never believed in this stuff till I saw it for myself.the formation was 3lites!<n>

They stopped in the air very quieckly and then 3 of them went in a diagonal line up and vanished, while the last one vanished in a straight line going south.

Four of the sightings were in the same location and around the same general time of between 1;30 and 2;00 am.  The fifth sighting was in a diffrent location and was about 45 minutes earlier .  This sighting was due north of the usual location of the sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was this night traveling south from north and was traveling at the same steady speed and about the same altitude.  The speed I would judge was about 20 to 25 mph and was silent of noise or vibrations.  If it was a painted craft it would be of a black color.  It had white lights that strobed on the outer end edges of the rear part of the triangle with a solid burning white light in the front point of the triangle.  It was a bit brighter I think than a normal landing light on a plane.  I saw no green or red light as one would expect to see on a normal plane indicating port and starboard. The thing that was of intrest to me was that if it had been just another 45 minutes later the thing would have been over the same area that i usually saw it for the previous four times.  As it happened this night I was running a bit early and therefore was in another part of town.  The area of town is with housing additions and very thick wooded areas in between them.  There i a mountain ridge to the east of the area about 4 miles away.  To the south is the town of Palmer and the Matanuska River and the Knick River and the Knick Glacier and the rough and rugged  Chugach mountains.  Every time that I saw the caft was always the same altitude and speed and was traveling from north to south, no noise  heard.  I tried to take a photo of the craft but my digital camera was not the best in the world and is only 3 mega pixels and did not make it worth saving.   I am 38 years old and have had experience as a Captain in the Oklahoma State Guard and my fathe! r was a police officer and Chief of police and I have had experience in observation from many points of view during my life and I have explained this to the best of my ability.  My only explinations could be that it was either a military stealth craft operating from Elmendorf  or that it was extraterestrial.  Either way it was a true UFO for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My telephone is  907 ((deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

(It&#39;s shape was somewhat spherical)  The light began to weaken until it disappeared completely.  I picked up the binoculars about 5 minutes later in an attempt to relocate it and did indeed find it but the light was not as strong as it had originally been.  I also noticed three very small &#34;stars&#34; to its right. Once again It then began to brighten and move OUT OF THE RANGE OF MY BINOCULARS causing me to try to relocate it again.  I finally did and by this time it was to the right of the &#34;stars&#34;. (It never returned to its position by the &#34;stars&#34;.)  The light moved quite rapidly in all directions (would backtrack also) for the duration of the sighting which made it somewhat difficult to track.  During this period the light never retained its original brilliance but remained reddish in color and was constantly blinking (actually, sputtering is a better term. Blinking would have been more uniform but this movement was not). It finally disappeared about 7:40 quite a distance from its original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD))<n>

Same spot<n> <n><n> <n><n> While out in front of the house telling my daugher to drive carefully as she was going shopping, I looked up. The sky was well lit by a full moon high in the sky to my right (SE). I was looking northeast at the moonlight on contrail left by a passing jet on a cold clear night. The contrail was on a normal traffic pattern from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a flash of light travel past at some what of a flat angle from east to west directly over the contrail. It lasted just about half a second.  I said &#34;hey, I just saw a shooting star&#34;.  However, It was followed by a longer flash/streak, maybe .6 of a second,  in almost the same spot and same direction only about a minute later. I thought maybe space junk? I haven&#39;t heard of any meteor showers, but could be. Then, about a minute later, the same thing happens only this time it goes from west to east. All objects appeared to disappear in roughly the area of the sky. Thats it.<n>

We were on Interstate 81 heading North and right as we were getting off at the Paxtonia/Lingelstown Exit I slowed down on the ramp as I saw 4 yellowish circular lights in a long stretched out row very low in the sky directly in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was &#34;Man that plane is low!&#34; I slowed along the ramp and rolled down the window, my fiance was observing as well.  We did not see any plane body and there was no sound either, and then just like that it fizzled away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, I never bought into anything with UFO&#39;s so natually I was trying to come up with a justification and could not.  I was thinking maybe fireworks, but there was no way it could have been and there was no noise either.  I wanted to see them again and kept looking, but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got to Costco in Lower Paxton Twp at around 19:00, I looked up over the shopping center in the northern direction and sure eough the formation was back again.  The lights lit up in a row again and then fizzled out just as they had before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to get my cell phone out and take video of it, when it came up a third time I got it on my phone!!!!.... Unfortunatly because of the lights in the parking lot and the distance you cant see the distinct circles, but you can very clearly see a bright bursting line of light blended together, having a quick burst of orange and then slowly fading away (on the left center of the video screen). I waited to try and get another clip but did not see it for five minutes so I gave up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked into Costco it showed up one more time in the distance to the right of where we last saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw it appear and disappear a total of 5 times.<n>

In the N.E. sky we saw a warm yellow light.  It divided into two then three, then four lights of the same size lined up vertically.  Then they disappearred.  I then saw a flare just above the tree line and then very small individual points of light blinking on then off in different locations all over that area of sky.  This much of the event probably lasted for about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had seen something similar in the same area of the sky one week previously at approximately the same time when traveling on Linglestown Rd and Progress Avenue.  Fort Indiantown Gap is located in that region and there may be some experimentation going on there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reviewed your listing of other sightings, I saw a siting posted on 5/24/05 of an event that occurred on 4/1/1996 in Harrisburg, PA in the same approximate area.  The sighting was very similar to ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen anything there or may know what it is we saw, I would be very interested in hearing about it.<n>

We also noticed the construction workers on the building next door pointing and watching the same object.  Several other coworkers also came by the object moved across Manhattan from East to West around 59th Street then traveled South then re appeared in front of us again on the N side of the building.  We called co workers in our office in NYC they saw it too and couldn&#39;t make out what it was they discribed it as a large black box.<n>

At least one of our national networks (MTV3) reported (nonchalantly and in passing) in more than one news program a luminescent or highly reflective trail/object sighted over the morning skies of Helsinki.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things make this interesting. First, there are apparently quite a number of eyewitnesses, at least one of which had captured very good footage of the phenomenon with his camcorder. A short clip of that was shown on the news program. Though it was impossible to make any definite appraisals based on the few seconds I saw of the anomaly, it moved quite slowly along a trajectory and most likely reflected the rising sun rather than emitted light of its own. But this is just a layman&#39;s opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, (and get your conspiracy hats out for this one) there was a separate report about a radar malfunction at Helsinki airport starting from 8.55 AM (local time) which lasted for 25 minutes delaying a total of 16 in- or outbound flights. There are two complementary radar systems at HEL, one of which didn&#39;t display any traffic during the malfunction. Apparently the system came back online as the GPS synchronizing clock was replaced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no information whether the sightings and the malfunction actually coincided in any manner or form. Apparently neither the Finnish air traffic control or Meteorological office observed anything out of the ordinary during the sighting. An astronomy club pointed out that there is a meteor cloud in the vincinity that might result in &#34;spectacular&#34; sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my full knowledge on the subject. If you wish to pursue this further investigate the issue through the news services and any local contacts you have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object reported and photographed might have been a high-altitude jet airliner, illuminated by the rising Sun.  This type of phenomenon is reported to our Center on a frequent basis.  We have no idea what may have caused the failure of the radar system, but we have no convincing evidence that the failure could have been caused by the presence of a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>

There was me and three other people there. We noticed a rather large light in the sky. It was orange and it seemed to big to be a star more like a planet. The light looked to be hanging in the sky over another town. As we watched the light it appeared to be moving but it could of just been flickering. We had become disinstrested in it and began doing what we were doing. What happend next was when we all new that somthing was not right. the light in the sky had become much brighter and at least twice the size. We were amazed by this and wonder what it was. We then thought its not geting bigger i think its getting closer. the object had appeared to be coming closer the details of it became clearer. it had actually looked like it had wings like an aircraft. it had gone back to its spot and moved back and forth. it would jump up and down and continued doing that. What happend next was very very bizarre. The light became small again and it took off to the left in a curve. it was not traveling very vast. It looked exactly like airplane and was traveling at the speed of a comericial jet. I dont not know exactly what it was but it is very odd for a light dancing in the sky to suddenly take off and appear to be a jet. antoher small light off to the left did the same thing but was smaller seeming like it was farther away. they both dissapeared like a plane would when it goes behind a cloud but there was no cloud near that light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was traveling under a vast grey cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped and stood in the middle of a crosswalk to really observe it, it appeared to slow down even more until it ceased moving, then slowly began moving again.

There was a light in the center and decreasingly smaller lights on either side of the center light obviously wrapping around what appeared to be a flying saucer.  It sat still after I noticed it, then it slowly moved up and out of sight.  I&#39;ve never in my life seen anything like it, I know it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light appeared to be stationary because everytime it would reappear it was in pretty much the same location in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after a few seconds of not seeing it, I noticed several bright lights streak very fast across the sky heading south lasting only a couple of seconds as if it was leaving and then disappeared for good. (so I thought) About 5 to 10 minutes later, I was on the other side of Coalgate heading east and continued to look to the south to see if I could notice the bright light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw the light appear again and immediately began to slow my car down so I could get a good look. Stopped in the middle of the road I noticed two smaller orange lights, one above the other which lasted only a few seconds before disappearing. As an oncoming car was heading my direction I began to drive off again and looking back to where I saw the two orange lights I saw what appeared to be a slow moving orange fireball which was leaving a small tail behind it. This only lasted for a few seconds and then was gone for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally don&#39;t believe in spacecraft or whatever so I&#39;m sure there is a perfect explaination of what I saw. Just wondering if anyone else noticed this on the night of Dec. 12 2005 in South Eastern Oklahoma near Coalgate and appeared to be heading toward s Atoka Oklahoma.<n>

Then I noticed what I could describe as a somewhat boomerang-shaped craft gliding silently from North or North-by-Northeast to South or South-by-Southwest, almost directly over my head.  It was dark, so it was hard to tell exactly how high up it was, but my best guess is about 75 meters.  It looked to be about 20 times the size of the moon.  It had 5 round, significantly sized lights that I could see, quite faint, and they seemed to get fainter at the edges.  They were spaced as such: one at each corner, and the other two were spaced just between the corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t be totally sure because it was dark, but the craft looked black, and I could somewhat make out the shape of body as it flew by; it looked like a boomerang, but, hm, how to describe this- if you were to take those five round lights, then make a circle around each light so that the outer circles were about 80-100% bigger in diameter, then joined them all together in a chevron shape, that&#39;s basically what it looked like.  Though between each of the circles there was a smooth connection.  Really the best way to describe it was like it was a lumpy boomerang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound that I could hear, even though it looked close.  The speed was also too slow to be an airplane.  It looked like it was just gliding along.  It flew with the point (to clarify, it wasn&#39;t pointy, it was rounded all the way around) of the chevron first.  It was clear to me that what I was seeing was not ordinary.  I thought about trying to get the attention of someone in a parked car, but it looked like it was about to go over the hill, and the bus was coming.  Since it looked like I wouldn&#39;t be able to see it anymore and it was really cold outside, I decided to hop on the bus after a moment of hesitation (now I regret that).  I was able to see it for about 20 seconds total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background: I was born and raised in America and studied Japanese and Computer Science related fields in University.  I got an internship in Japan and that&#39;s why I was there.  I&#39;m still there actually.  This all happened about 3 hours ago and I&#39;m sitting outside of my apartment room, catching a neighbor&#39;s Wi-fi connection to write out this report in freezing weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the bus stop of &#34;Hikari-dai Itchome Minami&#34; in Hikari-dai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto prefecture, Japan at 18:18 on 12/12/2005 just east of an NTT (telephone and technology company) research building when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/12/05 09:00|Navarre Beach|FL|Unknown|20 minutes and possibly l|Perfectly circular cloud with a circular rainbow on the edge of the round cloud.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48717.html|178|ndxe200512| Perfectly circular cloud with a circular rainbow on the edge of the round cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This report may not fit the defintion for UFO reports, but I include this report since it is an odd event in my opinion; it may not have anything to do with UFO&#39;s.)  Navarre Beach, Florida December 12, 2005 starting  at 9:00AM Picture taking didn’t begin until  9:18AM and ended at 9:21AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 12, 2005, I was in Navarre Beach, Florida working on a construction site erecting a 29 story [level] condo.  At 9:00AM after being on the reed bar slab since 6:30AM,  I came down to the ground from the condo slab for my 9:00AM coffee break.  I was still wearing my polarized sunglasses at the time when I just happen to glance up into the sky and noticed what appeared to be a circular and grayish cloud with a colorful rainbow on the outer skirt of this circular-like cloud.  The barely noticeable rainbow completely encased  the round type cloud  similar to a halo effect.  I was thinking to myself, &#34;This is unusual.  I have never seen a cloud formation that was so perfectly round; not only that, I never seen a rainbow that was so perfectly round during the daytime, only a rainbow that was half a circle and normally connected to the ground at both ends.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I removed momentarily my polarized sunglasses to see if I could see more clearly   defined details as in colorfulness in this rainbow that was on this unusual cloud effect.  To my dismay, the colorful rainbow effect was less perceivable than when I was wearing the sunglass and looking thru it at the rainbow.  This unusual cloud formation with the rainbow, kind of reminded me of what I once saw many years ago, when I was looking at the moon on a very cloudy night.  It had a rainbow ring around it when the moon shined through the clouds.  That phenomenon is explainable: When there is a high concentration of moisture within the cloud, the moonlight shinning through the cloud can possibly create a rainbow effect as in a halo around the moon.  When a halo effect around the moon is normally seen, this is usually a good indication that within a 24 hour period, there is a very good possibility of rain occurring in the region.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my supervisor  who was standing next to me, and I guided him with my hands and pointing in the general direction of the unusual cloud formation with the rainbow on the outskirts of the grayish, circular cloud.  He could barely see with his eyes what I was showing him; yet, he was able to perceive that there was something there with a rainbow effect which was almost unnoticeable .  He joked that it could be a UFO, and I told him that I didn’t think it was a UFO but a very strange event; possibly Eglin experimenting with weather control which is a joke in itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also told my boss as in a joke that is could be a wormhole, and that is how UFO’s were able to travel vast distant, but that was only as a joke; although, it had me thinking a little about it after I said it.  I told him I had a camera in my truck and asked him for permission if I can takes some pictures of this unusual cloud with the rainbow which he granted me permission.  I took 9 pictures with a digital camera. If I didn’t have to work at that moment, I would had taken more pictures and watched this cloud until it could no longer be seen.  Let it be known, there was no doctoring to the pictures that I had taken nor is there any hoax that I know of associated to the rainbow cloud mention above.  Not known at the time when the pictures were taken,  there had been some sighting on November 7, 2005 seen in the general area which is bizarre when you connect those UFO sighting with the odd cloud event.  I  may had witness maybe once in a lifetime an unusual cloud formation with the rainbow effect.  This could explain the event I saw several years ago of changing patterns of lights I saw at night which I originally thought to be a planet or large star.  I’m still searching for an answer for how a cloud can be formed perfectly circular with a rainbow effect.  If it were not for color gray inside the cloud, you could say it was a big bubble, but what could make a bubble that big?<n>

The lights i remember seeing from it were yellow and green.  My parents though it had been a satelite, being launched to space.  Trust me, this was no satelite.  At the time of the incident, I had a weird jitery feeling.  I was very confused, and felt very weird.  The craft made no sounds at all, even though it flew about 250 feet over our heads.<n>

We were approaching the four-way intersection of rt.9 and rt.287.  We both suddenly saw what looked like the headlights of a car in the sky and both exclaimed. There might have been one other car at the intersection but it pulled away before we got there (we had a red light). We stopped and looked at the lights and as they approached and we noticed that there were smaller white lights along the bottom of the craft as well as a slowly pulsing/blinking one on top.  All the lights were white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the car window and hung my torso out and did not hear any noise from the craft at all.  The craft was lower than any aircraft I have ever seen and was moving much more slowly than a normal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not close enough to Dulles airport for the craft to be attempting to land there.  I&#39;m not sure exactly how high the craft was as I am not great with distances but it was certainly above the tree line but significantly lower than normal planes.  As the stoplight changed to green, my friend pulled through the intersection and the craft was simultaneously passing over our car.  I was still hanging out the window watching the craft and saw the shape of it from below.  It had a elongated triangularly-shaped nose that was split directly down the middle and it had a compact body with short wings and no tail. There was no exhaust.  My friend and i drove on discussing the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 or 6 minutes later, we were still driving to my house and were on a non-lined paved road right before the turn onto my dirt road.  My friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed that it looked like there was a storm far off in the distance (it looked like there was lightning behind the clouds. The light was slightly glowing and pulsating).  At this point I suggested that we stop the car and watch the storm.  My friend stopped and a craft that looked exactly like the previous one sighted, (same shape, size, speed, and height, and similar bearing) emerged from the clouds.  The pulsing light that was on top of it was what we had thought was the storm behind the clouds.  I rolled down the window completely and stuck my whole body out of the car, leaning on the roof and, admittedly, yelled profanities at the craft.  This craft did NOT pass directly over our car but  passed over about, maybe....25 yards away.  My friend and I sat in shocked silence for about a minute and proceeded to my house.  She dropped me off and for the rest of the night I was entirely jumpy and kept darting to the windows to see if another craft would appear.  The crafts could not plausibly be the same due to time and distance differences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my friend nor I were intoxicated nor did we have drugs in our system.  We are both responsible and trustworthy high school students and while I know that my reveal of our ages can lead to an assumption of untrustworthiness and unreliability, I assure you that every bit of this account is true and unaltered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main reason of my posting this report is to seek other people that sighted the craft(s).  I would really appreciate other postings that correspond to mine.  I urge the creators of this website to look into this sighting as I am very confused as to what the crafts were.  If there had only been one craft I might have believed that it was an experimental military craft but the two sightings in one night is too coincidental and astounding to write off as nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for any time or exertion that may go into the publishing of my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

No blinking or brilliant light, but dime orange color light (Note: the sunrise time was 7:00 a.m.).  The weather was clear: cloudless night sky.  Its altitude cannot be determined.  The object must be flying over the high altitude or possibly outer space.  I could only compare the object with star lights and its dime orange color.   The object seemed to be moving slightly zigzag at times (it might be caused by the atmospheric effect).  The speed was undermined, but it moved faster than conventional airplanes.  I observed for about 3 min. and eventually could not observe it due to its distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While wondering what it might be, approximately 30 seconds or less than 1 minute later, I noticed another oval object (the same color and size as previous one) was moving horizontally from North to South passing over our house.  According to the size and color, it must have been flying at the same altitude at the same speed as the previous one.  Both of the objects never changed its color throughout the course of flying.  No reflection of the rising sunlight at all.   There are AFBs in our island (Oahu).  They should know what these objects are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event background:  I had to let my dog out in my backyard and just amazed by the beautiful night sky.  So I was enjoying observing stars when I noticed these two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really want to know what they are.

I told my mother to look and she saw  it too.  we had no idea what it was or what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another indication that it was not a star, was that usually when your driving, you can never drive ahead of a star, its usually ahead or above you.  But this wasnt a star, in fact it was way to bright to be one.  I kept an eye on it and eventually we pulled over and watched it for about 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it got brighter, and then dimmer, and then brighter, and then dim again and again. we started towards home,and we couldnt really see it so my mom told me to look in our spare bedroom window to see if it was still there.  when i went upstairs and looked out the window it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my mom that i could see it and kept watching, then all of a sudden, it started doing the brighter dimmer routine again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it went from light to dim, light to dim. then i saw about seven or eight other lights form a circle. That included the original one too. I called my mom upstairs and as she was comming up the stairs the lights went dim again until it was only one light. then just the one light kept going dim and bright dim and bright. during this routine it got so dim that it actually looked like a normal star. but then it got bright again. and then dim and then bright. then it got dimer and dimmer and dimmer until it didnt shine again, and then it was gone.

I was looking in the sky at the beams..right at sundown...as this was a newer machine and the location was about 2 miles across the river...looking up in the sky..I noticed a refection through low partly cloudy skyies...warm night...low level cumulus clouds.  (not complete cloud cover or fog like..more like a spring day than winter day)    I saw this directly over my house about 5000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light would flash against it....like a derigible or Goodyear blimp.  It was stationaary...could not notice lights did not  feel compelled to report it..as I didn&#39;t know there was a report...web site or that it was not considered mental illness to report.   I know it was some craft...and it was stationary...and my searchlight beam reflected off of it. It was large...larger than any air craft....It was not a C 130 from the AFB in Jaxville either.   I saw it as did my partner..on my front steps.   Cylinder and seemed similar to the submarine in Voyage to bottom of the Sea..with a saucer end then large fusalage like.   It was just hanging in the sky...as if it was just taking a view..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then waited the one or two seconds after looking at it for a few rotations of the skytracker searchlgiht and then the clouds moved and it was just gone as if it was not there.  It was something..and it was reflected..and I wouln&#39;t wait over 3 years to report it if I was just making it up. I know I saw something and I don&#39;t think it was a weather baloon.   There is just no body..to report this stuff to locally..here...Few people want to work in Arkansas after 5pm.  It is characteristic of the lifestyle here.  There are no live local real radio stations and It was not there long enough to call a TV station.  I tried to take a picture..but it did not show up.  I am not crazy, as I have seen on TV people who have seen a similar craft.  Not weird colored lights in night sky..but actual craft hanging in air..total silence....unsual.  could of been spy derigible possibly but why would they be syping at 5 to 10,000 feet rather than closer to earth..and why would it be over Maumelle?    a typical suburb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> did not see disk or strange lights or movement...but I did see something and I was not looking for it..when I saw it..I was only observing the searchlight beam and the reflectiion was obvious...and it was not making the same reflection as a cloud would make.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said he had first spotted it about 30 minutes earlier while driving.  My wife and I observed it for about 5 minutes, and it disappeared suddenly.   It reappeared just as suddenly about 5 minutes later and appeared to be larger, and better defined.  I watched it for about 15 more minutes when it disappeared at 20:15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the individual was observing Venus.  PD))<n>

Moving extremely fast they came in and were in a group - then one moved to the right and took up a position not far from a star..the other three moved to the left and spaced themselves evenly apart and also became motionless at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They went from being very bright to almost fading out completely and then they would all start to come into brightness again.  A type of synchronized strobbing was taking place with these (4) unknowns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for approximately 1 hour.  3 disappeared altogether from our sight as they went behind the tall pines in front of us.  The 4th stayed in place not moving - just changing in brightness from time to time.  The interesting thing about this was that the 4th unknown moved with the night skyline.  If we had not seen these 4 unknowns come into our skyline from the flash of light, we would have thought that they were just stars after they took up positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exciting to say the least... From our position we estimated that they were probably staged over the Pacific Ocean as the crow flys from us..<n>

All of the bulb&#39;s were working and had begun to flash on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed that about a half dozen of the lights furthest from us had begun to chase themselves back and forth numerous times.  We were both amazed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this light show when I noticed my wife was not.  Her attention had been caught by movement over the top of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking upwards I caught sight of the object that she was looking at.  There at about 50ft above the house was a oblong (?) shaped craft that was moving silently in a southernly direction.  It seemed to be reflecting the color&#39;s of the light&#39;s -Red-Green-Yellow-Blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We think the craft was about 10-15 ft long.  It seemed to have no external propulsion system, no navigation light&#39;s nor rudder.  It did seem to have electro-chromatic skin though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We eventually lost sight of the craft as we had to run around a tree in the front yard to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have not seen it since then.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It caught my attention because it was so large and not in the correct position to be the moon although it was white.  I looked at it and realized the edges were blurred and there was some difined shape within ot and then I noticed very faint twinkles of lights on the top flat side.  As I drove, I came to realize what I was seeing wasn&#39;t right.  I turned into a parking lot and lost the object behind trees for a moment, then found it again it what seemed to be a slightly different place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was calling my husband and kids to tell them to go outside and look at the sky.  They were downtown and couldn&#39;t see it.  I sat in the parking lot and looked at it . It seemed to be staying in the same place and was doing nothing. At this point I thought maybe it was a street light off in the distance and that I was having some sort of visual/perseption problem.  Then it changed into a perfect circle and turned slightly orange and got smaller and smaller.  I thought it was disappearing.  I was still on the phone to my son explaining all this to him as I watched it.  I told him it was disappearing.  Then it reshaped itself back into the  shape that it was in the beginning.  I decided to drive and see if I could get closer. I lost it behind buildings and trees.  Found it momentarily again but then lost it all together.  I drove back towards home on Redlands Blvd.  I went to the intersection at which I first noticed the object and actually turned around again (to drive west) to see if I could see it again from that same spot.  It was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus.

I feel like I have to comment on the note at the end of my description of the event on the nuforc reports page.  The note said  that I most likely was seeing Venus.  This could not be the case.  I am familiar with what Venus looks like this time of year.  I saw a large glowing (not star like) half circle( with a few twinkles at the top)  that changed shape into a complete circle and changed color from white to orange.  It then shrunk to a pin point and then reversed the process and became a glowing half circle again althoug a little more stretched out (if that makes sense). The object I was looking at was MUCH larger than Venus. Again, Venus looks like a very large star with some orange color to it.  I notice it often.  This is NOT what I saw.  Thanks.

I saw a bright light cross the sky. It was not consistant with any shooting star I have ever seen. It seemed much closer, near where planes would normally fly.  The shape was round and the size was much wider than traditional aircraft.  What struck me as odd was the speed it traveled and the fact that it made no sound.  It lasted for what I could see was about 2-3 seconds than went out of sight.  I have seen a meteor burn in earths atmosphere which gives off a green glow.  This was pure white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was near the Branford airport, however the planes that I saw in the distance before and especially after the event seemed to be moving in slow motion in comparison.<n>

Looks like a very big star, It seems to stay perfectly still at times, however we have seen it sway to the right and left very slowly, and raise up and down in the same fashion.  I am at a mountain top almost, and this is what I see approximately to my Southeast.  As it moved slowly, I saw one light ( an out of this world orange appear on its other side.)  It slowly moved away, and out of sight, below the horizon.<n>

It was visible directly forward while travelling on the I-15 southbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling home from work on thursday, the 8th of December. The time was around 3:50-4:00 pm. I was headed South on the I-15, toward the 215 turnoff to head west (where I live). I saw a large object in the sky, completely circular and grey. It hovered just above the mountain which was facing me (south). At first my eyes did not recognize the object in the air, and then I did a double take. It hovered there for about a minute. During this time of me spotting the object, I was beginning to exit the 15 South, and head down the 215 west. Furing that turnoff, you get taken underneath a section of freeway, temporarily blocking the view of the craft. When I finally completed exiting the freeway, and was finally on the 215, I looked back and the craft was gone. I was able to look at it, and observe it for less than 30 seconds, but when I turned off, and was going to pull over to really pay attention to it, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am used to seeing commerical airplanes and hellicopters all over this valley, and since my condo sits on higher ground than the airport, I get a constant view of planes comming in for landings and taking off. My father was in the air force, so I was raised around aircraft. This was not something I could have mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t move, make noise, cause any electronic interference I was aware of, and it didn&#39;t emit any light. It just sat there motionless in the sky, larger than any hellicopter or airplane I had ever seen in real life. It hovered about as high as normal hellicopters do when they are doing the traffic reports for the news. (I see them over the 15 all the time when I am heading home around 4:30-5 ish)  I wish I could have had the time to stop my car and take a photo. I had a camera but not within my reach while operating my vehicle. It was so large, I am astonished no one else has reported this. I asked a few friends in town if they had seen it, and they hadn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a meteor or other falling object from space, it had a tail which extended straight up as if it were falling. I first sited it at exactly 1:00, and it was still visible at 4:00 pm eastern and appeared have moved a relatively small distance down. it was off white in color compared to the pure white of a nearby air plain trail.  The object was hard to distinguish from the tail but appeared to be irregularly or oblong in shape, not spherical.  The tail was approximatly 11 times longer than the object itself.<n>

At first I thought it was a planet or a star. But, it had an amber color to it and it moved straight up and down and sidways and around.  It was off in the Northwest sky.  More west than north of our place.  I wanted to go wake my husband, but I was also afraid it would disappear while I was gone.  Plus, it takes him awhile to become alert when he first wakes up, so I left him alone and watched it by myself.  I then tried to explain it away that it was the Air Force doing maneuvers with one of those aircraft that can take off straight up and go sideways.  However, this object did it so swiftly and sharply that I didn&#39;t think it could have been one of those.  I had seen them at the EAA convention in Oshkosh, WI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell the distance it moved by the windowsill I was watching it out of. Plus, our neighbors behind us aways, have a yard light. It started over one yard light and by the time it faded into the distance it was practically over the other neighbors yardlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Midwest housewife, who really didn&#39;t believe in these sort of things. But, I saw for myself tonight,unless someone has an explaination for me.  I didn&#39;t know what to do at first.  I thought of calling the police, the local TV weather meterologist etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had gotten up because I couldn&#39;t sleep and then decided to come into the computer room to work on the computer for awhile.  But, before I could turn the light on in the room, I noticed this bright thing off to the northwest looking out the window in the room.  Like I stated it was amber in color or reddish and then became bright white at times. It also appeared as if there were sparks coming off of it. I watched it dip straight down, move sidways, go straight up and hover around in a oval circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the possibility the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, I.e. a star or planet, would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that she was looking at a genuine UFO.  Mars, which is quite prominent in the night sky, may have been in the western sky, at the time indicated by the witness, but that possibility is mere surmise, on our part.  PD))<n>

He said he watched it for an hour and it was definitely no airplane, helicopter or star.  The next day he told his nan who took him quite seriously.  The next day she showed him the local newspaper,  The Burntwood Post, and it had an article about sightings of a ufo by 3 different people.  He said there was an artists impression of 3 lights but my friend only saw 1.  Another person to see it was a lady woken in her sleep by an intense smell.  She looked out the window and saw a light in the sky.  As her husband was downstairs she went down to find him looking out the window also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened near pye green, staffordshire. I believe there have already been sightings near Pottle or Pottal Pool Road, Cannock Chase.

Suddenly some crazy noise that sounded like a a airoplane taking off many people stood and looked around for a jet but no jet appeared . Some man shouted &#34;hey everyone check if your phone is on!&#34;, so everyone checked and there phone where off and would not switch on . The station lights flickererd and turned off then i went inside to get away from the noise and there was a power cut. Everyone was going outside . Ilooked to the sky to see a HUGE black object in the horizon  with red lights on.Now this is stranged because it sounded like air raidsirens were going off (i thoughts the ufo was making it).it went  past extremely slowly and circled a church spire.It left a grey trail of smoke.It then went down a bit ,Then a girl started to cry.Then it wierdly turned to water.Then the noise stopped about 4 second after it did so.The lights went on.Suddenly EVERYONE started to get upset,it was like it maid people cry.I felt like someone had died or like i missed a extremelly inporttant oppertunity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched them on two consecutive nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Dec 7th around 8:00pm , I was northbound on Hwy 95 approx. 15 miles south of McDermott, Nevada and they appeared on the east side of the highway and I would guess them to be about 6 miles away and just above the hill tops. They appeared as a cluster of lights and each individual light appeared to be huge.  The lights were the only thing visible and seemed to be in staggered positions.  Their lights coming on and going off were synchronized and always moved from left to right.  When the first light came on it stayed lit until the second light came on and then the first one would slowly fade out and as the third light  lit up the second light would begin to fade away until it was completely off. This all happened within about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Dec 8th at about 9:00pm on a clear night with good visibility, I saw lights  on the south-east side of the road on Hwy 95 at mile marker 38.  This is between Jordan Valley and Rome, Oregon.  I watched 4 lights coming on and off in sequence from right to left moving upward at a 45 degree angle.  We always see the same type of UFO&#39;s in the Idaho, Oregon and Nevada area.  Always at night, always over the mountain tops and only being able to see lights going off and on.  August 2004 in Idaho and Dec 8th 2005 in Jordan Valley, Oregon area there has been a bright flash appear in the sky some distance away from the UFO activity.<n>

It had to be fairly large or close to the tree tops.  I could see the moon and the object at the same time.  It looked to be 1/3rd the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an area with few lights (couple of street lights) and on a cloudy black evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird thing is my son-in-law saw a bright glowing object that was half-moon shaped around the same area about a month earlier but I didn&#39;t believe him; I thought he was just exaggerating.  By my experience I had forgotten all about his and what his looked like.<n>

It was not very bright as with the other two fireballs I have witnessed in 30 years of observing the sky.  It left trail that glowed for approx. 5 seconds.  Facing north it was approx. 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing was how slow it moved across the sky.  I have seen hundreds of meteors (I am an amateur astronomer) and I have never seen one move this slowly before.  The other three witnesses agreed that it was moving a lot slower than any meteor they had observed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know exactly how to put this into words, but the whole event was just odd. I&#39;ve never seen a meteor moving due east like that, nor acting like it did. It just kept heading east, never growing brighter or dimmer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely not an airplane or a satellite, after all it left a trail.<n>

I sit out with him in the back yard trying to train him to do his duty outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one week ago I saw something going across the sky south to north.  It seemed longer then a plane and lights seemed to stretch the length of it.  Mostly red lights.  What I noticed was the extremely slow pace it went and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I was sitting facing east in the dark with Nate.  I looked up at the stars and noticed nothing but the star in the east that is the brightest right now.  Suddenly approximately directly under the north star? downlittle I saw what appeared to be a string of lights again.  No sound.  I would try and describe it as like a string bean or Chestnut tree whip with lights from one end to the other.  Not straight, but rather bent back, maybe like a boomerang but with not as much bend, just curved slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up another appeared to the right and one to the left behind it.  I just looked down at the dog and said &#34;see ya&#34; and went immediately in the house.  I tried to get my daughter on the phone and then my son and one neighbor and finally got one to look outside and they saw nothing.  I finally had the courage to look and saw nothing.  then saw it towards the west almost straight up, as I went to tell the neighbor on the phone about it I looked again it was gone.  They hover, not fly in any direction. The first and last appearances were separated by about an hour.  They do not fly away, they simply disappear.  I am hoping there is just something wrong with my eyes, but just had complete eye exam by Dr. ((name of doctor deleted)). After I went in the house after talking to neighbor the phone ran and all that was there was a noise like muffled helicopter blades, later I thought I heard that outside but figured I was just losing my mind.  this morning the television will not go on, will have to check batteries, light in kitchen would not go on, will check bulb<n>

It looked like it hit just over the hill, very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pulled off the freeway in north Marysville and asked the man who pulled in behind me if he had viewed the light also, he stated that he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been a meteor or something but it was pretty spectacular to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everett Boeing had just ended second shift so I am sure alot of other people viewed it as well.<n>

There appeared to be about 8-12 lights in a sequence and wiggled in a straight trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look, but by then, the light formation was fading from my view. I didn&#39;t see any type of shape or solid formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was definitely within the atmosphere and it made no sound. I thought it being DC, it might be some experimental flying military craft, but the fact that it made no sound and wiggled made me suspicious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no e-address.

It seemed to be going very slowly, but extremely fast at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what the shape of the aircraft is, as it was pitch black out (Washington State=cloudy), but there were three somewhat dim lights on the bottom that shone straight down that were arranged in a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I nearly got in a wreck while I was watching-whatever it was, I have never seen one before-and I did not see any flashing lights on the sides (if there were sides, I am not sure), so I am almost sure it was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew from East to West, and it appeared to be headed for the refineries at Anacortes, which is in a Westerly direction from Mount Vernon.  However, there is an air force base on Whidbey Island, which is also West of Mt. Vernon, so perhaps this was some experimental stealth aircraft.  However, if it was, I would recommend that they turn their lights off next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw a ufo yesterday night on my ride home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Riverside is surrounded by mountains, and since my home is on the top of the mountain, the road home provided a great view of the ufo.  It was a lime green, egg-shaped object, with a couple of red lights that blinked on and off on top of the object.  It was unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not move up or dowm, it only moved horizontally.  It slowly moved horizontally.  I got the feeling as if the ufo was overlookling the city, it stopped when it reached a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then went behind the mountain, where it disappeard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at a road near my home and saw all of it.  When it first caught my eye, it was close, and once I actually stopped by the road, it had gotten farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking video and a picture with my cell phone, but the object was too far away to get a good capture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Riverside is close to an airport, and there were at least 5 airplanes that filled the night sky. However, they all looked like airplanes do at night and they all flew at the same elevation, while the ufo flew about half the elevation a normal plane does, and was right on top of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel like I need to tell someone, but it seems as if no one else saw it because I looked on the internet and there are no reports.<n>

As we live in la, we where traving south on the 1-15 and we had either just passed or were just approaching the 210 connection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was super strange about this sighting, is that this plane was huge. I would guestimate at least 4 to six times the size of the biggest bomber plane that I have ever seen. To say that it was about the size of a football field would possibly be accurate, but I have no way of accurately reporting the size for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This palne was incredible, and my web research it looks identical to the Black mantra or giant stealth bomber other peoples have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this most remarkable is the craft drifted, at a very slow speed, that of the speed of a blimp, and maybe ever slower. In direction it seemed to be doing large circles around the town to our drivers side, and it would go way west of us, and then circle back. It seemed to be even holding its position for an instance, but we later realized it was just on a perspective that it must be moving in a direction towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But this object was incredible, it was so massive and flew so slowly I felt it best to be reported here. It may not be an alien space craft, and I doubt it is, but l would bet this remains unidentified for some time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I drove at 75 mph for about 15 minutes and the plane was still in view circling the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was also silent, for its size we expected to here some engine, but when we rolled down our windows we heard nothing. Maybe we were too far away, but I&#39;d guess we were between 1-2 miles away from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was all a daytime experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for letting me share my fasinating experience with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I was facing s.w. and saw a very bright white light approaching from the s.w. heading n.e.. Thought it was an aiplane on approach. As it got closer I noticed the light was intense and completely surrounded the &#34;plane&#34;. It went over my head at about 1000 feet and made no sound at all. I still was thinking it was a plane until it passed and the bright light totally surrounded the object. No wings noticed. No red and green lights. speed was about 150 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I first observed this, it was glowing orange with a very short tail behind it.  The object then had smaller glowing pieces coming off of it.  This lasted for approx-imately  three seconds. The glowing object then went out and reappeared for 2 seconds.  It seemed odd because of the slow speed that it was moving at.

We did not report as we are unsure of what happens with these reports. Before this sighting we have noticed alot of strange UFO activity in our rural location such as weird lights in the sky, unknown sounds in and on top of house such as &#34;something&#34; running arcross roof late at night or very early in the morning hours. Also, a few months before this sighting we observed five to six &#34;helicopters&#34; with very low humming engines and air to ground spotlights flying around the area as searching in a grid formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We(husband, wife and child) went outside to the rear of our home to gather the trash cans and wheel them out front to the curb. About mid-way I(husband) happened to look up and saw a huge &#34;ship&#34; and proclaimed &#34; What the !@#! is that?&#34; at which time my wife and son also looked up and observed the object. It was moving from South to North VERY slowly and was less than 150 feet in the air or right above our tree tops. The object was sort of rectangluar in shape but not quite. The rear of the object was &#34;glowing&#34; an yellow orange color and making a low humming sound. In the center of the object was looked like a large dome that hung below the object and pulsated the same yellow orange color. As we only saw the underbelly of the object we also noticed many what seemed to be &#34;tubes&#34;, my wife said it looked to her more like a flying generator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To say the least, we all three were very shocked and with me being a ufo buff got quite excited! Since this encounter we have heard that same &#34;humming sound&#34; on other occassions that seem to come from right above our home. We also hear very strange sounds that come from the woods around our home quite frequently and still see strange activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was pitch black night. As I neared Tadmarton Golf club. I saw the underneath of a triangular silver coloured object, hovering about 20 feet in the air. It had three apple coloured lights, which were rectangular, they were at the three points of the triangle. Also at each point of the triangle there were three bright white lights. As I drove past I turned and it shot off in to the dark. I turned around and entered the driveway of the golf club. I cannot see where it is. It had completely disappeared. It must have been a UFO as there are no street lights of any kind! I will endevour to send and image as soon as I can draw it in a software package.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/5/05 17:30|Rancho Cucamonga|CA|Light|10 minutes|Light (s) routinely spotted from East to West during the past one an half years|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48247.html|232|ndxe200512| Light (s) routinely spotted from East to West during the past one an half years<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ball of light, ususally one and sometimes two.  These have been seen for the past year and a half.  The ball appears high in the Eastern sky, estimated altitude of 100K ft. plus, at approximately 75 degrees and proceeds at a high rate of speed diagonally towards the southwest stops at my 110 degrees vertically and at approximately 25 degrees from my horizontal.  Somwhere over Los Angeles. It then makes a straight beeline towards the north, stops at approximately over La Canada or 10-15 degrees north of my horizontal and then heads east to the original point.  It will often stop and repeat the pattern or will execute a right turn and head straight south and out of sight.  Other times when it turns to the North it keeps on going until out of sight.  When there are two lights, they fly in irregular patterns and sometimes seem to go around in circles like they are chasing each other.  Then, one will stop and the other goes off to the South West.  Very seldom, a pulse trail appears when the light starts to move from a stopped position and it will also change to a dull orange or red color when it comes to a stop. The time of tracking is normally seconds ie. 5-10.  Sometimes, they move in straight lines, but most of the time, they travel in a slight waving pattern at a high rate of speed. I have been seeing this phenonomimum with both the naked eye (my vision is pretty close to 20/20) and with 7x35 W/A binoculars.  Last month, my son (age 25 and his friend (same age) also seen it with me at approx. 11:30 PM.  I have been spotting this light(s) on a routine basis, normally between 9-9:45 pm and again at between 11:00 and 11:45 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this light(s) appearing in the night sky, nothing other than a shooting star had appeared until August of 2004.  At that time, I seen a dull red ball of light go lazily accross the sky from the East to the West at 8:45 pm and follow the same pie/wedge travel pattern. It traveled at approximately 110 degrees to my vertical of 90. The total time was maybe 3-4 minutes.  Thereafter, the light(s) began appearing.  I am no hokster.  I purposly kept this to myself and close confidents because of potential ridicule.  Hope you can explain what is going on.  I will give you my business address for your records.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received no other reports of these sightings, as far as we know.  PD))<n>

As we pulled into a quiet neighbourhood where I live, I noticed two lights overhead, pretty bright but not blinding. They seemed like regular airplane lights.  However, as we continued driving, about 10 seconds later the object was right above and to the right of our car, giving me a perfect view.  It seemed huge. To be honest, I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before. It was triangular-shaped, with 3 dim blue lights at each tip, with a steady-glowing red one in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly howered over the car at about 1,000 feet and gave me the strangest feeling.  &#34;Awe&#34; is a good word to describe it, I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;ve seen something I could not rationally explain. It made no sound whatsoever.  My friend, who saw it but couldn&#39;t observe it well enough due to the fact he was driving, suggested it was an airplane.  When we stopped not even 10 seconds later to get out of the car and have a better look at it, it has already vanished.  What puzzles me, is the fact that it was moving so slowly, that it should have been still right above us when we got out.  The skies were clear, and there are no big trees in the neightbourhood to obstruct the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a pretty big Interstate highway junction (actually, currently under construction for expansion) half a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object reminded me of the famous &#34;Triangles&#34; seend in Belgium in the 90&#39;s.  To this moment I&#39;m in a state of excitement, for this is the first time in my life I saw something I could not explain.  A true UFO encounter :)<n>

On the way up the hill to our home, we saw a very bright elongated light in the south southwest sky.  It was about 4:05 pm and dusk was falling.  The sky was a clear midnight blue and there were very few clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unknown object was to the right of the moon and a bright planet (I think venus...).  I stopped the car to establish a  point of reference and determined that the object did not seem to be moving.  It was far in the distance and did not look like anything that I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to drive down a different road to get another look.  As we drove it started to fade away.  It eventually became a grey streak in the sky and then completed disappeared.  My daughter said &#34;it looks like someone cut a gash in the sky and was shining a light through it.&#34;   I agree.  It even seemed to seal itself and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very, very odd!<n>

The &#34;plane&#34; had no wings or tail.  The distance of it was anywhere from 8 to 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the object reached the edge of the mountain, it vanished in plain sight.  It did not turn, or bank, or rise, or fall, or slip behind a ridge.  I continued watching to see if it would reappear, and a couple minutes later I saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time it was in front of the north hump of Saddleback Mountain, flying north to south.  Before it reached the edge, it once again vanished in plain sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for 10 more minutes, but I didn&#39;t see it again.  Both times that I saw it, I saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I noticed something funny loking up in the sky. It was a green boomerang looking craft that had what looked like little holes in the back for engine outlets. The tail ended in a point at the back and it had no visible rear stabilizers. When I saw it the craft was making a slow right hand turn going up in a corkscrew style. I looked away and then looked back and it was gone. It made no sound and at the time there were no airplanes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I looked up and saw this object only several hundred feet above me in the air. At first first i took it to be a helicopter as seen from directly below however the Red, Blue and White-yellow lights struck me as odd. They did not blink and were very bright making it difficult to distinguish anything about the shape of the craft which would have blended into the night sky in the absence of light. However i believe it may have been tear drop shaped or perhaps something akin to a triangle with smoothed edges.The craft moved very quickly over my location and dissappeared on the otherside of an apt. building. The oddest thing about the sighting which makes me discount a plane or helicopter was the absence of any sound. This object made no noise. No hum or anything. It was deadly quiet and very fast. Growing up in the city near both major airports I am accustomed to seeing helicopters and planes flying low. I normally don&#39;t even look twice but something was very different about this craft. It was very unsettling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

First chevron object appeared at approx. 21:00 on 12/4/05. It appeared to be formed by approx. two dozen individual white lights of very low intensity (approx. same brightness as Polaris). Lights formed a luminous chevron shaped object. Speed appeared to be very great, much faster than high altitude commercial traffic. Second chevron appeared approx. 3 minutes later and followed the same path across the sky. It was smaller, consiting of approx. 12 individual lights. Both objects disappeared much in the way a satellite disappears from view after leaving the terminator area. I am an amateur observer and know the current sky positions of both Venus and Mars, this was not either of these planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bottom light was moving N to S. I really ran home to get my camera 3 blocks away.  I called an uncle in Santa Monica to get a 2nd witness, he wasn&#39;t home.   I got my camera and only found one of the lights and took several photographs with 2 cameras.  In one of the pictures a jet is streaming by, hopefully we can use this to pinpoint the light.  After several minutes I lost sight of the light.  I kept looking into the blue sky and could not see it.  Finally I looked towards the sun and noticed it North and 3 o clock in the corona.  I used the trees to block the sun and took more pictures.  I also took more pictures with the sun, in the hopes that we can reverse the picture in photoshop and get the light to be more pronounced.  I will email and mail pics as soon as they are processed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend thought it moved towards us. there were no parties or anything such as sound to explain the light (as it could have been a fire work) and it was also larger than a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THIS TIME DISAPEAR WITH A HUGE SONIC BOOM!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just like it was reported in February of this year (2005);<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported: 2/20/2005 4:42:22 PM 16:42;<n> <n><n> Posted: 2/22/2005  12/03/2005:  I was really surprised to read a posting of a sighting that exactly matches the one I just experienced tonight. The sky was exactly the same and the description of the four lights is exactly the same. The pattern of the four circular lights dancing in a consistent pattern, returning to the middle and repeating in a circular motion is just as I saw it. My sons thought this was cool and my wife thinks I am crazy, although she saw the same thing and says they were advertising spotlights. This could be true, however, the lights you normally would see shooting up to the sky were not ever present. The farther you moved away, the larger the distance of the lights would become. The really cool part is when I went outisde about two hours later to take my dog out, the lights were there doing the same exact thing but then a loud sonic boom blasted through the air as if a space shuttle was taking off, and would you believe that the lights disappeared as the very loud sound diminished? I can almost say with certainty that this sound seemed to be moving up and away from the surface of the earth and up into the sky, just like the space shuttle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 2/20/2005 19:20 (Entered as : 02/20/2005 19:20) Reported: 2/20/2005 4:42:22 PM 16:42 Posted: 2/22/2005 Location: Fairfax, VA Shape: Light Duration:2-3minutes 4 dancing lights<n>

There was a formation of 4 lights rapidly moving from west to north. As it turned north, the lights were obstructed by an oak tree in our cul-de-sac, and I ran to the front yard to see what this was. It took me about 8 seconds to view around the oak tree and there was nothing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

County<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday evening December 3rd, 2005 at 19:15 p.m. driving towards Hollywood on the 5 freeway just before the 605 freeway over the Norwalk area I spotted a bright magenta colored light to the left in the sky about the 10 o&#39;clock position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my girl &#34;What is that!&#34; as I pointed up in the sky.  She looked down and out the windshield as I also looked out the side window.  The light was pulsating, like no other.  It  was not a helicopter nor a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the bright magenta light was a smaller dim white light that was visible every other second.  As we drove north on the 5 freeway the object seemed to stay stationary and we were slowly passing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as it was about even with my shoulder straight up, the bright magenta light fell from the sky like a rock and got brighter as it approached the ground.  We could no longer see the object.

12/3/05 18:45|San Francisco|CA|Triangle|15-20 seconds|Two large Triangle shaped objects that flew over San Francisco Bay Area near Mt. Davidson|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48061.html|248|ndxe200512| Two large Triangle shaped objects that flew over San Francisco Bay Area near Mt. Davidson<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 6:45 PM on December 3, 2005, a friend and I were outside on our back deck looking to the crystal clear night sky facing west when we saw two large black triangle shaped objects move slowly and at a low altitude (500-1000 feet) directly over our house from the north west Mt. Davidson area to the south east.  We live in San Francisco on the south east side of Mt. Davidson at the cross street of Terasita and Los Palmos in Miraloma Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two distinct objects that we observed were flying in side by side formation and appeared to moving as one.  Both craft were perfect equilateral triangles with pulsating dim star like lights on each tip of the two triangles, six lights in total.  These were most definitely two solid black large triangle shaped objects which from underneath appeared to be much darker than the night sky as they passed in front other stars in the night sky and were darker than they night sky with no moon.  The objects were very well cloaked (best way to describe it) against the background of the night sky and could have easily been mistaken as constellations but they were moving slowly which is what caught our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted for approximately 30-45 seconds.  The objects did not appear to change speed, direction or altitude and moved slowly together overhead until they dimmed out of sight near the south side San Francisco crossing over 280 onto the north west of the San Bruno mountain range.   I have been an amateur astronomer for over twenty five years now and I can say with conviction that these were definitely Not planes, satellites, blimps, helicopters, the International Space Station, meteorites or fire balls.  They were two solid triangle shaped objects that move in perfect formation together and made absolutely no noise as traveled directly over head.  The two craft were identical in size and were significantly larger than a 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions in San Francisco last night crystal clear and ideal for sky watching.  The crescent moon had also just dropped below the south western horizon about 15 minutes prior before we witnessed this once in a life time sighting.  We were both truly shocked by what we had just seen to the extent that we felt it necessary to call into two local TV stations (CBS 5 &amp; KGO 7) to report what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am in my late thirties and the other person in their earlyy 40s.  We both have always been rather skeptical of alien spacecraft visiting Earth simply given the vast distances between stars and the time required to travel such a distance without bending space/time.  But having just what we say with our own two eyes list night, we can now say with absolute conviction that they were highly advanced craft that ones gut feeling tells them to be &#39;other worldly&#39;.  Nither of us had been drinking nor were we in any other altered mental state of consciousness at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw any strange objects lights in the Bay Area night sky last night please feel free to contact me.  I consider this experience one of the most amazing events of my lifetime that I cannot refute.  Weather the objects were deeply classified military X-Project space craft or Alien cannot be proven (yet) but the objects had an eerie feeling to them in the way that they moved together and at the angle the triangles were positioned in flight.  The profound impact of this event will forever change how I look at humanity and that such highly advanced technology does exists regardless of its origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not heard anyone else reporting what we saw last night in the media or on the internet but hopefully other people in the Bay Area witnessed the same event.<n>

I have been working there for about 8 or 9 months now.  I have access to the roof which is 10 stories off the ground.  The building is placed on high ground so you get a great view of Long Island, from the airports to hospitals to the beach were I had my sighting.  I always go up there to smoke my cigarettes, I looked toward Robert Moses Beach too look at the lighthouse you can see it well at night.  Just a little to the right, right above the horizon i notice these 5 bright redish orange colored lights staying still in the sky but they all would fade away and re appear in a new location but all in the same general area never moving far from each other.  When the lights were visible they never moved they stood still and only faded away and faded back in a new location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I called my girl friends father to tell him what I was seeing becuase he has had sightings himself.  For about 5 mintues the lights just kept doing the fading thing then i noticed only 4 lights were visible the 5th never came back from fading out.  The 4 lights stopped fading away and stood still but in 2 groups of 2.  Two of them sat still right next to each other and the other 2 did too but farther from the other two.  They stayed like this for about 2-3 mintues then started the random fade thing once more.  As they did this the 4th didnt come back then the 3rd and so on till there was 1 light left fading away and coming back then it was gone.  It faded and never came back.  I kept looking at the sky but none came back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back down to the lobby and wrote it all down as I saw it.  I went back up 15 minutes later to see if I would see anything again, they were still gone but instead there were many airplanes patroling the same exact area of the sky about 8-9 planes.  I&#39;ve been up there countless times and have never once seen anything like that up there or in my life.  I&#39;ve see airplanes take off from the airport at the same spot many times and these were no airplanes.  I&#39;ve also never seen airplanes in a group like that in that area which also makes me think they weren&#39;t commerical passenger planes but perhaps military, investigating what I had just seen.  These lights were bigger then the flashing lights of an airplane.  You can also make out each individual light, these lights were mixed together an orange red color and they never blinked like an airplane but they twinkled like stars do.  What I saw was no earth craft, this was something I&#39;ve never seen before.<n>

I was just leaving my house and out over the ocean, I saw a very bright &#34;star&#34; like object in the sky. It was enormous compared to the other visible stars in the sky. At that monment, I noticed other aircraft in the sky around this object. I thought it may be military planes given the fact that they seemed small and flew very quickly. One of these aircraft flew up to the object and shined what looked like a spotlight at it. Then it flew away from the object still shining the light as it headed south. This aircraft, I noted, had ONLY 3 red lights and may be a hint as to what type of plane it was. There were about 4 other planes flying to and away from this object that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some photographs with a film camera and have yet to see what comes out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also what looked like a lunar eclipse (although I&#39;ve never actually seen one before) It was just very eerie. My husband and one of my children also witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as altitude, I would guess that it was about 20,000 feet in the air. And would have been over the atlantic in the bayshore area between NJ and staten Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Photographs Upon request)<n>

It appeared to be at an altitude of 12,000-15,000 feet at a distance of 10-15 miles.  It was a slow moving object that traveled towards the west at a very slow pace, every so often glistening in the sun very brightly otherwise was a metallic object that appeared to be a disc shape.  After about 30 seconds the object stopped and then instantly reversed direction traveling back the where we first spotted it and the suddenly disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in the vacinity of both Detroit Metro Airport and Selfridge Air National Guard and I can assure you it was not a jet powered aircraft either civilian or military.  After 20 years of airshows and constantly watching every plane flying overhead, and watching too much of Discovery Wings on the tv I have immense understanding of what type of craft are in our skies, and this wasn&#39;t one of them.<n>

The UFO was travelling the exact direction away from me, due South.  It&#39;s magnatude was around 2.0 (about the same magnatude as the stars in Ursa Major).  As the UFO continued south, it&#39;s magnitude diminished.  The UFO was no longer visible at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon.  When I could no longer see the UFO I spotted an aircraft that sounded like a commercial airliner.  The aircraft was travelling at the same speed(from my viewpoint) and parallel to the UFO.  The aircraft was about 5 degrees East of the UFO&#39;s trejectory, and also lagged the UFO anywhere from 40-50 degrees.  Both the aircraft and the UFO travelled in a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23 years old, I am an amateur astronomer who has always taken an interest in looking at the stars.  I became extremely dedicated to observing about 2 years ago, which is when I was trialling a nice pair of binoculars to see if I wanted to invest in a telescope.  Currently I own 2 refracting (60mm &amp; 70mm) scopes and 1 reflecting (130mm) telescope.<n>

It was clear night and I was looking at the stars.  I noticed a &#34;star&#34; moving North across the sky.  My first impression was that it was a satilite, it was pretty high up - I then scanned right/South and saw approximately 11-14 similar &#34;objects&#34; moving in the same direction as the first object.  The objects did not seem to be in formation, however they we clustered/grouped and a number of the objects on the perimeter were moving/swirving in and out of the group.  After the group of objects passed, there was a brighter star-object that followed in the same path.  The trajectory of the objects was right over Logan Airport.  There were planes in the sky at the same time as the event.  Through my observation, I can confidently say they were not meteors/planes/blimps/etc..<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were lighted, circular star-like objects - moving at a very high altitude, all following the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were oval and held their position so they may have been lights on a structure but the structure itself was not visible, only the lights.  They were not bright and were visible only while almost overhead.  There was no sound associated with the movement and the movement was smooth.  I started to count the lights when it was about 2/3 past me and counted 9 but the clarity was diminishing and there seemed to be more than that.  It was moving from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be in groups of 20-30. They started comming out of the north in a horizontal line to somewhat of a v shape and looked like groups of moving stars. We saw several passenger jet move across the sky while we were watching the objects and judging from the speed of a jet these objects were going 8-10 times faster than the jets. I got out my binoculars and looked at them as they came over and they had a bird like or plane like shape. In the binoculars they looked slightly illuminated or white. These groups came one after another for at least 45 minutes that we watched. I have lived here for 50 years and I have never seen anything like this in the sky. I dont believe these were birds on migration because there were too many of them and there was no sound. Also as I was watching one group approach one of the objects fell from the formation and had the appearance of a meteorite except it fell much slower.If anyone can tell me what this was please let me know.

Then it started to decend from the sky.  It looked like a plane crashing right at me.  I stopped the car.  The thing stopped and flew over me very slowly.  It looked like a roundish disk and had blue lights in a circle around it and two red lights on it.  Then it went back up into the sky really fast &amp; disappeared.

To me left, towards the east, I could see a very brightly lit object that was located beneath a star.  It didn&#39;t seem to move much and may have changed length slightly and gradually as I watched it (as if it were turning?).  It consisted of several, mayby 5, VERY BRIGHT yellowish lights that appeared to be circular in shape and in a perfect line, very close together.  I thought that this could be how the windows of an airplane might look if it were rather close (it seemed rather large) and if it had only a limited number of passenger windows.  It was just starting to get dark though, the sky was well lit and overcast and the stars were just starting to show as I recall.  The lights SEEMED to be FAR too bright for aircraft windows especially considering that it wasn&#39;t really dark yet. The sky was a sort of grey color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The extreme brightness of the lights indicated to me that they might have been actual exterior lights (not windows) but they didn&#39;t strobe at all, were yellowish, were too large in number and I don&#39;t think that they occur in a straight line, one right after the other on aircraft. No strobing navigation lights were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to drive towards and then into this small town and looked at it very frequently to try to identify it. when I entered the town and turned a corner, my view was blocked by trees for about 15 seconds or so. When the view was again clear,the object was not at all visible. It was large and seemingly near and very brightly illuminated just seconds before. I saw the star that I assumed was the right one but looked around and could not see this object. I wondered if it were a plane (lear jet as far as the approximate number of windows is concerned?) that could have turned and become not visible. This didn&#39;t seem likely to me at the time.<n>

He and his wife had spotted objects in the sky and asked my husband if we had seen them/been watching them.  My husband went outside to see them then came back inside, woke me up and had me go out and look at them.  There were 3 distant objects (that I could see) in the Eastern sky.  They appeared not to be moving at all.  They were brighter than stars and &#34;twinkling&#34;/&#34;blinking&#34;.  Had they been moving I would have thought they were airplanes or helicopters or something.  But what struck us all was that they appeared to be motionless but just as bright if not brighter than an airplane or such.  When we first looked at them there were two other aircrafts in the air that were moving so it was easy to tell the difference between and airplane/helicopter and what we were seeing, which were seemingly motionless. I decided to use my husband&#39;s binoculars to see if I could get a better view of what they were.  I looked at each one and they each had the same characteristics.  It was FREEZING outside so it was hard for me to stand still and my shaking from the cold made my vision a bit blurry at times through the binoculars.  I couldn&#39;t see an &#34;object&#34; per say, but each &#34;object&#34; had bright, blinking lights (red, green, white, blue, etc.) that appeared to blink very quickly and seemed to change the pattern of their blinking/lighting-up.  With the binoculars, I could clearly see the lights.  The lights lit up clearly in circles but it was difficult for me to see their patterns as I was shaking from the cold and the patterns that the lights lit up in seemed to change very quickly.  We came to the conclusion that they were satellites since we know very little about this type of thing, but after looking into sattelites on the internet have determined that not to be the case.  We are all completely stumped at what we saw.  But these objects didn&#39;t appear to move a bit for at least an hour and a half (till we finally went to bed).  There has been no mention of it on the news and am very curious for an explanation of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The date I am reporting is approximate but I know it was between Nov &amp; Dec of 2005.  I was sitting on the couch watching TV with my 2 sons when I heard my dog barking.  I turned around and found her looking out the open front door and at the same time one of my sons was walking over to her to see what she was barking at.  I was getting up myself to see what was going on when I saw my son looking out the door towards where the dog was looking.  At that point he said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  My second son and I went to the front door and looked out and hovering above several of our neighbors houses and very close to the trees was a huge object and we were staring directly at it!  At first our eyes were directed to 2 red non blinking lights that were opposite of each other and when our eyes started focusing in the dark a little better we could see that there was a very dark (almost matching the night sky dark)cylindar looking object that these lights were a part.  This gave it a cigar looking appearance and as each end looked like burning embers of red &amp; it made no sound whatsover.  My son who first spotted it was scared and ran back into the house.  My other son &amp; I watched it slowly move towards the south of us (towards the Crawfordville area).  After I gathered my thoughts I rushed inside &amp; tried to find my camera but I could not find it so I ran back outside &amp; hopped into my car with my other son as I wanted to try to follow it and get a better view but it just took off &amp; I did not spot it again.   My kids &amp; I have never forgotten that night and have never seen anything like it since.  I am a full time professional women &amp; a busy &#34;soccer&#34; mom &amp; to this day I am shaken by what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

WE SAW ONE OF THE SPHERE&#39;S LOOKED AS IF IT WENT THROUGH THE BRIGHT TRIANGLE. THE SHERE&#39;S WOULD MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE, UP AND DOWN, BE RACING AND COME TO A DEAD STOP. AS WE WATCHED WE SAW AIR CRAFT COMING AROUND, I&#39;M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE INVESTIGATING THE LIGHTS IN THE SKY OR JUST NORMAL COMMERICAL. I WATCHED ONE OF OUR AIR CRAFTS COMING CLOSE TO THE BLUE SPHPERE, AND THE SHPERE LOOKED AS IF IT WAS TONTING OUR AIR CRAFT. AT ONE POINT I STARTED WORRING, THINKING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 30 SECOUND SIGHTING? ANYWAY THIS WENT ON FOR AN HOUR, THEN THE TRIANGLE LIGHT WENT OFF NORTHWEST OVER THE MOUNTINGS, BUT THE SHERES STAYED AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES AFTER. OUR FACES WERE GLUED TO THE WINDOW THE WHOLE TIME. AT ONE TIME I FELT SCARED, WAS THIS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS? (I&#39;VE YET TO READ THE BOOK OR WATCH THE MOVIE) BUT IT WAS A SIRREAL FEELING. I KEPT MY CHILDREN CLOSE AND THE WINDOWS LOCKED.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/1/05 17:00|Easley|SC|Triangle|5 hours|Hovering triangle shaped aircraft that the military DID see no matter what they report to the public.|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51052.html|271|ndxe200512| Hovering triangle shaped aircraft that the military DID see no matter what they report to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside smoking cigarettes. I had a 3 month old in my house and my cousin&#39;s 2 week old baby was inside as well so now you can see why we were sitting outside on a cool fall, almost winter evening. It was almost dusk and about 5 miles away we could see something flying and it had a bright light so we figured police copters looking for drugs. It was very low to the ground. It is normal to see cops looking for pot fields around here and if they think they have a moving meth lab the copter is out too. So we were watching cuz this is a small town. We all know each other if we aren&#39;t already related to them or married into the family. And it happened to be over top where a lot of my friends and family lived so I was really curious.So here we are cracking jokes about which friend/family member it could be and It darted sideways up! Totally from the left side at the bottom of the sky to the far right and high. After we were through freaking out at how it did that, then it dawned on us what happened and we started saying ufo! And we came in and got everyone in my house to go outside and look. (of course we told them we thought it was cops and how it darted there in the sky.) This thing hovered. It didn&#39;t move. I tried to take pictures of it but I have a pretty crappy cam when it comes to taking pictures of the sky. Even when we have a huge full moon that is bright I can&#39;t even get a dot on my cam. But I tried anyway. It wasn&#39;t like the thing was going anywhere. I got a blurry spot in the blackness of the sky with these pics BTW. We had been watching it for about 20 minutes when a passenger plane started it&#39;s nightly route to where ever. We watched this plane go straight towards it and we were like, &#34;It&#39;s going to move&#34; and it didn&#39;t. The plane kinda moved around it. It was like maybe 30 minutes after that we had military aircraft flying towards it. The funny thing was we were like &#34;should we call the air force? call the police? call someone?&#34; and we pretty basically agreed no that if the military was involved they would say it was one of theirs they were testing or a weather ballon or something like that. What could local police do? And we thought if we called the local tv station they would laugh at us. So we just sat there talking and watching. Well here comes the military and we were like &#34;YEAH! Now it is going to get interesting.&#34; And we watched 4 air craft fly up towards it and go completely around it like they were circling this object of prey. It was as if there was an invisible barrier stopping air craft from getting close because we used the trees as guides and we could tell before they got to a certain tree they would go around. We watched the military planes for a long time play cat and mouse and finally the object moved a tiny bit. And then it disappeared. Now what I really found odd was the planes still could not go into the area of the sky that the object occupied. After the military left we came in and warmed up and that is when my mom told me she had seen the same object before from her bedroom window one night and she watched it for hours because it scared her. She saw it in summer on the other side of town in a completely different year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well when we went out (we walk people to the door if not their car still here in the south) it was back, in the same place. My cousin says, &#34;They cloaked!&#34; He was convinced they cloaked themselves and hid. And we watched it for a minute or two but it was too cold to stay out there. So every little bit I would walk out my back door and look at it and it would still be there. I went to sleep at 12 that night and when I went to bed it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later, my cousin and his wife who were here that night and living in the same house my mom lived in when she saw the object that summer night, called me at like 6 am telling me they had been watching it stince about 2 am when they went out to smoke. And they reported they saw it two or three more times after that too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Plus as of 6-21-2006 they are still reporting seeing this object at my aunt&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will go in to my paint shop pro and try to make a pic of what it looked like-well the lights on it. I can&#39;t draw the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

12/1/05 05:30|Lexington|KY|Chevron|10 Min.|Lights over Lexington KY in a "V" shape formation.  Heading North.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48037.html|274|ndxe200512| Lights over Lexington KY in a &#34;V&#34; shape formation.  Heading North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5:30 AM I was coming home from work (I work at the Post Office late shift.)  Driving from West to East on New Circle road when I noticed a series of lights over the Fayette Mall area on Nicholasville road.  The thing that caught my eye was that the lights were stationary and not moving much.  At this point it looked like a single line of white lights.  I would estimate the pattern to be the size of a Concord jet (I have see one of those before flying kind of low in Europe at a special air show, so I know how big they look.)  I was driving toward the object when it did something that really caught my attention.  It made a right angle turn in the sky.  It did not make a slow turn like a plane but a rotating right angle turn. When it turned like that I could see that it was &#34;V&#34; shaped.  I have seen the TV show where all of these people saw a &#34;V&#34; shaped object and it looked just like that.  After that, it headed North at a very high rate of speed. It was gone extremely fast.  There were light clouds but I could see the object clearly. I was about a mile away.  I almost stopped my car and got out to watch it.  It was so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

12/1/05 05:00|Acworth|GA|Sphere|three minutes|egg-shaped light blue object, fast speed and sphere-like camoflauged object, moving slow.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48022.html|276|ndxe200512| egg-shaped light blue object, fast speed and sphere-like camoflauged object, moving slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 13yo son was with a friend in their backyard at 5pm. Temperture was cold, but sky was clear and the day still bright. My son noticed an object in the northwest sky traveling east at a very fast rate of speed. The object was egg-shaped and had two very bright yellow lights on both sides. It was &#39;highlighter&#39; blue (his description) with a grey trail of smoke (vapor?) trailing behind it. No noise was detected. 2-3 seconds after sighting the object, it suddenly disappeared, trail and all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 to 3 minutes after this sighting, they saw a sphere-like (hamburger shaped) object in the northern sky moving southwest. The object was just a slightly darker shade of blue than the sky, as if it were camoflauged. It had two white lights that were connected. The object moved at a slow rate of speed until it moved out of sight. No sound was detected with this sighting either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
