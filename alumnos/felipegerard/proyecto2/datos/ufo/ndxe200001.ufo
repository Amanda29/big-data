No noise. The brightness would intensify then subsided then intensify again. Then I would see bright particiles releasing and falling to earth in a straight line. As this ball of light slowly moved toward me. Another one appeared from the east again moving at a faster rate. The 2nd one I noticed approx 22:24. The 2nd one stopped. The light will would intensify and then subside like the first one and release light participles as well. Both move westernly. The first one disappeared and the 2nd one changed course and move easternly. Approx 22:28 a police car passed by my house as I was still observing the 2nd ball of light. It appeared that he was looking up in the sky in the same direction as I was but not sure if the officer saw it. Police car kept driving and turned into another street.<n>

Went on top deck after dinner.  Was on right side of ship heading north.  Heard buzzing noise like a boat motor/motorcycle.  Looked to right and saw a glowing green object keeping same pace as boat houvering over the water (maybe 10 feet above it).  After looking at the glowing object it turned to the right and took off at 90 degree angle.  Was not a boat, was not a plane.  Husband and I looked at each other, a little startled.  We looked at the people all over the deck, some looking forward, some looking left (approximately 4 couples total).  No one seemed to have noticed it.  We proceeded to the captains area and asked the crew that we saw if they saw anything on the right side of the ship.  They did not speak english well enough to hold a conversation with us and we walked away.  Kept to ourselves until someone else mentioned seeing a UFO and it sounded just like our experience so we are submitting this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

While leaning over the side, my dog started to bark furiously. I looked up and saw a huge triangular object hovering above with NO sound. I was hit by a beam of white light and fell backward onto the sole of the cabin. I grabbed my Ruger 10-22 rifle loaded with a 100 round banana magazine and stared firing as fast as I could until the clif was empty. I was able to shoot out the light. While grabbing for a second clip, I saw a hatch open up on the bottom side of the object and two people leaned down to yell &#34;STOP SHOOTING AS US YOU IDIOT&#34;. The only other noise I heard was a hissing sound like air escapeing from a flat tire or something. As the object move off to the south, I saw a helocopter come out off the top and move in next to my boat about 20&#39; off the water and 50&#39; way. Someone in the side door held up a camera and flash off a picture of me in the boat holding the rifle. The helocopter made no noise and had no markings on it. It was solid flat black as was the huge Triangle. The chopper then took off toward the Golden Gate bridge climbing up. The Triangle slowing gained altitude and was last seen heading south. I left the area for port and went out Wednesday to finish hauling in my traps. At first I thought it was an alien UFO and was genunly startled by it. However, I now believe it was an experimental military platform for transporting a small fleet of black helocopters that leave and enter out of the top of a huge silent floating triangle the size of a football field. A rigid airship if you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This may be the first report we have received that has the occupants of such a craft using a camera with a flash attachment..))<n>

The airplane was being discussed because the lights were in the wrong position and were slightly brighter than normal.  I then began to decrease my speed to get a better look at the object which was then observed was more circular in shape.  This cause me to then stop the car entirely on the road and to attempt to get out to see it better.  As we stopped the shape then began to have a glowing nimbus around it and promptly diappeared.  We all sat in shock none of us believed what we saw.  Upon arriving back at campus we asked the other cars who were ahead of us if they saw anything as well but they only remembered seeing a plane in the same spot we say the unidentified object disappear from sight.<n>

I saw a large white ball of light slowly descending southeast of my position. My first thought was that it was some sort of a meteorite, because it seemed to be streaking slowly down toward the horizon.  Then it seemed to travel in a southeast direction and the &#34;tail&#34; got smaller and smaller.   Some trees momentarily blocked my view, and when I could again see the patch of sky where it had been, it was gone. It wasn&#39;t a vapor trail from an airplane, and it was moving so slowly that I assumed it was something in the upper atmosphere.   My second thought was space junk burning up in the atmosphere, but I did see the space junk that burned up in the atmosphere a year or two ago, and it looked very different (space junk looked &#34;sparkly&#34;, versus just a solid patch of light like my sighting).   My next thought was that it was a meteorite, and I really expected to see it continue falling to the ground followed by a big explosion (actually picked up my cell phone to let my husband know my location should it touchdown). Two nights later there was a segment on Q13 news about some UFO sightings in China.  They showed some of the Chinese newscast images of their UFOs, which looked very much like what I saw, only their were moving horizontally, while mine appeared to be moving vertically.  Sent an email to the news to ask them if anyone else had reported a sighting after seeing their report, but got no response.<n>

About 5 miles from our exit I spotted what appeared to be an airplane flying over the hills near the Highway. I noticed that the object was not moving and was sitting staitionary above the hill. The Sun was not up above the surrounding mountains yet at this time and the sky was clear with no clouds. I looked very carefully for a tower that may have been supporting this object like a beacon. I did not see a tower and brought it to the attention of the person driving the car. When I first noticed the object it was giving off a bright white light. As I observed the object it very slowly faded color from white to a very bright red light before it disappeared behind the hill we were going by next to the road. The light reminded of an airport beacon which changes color as it rotates from white to green. the light changed at a much slower rotation, if indeed it was rotating at all. I have seen many beacons and it did not have the same look when it changed. it was as if the light faded out then came back on red increasing in intensity. I cannot speak for the person driving as to his background in observation. I am a trained weather watcher for NOAA and an amatuer Radio operator. I am an amatuer astronomer and very familiar with most types of aircraft. The object if it was above the hill was very small it appeared to be about 200 feet above the top. about the size of an F-16 or smaller. Since we were traveling about 60 MPH then if the object was not above the hill it was moving at a speed which made it appear to be sitting stationary in relationship to us. I looked very carefully at the object and did not see any rotors above the object which would have been associated with Rotary wing aircraft. It could have been a Harrier Jump jet, on training exercise holding position and signaling someone in the distance. but with the gust of winds we had that day, the pilot was doing an exceptional job of holding his craft stationary. when we passed the obstruction to ou! r veiw t he object was gone. If the object was a beacon on a tower and we could not see the original spot when we came around the hill, well the other towers on top of the other hills nearby were plainly visible that morning and I could not see any structure supporting this object and like I said all the other towers were plainly visible.<n>

The shape appeared to be diamond, but also appeared to change shape. Distance was a factor in our views of it, causing each of us to see differently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When first noticed the lights thought it was a star or a sattilite, but relized that the light was to bright to be either and it was constantly changing colors.  They appeared to move in a westerly direction and I believe I saw something shoot off to the left and to the right of the object.  I believe the colors to have been;  Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White, And the shape seemed to me to be a diamond.  Can&#39;t be certain of it though, seeing as my wife believes she seen a constantly changing shape. At the time of the occurance, My satillite reciever began to lose the signal, then turned off two or three times had some problems turning it back on. After the last time it turned off and got it to turn on again, happened to look out the window (faces south) and seen the lights.  I then proceded to call my sister and have her confirm what I was seening. University Student, Female, 28 Mover, Male, 26 Cashier, Female, 28 Retired night maitinance, Male, 35<n>

It seemed like it was going fast and was going farther from my site. I ran to get a binocular but it was gone. I got my mom and she came too, but it was not there. The object seemed to have several orangish lights. I know it could not be a plane or helicopter. After the object was gone, I looked in the sky also, and it seemed like there was some redish cloud, not to red but it seemed a different form of color and the object was moving that way. I am not bsing at all and please call me or anything if you need any more information. I can talk to you on the phone etc. Thank you very much.

I said it would be ok and then we looked up at the sky toward CASSIEOPIA when we saw a bright light that was about the same size and briteness as Venus is when it is in the night sky, just one hand to the right of Cassieopia and about two fingers lower. It made a little ziz zag side to side and appeared to have a tail/beam appx. a finger width shining down and comming to a point at the bottom. We all saw it for about 15 sec, then it just got real fuzzy looking and just blinked out.<n>

With outstretched arm the two shapes were lentil size. Both were suspended in the sky. At the same time we could also see fopur jets passing by these objects.  As one jet came within close range of the object furthest east that object appeared to lose control and began decending leaving a trail.  It then appeared to have recovered from this loss of control but it left a trail in the sky causing it to look like an up-side-down comma.  It then righted itself.  The jests has passed by then and one was returning from a southwesterly direction.  The two bright objects remained in the sky approximately 10 more minutes.  After leaving me at work, my huband spotted only one object in the sky and it dissappeared a few minutes later.  They were so bright they looked like small suns.  The jets were atoms in comparison to these objects.  If the jets had not left trails one would never have known they were there.<n>

I drove South, out of town, on 181st ave. until I reached Tilstrom Rd. (possibly spelled Tillstrom). Preparing top turn left on Tilstrom Rd. I watched a huge green appearing fireball/object disapear behind a fir covered hill, south of Damascus Oregon, where I live. I believe the hill had a large radio tower with red lights on it. Do not know the distance of the hill from Tilstrom Rd. or south of Damascus. The light green light emitted from the object was so bright,large, and close to the ground, it had to have hit the earth. The direction of travel, appeared to be straight down, from my vantage point. Damascus is located between Clackamas, and Boring, but everyone&#39;s mailing address is Boring. Also, my car has a clock embedded in the dash, directly below the windshield, which is how I know it was exactly midnight, when the sighting occured. This object was so bright, someone else, must have witnessed it.<n>

Reappears 10-15 seconds in another location.  3 jets scramble the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting in a hot tub only minutes after we entered. My wife saw a light and asked if it was a star in the east at about the tree line. It was almost the same size and distance to resemble a star. But as we looked, it slowly faded. I replied, well I don&#39;t think stars disappear. So we kept watching. Every 15-30 seconds it would appear in a different location but at the same level of horizon but many miles apart. This happened about 10-11 times. While this was happening there were 3 jets that would alternate flying west to east and circle back. As the jet got closer the light would reappear then fade. At one time as the jet appeared a smaller light left the light object as if a missle tracking a target. This light either circled the jet or just faded as it got closer to the jet. I commented to my wife that I was expecting an explosion as I felt it was just like the Patriot missle that would track and explode the Scud missle. As soon as this streamer light (which did leave a visible path trail) faded. 2 lights the same size reappeared and one was just above the other. They lit up for 3-5 seconds and then faded. All this time the jets circled or criss crossed. After 8:15 the objects did not reappear( at least in the East) but I did see jets circling in the north only minutes later. Also about an hour later the satelite dish which is Dish network was split screen for about 10 minutes. This may just be coincidental. I am very interested if anyone may have seen the same thing.

It seemed to be a circle with something above it that seemed to be either carrying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to watch the stars as I talked on the phone to my friend. It was about 7:40pm. Janurary 27th of 2000. It was a clear evening, there were many stars out, no moon. I looked up and to my right I saw the object slowly moving towards me. It was a fire orange type of circle. I noticed that it had something attatched to it at the top. That part was not lit up. I could barely make it out. I told my friend, who lives across the highway from me to go outside and look up and see it. She went out and right away noticed it also.  We both watched it together while talking on the phone. It moved slowly for a few minutes and then it stopped. It stood still for about 2 minutes. At that time I noticed that it seemed to spark off a little and I thought I might have seen a red tail. My friend thought she saw that too. But it was only for a second, and then I thoguht I saw it again, just for a second. Then it started to fade out and move slowly towards the east. It almost disappeared to where I could barely make it out, but I strained hard to watch it. It lit up a little more and I watched it move across the sky very slowly. It seemed to move from side to side and it seemed to be moving down a little to where the mountain was. Then I could not see it any longer. I then told my husband to go out and see if he could see anything and by then he could not, it was no longer in the sky or in eye site. I witnessed this object for about 10 minutes. I have seen this before on three other occassions. The first time I saw it was two years ago. Then on this new years eve, while I was outside watching the fireworks, I saw two of them. I was very afraid all of the times that I saw these. I am the type of person that is realistic, and down to earth but I know what I saw did not sit well with me. I was frightened. I don&#39;t think this was a man made thing at all. My instinct tells me that it was something very unusual. I really just would like to know what I saw. I don&#39;t know if it was a satelite or what.<n>

At approx 9:45pm, I felt the plane lose a little altitude in the cloud cover and assumed we were preparing to land in Sante Fe. I looked out the window (westerly) and saw yellow lights passing parallel to the wing tip. I believed them to be runway lights and felt they were a bit too close for comfort. Thinking we had passed all the lights, I looked back towards the rear of the wing and noted that the lights  were now traveling with us in a line parallel to the back of the wing. After one or two seconds the lights simply vanished. Shortly afterward, we broke through the clouds and were not, as I had imagined, near Sante Fe. It was another 25 or 30 minutes before we made it into Sante Fe. After landing, I asked our first officer if anything unusual had occured during our flight. The officer asked me to be more specific and I recounted what I had seen. I find the officers response to my questions as interesting as what I had seen during the flight. I was told that &#34;our aircraft&#34; or &#34;aircraft of this type&#34; do not use yellow lights of any sort, they use a red light on one wing, green on the other and white on the tail. I was then informed that there had been no radar contact with any other PLANE that close to us during our flight and stress was placed on the statement by saying that if any PLANE had been that close to us, it would certainly have been picked up by radar alerting the cabin crew to such a presence. Even more interesting, while showing an egar attentiveness and curosity to the details of my account, the officers remarks were professionally reserved. Additionally, this individual asked me a number of questions about what I had seen and yet never gave more than vague and obscure responses to my questions. Because of this officers manner, one could speculate about a few things: When saying &#34;our Aircraft&#34; or &#34;aircraft of this type&#34; don&#39;t use yellow lights, was this person hinting that perhaps a military or some other sort of craft might use yellow lights? If so, what sort of craft might that be? By stressing no radar contact with any PLANE that close during the flight, was the officer illuding to the possibility of radar detecting something else? Was I being subtly asked to read between the lines? During our conversation, the officer seemed to carefully avoid anything that might have led to answering questions about what the cabin crew actually saw with their own eyes. I have learned that airlines frequently assign less seasoned pilots to fly the small commuter planes, allowing them to rack up the flight hours required to pilot the larger, jet passenger planes. No doubt the admission of an unusual sighting during flight might well be considered a professional liability for a young pilot just starting out with a major airline, therefore, I am electing not to name the airline or make any further public comment about my interaction with the officer for the time being.<n>

While driving south on interstate 680 in Omaha, I saw a dark black object, barely distinguishable from the nighttime sky, moving across the sky from east to west.  The object had no lights or any visible source of illumination.  It seemed solid in nature, but being only a shade lighter then the surrounding nighttime sky, it was very difficult to see any detail.  No sound was heard.  I could not tell the size of the object or its distance from my vehicle.  Using the perspective of a coin held at arm&#39;s length, it was about the size of a penny. This may not be relevant to the above sighting, but my wife saw 2 fighters coming from the approximate direction of the sighting moving toward Offutt AFB 6 minutes after the sighting.  She made a notation of the time because I had called her during the sighting only a short time before.<n>

The set of lights moved to the right dropping almost entirely behind the tree line and then left again, almost entirely behind the tree line and then entirely when it disappeared from view.  As The two witnesses called to another family member in the house to come out and he witnessed the event also.  As they turned from facing the east, to come into the house, they saw a fireball coming from the west, travel across the sky, parallel to the horizon, well above the tree line.  It disappeared as it was traveling to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness and his girlfriend were coming to his parent&#39;s house and were walking in the garden in front of the house.  He notice, as they were skywatching, an object that he thought was a tower, with lights on it, but decided that it was not, since they never saw a tower in that area.  He called to his dad, who was in the house, to come and see it.  The three of them attest to the same sighting.  It was approximately 50 degrees above the horizon in the east moving counter clockwise and then traveled to the south a bit, dropping below the tree line with only the top of the two lights showing, six in total, as on a domino, but in a boomerang shape and in a vertical position.  It then moved to the north a bit when it disappeared behind the trees.  As they turned to walk into the house they notice a fireball coming from the west crossing the horizon parallel and approx. 30 degrees above the ground and traveling approx. 200 mph.  The entire event took approximately five minutes with the first part lasting only a few minutes.  All of the dogs for miles around were howling all night long.<n>

Green glowing flash of light with whitish light on topside and then smoke trail as it descended lost some brillance and then completely out in an instant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was just myself in the car.  Told members at meeting what I&#39;d seen. Late in evening made a phone report and return call from Mr. Davenport.  Now have computer online to report this same event as via phone. See the description in above summary.  One note is that it was due south  25-30 degrees from center going to right as looking at a clock it would represent approx. 1 to 2 o&#39;clock, and descending to about 5 oclock before going instantly out.  This was a very large light. 1/4 to 1/2of my extended hand would represent the size of light. the green color was almost a phosphorous green color topped with diffused whitish light then serpentine smoke trail illuminated from light. At first thought of plane in pattern crashin, but size and equal distance put it more heavenly and southward then in sky above SeaTac airport area. Big light.<n>

It was coming from the South West, a compass reading of 225 degrees and was headed North East, a compass reading of 45 degrees. I was observing this unusually bright pure red light, waiting for it to turn or pass over me to see if it was an aircraft with the typical complement of flying lights. I watched this object for two minutes, then my daughter called to me and I looked down to her for two seconds. When I then looked back up at the red light, it was no longer there, instead there was a bright white cloud, it was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length. I ask my eight year old daughter to look up at this bright white cloud and I pointed where this bright white cloud was. After two minutes the white cloud had dissipated.  There was no sound of an explosion.  I live in Westminaster, California where I observed this red light.  To me this red light looked like it was coming from Long Beach, California and when it disappeared it was over Huntington Beach, California.  After the white cloud dissipated my daughter went in the house and I continued watching for another ten minutes, but the red light was no longer visible.  I live seven miles away from MacArthur airport and see airport traffic almost every day for the last fourteen years.  I was enlisted in the United State Air Force for five years, stationed on five different bases including one base over seas, been to several air shows and familiar with all types of aircraft.<n>

The disk kept pace with her van as she drove . She descibed the object as a glowing disc with the classic little dome on the top it.  She felt the object was as big as her fist at arm&#39;s length.  Based on her judgement, the size of the object was over 100 feet in diameter.  After traveling for ten minutes in a southerly direction, the witness turned west and lost sight of the disk. The witness has found no other person who has reported the sighting.<n>

As it came in just above me, the object made a Northern turn then it started to dim its lights.  This accured with the first 3 objects.  But the 4th object came in from the Northwest heading towards the Southeast.  This object also started to dim its lights. This is not the first time I had seen an object do this.  As a matter a fact it was totaly the opposit.  In 1990 at approx. 5:05 a.m., (at that time we had a full moon presint)  a strange object came about from the South.  The object would be about the hight of a tower with red lights blinking so that the plains would not fly so low.  Before the object took off,  it turned on its lights before it shot itself into space.  Apporox.  10-15 min. later, another object did the same thing. It was like as if they were checking us out doing undercover work.

Omar said that this was not the first time to see those flying objects.  He continues that 8 years back he was sleeping on his bed in one summer night and saw a huge light ball outside his balcony with a trail of non-contineous lights. It lasted for few seconds, turned the place into bright daylight then vanished...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ..I asked him wither someone else saw what he saw last week and he instantly said that his mom and driver also was there and saw that.  They were all in the car on the &#34;Mouneib Bridge&#34; going from Cairo to Giza and saw those bright objects above the Giza Pyramids, so they stopped the car and went down to watch better, and kept watching till they dissapeared.  At that point I myself discovered that I also saw those same lights later during the same night and in the same pattern Omar has discribed!!...<n> <n><n> <n><n> [the writer goes into details about perseption theories and how other countries are studying UFOs phenomena since the 40s]  [the writer switches to his story] &#34;I too saw the same phenomena later during the same night, 01/25/2000, i was coming back on the Alitalia flight from Algeria via Italy to Cairo airport. we were still far above Cairo with its glittering lights.  I suddenly saw this bright light very visible among the relivantly dimmer city lights. Then it dissapeared. It was similar to a big light bulb. I first thought it was coming from the plane&#39;s strobing lights but when it happened again i could tell that it was un-naturaly bright. And was moving with the plane and not stationary as i first thought.  It was visibile that it is a rectangular shape flying just above the ground illuminating the ground as it hovered above land with its very special bright pure white (not yellowish as the rest of Cairo&#39;s other artificial lights). It happened 4 or 5 times between 11:30 and 11:45 then we landed in Cairo Airport and i forgot all about it till I heared Omar&#39;s story.&#34;  [the writer also discribes another incident] where another male was ubducted into a UFO while he was sleeping in an empty lot in southern Egypt. when he saw a landing UFO and creatures came out and took him inside on an operation table where he was exposed to some rays, later after this insident he started having strange powers like eating and swallowing broken glass and inserting a nail in parts of his body and taking it out from the other side without any trace of blood.  And he demonstrated those powers in my office infront of my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Omar also started feeling those strange powers, for example sometimes if he just rests his hand on one of his friends that person could fall down to the ground with extreme pain!  Lately he started noticing that when he holds a cola glass bottle in his hand, the liquid will turn into frozen ice in the middle of the bottle, while stays as liquid above and bellow the area where Omar was holding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Omar also continues that when he saw the fire ball years back, his brother was sleeping in the next bed and didn&#39;t see the ball, but when the fire ball crossed infront of the bedroom window the sleeping brother punched the air upwards with his fist while still sleeping. And in after the light dissapeared in few seconds his arm went back to his side whithout waking up. Omar remembers that during this incident there was a ringing or beeping sound coming from the tin trash bin in the same bedroom.  The sound was similar to the effect resulting of hitting the tin with another metal piece.&#34;<n>

It&#39;s shape was of a saucer and it hoovered slowly over the city as if it were looking for something or just plainly sightseeing. We were in our car and started following it at one point we came so close to it (about a 3 block distance) that there is no doubt in our minds that this was a UFO.   It then started to fly a little faster and started going eastward towards San Bernardino, it became hard for us to continue following it, and unfortunenately we didn&#39;t have a camera with us to prove to anyone that we did see this. It was an ahhhing experience and has erased any doubts in our minds that they do exist.<n>

1/23/00 15:00|Rio Rancho|NM|Sphere|3 hrs|Black object hanging in the sky possible cause of geese flock disappearance|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24175.html|37|ndxe200001| Black object hanging in the sky possible cause of geese flock disappearance<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a dark or black sphere shaped object that was hanging about 200 ft above the Rio Grande river near Albuquerque. I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of where I was working at the time, eating a snack and waiting to clock in to work, when I noticed a flock of geese circling above the river just behind the building where I worked. They were in their usual &#34;V&#34; shaped formation but instead of flying off into the distance, they appeared to be confused as to what direction to go. They seemed to be concerned because they were not making their usual honking while traveling sounds, instead the sounds where different, more high pitched and stressfull. I watched them circle and listened to their cries for 4-5 minutes, then as I was reaching over to the passenger seat for the other half of my sandwich, the sounds stopped. I took a bite, a sip of my drink and intended to resumed my observation, but the geese were gone, dissapeared within the 10-15 seconds that I looked away. I got out of my car immediatly and looked all around the sky to see where they may have decided to fly off to, but they had dissapeared altogether. The last time I saw them they were circling above the parking lot, not enough time for them to fly out of sight or to land at the Rio Grande river a quarter mile away. This was very strange, and I was in disbelief that they could have vanished. As I was still searching for the lost geese I noticed a dark, round object hanging above the river south of my position and about a mile away. I guessed it to be 10-15 feet in diameter and about 200 ft above the Rio Grande River. At first I thought it to be a large balloon tied to a string because it seemed to move a bit from side to side and up and down, but then I realized that if it were tied down and the wind was pushing against it, the movement would be in the shape of an arc, this was not. It seemed to be trying to maintain a particular position drifting +/- 15 to 20 ft on a horizontal or verticle plane. Two hours later and just before su! nset whi le on my first work break, I went back outside and it was still there. I pointed it out to someone else who confirmed it, but expressed no curiosity about what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion: I am thinking that this hanging object may have caused a kind of navigation problem for the geese, causing their stress and confusion. But because of their dissappearance, it may have opened or closed a gateway in time or place. The geese may have been traveling in one place or time, and then suddenly emerged from or vanished into another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Sighting: I had nearly forgot about that sighting until I saw it again, this time in Oak Ridge nearly three years later. It was the first week in June 2002 about an hour before sunset. This time it was a little further away, maby a mile and a half and floating about the same hight above the ground as before, which I guess to be about 200 ft. It had the same characteristics as before of drifting on a horizontal and verticle plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope. I watched it for 30 mins or so in its stationary position, but as the sun began to set I noticed the object getting smaller and smaller, and believed that it was now moving further away from me in a northern direction. Finally it was so small I could no longer see it in the dim light of dusk.<n>

The object seemed to be tilted upward slightly with the  right side up; this gave the illusion of the lower 2 lights to be slightly closed closer together at first: . . . the object then moved very slowly with no sound towards us and over our head of which then the lights were more of the original shape: . .    . Apox. 10 minuytes later each light went out slowly until nothing else could be seen. the cloud deck was at aprox 3000ft.We belive that the object was above the clouds which would explain why the clouds could be seen through the lights seemed defused slightly. None of the observers have ever seen a UFO and are sceptical to what really was seen but all agree they have neverseen anything like this before! Called the local USAF base McCellan and only the coast guard is on the base ,they had nothing flying last night. Called the Sac.

Totally opposite from where the moon is. I saw 2 lights on the object. No flashing lights.  My daughter said she saw a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday night I took my daughter out to dinner. We were driving east on Deerfield Road going into Highland Park,IL.  As I recall it was about 6:30 pm(18:30.  At first I saw 2 very bright lights by the moon.  I could tell that they were airplanes.  I saw the flashing lights. Then about a minute later I saw a bright light come from behind the moon. This object was moving very fast and heading to the south at a very high speed.  I told my daughter to keep her eye on it.  I told herthat it&#39;s going to fast to be a jet. I saw 2 white lights and my daughter said she saw a red light. I did not see any flashing lights, like you see on a airplane or a jet.  From the location of the moon being in front of me. This object was heading in a southerly direction.  From where the moon was in about 30 seconds the craft was across the sky no where near the moon.<n>

Just before returning into the house I looked straight up overhead and saw what looked like a red &#34;smear&#34; of light, moving South.  I pointed it out to my wife who stood and watched it with me.  At first we thought it might be a shooting star, or after we noticed that the light remained constant, we thought it was a piece of &#34;space junk&#34;, but we thought it was too large for that.  Also, it appeared to us that it was &#34;wavering&#34; a bit on it&#39;s path, not going in exactly a straight line.  As it approached the Southern horizon, it made a sharp right turn, heading West, for approximately 10 seconds, then stopped and sort of &#34;looped&#34; back to the East disappearing.  I mentioned this event the next morning on my local radio show, and received a phone call from someone claiming to be an Air Traffic Controller at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, who said they had picked it up on their radar, could not explain it, and had turned the tapes over to &#34;the authorities&#34;  When I asked him who he meant by &#34;authorities&#34; he said the FAA.<n>

They traveled from northwest to southeast over the Belcamp area. I am a construction Project Manager 32 years old.<n>

Well camoflaged, it appeared as if a piece of the sky had moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 10.50pm while observing the Lunar Eclipse, I spotted something in the sky below the level of the moon and a few degrees to the north. The object at first looked as if a section of the sky had peeled away from the background, and moved from north to south almost like a chesspiece on a board. I immediately shouted out to my companions and said &#34; look! what the hell is that?&#34; What I saw was a &#39;triangular (equilateral) shaped black object moving rapidly from north to south. One of the points of the triangle being the leading edge. The two outside edges (behind the leading point) had several dim lights down the two sides. These lights were a little ways in from the edge. The object moved in a straight line (without deviation) and without sound. It was visible for only a few seconds (four or five) and then we lost it in the glare of the lights from the hotel.. One of my friends missed it all together as he was looking in the direction of Orion trying to see shooting stars, but my other friend and myself observed it. Without prompting, I asked him to describe to me what he had just seen. He describe it &#39;exactly&#39; the way I had seen it. We were located just south of Puntarenas Costa Rica. Date Jan 20/2000, Time 10.50pm local time. We did not talk about it much while we were on holiday, as it took a few days to sink in, but had a serious discussion when we got back. The other day at work I asked him to draw the object in question and I would do the same. The drawings were identical. I cannot explain what we saw that night, it was most unusual to say the least. I asked one of the local guys at the hotel in Costa Rica (Caribbean Village Fiesta Hotel) to check the local papers and the internet. He did not find anything. At the time of the sighting the weather was clear and visibility was good. My friends and I were on a pier, away from the lights of the hotel, so we had a pretty good view of the night sky. We observed the craft by looking east over the beach. It was only after the craft had move towards the south, that the lights of the hotel came into play.<n>

At 10:30 pm on the south west sky I saw a shooting star so I turn my head and saw the light of the shooting star disapearing and appearing an object with wings.  They were two wings and something in the middle of them but it was not an airplaine it look more like a handglider but did not have any lights at all.  It was a clear night so I so it perfectly. The object was brounish grenish on the bottom of the wings.  So when the object stoped in middle air like loosing control all of the sudden took off vertically and then it went sideways(zigzag) very fast and then it took off south very fast and disapear in the orizon.  I have no idea what it was but I am sure others saw it because was the night of the loonar eclipse and many people were looking up.  Can you check and see if anybody else saw what I saw?  It is like a scene from a comic strip.<n>

The object was almost invisible, but seemed to be reflecting ambient light either from ground lights or from the eclipsed moon, as the color was almost that of the eclipsed moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:22 CST, my brother-in-law and I were outside in his backyard. We had been observing the lunar eclipse through his telescope, but having become bored with that, we turned the scope on M42 in the constellation of Orion. I had already located M42, my brother-in-law was in the process of changing the lens to a higher power while I was observing the constellation and waiting. I noticed movement above me. Looking directly overhead, I saw what I first took to be an atmospheric disturbance, like a vortex of air. The night was exceedingly clear and full of stars, without much ambient ground light, and there was no wind. However, the leading edge (as this was the direction it was moving) of the object or vortex was faintly illuminated by a light of nearly the same color as the eclipsed moon (reddish-brown). It was almost invisible, and for a moment, I doubted what I saw, thinking perhaps it was a floater in my eye. I asked my brother-in-law to look, and he immediately spotted the object and exclaimed &#34;what is that?&#34; The object, as I said, was an arc shape, about 90 degrees of a full circle, with a relative size of a baseball held at arm&#39;s length. Within the arc, there was no apparent blocking of the starfield, such as there would have been had the object been spherical or disk-shaped and reflecting light on its leading edge or underside. It moved very quickly from overhead to between Sirius and the constellation of Orion, toward the southern horizon, when it seemed to pass beyond our range of vision. There was no sound, and no wind. I would guess that it was visible no more than six seconds. In addition, the arc shape did not remain constant, as it would if it were the leading edge or underside of a spherical or disk-shaped object. It seemed to flow, not-unlike the way a line of geese or ducks flow and waver as they fly. My brother-in-law, who has better eyesight than I do, even said that he thought it was numerous objects flying in an arc-shaped formation, but that they flowed and shifted, not unlik! e geese. However, I have considerable experience &#39;in the wild&#39; and have seen flights of migratory birds both during the day and at night. First of all, to have formed this impression of an arc, there would have to have been numerous birds flying at a great height, much to high to have been seen from the ground at night. If the same formation had been seen during the day, and if they were ducks or geese, then they would have had to have been moving at super-sonic speed. To move across the sky in that amount of time, the birds would have had to have been much closer to the ground, in which case they would have been easily discernable as being birds of some sort, and at that height, given the size of the arc, could not have been more than five or six birds, in which case they could hardly have been mistaken for an arc shape. Also, they made no sound, whereas ducks and geese will honk and quack as they fly, and even when not, you can hear their wings - but there was no sound. Instead, my best description of the object is of a non-solid sherical object, clear, with light either reflecting along its forward edge or underside. As to size and speed, I can only hazard a guess or impression, as there was nothing to judge by; it could have been very large and high and moving very fast, or small and low and moving slowly. But my impression was that of an object about the size of a house, flying at two-to-four thousand feet, at about the speed of a cruise missile.<n>

My daughter described seeing two bright lights side by side but I had the better view with my binoculars (7 x 35) and saw two triangular sets of lights side by side. The lights were amber and blue and making this even more odd was that there was no sound coming from the object. The object appeared to glide through the sky in a southeasterly path above the Clear-Lake area and then make a left-sideway motion towards the Johnson Space Center. Coincedentally, shortly after our experience I noticed two military jets (coming from the general direction of where I last saw the object) preparing to land at Ellington Air Field.<n>

I went out for a cigarette.  I always look at the stars when I am outside.  As I was looking, I saw a very dark objectmoving from East to west.  If I did not have better than 20/20 vision, I would have missed it, as it almost blended in with the black sky.  I estimate it to be moving at around 200mph and at an altitude of about 2000 feet.  It made no sound, and being a star and airplane buff, it was not an airplane.  It had no marker lights, strobes or any lights at all.  It was very quiet, dark.  The shape was like a boomerang as it passed overhead.  As it continued away from me, I could just make out a shape from behind.  The first thing I thought of when I saw the shape, was squashed pearls. If you picture a string of 4 black pearls on a table in a straight line, then you bend the string in the middle so that 2 pearls are on one side of the wing, and 2 pearls down the other side. Then you squish the pearls down until they are oval shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, it looked similar to the stealth bomber, but didn&#39;t have jagged wings.  It looked like a black boomerang with 4 bumps on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after seeing this, I ran upstairs told my wife, and called the media and asked if there were any other reportings.  They told me there weren&#39;t any reportings, but took my name and number down and said they will contact me if anyone else reports anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why so long do I finally report this?  I always wanted to tell someone who is interested, but didn&#39;t think to look on the net until tonight after going out again and seeing the same kind of night reminding me of that night.  I can only say this.  Don&#39;t always look for lights in the sky.  I guess some of them want to remain unseen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They had set up many lg. and sm. telescopes to see the event.  All of them were trained either on Saturn, Jupiter or the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was chilly and very breezy and they had set up an area apart from the &#39;scopes with tables and chairs and partial cover to sit out of the wind.  My friend and I had been sitting there for a few min., I was facing east, she west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 9:30 p.m., I was looking at the east sky and noticed a red light thru the branches of a palm tree on the edge of the property.  At first I thought it was a tower light.  Then I noticed it was moving and thought perhaps it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it cleared the top of the tree I noticed it had a tail behind it and at that point remarked to my friend, &#34;Look at that&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She turned and exclaimed, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;  This was echoed by the other three people sitting near us, a mother and her two teenage sons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The five of us watched this red ball of light for approx. a minute.  It seemed to be heading southwest.  After that the tail disappeared and it turned dullish white and seemed to change its direction to a much more West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly it was gone, but only for a few seconds.  It came back in the same spot it had been and continued on for a few more seconds then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After talking about it for a couple of minutes between us, I walked over to the group by the &#39;scopes and asked random people if any of them had seen it.  No one had.  They had all been looking at the moon or planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find this really ironic because had someone with one of the smaller &#39;scopes seen they could have gotten a real good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the local television crews were there covering the eclipse.

It was reddish/orange in color then dull white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It never glowed like a distress flare and definitly wasn&#39;t one.  Also it traveled over land not water.  It also was not a meteorite.  I have watched the last 3 showers and others before that it didn&#39;t even vaguely resemble one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event only lasted a couple of minutes, 1 of the min.

They were under light clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 18.00 (6pm pacific standard time),I went out into my back yard to check out the weather and the upcoming lunar eclipse.  I went to the back of my yard which is west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed in the southwest sky over Wilmington,Harbor City, Lomita, San Pedro, Torrance, CALIFORNIA (which is the southern portion of Los Angeles, California), 3 lights going around in circles, coming together, and then splitting apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on till 18:30 (6:30 pacific standard time) when they met and then ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the later part of the half hour they moved to the center portion of the southern sky in widening colescing circles.  Then before they stopped they moved back to the southwest, for the last five minutes or so. They moved at extreme speeds in the sky.  As quick as you could wave your hands in the sky. Their relative size was a little smaller than the full moon. The three lights seemed to difuse a bit as they reached the outside of their circle before coming together in the middle when they crossed paths again and again. After a half hour of my viewing this they came together and ceased. They seemed like 3 transparent lights,shaped somewhat like manta rays. There was a light cloud cover while this was happening and the objects stayed under this even though the western sky toward the beach was clear with no clouds.  I would be interested if other people reported this sighting and would like to be informed if this occurs. If you phone me,leave a message and I will then call you back collect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD))<n>

My wife and son and I were traveling west on Powell Rd. in north Columbus when I noticed the &#34;object&#34; at about 40 degrees elevation in the northwest sky falling south at a very rapid rate (faster than other &#34;shooting stars&#34; i&#39;ve seen) to about 30 degrees elevation in the southern sky.  The size of the object was x3 the size of Jupiter and was twinkling the color of the green light in a stoplight. It was probably just a meteor but it was a very cool meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> see above.<n>

I was waiting for a download, so turned in my swivel chair to take a glance out the window and saw what looked like an oversized star, shooting across the southern horizon (from east to west).  I ran to the sliding door and ran out just to see it disappear behind a pine tree.  I would assume it was a meteorite of a fairly good size.  What amazes me is the several times I got up during the night to witness the large meteor event which was suppose to have happened last month, I saw nothing, with clear skies.  Or was it in November?<n>

When I focused I noticed an object of the same aproximate mass just NW of the plane. At first glance it appeared to be a balloon but the fact that the small plane had begun to turn back in its direction caused me to take a good look. the plane did not fully turn back and the object got my complete attention. I lost my theory of a balloon when i noticed its steady and deliberate nw trajectory. It did however move very slowly without any sound. It was overcast in SLC today but as it came closer I did notice a slight shadow on the west facing underside. thats when i realized it definitely was something unusual. I watched for aprox 8 minutes, hoping to peek the interest of motorists on 3600 west street. not knowing what to do I continued back to work glancing back several times, the last time I looked back (aprox 10 min into event) the object was gone. I work at a very consertive place and aginst my better judgement I reluctantly told two of the more open minded people what I had seen. Im sure they think Im nuts but I had to share this event! If i was to form an opinion as to the objects purpose/origin it was what I would think an unmanned observation craft might look like, I say this based on the size, shape and demeanor of the craft. Lastly I would sure like to speak to the pilot of that small plane &amp; I hope because of the proximity to SLC Int airport there is a radar record of this event.<n>

I proceeded to film the object while my husband was watching it, he later told me that the object (while hovering in one spot) had small individual lights rotating around it. I couldn&#39;t see them while filming, because it was a great distance away. The object appeared to bounce across the sky from right to left. The object decreased in size as it slowly faded from view. As soon as it was gone we saw a silver streak zip across the sky to the west. I have an excellent video of the incounter, when put into slow motion the object appeared to have alot of different colors flashing on and off and up in the left hand corner another object appeared that looked to be a beam of light shooting from the first object.<n>

Tonight there was a full moon, and a beautiful night in south florida.  While walking along - I looked up at the moon which was bright and full, and there was another lit object moving along next to it - it first moved towards the moon, and then away from it, heading away from me and to the north.  after a while it faded out of site.  I always have a digicam with me (I run a webcam site and always keep a small cam in a hip-pouch thingy in case I see cool stuff to post on the site) so I fired off a few pics of it before it drifted off.  Im SURE that anybody in the whole city that was awake and looking would have seen it, it was HUGE.  I never heard any noises, as it was very far away, like miles away.  I have the images on my website that i snapped if you want to see them, they are at - http://((URL deleted)).html    The bright object to the left is the full moon, the smaller object in the right of the photo&#39;s is the UFO.  please feel free to contact me for more info.<n>

It eventually turned east and disappeared, perhaps because my view was blocked by trees.  The sky was clear and other objects we saw in the sky both before and after did not pulsate.  I did see another airplane with flashing lights but it was not pulsating like the other object.  It may have been nothing but I thought I would report it in case anyone else saw it.  I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t give a more detailed description but that is all I saw.<n>

From within this light, a blue streak extended from the light source to beyond the boundary of the white light.  This light hovered silently for approximately 1 minute.  The light then appeared to &#34;cave in&#34; upon itself until it disappeared, leaving a lingering, glowing blue streak in the sky, that appeared to drift with the wind.<n>

So we ran to see.  we saw a bright white light about the size of a quarter or a little bigger..at arms length.. it was projecting a big V shape of light behind it like this &gt;o   it floated silently toward the neighborhood for about 30 sec before it disappeared behind a cloud.. we all expected to see it again as the cloud was quite small, but it was gone.. no Light no sound.. nothing just gone.  Then we noticed a Blue glow where the big (&gt;) of light had been it was a florecnty dark blue color and it gradually faded over a 5 min period. A neihgboor joined us just after the light disappeared, he only saw the blue glow I heard  2nd hand news stories today about a missle and a sattalite... it was those stores more than anything else that compelled me to file this report.. because what we saw was not That<n>

The white field was in a cone shape and from the the &#34;inner-tip&#34; projected a long blue beam of light that was unlike anything I could easily describe.  The long beam got longer and the white cone light faded by time I got a good look.  What struck me that this was a &#34;U.F.O.&#34; was because after whatever was producing the cone had faded into the night sky the blue beam remained for another 20 minutes or so.  To make sure I was seeing what I was seeing I asked my girlfriend and my next door neighbor to come witness the long blue glow as it just sat there in the sky slowly fading.  They both saw the phenomenon and were both baffled as to what it could be.  I hope I&#39;m not the only person in the area to see and report this because this event happened right over our downtown area and was also very close to a major freeway of Silicon Valley.  After witnessing the event we also noticed high aircraft (planes) out of normal traffic patterns flying very close to the glowing area and when I immediately came in to report this we experienced a &#34;boot-up&#34; problem never before experienced on our brand new computer.  Please E-mail me about any other sightings in this area.  Thank you.<n>

The other vehicle going to the same meeting contained four women of various ages and we didn&#39;t discuss much about it, only to observe it was something much different than we&#39;d ever seen before.

The light cut through the fog not unlike a laser light will cut through smoke and catch the eddies. The object made no sound neither when it was coming toward my house nor when it blew up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:15 PM (1815hrs.) it was dark and clear outside and clearly visable were the moon, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. There was a cloud bank low on the eastern horizon. There were a few intermittant clouds to the northwest of our position as I had been outside doing work since about 6PM (1800hrs.) A strong sideways facing light came toward our house from about the ssw about 500 to 800&#39; off the ground. The ovalish object resembled a helicopter with a bright spot light but the light had a green hue &amp; did not move around. Surrounding the object was a sort of fog or smoke because the light caught the smoke as a laser light catches smoke. The object itself was difficult to see because of the haze surrounding it. The objects light got very bright then dimmed and then the object imploded. It blew up sort of like a sky rocket does and a small ringed cloud appeared where the object was. The light turned bright green and became plasma like but remained stretched straight out and angled at about 45 degrees down toward the ground. The straight green light remained for a good 10 minutes after the object was gone. The cloud which had surrounded the object shrunk in with the light and exploded outwards into a huge cloud. The green light hung in the sky for upwards of 40 minutes after the implosion. The way the light looked was a lot like the norhtern lights but without the pulsating movements. It was straight to begin with, then slowly drifted together and remained noticable for a long time. No sound was heard when the object blew up. No sound was heard when the object was approching my house. I called 911 and they were real excited about it and had the Fallon Naval Air Station on the phone and would know in about an hour. When I called back the military told the police that it was just a titan missle from Vandenberg AFB and it was nothing to worry about. When I mentioned the lack of debris and the fact that an glowing green cloud hung my place for a half an hour or so they said that they were told that there is nothing t! o worry about. The object blew over my house an nothing fell out of the sky. I have never seen anything with no sound blow up and still have no sound. Also, if it is a titan missle shouldn&#39;t there be stuff that fell off of it around here? The three observers were myself, my daughter and her friend. I am a substitute school teacher and part-time librarian and my daughter (16) and her friend (17) are in high school in Virginia City, Nevada. We had all just come home from work, rested a bit, then started in on our chores for the evening.<n>

He pointed it to me and I saw a very brite light,it seemed to be focused  bright light that showed the outline of the light beam.   at first it appeared to be a focused spotlight from a police helicopter, pointed towards the ground.   I also noticed a blue smoke pattern about 500 feet away from the light and looking like it was tapered and also pointed toward the ground in a 30 deg angel. While we were driving, we slowed, and a few vehicles around us slowed, all looking at this light. The light focused on the tail, expanded it&#39;s beam, and lighting up the source with a very bright white light, totally involving into a ball, and disappeared.   A large ball of white smoke expanded around this source and disappeared.   After about 30 seconds, the white smoke disappeared, but the blue trail was still illumines for at least 5 minutes..<n>

I pulled off at road side park on highway 70, just north of Blackwell Tx. I turned off the truck and got out, It was very dark and the stars were bright.I noticed that I was looking at the cluster or the milkey way, because there was a ban of stars, and I could see very small stars that are usually difficult to see. Then I noticed a object or a light, about the same intensity of a star moving very quickly south to north, this light was not as fast as a falling/shooting star, but faster than a aircraft. the light was moving in a straight, uniformed direction, and did not turn or slow down. (Steady Speed). Then I lost sight of it as it went behind trees.<n>

I was scared but I had to get a better look at it so I got out of the car &amp; I looked up at it &amp; then I got a flash of symbols &amp; crazy pictures in my head. Then the next thing I knew it started to take off, slowly at first then it took off fast. I was so scared after it took off that I got in my car &amp; drove it at a speed of 120 mph to make it too the truck stop. When I got there I noticed it took me 20 minutes longer than it usually does to reach the truck stop. My watched stopped when I reach the truck stop &amp; looked at, it still doesn&#39;t work even with a new battery. All I know is this took a lot for me to write let alone remember cause I hate remembering it, &amp; I NEVER want to see that thing again.<n>

Can you hear it?!&#34;  To which he replied that he couldn’t hear anything from it either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I ditched my bike and we both began running toward the object which had by then stopped flashing the green light and began flashing a gold light 10 to 15 feet forward from where the green one had been.  The gold light was as large and as bright as the green one had been, and it was definitely more captivating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as the two of us had reached a full-speed run, the object abruptly changed direction and began flying directly towards us.  There was no curving turn like an airplane would have to make, no sweeping change like a glider, the object just stopped going away from us and began heading immediately toward us.  I think even a helicopter wouldn’t have been able to change direction of flight as quick and immediate as the object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we were scared!   We turned and ran back to our friend’s house.  We pounded on the door for him to let us in, and he opened the door just as the object flew directly over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, there were no longer any lights flashing, but we could hear a faint humming noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object flew over, all we could see was its black silhouette against the night sky.  We both agreed that it was triangular in shape and small like an ultra-light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do not believe it was an ultra-light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We honestly don’t know what it was, but it was the very first time any of us had seen what we believed to be a UFO.<n>

IT DIDN&#39;T LEAVE ANYKIND OF TRAIL. IT DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY KIND OF WINGS OR STABLISER THAT I COULD SEE. IF THE MOON WAS FULL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER ACROSS THAN THE MOON IS WIDE.

It was bitterly cold (approx. 15 degrees Far) And very windy. At appox.6: 02 PM I went out back into her small yard to have a cigarette (she doesn&#39;t like the smoking inside). About a minute or two passed when I thought I saw movement in the sky (It was mostly dark with indirect distant light from further down the street, the sky was devoid of any clouds, only stars were visible) I looked up quickly I moved further into the yard to see what it was when I saw these three rectangular objects moving in tandem. They were not like anything I ever saw in my entire lifetime. They were moving at a quicker pace (based on their approximate altitude I would estimate much faster than any commercial or non-commercial aircraft I have ever seen. They glowed with a subtle consistent amber color, rectangular in shape but with smooth edges. I followed them without a blink for about 6 seconds before they went out of view over the rooftop. When I first saw them they were in tandem, before they went out of view the were going out of tandem. Needless to say i was stunned but excited. Before I went back into the house I just reaffirmed to my self that I really saw this and did not imagine it. That only took about a second.<n>

I IMMEDIATLY NOTICE AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT COMING THROUGH MY WINDOW, IT WAS RED, GREEN, BUT MOSTLY WHITE, IT WOULD HURT YOUR EYES TO LOOK AT IT. THERE WAS THIS PULSATING SOUND REPEATEDLY GOING, IT WOULD HURT YOUR EARS. AS I LOOKED AT THE WINDOW FOR THE FIRST TIME LYING IN MY BED I SEEN THE SHADOW OR OUTLINE OF AN OBJECT APPEARING TO BE THE SIZE OF A LITTLE BOY, THEN INSTANTLY IT WAS GONE. I WAS SO SCARED I PULLED THE COVERS OVER MY HEAD AND STARTED PRAYING. I COULDNT MOVE FROM FEAR. EVERY NIGHT AS I GO TO SLEEP I TURN ON THE RADIO TO LISTEN TO ART BELL, AND EVERY SO OFTEN I WILL ACCIDENTLY LEAVE MY CLOSET LIGHT ON. YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT PEERING THROUGH THE DOOR. AS THIS WHATEVER WAS GOING ON I NOTICED THAT MY RADIO AND MY CLOSET LIGHT WERE OFF. WHATEVER THIS WAS SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS RIGHT OVER OUR HOUSE OR IN OUR BACKYARD. AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES PASSED THE SOUNDS AND LIGHTS INSTANTLY STOPPED AND MY RADIO AND CLOSET LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I NEVER ACTUALLY GOT OUT OF BED BUT I COULD SEE OUT MY WINDOW AND I DIDNT ACTUALLY SEE ANYTHING. TONIGHT I AM GOING TO TRY AND STAY UP AND CATCH SOMETHING ON FILM.THE PRIOR NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS AWAKEN BY THE SAME THING, SO THIS IS TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW. SOMEWHERE AROUND 3 WEEKS AGO A GENTLEMAN THAT LIVES ABOUT TEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD WAS OUT ON HIS BACK PORCH AROUND 8 P.M AND NOTICED THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS OFF IN HIS FIELD HE ALSO SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WERE FLAMES COMING FROM UNDERNEATH IT LOOKED ALMOST CYLINDER LIKE HE IMMEDIATLY RAN INSIDE AND CALLED THE POLICE AND LOCAL FIRE DEPT. BUT NO ONE RESPONDED SO HE WENT BACK IN AND CALLED AGAIN,FINALLY AFTER THREE PHONE CALLS THEY ARRIVED BUT WHATEVER WAS OUT THERE HAD ALREADY DISSAPPEARED. THE NEXT MORNING AT THE LOCAL COUNTRY STORE HE GOT TO TELLING THE STORY, EVERYONE WAS MAKING FUN OF HIM UNTIL ANOTHER GUY CONFESSED TO SEEING THE SAME THING,HE HADNT SAID OR CALLED ANYONE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD THINK HE WAS CRAZY. HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE SAME THING! , HE THO UGHT THAT A CATTLE TRAILER OR SEMI TRUCK HAD RUN OFF THE ROAD IN HIS FIELD SO HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD GO TAKE A LOOK. HIS WIFE SEEING THE SAME THING KEPT WATCHING AS HER HUSBAND WENT TO PUT HIS SHOES ON, AS HE WAS PUTING HIS SHOES ON SHE YELLED BACK TO HIM &#34;IF YOUR GOING OUT THERE YOU BETTER HURRY BECAUSE THAT CATTLE TRAILER JUST FLEW OFF&#34; THERE IS ALSO A RUMOR THAT A LARGE METEOR FELL IN THE SAME AREA AROUND THIS TIME AND THAT SOME PEOPLE CAME DOWN FROM OUR CAPITOL FRANKFORT AND TOOK IT. THIS IS JUST A BRIEF SUMMARY THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SEEING THE SAME THING AROUND HERE BUT NOT SAYING ANYTHING.THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS.<n>

I read the post and knew finally that I wasm t crazy.  This very same night I too witnessed a UFO.  It was of a triangular shape and it hovered over three houses in the Hovious Ridge area of Columbia, KY.  I am unsure if this was one of your houses or not?  I was leaving a friends house and as I was pulling out of the drive onto the road the object appeared hovering over these houses.  My legs and feet began to tremble and I just stopped.  I watched it and was afraid to go any further as I knew once I went down the ridge there would be no houses and I would be all alone.  I sat there watching it for approximately 2 or 3 minutes and my heart just raced.  It appeared to be of a triangular shape in the front with all types of different colored lights.  It just sat there hovering.  Watching me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could barely breathe.  Then suddenly it took off like the speed of light over the trees and towards Green River Lake.  It was beautiful to watch.  Then all my fear just left me.  And I went on home.  I hope that the person who posted back in 2000 comes back and reads this.  Columbia is a small town and i&#39;m sure we are not the only ones who witnessed something dramatic that night.  I think people are just too afraid to say anything about it.

It appeaared to land just north of Williamsport Md., perhaps in the Potomac river.  No reports of any sightings weere made to any local radio stations, T.V. station, newspapers, or police.  Perhaps it was an object further away &amp; just mistaken for something closer.<n>

Enjoyed watching it. It was very bright (1 mag.). Watched it move across sky and then noticed a small blinking light on right side front. As I watched it move slowly across the sky I then noticed another blinking (somewhat larger) light on rear left. I then thought it can&#39;t be a satellite, I continued watching and was not sure. The intensity of the brightness stayed the same as it crossed sky and then disappear behind tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed the thought that it might be an airplane because the whole object was illuminated and it did not appear to be the headlights of an airplane which are in front.  I would have accepted it as a satellite if it were not for the blinking lights. Not sure if this is a UFO but thought I would report it anyway. I did not alert anyone else.<n>

I still have not discussed this with anyone. I have one question for you? Are these things able to disolve or maybe cammouflage themselves at will and in midair? Because this one did. When it dissappeared those three times that what it seemed to do and on the third time it didn&#39;t come back. This was the first time that I have ever seen anything that I couldn&#39;t rationalize to myself. I&#39;ve never seen aything like this before in my life. Also one other question, are these things always silent, because this one was.<n>

I am located at roughly 35.717N Latitude/-86.5060W Logitude. The moon at this point was roughly 75-85 degrees from my field of view and I was facing SE. This object glided eerily and slowly. Each point of the triangle was covered in vapor or cloud-like material and the object was translucent. As the object crossed my view of the moon, it obscured the moon as if looking at heat waves down an asphalt highway during the summer months, but the moon was still visible. I also detected a faint oscillating or sound pressure alternating sensation in my ears. The wind was blowing gently that night as well. It was a partially cloudy early morning and particularly cool, approx. 45 degrees. I didn&#39;t report this incident earlier as I had dismissed it as an illusion of the elements (clouds, moisture, temperature) but after seeing Eric Martin&#39;s GIF animation, that&#39;s (more or less) exactly what I experienced, except not against a starfield specifically, but against the sky as it was that morning. I don&#39;t necessarily have a need to be contacted, I just wanted the data to be included. I have no objection though and I&#39;ll leave that up to whom it may concern. Thanks.<n>

It caught my eye, because objects at that altitude do not more that quickly.  It was not moving at an ASTOUNDING rate of speed, but it was moving too fast for the average jet operating at that altitude, so it caught my eye.  As I watched it cross the sky I noted that it seemed to be heading for an identical small blob of light that was STATIONARY, situated at the same altitude, due northwest.  I watched this drama unfold, as the objects seemed to be heading for a rendezvous.  They finally met, and seemed to form a larger blob of light, though there was some separation between them.  Then the pulsing rings of light began, light pulses that were slow, forming vast concentric and expanding rings around the center of the two objects.  There would be a huge flash, followed by an expanding light-ring that filled perhaps 1/16 of the sky.  As one light ring dampened out, the process would repeat.  At this point, I dashed in the house to get my wife to come see.  She also saw the light-ring phenomena.  Finally, the light rings stopped, and the two bright blobs of light simply disappeared.  Again, this event was not reported on in the local papers, in spite of the fact that this was a HUGE phenomena.  I thought it could have been some kind of USAF operation, perhaps an exercise in signalling, but nothing was ever reported.  The date is very approximate -- it could have been anytime between December `1999 and January 2000.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two reports from same source.

We live about 3 miles off the main highway, on a one lane country road, which is very curvy and hilly. As I turned off the main highway, I noticed, far away in the sky above the hills a bright light. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at that moment. As I was driving down our road home, going around curves, up and down some small hills, I still noticed this bright light. It was in the northeast sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared our home, going down this one particular straight stretch of the one lane road, I noticed this same light, brighter than ever before, right above the hill line, right above our property.  It was 10 times larger and brighter than when I had first seen it, turning off the main highway, 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pulled down our driveway, our pet dogs ran in front of my van, barking, yelping and acting scared to death.  I could not see this light from the bottom of the driveway because we live down in a narrow holler, but I did see it still hovering over the trees BEFORE pulling down the long steep driveway.  When I got out of the van, I noticed no sound whatsoever. I thought maybe the light was a helicopter hovering. But, I heard no sound. It was deathly silent all around, except for our dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the kids to quickly get out of the car and run to the house. When we all hopped out, the dogs started running around and around our home, barking, looking up at the sky. When I mean running around our home, that is exactly what they were doing. They were running at breakneck speed, in circles around the home. They may have circled around our home 3 or 4 times, all the while barking and yelping. After making sure my kids were safe inside, I opened the door to look out to see if I could see anything.  The dogs were there, right against the door, and when I opened it, they ran inside. Now, my 2 dogs are outside dogs and NEVER come inside.  This was very unusual behavior for them.  I couldn&#39;t get them back out the door. They layed down in the floor and whined and cried when I tried to get them back outside. I ended up letting them stay inside for awhile till they calmed down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was went away. But, several months later, in the local newspaper someone had wrote in the &#34;Vent Line&#34;, asking if anyone else saw the bright light above the hills in the vicinity of Hurricane/Milton area on the very same night my family saw the light. So we are not the only one&#39;s to see it.…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were moving in a curved shape from west to north east. i had a small telescope on the roof. i tried to find them through it but could only catch a glimpse which looked like a star seen through a telescope. they moved slowly at constant speed , equal distance between them and vanished towards the horizon in 2-3 minutes. They did not like aeroplanes, shooting stars or satellites which we usually see on the roof. they were blinking and did not do anything else and just vanised.

I was called to view this.  When I did I noticed it made no sound and was approx 10000 feet, (I first thought it might be an Aircraft).  I then thought it was a Satellite/Shuttle until it started darting quickly backward, sideways and forward in an erratic fasion and then stoped for a lenghty period of time before starting to move erratically.  My Parents who are open minded on UFO&#39;s were also convinced it was strange. I am a pilot and was convinced a fixed wing aircraft would not be able to manoeuvrer like this.  There was no sound so that puts a Helicopter with a search light out of the question.  Plus the altitude and erratic behaviour puts this out of the question.  I went inside to telephone the local radar, (Williamtown Millitary RAAF Base) but I could not get through.  It then was seen to pick up unrealistic speed and disappeared. It was a clear night, I am not certain of the moonlight on the night. I have been trying to find a report for my area to see if there was anyone else who saw this.<n>

I called to my wife who came immediately and saw the object just as it began moving east toward Lake Charles Municipal Airport. We got into our car and followed the object, which had to have been moving close to 100 miles per hour. I distinctly remember the object passing in front of an airplane descending onto the runway. Afterward, the object moved too quickly out of our range to keep up with it. The local television station, KPLC, reported that there had been multiple sightings. The next day, our newspaper, &#34;The American Press,&#34; reported that what people were seeing was a blimp with lights inside of the inflated part that was illuminating it. I was within three miles of the object and got no impression that it was a blimp, but I cannot say for certain what the object was.<n>

We were getting into our car when my husband noticed this object in the woods across from our driveway.  It was hidden behind the trees at first, then it came above the tree tops.  It was enormous!  It was oval shaped with huge white lights around the perimeter of the craft.  Including red and white lights on the bottom of the craft.  There was an unusual brilliant red light on top of the craft, it was a blood red color, very strange!  The craft darted up and down through the trees within seconds then all of a sudden the craft shot up over to the west and disappeared.  We were both terrified!  There has been alot of UFO activity especially in this area for the past 4 years, but this by far, was the closest and scariest encounter we have had!  There was no noise from the craft, but the strangest thing of all was when it was darting over the trees, my husband called out &#34;come closer so I can get a good look at you&#34; and it would come closer!!  I&#39;m just glad I found this web site so I can let people know that this does happen anywhere and we are not alone!<n>

1/15/00 18:00|Longview|TX|Cigar|Two min.|I was standing on my patio looking around my back yard, I glanced up straight ahead. Not up to the sky.I saw two very large red lights|1/22/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11746.html|104|ndxe200001| I was standing on my patio looking around my back yard, I glanced up straight ahead. Not up to the sky.I saw two very large red lights through a grove of trees on my neighbor&#39;s property. The lights were in a straight line and were moving in my direction, still behind the grove of trees. Then they began moving to my left,came out from the trees, and when I saw the front of the craft, I thought it was a blimp, because of the shape.It kept moving to my left very slow, passing behind another grove of trees,just above tree top level.The lights were blinking,and it made a slow easy turn to the northwest, and dissappeared due to the trees.It was less than 150 yards away, it was very, very large. An aura, faint, dull white color,and appeared to have windows,and DID NOT make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 18:00 cst. on 01/15/00 (dusk). I walked through the garage to the back door that leads to my patio. I walked out and stood on the edge of the slab, just glancing around.These two large red lights had appeared through a grove of trees on my neighbors property that butts up to mine. The lights were in a straight line atop the craft, but very apart, and they appeared to be moving toward me (south),then they began to move to my left (west). The nose of the craft                                                        broke from behind the grove of trees, and by the shape of it, I thought it was a blimp. Both red lights were on, with a slow blinking. I ran to the door and called the other two witnesses.We were standing in the back yard. It was moving very slow, no sound, very large,(long). It had an aura that was fuzzy, a dull light color that blended in with the early evening. There appeared to be the outlines of two or three rows of windows that were a shade darker than the body of the craft. It was very low but, above the trees.It was about 100 yards or more away, VERY CLOSE! It was still moving west, and then started veering (slowly) to the NNW. And the trees then obstructed our view, and it was gone. The witnesses: I am a 38yr old male, no drugs, have held the same job for 20yrs and single, and considered Middle Class on the pay scale. The other two witnesses are single and have been friends of mine for 20 years. One is an assistant mgr; the other is a do every thing office worker. Neither do drugs.We are all very responsible, and family oriented, and have a ton of friends. We did not contact the local authorities, and as far as I know, no one else in my neibhorhood observed the craft, an that disturbs us. Please! Someone call us for questioning, we know we saw something that very few see.<n>

It felt really cool to see that thing with our own eyes...<n>

Arrived home around 2:45 AM friday night.  As we pulled in her drive way I asked her to keep her car running so we can wait in it for my car to warm up - it was COLD.  I got out of her car, started my car, as I went to get back in to her car, I opened her car door I noticed a bright light went on, I thought it was her flood light which come to find out is not a sensor light and no one in her house turned it on. I got in her car and shut the door, next thing I remember it was 2 hours and 45 minutes later and we both didn&#39;t have a clue as to what happened except for the fact we both were unconcious for almost 3 hours... simotaneously.  Both of our cars were still running and neither of us had any physical evidence of an abduction.  We were not drunk nor on drugs. The next day, I told a friend my story and they checked my neck and back and found a small circle of punctures in my upper back/lower neck consisting a total of 5 marks (I was told that this was common in abductions).  I am afraid for my well being and would like any feed back that you may be able to provide me with.<n>

My husband and I traveled East of Louisville, out in to the country, because we were so fascinated. It stayed stationary for about an hour and gradually faded away leaving a residual glow. It had almost a biblical parting of the heavens look. We were sure there would be some other people that saw this because it was much larger than even the moon when it first appeared.<n>

A black helicopter, with no markings, was observed in the area shortly after the sighting.<n>
1/14/00 09:23|York Mills/Leslie (over the intersections of) (Canada)|ON|Cigar|5 miutes or so|Clear blue sky ,temperature -12 C . After leaving our garbage route for morning break,I noticed a bright lightin the sky to the east. F|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12783.html|112|ndxe200001| Clear blue sky ,temperature -12 C . After leaving our garbage route for morning break, I noticed a bright lightin the sky to the east.  First thought that it was a jet on approach to Pierson International A.P. Closer observation as we sat at the stop lights left us with no earthly explanation as to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of January 14 2000,my partner and I witnessed a sighting over Toronto.  At roughly 9:20 A.M. ,My partner and I decided to go for break.  Northbound on Bayview Av.,we turned east on York Mills.  Just after passing over the crest of the hill nearing Versaille cr.,I decided to have a little fun at my partner&#39;s expense. When I saw what I thought was a jet on approach to Pierson International,I said hey I just got beamed in the eyes by a ufo.  The object then &#34;deluminated&#34; and re-appeared all within the time of two seconds or so.  The smile droppped when I realized the light had not changed position. As a blue collar pilot and by necessity trained observer,I began to go through ALL the posibilties as to what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second, though was it could have been a planet ,but no ,any visible planet would have been behind and to my right and not visible this late in the morning due to light pollution from the sun. Third thought was the most likely ...helicopter...but no rotor was seen . Lastly and possibly a Harrier jet on manuevers,...the afternoon before, I saw a military chopper hover over roughly  the same area. Fortunately,we were able to be stationary ourselves long enough while waiting for the light to change at York Mills/Leslie to make out it&#39;s altitude(roughly 1000ft AGL) and it&#39;s shape . It was cigar shaped I&#39;d hazzard to say 20&#39; long and 3&#39; wide at it&#39;s widest and shimmering(like mirrage on a road)but only close to it&#39;s skin ,if you can call it that. There were no control surfaces whatsoever ,although bright ,it was more like the reflection of the sun off a mirror than anything else. I had noticed a light aircraft approach it then veer off to the north back toward buttonville airport . I hope someone there can corroborate  the sighting, from or pireps atc... After the light changed in our favour,we proceeded through the intersection to turn right into the parking lot of the Coutry Style donut shop. Just before I jumped out of the truck to get a better look,I thought to myself &#34;I&#39;d really like to see this baby move out&#34;and as my face was pressed against the glass it moved ,but just before it did,the shimmer effect around the craft inceased then three puffs of what appeared to be steam were expelled in smoke rings from what may have been the anterior end of the craft. Three puffs each larger than the other took a shape simmilar to that of a torche flame when ajusted to form the cone in a cone. What I thought kind of odd was the lack of vapor trail,I&#39;ve watched jetstake off and they&#39;ve always left a dark vapor trail. This thing didn&#39;t! It was at  this time that I took advantage of a slow moving truck to jump out. Unfortunately ,I didn&#39;t get to see it in full flight before re-spotting it N.W. of my present postion. The Last I saw of it was somewhere in the neighborhood of the HWY.401/Bayview. Since then ,we&#39;ve been keeping my eyes to the sky more often. P.S...Roger&#39;s Cable transmiters and recievers are located just across the street from the sighting..Hmmm...coincidence?<n>

Sky was still dark. He looked to the south of our house (we live in the open country),about 5 miles away he saw a red light about as big as a full moon, it looked as if it was coming straight for him, then it wobbled left to right like a falling leaf and shot straight up and disappeared. The red light wasn&#39;t blinking, it was shining steadily. At one point he said there was a beam of white light coming from the object. He came in running to tell me, he was excited and scared. He said it was very strange because if it had been an airplane he would have heard the motors, that&#39;s how close it was. But as it was there was no sound at all. He didn&#39;t hear anyone else talk about seeing it so he didn&#39;t bring the subject up.<n>

The thing that clinched the sighting was my phone call to a local airport. The phone call was made within fifteen minutes of my sighting. I asked to speak to the control tower and to my surprise they put me through. I asked the control tower if there was anything in that area of the sky at the time of my observation and they said (after asking me some relivent questions to where I was and posistion etc) that there was nothing in that airspace at that specific time. The person I spoke to informed me they had UFO report forms and they would fill it in over the phone, so we did that. A week later I received a letter from the MOD saying that nothing was in the sky at the relevant position and time of my observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report is on file with the MOD in the UK and can be seen here:  http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/9341B687-6100-4D03-992D-4FB5E45F0DC4/0/UFOReport2000.pdf<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Eight entries down, listed:  Motherwell.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent written reports from the same source.

I just missed a flash, so I kept looking in the Northerly direction. Then from NW to NE a fireball arched across the sky. It was unlike the Leonids (i.e. it wasn&#39;t fuzzy and greenish/blue) it was white/yellow and a bit broke of it and fell quicker... i.e. it went down (like it hit resistance in the air) instead of with the rest of the fireball to the NE...

A man had video footage of the event north of Galesburg.  Many orange lights were seen going on and off across the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as can be said in the account on the television, it was an amateur camera operator who was trying out new equipment.  The footage shows the lights first coming on.  Then one after the other they start coming on slower and faster.  In all there were about 6 or 7 objects.  They continually flash from anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour.  This is not the first time that anything like this has happened.  They were sighted numerous times at my work place in Knoxville on the 3rd shift.  We have no conclusions to what they might be.  We have tried chasing them down before but they always seem to stay about a half-mile to mile ahead of us.  The usual time occurences for these incidents is between 11pm and 4 am.  I will continue to watch but would like any suggestions to its origin.  By the way, the things are sighted at the place where i work.  The facility is by an interstate and for some reason the objects dont come out unless there is no cars going by.<n>

It appeared to be hovering which could have just been because of the movement of the vehicle however there was no noise.  It appeared to change its position as we would only see 2 white lights then all of them then only 2 again as if it was turning. Because of the movement of the vehicle it soon dissapeared behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted anonymously.  We have no way to corroborate the report.))<n>

My son was out jogging about a block and a half from our home,and stopped in his tracks when saw something in the sky, . My son first said it was as large as a football field, but corrected this to saying it seemed large like a planet. He said the width covered the span of five to seven houses, which might not make sense, but this is what he said. My son stopped to look at it, and did a doubletake, because he could not believe what he was looking at. Afterwards, he ran home to tell me.  I walked to where the sighting took place(perhaps I should have taken my car)and unfortunately it was gone.  We just wanted to let you know. Thank You...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright and yellow similar to the sun,with an oval shape.  It was described as having clouds all around it, but I assume this is due to probably actual clouds in the sky;however,I must admit it is a clear night out. The object was low in the western sky and  covered the span of five to seven houses. My son said looked like a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicated the date of 11NO00.

I looked straight up out the front window and saw what looked like three brightly lit up windows and several colored lights like on an aircraft. There was a couple red ones a bright white one and some blue ones. Then the windows appeared to light up EXTREMELY BRIGHT then it appeared to explode. It did not look like an airplane diving,I thought at first it was some huge helicopter but it was really to humongeous for that. It also was reported to the Ellis  County Sheriff at Hays Kansas, there was an article in their newspaper The Hays Daily News about it on Thursday Janurary 13.<n>

It didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  As I drove towards it, the light got dim and it started moving very quickly and as it passed over I saw it was a triangle shape (but the sides were concave not straight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving work very late.  I was driving west on Roosevelt Road from 25th street in Westchester.  It was a cold, clear night.  The stars were easily visible.  As I drove, I noticed a very bright light in the sky (almost exactly south southwest).  It was high enough in the sky that, at first, I thought it was a star.  But as I watched, I realized that it was really bright, which is why it caught my eye in the first place.  So bright, that when I looked away, I had blue circles in my vision.  At this point I realized that it couldn&#39;t be a star, so it must be a plane.  I continued heading in its general direction.  It appeared to be about 3 miles away or so.  I judged that it must have been over the next town, Oak Brook.  As I approached Wolf Road, the light suddenly dimmed and, for the first time, it appeared to move in my direction.  I turned south on Wolf Road because its direction seemed that it would pass over just a few blocks south of my position.  At this point, I really just wanted to see what kind of plane it was since I have never seen a headlight that bright before.  The roads were very empty that morning, so I drove very slowly with my head hanging out the window watching it approach.  I stopped directly under it as it went over.  It appeared to be triangular, except that the sides were sloped inward.  It didn&#39;t seem to be more than a few hundred feet in the air.  And it wasn&#39;t until later that I realized I never heard any noise, not even as it passed directly over me.  I didn&#39;t notice any lights on the bottom of it, but, after it passed over, I did see a blinking light on top, which appeared to be the same kind of beacon all airplanes have, with a few other red lights near the front portion on top.  It was heading directly northeast.  I realized after it passed over that I forgot to look at the front where I had seen the bright light earlier.  So, I decided to follow it.  I turned east on a side street.  I watched as it moved away, so slowly that it appeared to be floating.  I decided to! turn no rth so I could get back to Roosevelt Road and continue the chase.  I lost sight of it due to trees and houses for the two blocks ride.  When I came back out on Roosevelt Road, maybe 20 seconds later, it was gone.  I stopped my car and searched the entire sky, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I had my cell phone in my hand the entire time, but I was so distracted that I never made a call to anyone who could have witnessed it too.  So, I went home.  I didn&#39;t think that much about it until a few days later when I heard a local television station news break teaser.  It was something like, &#34;are there UFO&#39;s in the night skies over Illinois?&#34;  But, I forgot to watch the news that night, so I didn&#39;t see the story.  I decided over the weekend to search the internet for the story.  That is how I came across this web site and read about some other sightings almost identical to mine.  So, I decided to report it.<n>
1/10/00 22:00|Erie (area)|PA|Unknown|less than a minute|dark object with strobe/beacon.stationary over Interstate 90 near Erie,PA|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53196.html|130|ndxe200001| dark object with strobe/beacon.stationary over Interstate 90 near Erie,PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving eastbound on I86 (then called NY route 17) one January night around 10pm.We had just turned onto I86 from I90 near Erie,PA. On the westbound side of the highway there are two steel frame towers (communication towers I assume),right up near the road,that each have a light at the top that slowly flash like the lights on radio towers.I&#39;ve seen these towers many times while driving through the area. So when we got another half mile or so down the road,I was surprised to see what at first looked like a third tower.Actually I assumed it was another tower because of the strobe/beacon that I saw flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer I noticed that the light was flashing much more quickly than the lights on the towers.(and,by the way,flashing about twice the speed of a normal aircraft strobe that can be seen in the sky on any given night.) I said to my wife,&#34;What the hell is that?&#34; She only glanced at the light.(We were returning from the Erie,PA veterens hospital because her dad was there recovering from a collapsed lung...so she was thinking about her dad and not a light flashing along the expressway) As we got closer,still...almost beneath this thing,the strobe was obscured by the &#39;body&#39; of the object.It was a very dark night with no moon.Whatever this thing was,it was as black as the sky.I couldnt really tell how big it was as it was invisible against the dark sky.No outline was visible at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is the thing that tells me this was not a stationary helicopter or something...and also the part that scared me. As we passed the object I kept looking up at it through my drivers side window. I saw a rectangular opening on the bottom of the object. The opening was about the size of a small car. I could see a grate or screen up inside there through which was visible a pulsing,glowing orange/red light which sort of looked like the pulsing glow of the hot coals at the base of a campfire. I&#39;ve seen lots of helicopters and they all have lights and numbers on the bottom or say police or sheriff and have visible landing wheels or skids on them.I&#39;ve never seen a helicopter a with pulsing,glowing rectangular opening on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way,the object was close up to the road...just over the tree line.The opening was about as high as the top of a 4 or 5 story building.We heard no sound as it was January and we had the car windows rolled up tight...and we were driving around 60 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to admit that I began to panic a bit on the inside! My heart began to race as I realised I was looking at something very different than anything I had ever seen before in the sky! For some reason I had the feeling that whatever it was,it &#39;knew&#39; I was looking at it...as if all the other cars that were going by didnt notice anything strange...as if I was the only one who noticed that this was NOT another communications tower! For a moment I feared this thing would come after us!My panic began to subside as we left the object further and further behind. I watched it in my side mirror and glanced over my shoulder at it as we continued down the road. It may have been an illusion,but I thought it looked like it moved back away from the road about 30 feet in an instant! ...like it moved in a wink! ...but it could have been an illusion because all I could see over my shoulder was the strobe blinking in the dark sky...and we were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we rounded a bend and passed under a bridge I was not able to see the object any longer. My wife said it seemed weird but like I said she was preoccupied with thoughts of her elderly father we had just left back at the VA hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole thing happened in less than one minute as we drove along the highway.Just for the record,there were plenty of other cars driving in both directions...I&#39;d say light to moderate traffic for the area...so others must have seen it.If anyone else thought it was strange I do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The freeway travels through the marine corps air station, Mira Mar. Its basiically three miles of darkness at night. As I was looking at the moon low on the horizon, I saw a green light shoot up from the bushes ahead of me to the right. It arced  up to about 100 ft. and leveled off then casually moved horizontally towards the freeway above me. The last view I had of it was leaning over my stearing wheel looking straight up at it. I was so deep in thought as to what the hell it was that I missed my exit four miles down the road. There was no structure surounding the light and it&#39;s movement was slightly erratic. Although I was traveling 70mph, I got a good look at it. It was about the size of a soccer ball and green like a traffic light. The air base does touch and goes routinely but in my 23 years of traveling this freeway, Ive never seen a light in the sky behave this way. My windows were up and I didnt hear any sound. I&#39;m a 38 year old male.<n>

About 1 1/2 hours after sunset my wife and I were unloading hay out in an open pasture for the cattle. The evening was cool, clear, and silent, with no wind or clouds,and I don&#39;t believe there was any moon yet. I saw the Orion constellation in the east and looked higher and saw the constellation above Orion that looks like a little letter &#34;Y&#34;. Directly over my head I noticed a bright roundish object moving at a high rate of speed from due west to due east. It was brighter than any star in the sky and appeared to be a single glob of white light. Thinking it to be a meteorite I told my wife to look straight up. She did and listening, there was no sound, and no trail behind it or anything. I then noticed motion in the southern sky and saw an identical bright white object speeding due north. Both objects were now in clear view and I judged by their heading, that they would barely miss crashing into one another. They kept coming, never slowed, and they didn&#39;t burn out or weaken in intensity of their light. They both seemed fairly large considering the distance, or altitude they seemed to be at, larger than a big jetliner I would say, yet there was no noise, no vapor trail, no winding jet turbo-drone type sound, and going way too fast, yet it was perfectly quiet. The object coming from the south passed just over the top of the object coming from the west and both continued straight ahead on their same respective courses. As I watched the first object continue due east, it unexpectedly disappeared at about a 60 degree angle up from the east horizon as measured along the path of my line of vision. It went from full bright white, to dim blue white, to gone in half a second. No sparks, no tail, no trail, nothing. I looked back north to the other object and it continued bright and was getting further away, racing along at the same high speed. Low on the horizon to the east I could see the soft glow of the city lights from Tulsa, hidden from my view by hills, yet illuminating the humidity and/or dust and pollution hanging in the air. I noticed an airplane low to the east northeast about where the Tulsa Int&#39;l Airport is located. The plane looked like it was heading west, and probably had just taken off. The plane had a solid white light on the front and a red blinking light to the side, as is common. I strained to hear the plane, but it was still too far away, as it is at least 45 miles to where the airport is located. I realized when looking back to the bright white object that the object was traveling at least twice or more than the speed of the airplane, and was much brighter. As I watched the object speed due north, now in the distance, it suddenly dimmed to off white for a fraction of a second, then just vanished from sight. Maybe both objects individually turned off their light at different times, but there was never so much as a blink of any colored light, or any warning light, only a bright white, a single, same intensity, solid white light. I&#39;m thinking that maybe the altitude where they were passing through was high enough that surface reflection was occuring from the sun, which had already set in the west, an hour and a half earlier. As we watched the first object speed east it could have gone into the Earth&#39;s shadow, making it invisible to us. Same with the second object a few seconds later, as it was higher because it passed over the first object at their point of crossing, so it may have reflected sunlight for a little bit longer time until it got too far to the north in the Earth&#39;s shadow and just seemed to disappear. We looked back to the airplane, and it continued it&#39;s slow progress forward. We are both used to seeing satellites circling the Earth, falling stars, meteorites, meteor showers, comet tails, etc. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this, both were clearly bright, fast, and seemed to have purpose in their close pass at each other. We stood a few more minutes and looked around, scanning for more information, more clues, but there was none. I have no idea what the objects were, or what they were doing.<n>

For some reason I looked left over the Brentwood Middle School, and saw an object flying approx. 1/2 of a mile away and at an altitude of about 500 feet. For 1/4 of a mile I had a totally unobstructed view of this object until the road became divided by a tree line, though I could still see the object through the tree limbs. The tree line ended about 200 yards from where Murray Road ends into franklin Road, and I had another unobstructed view of the object. The object appeared to be keeping pace with the speed of my car. The object then faded out and I could see it no more. After turning left onto Franklin Road I looked left, then right and saw the object again. It appeared to be flying once again at the exact same distance and altitude. Again I had a totally unobstructed view of this object as it now flew over a farm field. Again the object faded from my view, then about 3 seconds later reappeared. I watched this object for another 10 to 15 seconds, until this object faded from view for the last time. Again I noticed it seemed to keep pace with my car. The object had no wings, was a silver pewter in color,and I could hear no noise emanating from the object. There also seemed to be an aura or hazzy like disturbance in the air around the craft each time it faded from view.<n>

I asked my Mother if she was watching it and she had been. We carried on watching for maybe a minute or so, and then it simply disappeared, we were only a maybe a mile away from it, the sky was amost perfectly clear and well lit;it was over some fields with cows in, so you could percieve the scale. I could tell that the source of the light was small, but I could see no object, nothing. Then it was gone, not a trace. Observers(Undergraduate and Speech Therapist)<n>

We first saw the first cluster, the center of the cluster had a triangle shape that was made up of several bright lights. the triangle was surrounded with approx 6 more stars two at the far front ,two near the center and two in the back. We continued watching the first cluster until it almost disapperaed in the deep dark sky not knowing that there was another cluster following it. Thats when we noticed the second cluster, it also was formed and moved in the same way that the first cluster did. The second cluster follow the first cluster path until it also disappared into the dark sky. We were both puzzled form what we saw. Unfortunality I did not take my video camera with that night to tape this unbeleivable sighting. I wanted to report this the sameday but I was unsure if I should. When I came back from my trip yesterday, I told my wife what I have seen and she told me that she heard on the news that four LAS VEGAS Police Men also saw and reported something simlar to what me and my friend saw that night. That when I decide that I need to report this also. Thanks ((name deleted))<n>

The sky was still somewhat light from the daylight. I continued to drive, glancing at the light for a few minutes, at which point I realized that it was too large to be a star and/or a planet (and probably still too early in the evening to even make out a star/planet).  The light was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners, and there was a slight illumination around the outside. It was not moving, but stationery. As I continued to drive, I pondered what it could possible be, thinking that it might be a weather balloon or perhaps a helicopter of some sort.  I slowed my car to really focus in on it.  And then just stopped.  All of sudden, it was directly above my car, clearly visable from the driver&#39;s side window.  The movement from the distance was undiscernable, and as to whether I really saw movement or not is beyond me. The object that was above me was made up of maybe 10 or 11 very large bright white lights -- kind of like klieg lights -- maybe six of which arced around one side of it, and the others staggering away from the arc -- I believe these ones were a bit smaller.  Almost like an arrow with a rounded point. (It would be best to show it drawn.) The lights were so bright, that it was impossible to see what they were attached to.  It lingered above me in the sky.  I turned off the radio and unrolled the window to see if I could hear anything.  There was no sound.  Realizing that I was stopped in the middle of the road (dangerous), I continued on the road for about 15 seconds to the nearest intersection, where I pulled off and immediately got out of the car.   Whatever it was that I had seen was no where to be seen.  After studying the sky for a minute or so, I got back in the car and drove back in the direction I had come from to see if I could find it again.  Nothing.  Continued on my way (stopping in the town of L! itchfiel d) to meet a friend of mine in Waterbury for the evening.  While telling her about what I had seen, the color left her face.  During the afternoon, she had received a call (she thought it was around 3pm or 3:30pm) at the newspaper from a male who had witnessed a similar event with a friend while leaving the Home Depot.  For natural reasons, this added validity to what I had experienced.  This morning (Monday, January 10), I contacted the FAA, who directed me to the UFO reporting center. If you would like to contact me, I have provided my work phone number (thus, a collect call would probably not go over real well...).  I would be more than willing to speak to someone at my expense if a mutually agreeable time could be arranged.<n>

It happened one morning on the way to work when I was driving I noticed a reflection from something in the sky that caught my attention. As I observed it closer I noticed it was a metallic sphere of some sort which was absolutely dead still in the sky it didn&#39;t move whatsoever. I only saw this object for like 1 min at least, it was difficult keeping on eye on it as I was driving, but I looked back up again to where I had saw it and it had vanished from sight. After I had noticed it had vanished I saw what I believe was a kind of haze or even a heat wave left in the sky. It seemed at first like it had left really quickley and left a mark in the sky, but I had come to the conclusion that it might well of become invisible or even transparent. I know what I saw wasn&#39;t a plane or a blimp, all I know was it left very quickly almost like it had sensed it had been seen. As many witnesses do I wish I had a camera at the time, but now I keep a camera handy just in case it happens again...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It crossed the road in front of us heading towards the GE plant in Berkville in Alabama, the only bright spot on the horizon to the west.  Upon seeing the triangle I slowed my speed to under 25 mph, and watched it travel another 1/2 mile, stop, and retraced its route.  It was approximately 120 feet in the air.  I stopped my car about 1/4 of a mile after passing underneath it.  Turned around to see it retrace it&#39;s path &amp; come back at a slower speed, approximately 10 mph.  Went another mile, or so - &amp; vanished. Thank you for your return call Sunday evening.  You had me as a Mrs. Montgomery.  I neglected to give you my last name, sorry. The craft was triangle in shape, with bright lights on all three corners, one or two lights down the sides, all white lights.  One toward the front was especially bright.  It created shadows from the bushes &amp; trees, and lit up the brush so you could see colors.  Was flat across the back with no lights on the back.  The triangle was black.  The underside was void of any distinguishing marks.  The night was very clear, and somewhat warm.  Lots of stars, and very little moon.  The area we were in is very unpopulated, and has many fields where crops are during season.  It made no sound. There is a commercial airport with a air force reserve squadron five miles to the southeast.  There is a major airforce base about five miles to the northeast.  Danley field, and maxwell afb respectively. Prior to seeing it the radio on fm fading in &amp; out with a kind of squeally noise.  It only happened once, and lasted only a few seconds.  Not tyical for this area.  The closest we ever got was about 200 feet. On a personal level I am 35 year old mother of three daughters, marrried, 3 years of college, business major, home school my children, and work as a clerk in a movie store, accounting background.

About a mile up the road I saw a bunch of cars pulled over looking up at the sky.  It was another mile before I reached my apartment I loked out the window and at his point they looked as if they were forming a circle (they were all in a circle except one).  I then went out my front door and was standing on my stairs but I couldn&#39;t see the lights do to my building.  Within a minute or two an upside down triangle formation came into my view as startd to pass my building.  They moved fairly slowly and the bottom light slwly dimmed to nothing.  Then the top left light dimmed to nothing then the fourth light came into my viewpassing my building.  That light then dimmed.  Finally the top right light dimmed to nthig.  I couldn&#39;t see what happened to the other two lights.  The lights were a yellowish color.  They were steady and slow moving.  I didn&#39;t hear any noise when I got out of my car.

Some neighbors in that area said one of the objects had come down real close within a few hundred feet above their homes.

My wife and I were on our way to Denver through Kansas on I-70 just passing Fort Riley army base. I saw chem trails from several jets which I found very odd because they were flying very close to the same altitude. I looked at what they might be doing when I noticed that they were flying around a white object.  I took out my binoculars and asked my wife to tell me what the white object was they were surrounding.  I then spotted another white object about the same size.  maybe a couple of thousand feet direct south from the other.  I then came to the realization that I was witnessing a very, very possible military unit responding to an actuall UFO. The objects were bright white, my wife thought they were military crafts or clouds.  But when she looked through the binoculars she said she had never seen anything like them and couldn&#39;t tell what they were.  I immediatly stopped and had to look for myself.  My father was in the air force and have seen many aircraft and weather balloons. occasions.  The thing that impressed me was when one decided he had enough or was just having fun and took off in a S.W.direction.  The one jet that had been assigned to that particular object had to put on the after burners and had a tough time catching it.  The second object followed the first.  I started driving again at 65 mph and if these things were weather balloons they were go in and out of the jet stream. We had been watching now for about an hour, the two finally were far enough to where we could only see two small white objects on the horizon, but far enough that we could no longer see the jets.  Then we saw the third and it was real close.  We could also see two jets returning back to where we first saw them.  The third object had a lone aircraft escort. We got so close, but the wierd part is how it moved when it moved it was like if you were following a rainbow(The harder we tried to close to it, it some how moved so fluid you could not detect any motion). We got real close I would say it was less than a half mile in front of us and less than a mile in altitude.  It then moved slowly away from us (East) then in less than a second it was no longer there.  Another reason I don&#39;t think it was a balloon is because the horizon was a burnt orange but the objects stayed a bright white.  The next morning my wife was sleeping and I saw another object, less than a mile off of my nine oclock.  I have to keep my eyes on the road so I kept looking forward than looking back at the object. I saw three jets speeding in the same direction of the object so I watched the object as close as I could but it did the same thing as the third object the day before. In less than a second it was gone, or no longer visible.

The discharge was along the entire back edge.  It was totally silent. It appeared to be about as long (edge to edge) as a jetliner.  I have no way of estimating how far away it was, but it was an absolutely clear day, and the object was clearly visible but earily silent.  I continued to watch it move for about 3-4 minutes.

They came quickly did air show and then disappeared instantaneously at different intervals.  After all were gone (about 15 seconds) one object seemed to reappear vaguely and then just disappeared again.<n>

We saw what appeared to be a large single spot light to the south (possibly between us and town).  We stopped in the drive way and turned off the vehicle.  The light did not appear to be moving at all.  After a few minutes the object began to bank to the east and then back to the north.  At this time it appeared that there were in fact three lights on the object.  It seems possible that the lights were on the wing tips and the front landing gear of an aircraft.   There were a few strange things: 1. absolutely silent, no noise of any kind, not even when the object passed by and was leaving our area.  We appeared to be directly behind the object (usually you will hear some sort of &#34;rumble&#34; after a plane leaves.)  2. The object was not moving for a number of minutes (I realize that an airplane coming straight towards you does not appear to be moving).  3.  It had an odd red flashing light on top, in the middle of the object.  It looked like an old style red ambulance light flashing. I have been a private pilot for about 15 years and an airplane buff all my life.  This object baffled me.  It was one of those situations that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. I should also mention that we are located about 25 miles south of Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins GA.  This may have been some sort of military plane, it did not look like an airplane and it did not look like anything I had ever seen before.<n>

While heading south on Rt.4,it changed shape,and looked like the two lights merged into one big one before my eyes.After getting into the town of Lebanon,I turned eastbound onto Rt.50.While traveling eastbound,I watched it change into what looked like an elongated cigar.It was to the south-east of me at this time.There were a few cars on the road,so I turned on my overhead emergency lights,I was going approx.75-80 mph while heading in the direction of the object.When I turned onto old Rt.50,it started moving slowly noth-east.I stopped my squad car,turned off the overhead lights,and turned off the car. It then headed south-west at a very high rate of speed.It looked like it was somewhere around 2000 ft above the ground.It passed just south of my position,approx. 150-200 feet away from me.When I began to tell the dispatcher,it then accelerated ,and headed south-west,towards Shiloh,before I could finish what I was going to tell the dispatcher,it looked like it was over Shiloh&#39;s south-east side.I told the dispatcher that if a Shiloh officer would look up,he should see it.Right after the end of my transmission,Shiloh advised he could see it,and that it was still heading south-west at a high rate of speed.Soon after that,the Millstadt officer told the dispatcher that he could see it.The next reporting agency was the Dupo police Dept.,who said he was watching it through his field glasses. I couldn&#39;t discern what shape it was until it flew almost overhead.When it did,it looked like a large,narrow triangle,with the sides being longer than the base.It had three large,very bright white lights in what appeared to be the three corners.The lights were pointing straight down,with no oscilation.There was one red light that blinked near the base,just in front of,and in between the large white lights.When it was moving away from me,the back end looked long and narrow,with white light coming from it.The light looked like it was one long unit.There were multi-colored lights spaning the length of the back.I could tell there was more than one color,but not sure which ones because they seemed to blend together.Total length of observation was approx.4-5 minutes.Also,when it flew past me,It made no noise. I&#39;ve drawn a total of five pictures of what I saw,and the Shiloh officer has drawn one.The Millstadt officer said he was able to take a picture of it,but that it turned out fuzzy due to the cold.<n>

1/5/00 02:00|Florissant|MO|Rectangle|3-5 seconds|two story rectangle flys low and silent over the city of Florissant|12/3/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40653.html|172|ndxe200001| two story rectangle flys low and silent over the city of Florissant<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 1-5-02 I was driving home from a friends house on HWY 67 (Lindbergh Blvd.) Traveling South bond towards the City of Florissant border with the City of Hazelwood approximately 1 mile from HWY 270 and within 5 miles of Lambert International Airport.  I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but can’t tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnuck’s market (grocer)  at approximately 100-200 feet ( very low like a police helicopter height ).  The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldn’t tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway ( 4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I can’t say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon closer examination I noticed the officer walking back to his car and saw him looking towards the sky near a grocery store.  I looked towards that direction and saw a huge black rectangle with large windows on the side.  The interior of the object was light up well enough that I could tell the mass of the object was very large.  I would estimate the object to be as wide as a five lane highway or at least 100 yards wide.  I seem to remember seeing other hyper bright ( xeon or blueish in color like the new BMW cars headlights ) lights on the exterior of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed about 200 feet off the ground nearly directly over the Schnucks store flew over hwy 67 and out of my sight.  The object made no sound as it flew overhead.  As it passed I noticed movement inside of the back windows of the object and thought I saw someone move from the interior portion of the craft to look out the window ( perhaps to see the lights of the police car ).  My immediate impression was that this was some sort of military stealth blimp.  I do recall other colored lights on the exterior of the object, but can’t be certain of the configuration or more specifics because my attention was diverted to the large window and the movement I discussed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I told my friends I had visited that evening and my then girlfriend about my experience.  I hadn’t reported it to anyone else initially until I saw a documentary on the police officers who followed a similar object on the exact same night.  This year I contacted Darryl Barker (a local producer who has a website on the incident) here in St. Louis and spoke with him about my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Darryl Barker for directing this witness to our site.

Within hours of a similar craft reported by police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking a cigarette outside a friends house in Dupo, IL at 11:35 pm. I normally look at the sky and watch planes in route to Parks air field and Lambert International Airport (These are usually much higher altitude).  While looking to the north I followed some lights I thought were a plane. Will I watched I noticed there was no beacon (I was able to see beacons on other planes flying in the sky).  The crafts lights were also much bigger than any I had ever seen on a plane, and in an unusual delta ( compared to the other high flying jets that night).  My distance from the craft was hard to judge, but I would say about 3/4 to 1 mile and about 500 to 750 in altitude. The craft appeared to be banking to the north toward downtown St. Louis on it&#39;s slow journey (the slowness also set this craft apart). It seemed to be as slow as a blimp but much more stable in its route (I had seen many blimps use Parks Airfield on other occassions).  I finished my cigarette and went back inside.  I did not mention this to anyone inside because I thought they would think I was crazy.  I went home about 15 minutes later to meet another friend and told him the story.  I heard about the police officers on the news the next few days, who had seen something similar, but they saw it about four and a half hours later.  I tried to find someone to report this to but gave up quickly.  Last night (Nov. 30, 2000) I saw a Dicovery Channel presentation about the police accounts.  The computer rendition of the one officers craft sent a chill up my spine.  I woke my wife up to show her that what the officer had seen that night was almost exactly like what I saw.  I just wonder why no one else saw it earlier.  I do not know what it was but I know it was nothing I had ever seen before.<n>

Would flicker out and then reappear at least five times.  One the third sighting, it split into two lights before dissappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving back to Dallas from San Angelo, TX.  We were perhaps 40 miles outside of Coleman when I saw a light in the sky perhaos twice as big as a star, and with more of a yellowish hue.  I thought it might be just an extremely bright star, but after perhaps two seconds, it flickered and went out.  My initial reaction was that I had witnessed a shooting star, which somehow approached the earth at such an angle as to appear to not be moving (coming straight at me).  I then wondered if perhaps I had somehow witnessed the death of a star. My wife did not notice this first sighting, and I said nothing. Perhaps 3 minutes later, it reappeared at exactly the same spot in the sky, and this time, my wife noticed and asked what it was.  My next assumption was that it was a flare-gun, but I also thought that a flare should be seen falling back towards earth.  Instead, this light remained in place for several seconds, then flickered out.  We began watching the sky intently as we drove.  Perhaps 5 mintues passed, and again the light appeared, in what I would guess to be the same place.  (We were driving, and it is possible that our road&#39;s curves would change the location of the light).  This time however, the light divided in two... but the two lights remained the same size as the first original.  Each light moved horizontally outward from the original position.  If I had been holding a ruler up against the windshield of my truck, I would say that each light moved half an inch from it&#39;s original position.  To diagram what I mean, Suppose &#34;O&#34; is the Original position, and &#34;N&#34; represents the new position of the lights.  Here is how it would look:  N&lt;---O---&gt;N These two new lights then flickered and went out, remaining for about the same duration as the others... perhaps 3 to 5 seconds. At least twice more we witnessed the light, but only once did it split as I described.  Each time, the instances occurred perhaps 3 to 5 minutes apart.  Due to the number of sightings being between 5 and 6, I would say the entire episode lasted perhaps thirty minutes, all while I was driving perhaps 70mph.  There were no sightings after passing through Coleman, although I did see two planes, which I would tend to describe as a &#34;military search plane.&#34;<n>

The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud &#34;sonic booms&#34;.   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When it stopped, I saw an oval blue light; I thought I was looking at dayllight in that oval, which was slightlly larger than the size of the moon.   It appeared to be about one block away and 100 feet high, and stayed there for about 5-7 seconds.  I tried to see if it were part of a larger craft, but could only see the oval surrounded by darkness.  It left just as suddenly as it appeared, in a streak of light, similar to the color of sodium streetlights.<n>

While I usually do not pay attention to aerial objects since we have a high amount of air-traffic in the area, I found myself mesmerized by this object because of it&#39;s peculiar color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost a &#34;neon&#34; type of glow, I can only say that it looked very similar to the type of glow given off by those new &#34;HID&#34; bluish headlights found on BMW&#39;s and Accura&#39;s. No strobe lights appeared on this object, as is commonly seen on aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be silent and moving very slow to what appeared to be a westerly direction. I can only describe the shape as being almost half-circular with a bit of distortion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a digital photograph and although the image did not turn out too well it is still visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date shown here is an exact date.

1/4/00 03:15|Union|MO|Triangle|1 hour|Trangluar Craft over Union, MO  Jan. 5th 2000.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from law enforcement officer.  PD))|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93294.html|180|ndxe200001| Trangluar Craft over Union, MO  Jan. 5th 2000<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Northern Minn.  I’m retired from Law Enforcement of (10) years. I then moved into State Government work for (28) years.  After retirement I stepped back into Government work as a consultant. I worked as a Volunteer Asst. Fire Chief for (24) years. I was also a member of the Bomb &amp; Arson squad in my county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lets start by the date!   On Jan. 5, 2000 I was at a nearby township investigating a house fire. At around 3:15 a.m. I walked back to my truck to clean off all the dirt from my boots and turn out gear. I stated listening to the Two-Way Radio in my truck. We where picking up radio traffic from the  ILL area.  The ILL Co. dispatcher was talking to some Police cars about a object moving North East heading for the St. Louis, MO area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a half hour, I was still on the fire scene I stated heading home on I-44. That’s when I picked up our county dispatcher talking to a Union, MO Police Officer about a large object over Hwy. 50 &amp; Hwy. 47.  I turned down Hwy. 47 towards Union, MO. As I came over the hill into town I saw three white lights about 75-100 ft. apart from each other. In between the round white lights there were multicolored-color lights scrolling back and fourth from left to right and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came down the hill and pulled up behind two Police Officers parked on the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then could see a very large triangle shaped craft with more lights on the bottom of the craft. One very bright white light in each corner &amp; one red light in the center towards the back of the craft. The white lights where beaming straight down. The red light was blinking on &amp; off like a radio tower light.  I got out my truck and started walking up to the Police Officers. One officer was from the City of Union, MO the other was a Franklin Co. Deputy. Just as I got up to them the craft started to move off to the north east at about a very fast running speed.  The two officers got in their cars and started to chase the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to keep up with the two officers. They where using their overhead lights. So, after a minute or so, I caught up to them. I got out of the truck again and walked up to the officers. The craft had stopped again about a mile up the road. As we were watching, the bright spotlight type lights in each corner came down to about 100 feet from the ground and stopped. No light beam touched the ground. We watched the craft for about 10-mins. Then the craft moved again. This time only about ½-mile and stopped again. After stopping and getting out to talk with officers again, I noticed the County officer was trying to talk to the dispatcher by two-way radio. I have a portable two-way radio with me and could not pick-up any radio traffic from the County or the officer in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to mention that the craft was directly overhead and about 500 ft. high. The craft was also the width of a football field. The sides in some parts of the craft where about 10-ft. at the corners and moved up to about 20-ft. in the center, making it curved on top and flat across the bottom. As this craft moved again all radio traffic returned to normal. We again could hear the dispatcher over in ILL talking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved off for the third time, the County officer looked at both of us and said “I another call pending” got back in to his car and drove off! So the Union office told me he was to far out of the city limits,  “I don’t see a thing” and got back in his car, turned around on old Hwy. 100 and drove off. I watched the craft move off until I could not see the lights any longer. It was moving cross country and there were only private roads &amp; driveways. I then got back into my truck and drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the second stop the county officer was trying to set his dash camera in the up direction, but it was bolted in and would not turn.  I waited for weeks to see this story in the news paper or on the TV news, but no one file a report.  Do to the fact I didn’t have a Police report to fall back on, I decided not to talk to anyone about this sighting.  Now that I’m retired and this craft keeps showing up in Missouri, I thought I would bring this story to light. Hopefully, this will help out investigators in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was as large as my thumb extended at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:43 Jan 03, 2000 I observed in the night sky, an object traveling at a very high rate of speed, flat on the horizon. It traveled from north to south. It came into my vision at a point just below and to the south of the North Star. It traveled below Cassiopia to a point just about exactly West of me. I am in Reno, Nevada. The object was very bright (not like a fireball)like a white light. It appeared at least as bright as Venus. It took only 3 sceonds to travel this great distance of sky. It&#39;s elevation was very difficult for me to even estimate. I was looking about 12 to 15 degrees above the horizon. The object was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. It didn&#39;t get appreciably brighter nor did it fade out. It just traveled at a high rate of speed in and out of vision. I watch satellites all the time. I can usually figure how high up they are and the characteristics they demonstrate. Including how long it takes them to travel across our sky at 17,500 miles per hour. This was traveling at many times that speed. Even if it was lower, it traveled many times faster than any planes I know of. Within a very short time after I saw this object two aircraft appeared in the sky going in the direction where Lost sight of the bright object. They were very large and traveling at the speed I would expect chase aircraft to travel at. The only thing is they had very bright lights on all the way accross the sky (unlike regular aircraft)and they made no sound. It was very quiet and there was no wind. I watch aircraft all the time and I know you can hear them in these circumstances. These made no sound. They did have, in addition to the regular appearing aircraft lights, red and white strobes. Two things were very strange however; I watched the one that was traveling from North to south, in the direction of the object, for an inordinately long time and distance. I watch planes all the time and I know I cannot see them at such a distance and again I must mention they made no sound. The other aircraft appeard from the East and traveled west to the direction of the Object. I am a cool headed person in my fifty&#39;s. I  love the sky, planes and things celestial as did my mom before me. I have been observing the sky since I was a very young man. I don&#39;t know what I saw but I did see this interesting object and the craft I described. I felt I should report it. If it was Russian space junk entering the atmosphere, why the chase craft and what were they? Very large, lights on when they shouldn&#39;t be and NO SOUND. I hope this report helps.<n>

I was standing at a nearby corner, looking up at a no-longer-in-use water tower sitting on the lot next door.  I turned my head northward to watch an east-moving plane--I like to see the &#34;tail&#34; they leave behind.  I then saw a north traveling object; it was moving ever so gently, as if just glidding.  I was so shocked because I observed I was about to witness a mid-air collision.  This very very shiny object, (like shine coming from a high gloss metal like chrome) went: (AS THE JET WAS TRAVELING EAST) 1. North 2. Up and over the jet then under it 3. and Over it again Like a wrapping motion-1 1/2 turns. Then this object that looked like a manta raya traveled towards my direction (in southerly direction. I did not keep my eye off it.  It moved very slowly, gently, swaying very gently towards south-western direction --towards the mexican border.  about an hour later, my mother called me from Laguna Nigeuel in Calif.  She said something like: Honey, put everything down, I need to tell you something I just saw (fm her kitchen window). I stopped her from talking further and told her to stop and let me tell her what I had seen.  We both described the object in the exact manner: a metal object that looked like a manta raya or sting ray, moving very gently, no vapor trail... We know what we saw.  And so did the pilot moving east on this day<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; witness does not indicate year of sighting.

It was a very clear night, with lots of stars.  I forget if the date was Jan. 2nd or 3rd of 2000, but it was between 10:30p.m.-11:30p.m. and my children were asleep in the back seat in there car seats.  I was driving, and my wife was passenger in the front seat.  We were near the Nevada border( within 25 miles either way), when my wife and I noticed 3 bright, white lights in a row, one behind the other.  They were about 200 yards in front of us, and about 15 yards to the right side of the highway,(south) at a hight of approximately three telephone poles.  They appeared to be hovering, or moving very slowly toward us.  As we aproached within 50 yards, the lights began to ratate, slowly, as if on a side of a plate that was perpindicular and spinning downward.  My wife and I nearly lost our breath as it came right at us.  My wife thought it was actually going to crash into us, but as the spiraling lights appeared to almost hit the ground in the ditch next to hwy.(aprox. 10 yards from car at a 1:00 angle), the lights abruptly went out.  I thought for sure the thing should have crashed and that was why the lights went out, but there was no crash sound.  My wife then told me that right as the lights went out it abruptly made 90 degree turn toward the south and disapeared at a rediculous amount of speed.  Since I was driving, all I saw were the lights(about the size of tires, spaced aprox. 10 yards apart).  My wife however was able to see the dark shodow of a craft, stating it was wing shaped, moderately flat, with the three lights positioned on the side, and bars hanging from the front(possible landing gear).  The craft made so sound at any time, and for being so close to our car when abruptly changing direction there was no turbulance from any propulsion system.  I am curious if we have any technology in propulsion systems that would allow the sudden direction of! change, with abrupt changes to extreme speeds, without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At that moment, I saw a boomerang with 3 lights evenly spaced on each wing. It went quickly from exactly west to east. It was totally silent. The lights were white. I could see the outline of it against the sky. It had a bit of a rectangular look to it, very symmetrical. It was like nothing I ever saw, and I&#39;m certain it was not a man-made machine. It was about the size of an index finger held at arm&#39;s length. 10 seconds, and it was gone. I&#39;m still amazed at what I saw.<n>

It flew level accross the horizon from west to east. At the very end of the flight it split into 2 additional smaller pieces in front of the main light trail. The two additional pieces did not have trails. The pieces and the original light continued in a straight line on the original trajectory. The lights then all went out simultaneously. It was NOT a meteor or a comet. It appeared to about 1000 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My original summary describes what I saw. I can only add that I have seen comets, meteors and enough planes in my life to know that It was not any of those things. I immediately contacted NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and they had no clue what it was but said that they had gotten many calls. I could not tell what the shape of the object was or how large it was.<n>

It was bright, &#34;neon&#34; green with a bright orange, firey trail running behind it. It had brighter lights along the sides. It was flying in an arc as if it was about to crash but we did not hear a crash or see any explosion. It was not &#34;falling&#34; but was flying under power. I could not determine whether the flames were &#34;normal&#34; or were a sign of distress. We only observed it for 3 seconds and it did not change direction during that time. It only continued in a downward arc and went behind the trees where we couldn&#39;t see it. When we saw it, we were traveling along Sunset Drive in a northern direction. It was directly ahead of us, not high in the sky and arcing down as it went. After it went behind the trees, we continued to scan the sky for about 7 minutes as we drove but we didn&#39;t see anything else.<n>

Sunday, January 2nd, 2000, approx. 9:30PM A Redlands resident, who is also a licensed civilian pilot, witnessed a flaming green fireball descending slowly, making a (jet-like) roaring sound. The witness reports that at first he thought it was a 747 going down, it was so large.  The object appeared to move at a speed of about 4-5 knots and was estimated at an altitude of 4 to 5,000 ft. when he saw it.  He watched it descend in an easternly direction and said it appeared to him that the object crash landed here in the area.  He describes the object as round in shape, as near as he could tell by the objects extreme brightness and the color was &#34;a beautiful green - like burning metals&#34;.  Size as large or larger than the full moon.  He called the local Sheriff Dept. and newspaper and was told that it was a meteor.  He said, &#34;He&#39;s seen alot of meteors in his day but this didn&#39;t look like any meteor he&#39;d ever ever seen before - if he didn&#39;t know better he&#39;d swear it was under intelligent control.&#34; (Source:  Cinde Costello, MUFON SSD, San Bernardino County, So.

Conditions in atmosphere were clear.  Object went too fast to be a plane too large to be a meteorite.  Object was white in appearance. On 1/2/00 (approximately 7:34 pm)saw same object at a northerly 45 degree angle from the ground.  Object went straight down towards the ground and proceeded to zig zag and then continued straight down.  Conditions were clear.  Witnessed by my girlfriend and I.  Within minutes after the event the sky was filled with 3 objects obviously airplanes heading in a westerly direction with very minimal space between them.  Possibly military. We currently live 10 miles outsite the Hanford Nuclear Reservation which covers 450 square miles.  So if object was picked up on radar military aircraft would have been scrambled to verify object.<n>

It was inside our atmosphere..that I know!! After one sec of spotting it...it decended at a very high rate for approx 1.5 secs at downward slope. Point of light blinked out, before it moved behind the building. The building DID NOT block the light blinking out...it went out before it passed behind the building..my husband...sits in his office...like you I&#39;m sure..in front of his computer EVERYDAY...his window looks east. He is very aware of the light patterens that blink in the night, on an everyday basis. He claims he saw a point of light, 45 min prior in a totally different place, matching the same description. This orange/red twinkling point of light, was unusualy large, to be suspended in mid air for 4-5 sec&#39;s. It was something he claims he has NEVER seen before in differentiation to fixed winged aircraft and helicopters flying in the vicinity. He says you mentioned something about a fireball. He says....SORRY...NO FIREBALL...FIREBALLS dont hover for 4-5 sec&#39;s..then just blink out....or maybe they do...who knows. This is our report.<n>

No car present. Immediately looked up and heard a &#34;whoosh&#34;, or something cutting through the wind, like a hang-glider-only I saw a fairly large (approx. 30 ft long) black cigar shaped aircraft of some sorts. I have experience working around aircraft at night, and this was very different.  It had no sound (engine) after the initial noise. It flew from south to north just above a mature tree in our back yard. It dissappeared in an instant-making no noise at all. It was truely amazing. I wondered what I had just witnessed. Maybe some new Govt aircraft. I called EVV and talked to ATC. No reports of low flying aircraft. Our house lies under the approach pattern for aircraft from the south-however we are 6 miles south of the airport-much too far for an aircraft to be at an altitude of 40-60 feet. There are too many power lines for it too have been a hanged-glider, plus it was dark. That would have been suicide.<n>

It it appeared as an aircraft light, but 3 to 5 times larger, if the craft was about 700-100ft in altitude and approximately 1 mile south. The light did not flash, flicker, or streak. After 3-5 seconds of what seemed to be a hover to a slight North to South movement, it then seemed to either move drastically from North To South, or fall in an arc to the Earth. In less than five seconds it had faded to nothing, over the tree line. At first I thought a shooting star. I have seen 20+ shooting stars. Again, I emphasize, this thing did not flicker at all, nor did it streak.<n>

As we walked outside, we saw this huge triangular shaped object in the sky not much above the tree tops.  The object made no sound &amp; was travelling extremely slow (almost hovering).  I yelled down for my parents to come outside.  As we all stood their watching we could see the object very plainly, as it was flying so low.  It was heading north.  It had several very bright lights &amp; the bottom of the craft appeared to be flat.  The rest of the craft was mostly black.  The lights from the craft could be seen reflecting off of the ground.  We actually didn&#39;t have a clue what it was, but it was unlike anything any of us had seen before.  It flew north over my parents yard &amp; then over the field across the road going north.  It seemed to pick up some speed when it got to the field, but nothing extremely fast.  My children were 10 &amp; 12 at the time &amp; they both remember.  My mother suggested that night that it was possibly something from Scott Airforce Base.  We all tried to accept that theory, but have since pondered what we saw that night.  We never did report it....I guess we were just afraid everyone would think we were crazy.  I was the documentary on Travel Channel a few nights ago called &#34;UFO&#39;s over Illinois&#34;.  Those officers &amp; other eyewitness were describing the same object we seen in Janurary 2000, so I decided to go ahead &amp; report our sighting.  Actually, it made me feel better to know that we were not the only ones to see this!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first it moved passed 1 or 2 stars real slowly.  It made a sharp turn and quickened its pace.  It went straight for about 5 more stars and then it suddenly zipped away and disappeared.

I happened to look up and noticed what I can only describe as a &#34;blob&#34; roughly circular in shape moving from south to north. If asked to provide a better description I guess you could almost describe the object as amoeba-like in its shape. I almost didnt see it because it was completely unlit, I could only see it do to the ground lighting from the power plant and other chemical plants in the area. (This area has a heavy concetration of chemical plants.)It was hard to determine the color but appeared to be slightly off-white or very dull gary in color. It was not moving particularly fast, maybe about the speed of a small propeller plane, and flew in a straight line, not erratic at all.It also made no sound that I could detect although there was a quite a bit of noise from the power plant that may have obscured the noise, if any, that may have come from the object.I had never before heard of any reported UFO&#39;s having the same strange shape that I saw. I told the shift supervisor about what I saw but he didnt seem to concerned. I have not reported this to any other agency though I may try to conatc the local FAA in Houston to see if anything strange was reported about that same date, time and vicinty. The location is in east Harris County, Laporte, Texas, a suburb of Houston (east of Houston) just south of the Houston ship channel. The area is a couple of miles southeast of the San Jacinto Battlefield and monument and about 1-2 miles west of the Highway 146 ship channel bridge. I not not want my name released publicly.<n>
1/1/00 01:00|Washington, D.C.|DC|Cylinder|about 1 minute|Near end of 1AM fireworks while standing outside Metro station in DC observed at least 5 cylindrical things moving at high speed across|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11594.html|223|ndxe200001| Near end of 1AM fireworks while standing outside Metro station in DC observed at least 5 cylindrical things moving at high speed across sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attended &#34;America&#39;s Millennium&#34; celebration on the national mall in Washington DC New Year&#39;s Eve.  Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me &#34;jump&#34;.  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn&#39;t real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, &#34;What good timing for shooting stars!  It&#39;s great to see that during the fireworks.&#34;  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the &#34;shooting star(s)&#34; never &#34;burned up in the atmosphere.&#34;)  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects &#34;flying&#34; in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more &#34;shooting stars&#34;.  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, &#34;Am I seeing UFOs?&#34;  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn&#39;t notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess &#34;resistance is futile&#34;; I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post&#39;s of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!<n>
1/1/00 01:00|Healesville, Melbourne (Australia)||Unknown|20 minutes|Light darting around over resevoir|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30665.html|224|ndxe200001| Light darting around over resevoir<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were walking along the dam wall at the local resevoir. There was no moon and there are no lights around. Our eyes had become accustomed to the low light and we walked to a lookout. On the way back I looked over the resevoir and saw a light dart up then down below the range of hills in the distance. I stopped walking and watched and it flew up again, hovered with a shaking motion, then &#34;hid&#34; again. The object had a white light on the front, a red light on the bottom and a flashing yellow light on the back. At all times it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew my lady friends attention to the distance and it obligingly darted into view again. It didn&#39;t seem to be affected by inertia and when stationary, seemed to shake as if it was between two repelling magnets. At one stage it dissapeared behind the range of hills and a vivid red light lit up the trees on the ridge as if they were on fire. Then it flew up, darted round then flew down to the water. A bright red light eminated from the front of it, not a beam, more like ambient light. After a couple of minutes it flew up again and started moving in our direction. It started off about 2/3 kms away and got to a few hundred metres away before I decided to leave. There was a feeling of danger and were glad to go, despite my curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the strangest things about the event was that as we left the house to start our midnight ramble, I had a feeling that we would see something and I said as much to my girlfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It was way off in the distance, but brighter than any planet or star. It traveled downward about 10 degrees, and held it&#39;s position for around 10 minutes. My friends and I were sure it was nothing we had seen before. Eventually it just disappeared. It was incredible and didn&#39;t scare us at all but rather mesmerized us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  We would like to know where the incident occurred.  PD))<n>
1/1/00 01:00|Zurich (Switzerland)||Light|20 min.|Large red orange light was seen traveling slowly over Zurich on New Year's Eve under a cloudy sky.|3/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12219.html|226|ndxe200001| Large red orange light was seen traveling slowly over Zurich on New Year&#39;s Eve under a cloudy sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A red/orange light which appeared to shift between red and orange and which appeared much larger than an airplane light and much larger than Venus at it&#39;s brightest was seen moving slowly across the night sky of Zurich, Switzerland on New Year&#39;s Eve.  The sky was completely overcast so it was clear the the object was not a star or anything in space. We were watching some fireworks in the distance so many of our eyes were turned skyward.  I don&#39;t have any directions to give you at all but the light in the sky was there for about 10 minutes before it registered with me.  I just thought that it was a super bright star but then after the fireworks stopped it hit me that the sky was completely clouded over and at that time I called it to the attention of my five friends.  Nobody had any idea of what it could be and after about 10 more minutes the object started to slowly move over the city.  Two of us had cameras but my friend with the digital camera had (wouldn&#39;t you believe it, just at this moment, just like in the movies!) technical problems and he was not able to get a shot. I was able to get off a few shots.  I made sure that I got a building in the picture to aid in determining the distance and with luck a low flying airplane flew near the object so I was able to get the object, an airplane, and a building in one shot.  The camera was just a little point and shoot model so the negatives are extremely underexposed.  I don&#39;t know how much use they would be. It really just looks like a light with a dark background. The object moved out of my view after about twenty minutes.  We heard no sounds coming from the object. I was wondering if anybody else reported this.  It must have been seen by a lot of people because it was up there for so long and it was moving so slow. I would love to hear something from you. I can get images to you if you would like them.

The object now appeared maybe 300 m overhead. It was eliptical in shape and perhaps turquoise in colour. It appeared to change shapes several times, like jello. It then continued away from us appearing to increase in altitude. We tracked it for at lest 1 minute until it dissappeared at very high altitude. We were having a conversation about what we were watching and could not come up with any reasonable explanation. We had shot a fireworks show that night on the beach and joked that maybe we caught someone&#39;s attention in a very remote part of the world. The sky was black and clear with a 20 km/h tradewind inland.<n>
