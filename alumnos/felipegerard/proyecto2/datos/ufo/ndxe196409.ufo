I looked up and saw a round saucer-like object (similar to two saucers turned to face each other horizontally) hovering at about telephone pole height. It seemed to have lights all around its perimeter. The only noise we could hear was a very gentle hum. It stayed in one place for most of the time and then with a slight increase in noise intensity,  zoomed away very rapidly. This area where we saw this event is very close to O&#39;Hare Airport (Mount Prospect Country Club) although we did not see any aircraft of any kind near it. I would not object to being called if it would help you in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to notice that Dr. J.

I called him and related my experience with the sighting, and he told me that the sighting was still unexplained.  He did, however, offer an explanation proferred by some Chicago City department, I think the police department, the day after the sighting.  It seems I and my neighbors weren’t the only observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The explanation was that the object was an airplane that was carrying behind it a broken electric sign.  I told Dr. Hynek that that simply wasn’t possible, given that the object hovered for 45 minutes and was noiseless.  He agreed, saying that was why it remained unexplained to that day.  If you have heard of this sighting, or know of anyone else who has reported it to you, please let me know.  Though I was only 12 or 13 at the time, I have compared notes with my father over the years, and my recollection matches his.

One saucer-shaped, silent, dull-metallic appearing object travelled over downtown Arcade headed nw about treetop height.Seen by many. Nellie Daully(town operator) receieved many reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late summer/early fall before dusk.Object as described passed over town headed in general direction of thr park (nw).The year was probably 1964 or 65-66.I was a toddler but distinctly recall the object passing overhead dissappearing beyond the treetops in the distance. My mother witnessed this, and my sister(3yrs older)-but sister doesn&#39;t recall.The area was a hotbed of activity in the 60&#39;s. My father a physician and formerly, an airforce pilot during Korean war recounts that many of the sitings corroborated ufos generally travelling northbound following rt98. Bray road is one of the highest elevations in the county and people living there and in the area of Lost Nations witnessed several objects. One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch. The last I&#39;ve heard is that there is a dome shaped building 1/2 way up Bray rd. which is under 24hr guard. Even the farmers next door to it don&#39;t know why it&#39;s there. I hope this old archival info may be useful. It is definitely truthful and deserving of scrutiny. One other point (of potential interest) is that Arcade is pretty rural-about one hour south of Buffalo; the only other interesting thing of note in the vicinity is the West Valley nuclear facility (about 15 miles south ). This was being built in the early 60&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A boyfriend and I were parked on a jutty overlooking Monterey Bay-yes in the old time venacular-making out.  I happened to open my eyes and way in the starscape I saw a light make a 90% turn.  I said excidedly_______ stars don&#39;t make 9% turns-quick flash the headlights.(Yes I was bossy-even then)He did and in a milli second it appeared before us-hovering over the ocean and filled the whole windshiel.  I felt there was a presance with us, but not threatning.  We flashed the headlights again and in responce blue yellow and red lights circled the machine.  There were windows and I peered so hard but nothing appeared - again a sence of presence.  It was completely silent. I was 18 and torn between spooked and fasinated.  I asked to leave and we did.  In latter talks with my priest he said a VIP had taken pics same night but would not come forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Most of the things you were taught are gone as useless information as you stand looking up at the huge craft that according to what you’ve been taught, can’t be hovering over you!  The thing can’t even fly!   Yet there it is!   You’re not scared of it, you’re fascinated by it!   You loose track of time as you stand there gazing at it!  Is it a few minutes, or fifteen minutes or more that you stand there gazing at the huge craft?  There are portholes and lights around the craft and the sounds it made as it approached have stopped and there’s only a high pitched hum.  There’s a strange feeling coming over you like that some how you are drawn to whoever is inside the thing.  It starts moving back on a 45deg. angle to the path it came in on, and as it does it starts to rise!  Suddenly it moves upward with increditable speed and no change in sound.  As the lights disappear you feel like you have just lost your best friend.  You look at your brother who is about twenty feet from you and two years younger.  You both run to the house to tell your dad what you have just seen.  He dismisses it as so much garbage because he’s a Baptist preacher and that blows his religious theories all to hell!  That happened to me and my brother in 1964.  I was eighteen.  I see it now in my mind the same as I did at that time forty-one years ago.  That made me a “knower”.  Not a believer.  There is a big difference.  It changed my life in ways that’s hard to explain.  I lost all faith in anything the government said or ever will say, and I also lost my religion!  Probably the best thing that ever happened to me.&#34; end quote Since that time I&#39;ve seen another object here in the Smoky Mountains of E. TN.  It scared the hell out of me and I have never talked about it much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought you may be interested. This is not about moving lights, or fireballs, it is not about an encounter with people from another world!  It is just the plain truth about a craft that made a lasting impression in my mind as I looked it over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just call me ((deleted)).  I’m fifty-((deleted)) years old, and I’d like to share an experience I had, when I was seventeen or eighteen years old, with you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the late summer of 1963 or 1964.  I do not remember the exact date, because I tried for a while to try to forget it.  Things like I’m about to talk about were taboo in the home of a southern Baptist preacher at that time!  It was best to keep your mouth shut and try to pretend it didn’t happen!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following event took place in upstate SC.  Within 30 miles of Spartanburg-Greenville airport.  The reason I mention this is, the airport had very good radar at that time, and the Air Force Base at Sumter is less than then fifteen minutes away for an interceptor.  None showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother {who is two years younger than me) and I usually sat out on the front porch each week night after school started back in late summer, and talked for an hour or so before we went to bed around 11 o’clock.  Our front porch faced about 10-20 deg. northeast.  There was a wooded area directly across the street in front of us, that had a lot of trees in it that were 50 or 60 feet high, so our view of the sky was limited down to about 1 o’clock.  This night the moon was very bright and probably within a few days of being full, which made the porch dark where we were sitting.  We heard a strange sound coming from across the street in the sky and out of our sight.  It sounded like a multi-engine aircraft that was straining real hard.  We sat there and listened at it for a couple of minutes as the sound got closed and the noise changed to more of a whine, almost like a locomotive without the rail noise.  In a minute or so we could see some lights through the trees and a huge shape moving slowly toward us.  My brother said it was &#34;one of those flying wings&#34; speaking of some multi-engine aircraft at that time that looked like wings.  As it cleared the trees we realized it was a &#34;flying saucer&#34; and the sound had changed to a high pitched hum.  We watched in awe as it came slowly over the road and over the house beside us on our left or west side.  It was very low and not moving much faster than a person can walk.  We jumped up and jumped off the porch and walked beside the house watching it as it moved over that house and than just stopped and hovered over the back yard of that house.  The hum changed to a hum like an electric motor, as I remember standing there in our back yard and staring up at the huge craft.  It was a round thick disk with three or four little blue lights on the side I could see.  It had a big dome on top of the disk and it had a few amber lights around it about a third of the way up.  It looked to be about a hundred feet across the disk, and maybe fifty feet high. It was about five hundred feet up an! d maybe a hundred feet west of us. (The reason I can describe the size so accurately is, I went back there several years ago and stood in the same place and looked the same way I did that night, and it was almost as if I was reliving that night. And I figured out the size and altitude than.) It was a dull gray color and the moon made it look very dark underneath. The odd thing was, the moon didn’t reflect off the dome in any way that I could see. The craft just sat there motionless, as we stood there looking it over. I wasn’t afraid of it at all, I was fascinated as I watched it. There was something about it that seemed to make a weird sensation in my body. After what seemed an eternity, which in reality was probably around a minute, the sound changed to a high pitched hum and than it seemed to get out of the sounds that a human can hear. The craft started to move up and back a little to the northwest at a very steep angle, slowly at first and that it left so fast that it was gone in about two seconds. I remember as it was going out of sight I saw a red light blink somewhere on it. I can remember the feelings that I had as it disappeared; I felt as if I’d just lost my best friend! I was excited, but I had a empty feeling! Now the weird part is, my brother and I have talked this over several times during our lives, and we remember the same things until the craft stopped. His version is quite different than mine up until it started to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well anyhow, that changed my life! I knew that everything that I’d been taught in church and history was wrong. Whenever I mentioned the damn thing to one of my friends, they thought I was crazy! So I quit talking about it. My brother and I didn’t even talk about it! That experience did something to me, I have thought about it daily all my life! It has caused me a lot of problems! I’m going to cut here as I don’t think the rest of this testimony has any information on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have held several significant positions since my retirement.  I say this knowing that my pedigree may mean nothing to my credibility once this story has been told.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While returning from upstate NY, and heading south along the parkway, we saw a large, lighted object in the distance, hovering over the Throggs Neck Bridge.  We all thought it was a blimp. As we got onto the bridge the object, remaining stationery, was clearly visible as a flying saucer.  It was above the center of the bridge with a span that was much greater than the width of the bridge. Around its center were white lights, revolving in a counter clockwise manner. The ship was silent.  All passengers in EVERY other car, were looking at the craft, even the drivers!  It was amazing that no one caused an accident that night.  We were also motioning to one another to confirm that they saw what we saw, and they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we were just under the ship, it went from hovering over the bridge to gliding along a path that followed the parkway to the Northern State (I believe) and turned east and followed the lighted road out to Suffolk County where it turned south and flew along the path of the Oyster Bay Expressway and out of sight.  It was as if it was intrigued by the traffic and the lights of the cars and the roadways it was above.  Until it sped off towards the southern portion of Long Island, it was cruising at speeds comparable to our cars&#39; speeds. Then it darted off so fast as to become a blip in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were times while we followed it that it darted up and down and east and west but did not deviate from the overall path I described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we arrived home we called up the Suffolk County A/F base and Newsday.  Neither confirmed any other contact by others or that they had tracked anything on any Radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and our 3 other passengers all spoke about what we had witnessed and, to this day, 45 years later, we still know that what we saw was a huge saucer shaped object, capable of unbelievable maneuvering and great speeds.  We are convinced it was other worldly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were there other accounts in the area during the time I described (actually it was the first weekend of the month of September &#39;64 and we were bringing a friend up to Albany State College to begin college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I was startled by the fact that with the flickering of the meteor I also heard a buzzing / sizzling / sputtering sound.  I was shocked when I realized that the object must have been miles away yet I was hearing it as it flickered and the intensity of the sound followed the flickering exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, I discovered that this is a documented phenomenon that is reportedly caused by a electromagnetic coupling of the em given off by the meteor with the observers hearing system without any perceptible sound being transferred from the meteor to the observers ear,  I beleive it is refered to as &#34;ElectroPhonic Meteor&#34; effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> see: http://www.meteorobs.org/bagnall/audible.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We saw it again moving slowly from left to right at about the speed of a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had lights which appeared to circle the craft.  They were about the size of lights on a blimp but were not letters.  Letters would have been easily read as low as it was positioned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really convinced us that it wasn&#39;t a blimp was that after about 30 seconds of moving after we got to the balcony, it suddenly took off directly away from us and was out of sight within 5 seconds.
