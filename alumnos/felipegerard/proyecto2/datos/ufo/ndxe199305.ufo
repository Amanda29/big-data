I had seen a few meteors streak the sky every once in a while and watched a satellite move by.  Then, I saw a big slow fireball coming toward my direction (from east to west) then going where the porch roof blocked the view overhead. I thought how weird a meteor could be that slow and big. I got out of my chair and looked weset over the roof and saw the fireball finally disappear in the night sky which I thought nothing more of.  THEN a day or two later the union bulletin (our local paper) had a story with pics of a crop circle in walla walla.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may be alluding to the crop circle that appeared in a wheat field on a north facing hillside, just south of Kennewick, WA, which is believed to have first appeared on, or about, Saturday morning of the Memorial Day weekend in 1993.  I will attempt to confirm the date.  PD))<n>

Very shiny exterior with what looked to be windows on the sides. Flying low (appox. 800-900ft). Moved fairly slow about halfway across my field of view, then sped up and vanished. When the object sped up, it made a relatively quiet (zooming) sound.  There was a slight green glow around the object. very strange. The stragest thing Ive ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

T ere is an area close to our houses where at the time there was some development going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This spot is nestled in the foothills. We were admiring the sillouette of the mountains against the dark blue sky.All of a sudden a tear shaped object flying pointed end forward skimmed barely over the crest of the mountain.The front portion of the craft was glowing in a blue/purple color while the rear of the craft pulsed in a peach color.It left a slight trail but made no sound.It flew directly across the sky and into a small cloud.The amazing thing was that the speed it was traveling at,it never came out of the other side of the cloud.We stood there shocked and amazed not breathing.Finally one of us broke the silence by yelling &#34;WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT&#34;. We sat there and talked about it for two hours hoping we would see it again.Upon arriveing home(about two miles away)my little sister and my neighbors son were sittin in the yard.They described seeing the same object at the same time we saw it only they were directly under the cloud it flew into. They said it disappeared in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I cannot possibly begin to put it all in this little space. PLEASE go to my site I put down there and just read my diary. At the request of Dr.John Mack, (a ufo reseacher)who I went to see when he gave a talk in KC, I went and got tested at the KU Med Center in Kansas City, where they had a UFO research dept there, headed up by Dr. Fowler Jones (who will verify this) Everything I have on my site is true, but unfortunately, I do not have any pics. I have had numerous abduction experiences as a result of all this. My checkmarks are only for the first one that I saw.<n>

It was one of those nights where the fog was sitting just above the tops of the buildings, not on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There in the fog I saw lights in the shape of a triangle, hovering just above me in the fog.  The triangle was large maybe about 10 ft per side.  I ran back in the house with the dog and told my oldest son to come out with me fast so he could see it, we left the dog in the house and went back down to the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle light was still there, we stood there n the middle of the crosswalk staring up at the sky.  For the next several minutes we watched what is somewhat difficult to describe, other than it reminded me of something you might see when dealing with special effects on television, (computers now), but that&#39;s not how I would have described it then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle divided itself in half smoothly without a break in the light, into two triangles, always touching at some point, as they seemed to roll along the others side, before dividing again turning into three then four, almost dancing off of each other.  The lights where bright blues and reds, always changing. It was like watching nothing I have ever seen from anything that I know could be in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing there fixated on these lights, we heard some neighbors come out of the apartment just a few doors down on F street, seeing us standing there staring up into the sky, we heard them laugh and say something to the matter of, &#34;what the hell are they doing?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head and looked at them, there were two people there, and at that point they had looked up, the next thing I heard was, &#34; Holly ((word deleted)),&#34; as they too saw the lights in the sky, and then out of no where the lights vanished and it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing about this event, was years later my youngest son when he was somewhere between 8 to 11 years old, told me he remembered as an infant being visited by what he would later know as aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having very vivid memory&#39;s myself as early as 2 years of age about just life, normal stuff, I am inclined to believe him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was moving a NE to SW direction in front of me, I was standing facing north.  AS THE Light crossed in front of me, I noticed that it had a dull or Dark color and that it was &#34;Triangle shape.  There was no sound,but it was really big!  In fact,it really scared ((deleted)) me!!! As it got close to where I was standing, all the lights went out.The lights were originaly white,like car headlights, or more like aircraft landing lights.  I fly,so I know what they look like.<n>

Suddenly my daughter said &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;. Looking over my shoulder there was an oval light source approx. 30 ft in diameter about 40 - 50 feet above our house. It was not transparent as it blotted out the star field. As soon as both of us were focused on it the object elongated and streaked due north toward Minneapolis (40 mi away). It vanished over the horizon in 2-3 seconds. I served 2 1/2 yrs in the 2d Marine Air Wing and have experience w/aircraft of all types.  This was unknown. At no time did it fall to the earth..but traveled a parallel path w/ the terrain.<n>

Then the others started to do the same but in differrent directions. At this piont I felt that I was in mortal danger and just writing about this makes me very shaky and scared as if it just happend 5 minutes ago.   I ran to get witnesses and no one would come, they did not belive me. It was like a movie. I had to see this once in a lifetime event to the end, so I ran back outside to see what they were going to do next. All the objects that are scaning the area are still doing so, I felt that they were watching me and I was very scared and helpless. After watching them for a few more minutes, they all came back togather like a fleet just as fast as they split up, at this point they all shot straight up at such a speed that no human could live through. I&#39;ve lived with this all this time and I had no way to prove it, but if I could take a lie detector test and be hipnotized, you will get the truth. I don&#39;t know if anyone else saw these things in the sky that night because I never talked about it again in fear that I would be seen as crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel and just know that they were watching me and there is nothing I or anyone else could do about it. I hope we all get some answers and I hope I life long enough to see that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated probably is approximate.  PD))<n>

Straight ahead, to our left, we witnessed two diamond shaped red lights just above the tree line.  It was nearing sundown, but still well-lit daytime.  We found the nearest parking lot - the Hilltop Orchards on Rt. 1 - and watched events from our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From the parking lot, we were facing south.  The lights were directly ahead of us.  They were two objects, both identical, a good distance apart.  Each object had two distinct red triangular lights, and no noticable frame or body. The two lights on each craft alternated luminescence.  The object looked a little like this: &lt;&gt;, with each of the carats being a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved toward each other VERY slowly, blinking out of synch with each other.  After about seven minutes or so, the two objects met each other, and actually appeared to COMBINE, forming an object closer to a disc (of the same size) with four rotating red lights: &lt;<n><n>&gt;.  At this point, the object moved much faster, and dissappeared to the right of our view.  We got into our car and drove to the exit 56 onramp of I-95 in the hopes of catching up with it, but had no luck.  The craft dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

No sound.  It had colored lights that did not seem to be lighting up the surrounding area.  It was gliding very slowly about 100 feet above the trees behind our house.  Both my son and I witnessed the event in different parts of the house but did not discuss it for years.  I could not see the shape from the angle I saw it.  &#34;My thoughts at the time were, wow!!! that&#39;s big.  I can&#39;t do anything about that&#34; so I went back to bed.  It was surreal to me.  I was somewhat relieved when people started to report similar sightings many years later.  It wasn&#39;t what I had heard being reported at the time - not saucer shaped etc.  I am a school teacher and my son was about 8 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It might have been several craft in a straight line, but I&#39;m not sure.  It didn&#39;t have any beacon lights. The color of the lights was white or yellow, but I don&#39;t remember exactly.  At the time, I was 9.  Don&#39;t think that I was young and made a mistake, I was sure of what I saw, because my friend saw it too.  He was 10.  We both were at an astronomy night at my school, and we were the only ones that saw it, as far as we know.  It was visible to the naked eye.  It was either very large, or very close.  Since it was at night, it was hard to tell how large or far it was.  It was just hovering, and we were watching it from the north, so it was south of us. we were on an asphault campus maybe 80-100 yards north to south.  We spotted the UFO over a tree that was about 100 yards away, and maybe 50 feet high.  From our view, the thing was as long as the tree is wide (including the branches).  About 10 seconds of watching it, it started moving west, but made a zigzag, and moved east, somewhat downward, until it disappeared behind some trees and buildings.  I seemed a little slow, but if it was as large as a Boeing 747, it was moving a little faster than a 747 5 miles from the runway.  I have another sighting, but it isn&#39;t mine, so I just want to say, my dad and brother saw the same thing almost exactly 3 years later, only it moved a little faster. It was near the same spot too, only a block away.<n>

There were approximately 10-20 of us all around the area. It&#39;s been more than 10 years, so I&#39;ll do my best at decribing what I can remember. I only just found this site today (07/19/04).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in Sedona at the time, and my friends and I loved to go hiking whenever we could. We had heard many stories of UFO&#39;s, but most there had never witnessed any personally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of my closest friends and I were inside the van which was parked at the top of Shnebley (sp?)or as close as we could get. There was a sort of pseudo rocky parking lot which we used as a &#34;base&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember the exact time, but it was near dusk and I was inside the van with a few friends. All of a sudden someone pulled open the sliding door and screamed, &#34;you&#39;ve got to come see this....there are some strange things going on out here!&#34;  So, of course, we all piled out and walked to the end of the &#34;parking lot&#34;, looking towards the major rock formations directly across from us (I can&#39;t remember the name of the certain formation now). They were all pointing across the way to what looked like two black helicoptors which were looking like they were &#34;guarding&#34; either side of this strange rock formation. This is so hard to explain, I wish I could remember the name of the rock...you&#39;d know exactly how it was set up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WEll, just then, the middle flat front face of this rock formation all of a sudden disappeared while the black helicoptors just &#34;stood guard&#34; on either side of the &#34;cave&#34; and UFO&#39;s stared flying out of the new formed &#34;cave&#34;. The UFO&#39;s were fling very erraticly, hard to count or follow a certain one. They continued to zip about until all were out of the &#34;cave&#34;. Then in a flash they were here, then there, then zap! gone! no where to be seen! Then, the rock face closed back up and the black helicoptors waited a few minutes and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us were stunned, needless to say. We didn&#39;t know what to think and all of us had our own descriptions of what we saw, but we all agreed that we had witnessed something none of us could explain. All of us all felt an unnatural &#34;buzzing&#34; like a different frequency disturbing the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the next few months of living there, I encountered many sightings of black helicopters, strange stories of &#34;government men in black&#34; turning away hikers in certain areas and caves, and even a strange underground explosion, or earthquake, or something...(none who were with me ever heard anything in the news about an earthquake or explosion underground in the Sedona area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still don&#39;t know exactly what we all saw, but it was definitely something all of us witnessed that we had never before imagined or could deny.<n>

As we passed over a slight hill after rounding a bend, I noticed on the right hand side of the road, behind some trees an array of lights and what appeared to be a large triangular shape.  It looked very bright and as I was looking at it rose up above the trees and basically vanished.  When I say vanished, i did not see it actually go anywhere, it just wasn;t there any more.  I drove on for about 2 miles without saying anything to my friend, then asked him if he had &#39;seen that&#39; he agreed that he had and that it was the same shape etc.  I would estimate the size to be around that of two double decker buses on top of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I could see the space between the lights all the lights were equally spaced they looked like the lit windows on a airplane and they are arranged in two rows there are no lights on the belly only on the sides. I think  it must be a mile above our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should tell you that this particular area is small rural area no big buildings, lot of vegetation but Indian air-force flights frequently fly in this area as a part of exercises but this one is too big for a jet fighter and there are somany lights on it and shaped like disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was walking , I noticed a very large cigar shaped craft in the sky approx. 10,000 - 20,000 feet up in the air.  It was heading east over Lake Erie at an incredible rate of speed. I watched it for a few minutes to make sure I was actually seeing this. It was an enormous craft, much larger than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen, I presume it would dwarf a B-52 bomber ten fold. I could not see any wings or windows on this craft. It made no audible sound. Upon sighting this craft I yelled for my other 2 co-workers to come and see this craft. They ran outside and spied it just as it left our field of vision. Within 30 minutes went outside to watch a very large helicopter, unmarked and solid grey, with a very large gun fly over our area heading northeast to Lake Erie. For the next 3 months we witnessed Apache helicopters flying patrols along the lake, always flying east, 3 helicopters in each patrol. After a few months the patrols stopped and we never heard or witnessed anything else out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  The &#34;gun&#34; on the U. S. Navy helicopter may have been a refueling probe, which projects forward from the fuselage a considerable distance, so that a refueling hose does not interfere with the main rotor.  PD))<n>

I remember it was very warm that night,  so I would say it was late spring or early summer.  I walked out of my apartment to go to work.  I was looking east.  I noticed the sky was very clear and you could see all the stars perfectly, so naturally I was looking at the sky as I walked to my car.  I noticed a group of three lights come over the hill.  To those that know the area it seemed like they were about over Fancher Heights.  It seemed like they were pretty high.  They glowed what I call amber or orange like in color.  Having seen many planes fly over I&#39;d say there speed was a lot faster than a plane.   Planes  take what seems like a full minute to go from horizon to horizon these or this took about  6 to 8 seconds. I say this because I don&#39;t know if it was one craft or three.  They flew in a perfect triangle shaped pattern all the way across the sky flying west.   When they got over the Saddle Rock horizon line they all of the sudden separated and then darted in and out and around each other.  Then just as quickly they formed the triangle shape they were in originally and kept going west over the hill.  What made me post this now in 2010 is a picture and video I just saw of the Phoenix lights, because it looked just like them.  The objects made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I suggested that we take the two older boys along with thier mom to go spot deer with a halogen light that pluged into the lighter of the car.. we drove past the open meadow ont he mountain top and after spotting the deer, we decided to turn around at the cliffside past the meadow. As I attemped a K-turn pointing the car out to the night sky and the dropoff of the mountain, the car filled up with a bright light, bigger than the windshield. I covered my eyes as one of the boys asked &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;, and I replied &#34;it&#39;s a campers lantern&#34;, then my next memory is driving back to camp, around 1/8th of a mile from where we turned..but no one remembers the turn finishing, including me who was driving, and what happened to the light?. We returned to find ((deleted)) jumping up from the fire to tell us aobut this huge white light in the sky, we told him we saw it in front of us. Nothing was ever mentioned again. From that time my life took a differnt road and i became a hypnotherapist. The encounter was still bothering me, I couldn&#39;t believe that I would give a stupid answer &#34;a campers lantern&#34;. My logical mind was not accepting this. So, till I took one of the boys camping with me to the same area in 1998. . i took ((deleted)), who was 9 at the time of the encounter. I regressed ((deleted)) back to the time of the sighting and this is what he said &#34;It&#39;s a bright light, bluish in the center, it&#39;s an energy, it&#39;s pushing us back up the mountain, we&#39;re not supposed to remember&#34; he repeated this over a few times. ((deleted)) on the other hand does not remember telling us about the light. Me, ((dleted)), ((deleted)) and ((deleted)) were in the car, and either ((deleted)) or((deleted)) are willing to talk aobut it.. something is making them dismiss it, they admit they saw something, but they dont&#39; care what it was.. I find this very odd.<n>

The object was greyish pewter color &amp; had very small twinkling lights all around it.  As we passed under &amp; away from this object I slowed down &amp; pulled over ( My son screaming &amp; hollering that they want to take us) He&#39;s always claimed this. He was about 10 at the time &amp; refuses to discuss this even now, But as we were looking back maybe few seconds passed &amp; it just left in a flash &amp; I do mean FLASH that all we saw was a blurr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
