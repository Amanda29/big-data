Mountain Top, Pa<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please note that I reported this on another site not too long ago and realized my date was wrong.  I was in 7th grade so it would have been 1976, not 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched an object which at first appeared to be a helicopter in the dusk coming down toward our field.  As it came closer, you realized it wasn&#39;t a helicopter since it didn&#39;t make a sound.  Lights rotated in a triangular pattern.  White and red I believe.  I can just remember how large it was and that it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered over our field and lowered itself to our tree lines.  We ran inside and hid in fright but two of my family members stayed outside for a little bit until after fear they ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was as if it was going to land on top of our house and I can remember seeing dark heavy metal with the rotating lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As sudden as it came it started to climb up because my siblings called us upstairs.  We watched it move up into the stars and veer off in the direction of northwest.  We had our eyes glued on it until it blended into the distant stars in the sky and you could barely see a difference between the two.<n>
5/30/76 18:00|Mountaintop|PA|Cigar|11 minutes?|Seven  teens see nioseless cigar ufo & one reports a swirl of light that stops 1 foot in front of her.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51790.html|2|ndxe197605| Seven  teens see nioseless cigar ufo &amp; one reports a swirl of light that stops 1 foot in front of her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the spring of 1976, in my backyard in Northeast Pennsylvania, I saw a UFO. I was around 13 and had been outside with my brother and five other kids. Something told me to run to the bottom of the yard. This is an old railroad town and the lot my house was on was 80X150.   We had been playing in the middle of the yard so I thought it was strange my brain was telling me to go to the back of the yard. But I listened and walked to the  bottom of the yard and stood there. The other kids said, “What are you doing?” I told them I don’t know and stood there looking around asking myself why was I suppose to walk down here. Then my brain said, &#34;Look over this way.&#34;  I looked to the left (east) and there I saw half a spot light that seemed to come right out of the mountain top. It was moving in an upward direction, not forward, from a forested area, about 1/4th mile away. This was the beginning of my UFO experience that still disturbs me to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as this light rose slightly above the tree tops and turned into a circle. It then proceeded to move forward in my direction. I called the other kids to come see it. They ran down to where I was and we watched this light slowly come right for us. As it got closer I could see two lights, one on top of the other. I thought it was a helicopter, but couldn’t see any blades or anything beyond these lights. There was no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these lights kept coming right at us, the other kids ran. It appeared that a helicopter was going to land right in our yard. I was the littlest and as I ran up the yard the lights made a turn as if to follow. The other kids were way ahead of me. I could see the blades of grass, this was before dusk.  I made a turn while I was running to go in front of an old garage and to see where the lights went. There above and slightly next to an old oak tree, about 20 feet from the garage, sat a cigar shaped object..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stopped in mid run with one foot in front of the other and my arms spread out. I was frozen. I wanted to turn around and see where the other kids went. I couldn’t. I couldn’t talk. I was petrified and curious at the same time. The last I saw or heard of the other kids besides my brother that night was then when I heard, “Do you see that?!” I couldn’t believe how the biggest thing in my yard, and old six foot round oak tree, was dwarfed by this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be made of   brownish, semi-shiny metal. It was not completely smooth. I could see a mottled pattern all over this thing, like you see on some copper or brass ware. There were two triangular lights on the center bottom, facing away from each other, one red, one yellow. It had to be at least 70 feet long and 40 feet across. I stood frozen, trying to figure out what it was. There was no noise at all. The trees leaves right under this thing didn’t move at all. There was no heat trail behind it. It just was there, not moving at all like a blimp or helicopter would do. I searched for seams and rivets and bolts, there were none. My brain said this is not natural. So I stood there frozen with my mind racing to explain this thing. Our dog made no noise and hid in the garage.  If I had taken about 8 more steps, I would have been directly under this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a light opened up from the bottom middle of this object and hit the ground. It was about a 2 feet round, very clean looking spot light. I could see the blades of grass under this thing clearly from the light. This light slowly started to go in a clockwise directional swirl. It was as if it was looking for something. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I realized if the swirl keeps going and getting wider, it will hit me. I was still frozen and had the feeling like they knew I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were the only thing I could move and I watched this spot light on the ground. This light stopped 1 foot in front of my extended foot. I couldn’t move. It was a round circle of light about 2 feet across. I felt like this thing was getting information from me, like when a dog sniffs for information. I had no clue what this light would do to me. My brain raced with ideas that it could burn me, that little people were going to get me, that army men were going to drop out of this thing on a rope, that this thing was going to drop out the sky and blow up and kill me because I was so close to it  then the light just pulled back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I was slightly relieved and could move again. I turned to run up my yard away from this thing and I noticed I could no longer see the blades of grass, it was very dark. I thought this is strange.  I could here my brother up a head of me running too. I watched over my shoulder as this huge object went backwards a tiny bit and then pulled forward. I was afraid it was going to follow me but it turned back east and slowly went back to the exact spot it had came from and went back down below the trees, not over the trees, but down into the trees.  Sometimes, airplanes can look like they are going up when they are coming toward you from a mountainside, I have seen that. This object didn’t appear to come from over the horizon, or on leaving, did it appear to go over the horizon. On both cases, it appeared to come up from and go down into the horizon. I found this strange because there would be nothing but woods at that spot with no clearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I bolted into the house and told my parents what we had seen. I felt like I had walked into a staged scene. My father was sitting in the kitchen with the paper covering his face. My mother was standing in the kitchen wiping her hands with a towel. She was wearing an old apron. She never wore aprons. My father usual sat in the living room with the paper. They did not get excited. My mother slowly went and looked out the window. She said she didn’t see anything. Here were 2 kids, breathing heavy, and scared, and these people didn’t seem upset. They were good parents so to this day, I am perplexed. Maybe my adrenaline was pumped up high and slowing everything down, or maybe it was staged, I don’t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I learned quickly after that that no one really believes these stories. So I just learned to stop talking about it. I had seen one silver saucer high in the sky before while with about 10 other kids. I haven’t seen anything like this cigar shaped object. I am now 43 and still can’t answer my own questions concerning this incident.  I am Irish/Indian ancestry, novicane challenged, and quite often like to watch sky in big areas. I do believe this object picked up a bad gene I have for low blood pressure and left me alone because of that. Please add my experience to your data base and leave out my name I guess. Since it’s an older case I didn’t know if you would want it put into the online additions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have other questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why would this thing have to pull back a little bit to move forward?  That sounds like man made directional flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What where the small indentations, mottled appearance for? I have never heard these mentioned in a UFO description before?  This incident was one of the first in my life that made me realize, my parents can’t protect me from the world. But I’ve ruled out some type of subconscience trick my mind played on me because there were 7 people who saw this thing. How my parents didn’t see it out of the big kitchen bay window I don’t know. And why my mother was wearing an apron is one of the biggest questions. That was strange. Ironically though, the old oak was the same tree I had been knocked out by when I was about 6, in a bad sledding accident. When I came to, I was on the couch and sweating terribly with my coat still on, and my mother watching. So I estimate I had to be unconscience for at least 20 minutes to be that hot. Odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was definitely a physical object.  But after almost 30 years, I have no clue! When I was in kindergarten to about fourth grade, I would have this recurring dream where a space ship lands in the playground at school. The whole school population is there, teachers and kids. These little men come out and want to talk but no one steps forward. For some reason, I was always the only one who could talk to these little men. They were the same size as me and friendly, not scary. So in this recurring dream, I would have to be the one they talked with. I would walk up by the ship and start talking and then I would wake up.  I could never understand why no one else could talk with them. My present alien dreams involve wars being raged above our heads, where humans are hurt because they are in the way of fighting aliens. Very strange. So I remain clueless after 30 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Months ago I observed six red lights from about a distance of 15 miles from an overlook. These lights just seemed to hover around a nuclear power plant cooling tower. They would move a little and then stop.   Then after about 15 minutes they just all formed a line and went west. I’ve never heard of 6 helicopters inspecting a cooling tower at one time have you? I was just glad they didn’t come by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It did not move across the sky, rather it disappered and reappeared in a different part of the sky instantaneously. It disappeared/reappeared twice. There was no sound, no wind,a new Moon, no other lights were seen that night. This event occurred at approx. 23:00 hours PDT. The white light in the sky (UFO) emitted a triangular beam of light down to the ground like an extremely bright searchlight beam which lit up the entire mountainside like daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we tried to to &amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; from the view of the object, it would move to realign itself with our line-of-sight. I used a flashlight to send a Morse Code message to the object, but there was no response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When last viewed, the object appeared to be descending from an altitude of 4000-500 ft. to an altitude of 1000-2000 ft. about 1 mile away when it disappeared behing the tree line. Lattitude=38°54&#39;34.49&amp;quot; / Longitude=120° 2&#39;42.30&amp;quot;W<n>

Approx 100 feet above my head. Silent and stationary.  Another floted towards this object andn attached its self to the other.  A corrcctions officer who drove by made a statement.  He said if ,&#34;If those things come together,&#34;  When they did he told me to get into the car and we sped off.  He also told me not to say anything because we may be thought of as nuts<n>
5/17/76 02:00|Ridgefield|CT|Unknown|10-15 minutes|Saw individuals that were not human.|12/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33415.html|5|ndxe197605| Saw individuals that were not human.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occured at what was then the Casagmo Apartments in Ridgefield (1976)  My (ex)wife and I were asleep - it was early Spring and the large sliding window was partly open (an inch or two).  A loud buzzing noise woke me (I remember covering my head with a pillow).  I realized that the buzzing seemed to come from inside my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the window and saw what I thought were 3 electrical company employees (linesmen) at the far side of the parking lot (less than 100 feet from my view).  I thought they were electrical linesmen because they had their backs to me and appeared to be wearing hard hats (vey shiny hard hats that looked like chrome). Each was dressed oddly (I say this because they appeared to be wearing dark &#34;wet suits&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each looked to have on &#34;mittens&#34; as I saw only a &#34;thumb&#34; and what looked to be a mitten like glove. Each of the individuals looked to be 5 feet tall or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said quietly to my wife &#34;what the hell are these idiots doing out there in the middle of the night?&#34;  The 3 were clearly visible because they were illuminated by an overhead light source.  One &#34;individual&#34; was looking up into the tree line, another was looking very intently at the ground and the third was looking around almost as if keeping a watch.  I continued standing at the window behind a very large, potted philodendron plant that we kept in the bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three individuals suddenly turned as if they were given a command (right face) and faced directly at the window where I was standing. (Please understand that the bedroom was on the second floor and we had not turned on any lights nor made any noise to attract attention - the buzzing was still quite loud at this point).  I felt immediately uncomfortable and crouched down behind the plant.  As the individuals turned toward me, it appeared that one of them had a reflective stripe running down his pant leg (much like the satin stripe on tuxedo trousers).  The helmets were no longer visible from the front (only slightly around the perimeter of their heads - for lack of a better description - like an ancient Egyptian headdress).  They had unusually large reflective goggles over their eyes (or unusually large reflective eyes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my (ex)wife to please take a look.  She got out of bed and came to the window.  My recollection is that the 3 individuals then turned to their right again (all at the same moment).  They all walked as if they were in a strobe light.  Two went out of my field of vision (behind the maitenance garage in the parking lot) and one simply &#34;disappeared&#34; from the open field.  The overhead light and the buzzing stoppeed at the moment the last individual &#34;disappeared&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not tell my Ex what I saw but asked her what she had seen.  Her description to me was the same as what I witnessed.  She, however, described them as walking away in &#34;slow motion&#34; and she was also unclear as to what happened to the third individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to bed.  The night was clear prior to the incident but it did rain after the incident.  In the morning, I went out behind the garage to see if there were a light source.  There was a fixture but it had not spot light bulbs in it.  There were no marks on the ground.  I saw no craft and maitained that if it had gone forward, backward or up I would have seen it so it could only have gone into the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned the incident only to my closest friend who insisted that I get the number for UFO Locater and call them to report it.  After 2 weeks, I relented and went to the Ridgefield police and got the UFO Locator 800 number from them.  I reported the incident to Locator and asked if anyone else had seen or reported anything unusual that night.  They told me that there had been 26 reports for that same night from Katoonah, NY to Danbury, CT (along the power grid and fault line - which I never knew existed).  They subsequently called to interview me about the sighting.  When I told them the craft could only have gone &#34;down into the ground or I would have seen it&#34; they asked me if I thought that it could have gone to another dimension or time.  I had not considered that possibility and said so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The memory is still vivid after nearly 27 years.  It was suggested to me that I submit to hypnosis to see if I could recall more.  I did in 1981 and had kept a copy of the tape that was made.  I heard myself yelling about the individuals looking closely into my face - yelling about their eyes and yelling for help because I was outside of my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have rarely shared this information with anyone.  My Ex Wife refused to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/16/76 20:00|Newtown|CT|Fireball|5 minutes|meteor like object about 20 feet from us|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42195.html|6|ndxe197605| meteor like object about 20 feet from us<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern,  For many years I have told the story of a UFO which approached me when I was 5 or 6 years old. No one has taken me seriously because I was so young and could not recall the exact year though I know it was 1975 0r 1976. I remember it was 8pm and my brother and I were having a stick fight (like a sword duel) outside of the house when my Mother (now deceased) went into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were playing I noticed a light in the sky and pointed it out to my brother. Within a blink of an eye it was close to 200 feet away from our road and then it dipped down and hovered over our driveway in front of us. Now it was about 20 feet away from us and it looked like a meteor with craters and it changed from orange to white then to red. It was about the size of a volkswagen bug. It hovered there for a couple minutes and made no sound, absolutely silent. I asked my brother what it was and he said he didn&#39;t know. My brother was 7 or 8 years old at the time, but I recall the UFO better than him. I asked my brother, what if aliens come out of it? That&#39;s when we ran to our door which seemed to be locked. My Mom opened the door and said it wasn&#39;t locked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never saw the UFO again but I recall not getting much sleep that night. Years later I looked in the Newtown Bee (a local newspaper) for articles about it, because others had been witnessing UFOs at the same time, I came up empty handed. I knew it was in the paper because my Mom told my brother and I that it was published. I know I don&#39;t recall dates and ages well but the UFO itself was real and I remember it like it was yesterday. I hope this helps others who may have witnessed the same object in Newtown. I know it WASN&#39;T a meteor because it would have made quite an impact in our driveway. I now live in a different location not too far from the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a luminescent quality similar to an oval fluorescent bulb, the center of which would change intensity and color. The object appeared to be fairly close to us and I would guess the diameter to be about fifty to one hundred feet.  The object never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along the road other cars were pulled over and the occupants were staring at it along with us. I asked a person that was staring at it near us what they thought it was?  He didn&#39;t answer me, he had a strange look on his face almost like he couldn&#39;t believe what he was witnessing.He never did answer me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the object went from white to yellow to a reddish yellow over a few minutes or so.

5/1/76 20:00|Coventry|RI|Formation|3min|red orbs 'dancing' around a central orb|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37535.html|14|ndxe197605| red orbs &#39;dancing&#39; around a central orb<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since my sighting was nearly thirty years ago,my recollection is somewhat fuzzy,but i shall do my best to describe my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my 2 year-old son had gone shopping at K-MART.Upon leaving the shopping center i approached and stopped at a stop light.While waiting for the light to change,i observed a round red light approximately 100 feet above and behind the stop light.While looking at the light,it instantly became three red lights,which seemed to &#34;dance&#34;(for lack of a better word)around one another.The &#39;dance&#39; seeemed to be well choreographed,one red light was stationary in a center position while two lights manouvered up,down,around,behind and in front of the center light.Then the two &#39;dancing&#39; lights merged with the central light and were gone.That&#39;s it gone,no sudden taking off,no streaking of lights, just POOF, gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this seemed to occur within a 30 to 45 second time span,as the light changed from red to green.However,my observace of this spectacle, in my mind,was at least 3 to 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i recovered my senses,taking off from the light,i had an inner dialogue with myself, trying to reconcile what i knew i saw to what i thought could not be.Although i lived just one mile from K-MART,i passed up my house and went to my parent&#39;s home fifteen miles away.I didn&#39;t know why, i only knew i did not want to be alone.I was wired,i mean i was so up,so jittery,so energetic i could not be still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once i was seated with Mom,i was immediately calm,even mellow.I had not recounted my sighting,but as we chatted,a replay of my sighting was constantly going through my mind,sort of like background music.I wanted and intended to tell Mom what i had experienced,however,i never did .I don&#39;t know why,it was an eerie feeling,my sighting being foremost on my mind and not speaking of it.Why was that???????? I know to this day that what i saw was real and not of this world.I sure would like to know if anyone out there has experienced similar sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting occurred summer of &#39;76 in Coventry,R.I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

5/1/76 16:00|Eastland|TX||10 minutes|eagle shaped with detailed coloring|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48734.html|15|ndxe197605| eagle shaped with detailed coloring<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only about 4 years old, but I remember it well.  Me, my sister (8 years old at the time), my grandmother, granddad, mother and stepfather were out in the front yard at my granddad&#39;s house.  It was early evening and there were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember, as do all that were there, looking just above the big pecan tree and seeing a giant (the size of two 747s) eagle that was made out of what it seemed like to be metal.  It a light on the end of the beak and around the wings and on the tail.  It was solid...meaning that the wings did not flap.  It&#39;s head was turned to where looking up, all you could see was one eye.  The color was very detailed and there was no sound.  It just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all were standing there in awe looking at the eagle when my granddad started yelling at us to get in the house and go to the closet.  The last thing I remember was running into the closet and everyone was crying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stepfather started to close the door and everyone started yelling for granddad.  My stepfather said that he would go get him and he closed the door.  That&#39;s the last thing I remember.   What I do remember, I remember very vividly...as do all that were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That very next Christmas, my granddad built a huge cross  that the entire town could see for years to come.  He lined it in white lights and put it in the yard right where we were standing that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the years after that day, when we would try to discuss it with granddad, he ALWAYS cut us short and refused to discuss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve NEVER heard of a UFO sighting like this in my life.  I&#39;ve looked everywhere on the web as well as the UFO museum in Roswell.  I know what we saw was real.  We all remember very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were 2 craft, one in the shape of a diamond and the other in the shape of 0=0  like the old time barbells.  I remember pointing up and saying to my freinds, look there.  After watching them for a couple minutes, they drifted behind the clouds and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
