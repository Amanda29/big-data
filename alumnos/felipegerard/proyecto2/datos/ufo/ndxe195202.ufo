2/17/52 18:00|Nellis AFB (Las Vegas)|NV|Disk|30 mins|We are dealing with something very real.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39861.html|1|ndxe195202| We are dealing with something very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was observed from the control tower of Nellis AFB by this writer and an assistant control operator and and base operations officer, who came up to the tower stating that had been flooded with calls from Las Vegas, a city 10 miles South of the field, telling him that a strange object was buzzing the city. He asked what aircraft were in the air. We replied that all aircraft were on the ground, except for a F86 fighter jet that was inbound from March AFB, Riverside California that was due in in about 45 mins. All eyes were trained towards Las Vegas with binoculars and saw nothing, but shortly, coming around Sunrise Mountain, which is a 5000 foot mountain located five miles East of the field, was a very silvery disc shaped aircraft about 500 feet above the ground trailing a vapor trail. We were all in awe, especially the vapor trail at that low altitude in the dry desert air and the craft was mirroring the orange sun, which was setting in the West. The craft stopped and hovered at the end of the East/West runway about a mile from the tower at about 200 feet and remained there for about twenty minutes. There is no other way to describe this object other than a very shiny disc with no other chararistics like windows, doors, antennae etc. Following the period of time that it hovered at the end of the runway, it started moving again, trailing vapor again and passed over the highway West of the field. It made three circles and a circular ring of vapor and hovered again about two miles West and the vapor dissipated. The sun now set behind the sheep mountains and the craft was no longer mirroring the setting sun, now looking like an ominous dark object. The incoming F86 was ordered to expedite and investigate the object. He descended at very high speed and approached the area. He excitedly radioed that he sees the object and locked in on it but it dissappeared very quickly&#39; The personel in the tower also observed the craft disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The writer was encourged to write this because of a recent article in the newspaper regarding a UFO Sighting by dozens of people over the towns of Orland Park, Matteson and Tinley Park. There is more to the Nevada sighting, but I believe space may be limited for the posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We have corresponded with the witness, requesting more information about the interesting case.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> You asked if I ever have been in touch with other witnesses, unfortunately I have not. I never found out the name of the operations officer who came up to the tower, but my assistant&#39;s name was ((name deleted; initials &#34;EW&#34;)) whose home was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I tried once to send letters to all ((name deleted--initials &#34;EW&#34;)) listed in Pittsburgh&#39;s telephone book, but I received no replies. Incidently, the only time element in the questionnaireI sent in that was correct was the year. The month and day was incorrect because the form wouldn&#39;t accept question marks or blanks. There was more to the story than what I submitted. Your are welcome to contact me at any time at ((telephone number deleted)).     I can tell you of other FAA Agencies that were involved in the sighting that I presented.  Respectfully,  ((name of witness deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
2/10/52 21:00|Binghamton|NY|Disk|10-15 minutes|1952 UFO  disk outside Binghamton, NY  Girls' Club stops for a look at teenage females|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43406.html|2|ndxe195202| 1952 UFO  disk outside Binghamton, NY  Girls&#39; Club stops for a look at teenage females<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was 11 years old but I will never forget it.  It was a life changing experience and I entered The University of Michigan as an astronomy major in 1958 as a direct result of fascination based on this event. It occurred at 9 pm as I was leaving the Binghamton Girls Club, at that time located at the intersection of Frederick and Liberty streets in Binghamton, NY.  We were all dismissed at 9pm so the front yard was full of girls age 9-16, about 45-60 in number, heading for home.  The date was approximate- but the moon was a crescent descending in the west. The object appeared in the southeast sky, looking like a shark&#39;s fin, or like a crescent moon cut in half by a cloud, but the sky was black, clear and cloudless.  I was fascinated by the night sky and the beautiful stars even then, so I was constantly looking up at them.  I may have been the first to notice this thing.  As I looked at it, it was self illuminated- sort of a harvest moon orange color- no lights visable.  It did the most incredible thing. As it drew closer and enlarged in size it flipped or sort of rolled over, I saw this whole thing very clearly, when it sort of turned over or revolved horizontally it appeared as a disk and approached us very quickly and stopped in the sky about 45 degrees up from the south horizon.  There was no sound at all, but the machine appeared solid, and had a series of windows (?) or port holes (?) around the middle.  I had the distinct feeling that we were being observed or scanned or something.  It was a very oppressive feeling I had never experienced before.  When someone yelled &#34;it&#39;s a flying saucer&#34; it started a stampede back into the Girl&#39;s Club door, if you can imagine a large number of teen-age girls all trying to get back into a small door all at once.  We yelled at the 2 women directors that a flying saucer was outside, they reluctantly and (too) slowly went outside.  By this time the machine had moved to the southeast and was much smaller in size, it quickly moved away in an apparent straight line becoming quickly smaller to an orange &#34;point&#34; and disappeared as it speeded away.  &#34; It&#39;s the moon &#34; said our director, but I said &#34;no&#34; and showed her the crescent moon setting in the west.  I checked the local paper next day but couldn&#39;t find report, but being very young maybe I didn&#39;t follow up on any reports.   The thing looked most like an orange football or blimp shape with those portholes around the middle, but I know it was no blimp as they make a noise and cannot approach or speed away like this thing did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
