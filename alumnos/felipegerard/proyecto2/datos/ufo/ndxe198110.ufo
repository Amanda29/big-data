10/31/81 18:00|Weed|CA|Disk|10 minutes|10/31/1981 Saucer Shaped UFO hovering between the moutain Mt. Shasta and the city of Mt. Shasta California|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70989.html|1|ndxe198110| 10/31/1981 Saucer Shaped UFO hovering between the moutain Mt. Shasta and the city of Mt. Shasta California<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in Weed, California, Siskiyou County, and heard numerous stories of UFO sightings and in particular, stories from my mother regarding &#34;St. Elmo’s Fire.&#34;  The sightings of St Elmo’s Fire were always located several miles south of Weed in an area that bordered the then Kellogg Ranch.  Located west of I-5.  My mother described St. Elmo’s fire to be as large as a car, hovering approximately 5 feet off the ground.  The color was always a brilliant emerald green mixed with red/yellow flames.  She stated that the only way you knew St. Elmo’s Fire was coming was because the air surrounding you would become charged with electricity causing the hair on your body and your head to stand up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story begins early evening October 31, 1981.  Fall was settling in and when I was growing up, November 1st always brought snow; thus, there was a coolness to the air with the smell of wood smoke.  I was newly dating someone who lived in Mt. Shasta, California and I was headed to a dinner party that friends of his were having.  Just as I approached the Kellogg Ranch area headed south on Interstate 5, (which at this date of 1981 had a McDonald’s and a hotel located on the east side of the highway) I felt the crackle of electricity in the air with it being stronger to my right, which would be due west.  I was slightly confused due to this new sensation and as I scanned left to right I saw a huge ball of emerald green fire shooting from the west headed due east about 2/10’s of a mile in front of me.  The ball of fire was as large as a sedan and approximately 5 feet off the ground; just as my mother use to describe it in her stories.  As I visually followed St. Elmo’s Fire from right to left, the mountain, Mt. Shasta was in my line of vision to the east.  To my utter amazement, there was a saucer shaped UFO hovering on the side of Mt. Shasta closest to me.  It was huge, sliver in color and slightly dipped downward on the left side of the UFO.  The UFO was located toward the base in the area we call the &#34;timberline.&#34;   As I traveled south toward Mt. Shasta, I was able to keep it in my line of vision for approximately 15 minutes and then it shot straight up in the air and disappeared.  The light during this entire sighting was bright enough for me to not misinterpret what I was seeing.  I had hoped that the UFO would remain where it was as the house I was headed for would have had a front and center view of a life time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The house where the dinner party was being given was located almost at the base of Mt. Shasta on the Everett Memorial Highway.  The house is located on the west side of the highway and Mt. Shasta High School is still located across the road from this house.  Upon entering the house everyone was excited and asked me if I had seen anything strange on my way to their home.  Because I didn’t want them to think that I was strange, I told them to tell me what they saw.  They stated that they felt a charge of electricity and when they looked out the picture window that faces Mt. Shasta, they saw a UFO and described it exactly the way I saw it.  None of us saw lights that were lit up on the UFO-could be due to the fact that it was still light outside that none were needed.  I then told them about seeing St. Elmo’s Fire and then the UFO.  My friends apprised me that, though they had never seen St. Elmo’s Fire, they had heard stories of sightings in the same area where I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four individuals that saw the UFO besides me were approximately 8 to 15 years older than me as I had just turned 21 that April.  Two of the individuals were school teachers and the other two were business owners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not the first time I had seen a UFO while living in Weed, California, and the other sightings were also witnessed by my siblings and friends and on one occasion, we even called law enforcement, who did respond, but found ways to discount what we were seeing and what they were seeing.<n>
10/30/81 23:00|West Elk Wilderness Area|CO|Circle|five seconds|Bright round ball. several thousand MPH leveled off to one thousand MPH zig zaged through dense timber, no sound no projected light|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26278.html|2|ndxe198110| Bright round ball. several thousand MPH leveled off to one thousand MPH zig zaged through dense timber, no sound no projected light<n> <n><n> <n><n> A brightly lit white perfectly round ball estimated fifty feet in width dropped in a straight line almost as fast as a shooting star and began to make slight serpentine motions as it slowed down. As it slowed futher the zig zaging of the craft became much more radical until it was making large sweeping switchback turns going from a speed of several thousand miles per hour to about one thousand miles per hour. We were witnessing this from a distance of about one mile away. The craft looked intensely bright at it&#39;s core. As it leveled off at the tree line in the dense forest that it was flying into one would have thought that it would light up the whole forest around it. However it did not emit this light out because as it disappeared in and out of the dense forest that it was zig zagging in and out of, it dissapeared totally and then reappeared with no light projecting on to the trees. So it didn&#39;t project light as we know it. It looked extremely bright at it&#39;s core but the light did not emit out beyond that core. It had the ability to zig zag in and out of heavy black timber at a speed of nearly one thousand miles per hour. It didn&#39;t bump any trees or make a single sound of any kind. I was with two other men that can verify this if they are willing. They got pretty scared over the whole thing and wouldn&#39;t talk to anyone afterwards but I&#39;ve been very gabby telling everyone I know about it. I&#39;m sorry that the reporting was back in 1981 before I contacted anyone but frankly I didn&#39;t know who to tell until I came across this site on the dinternet. I also have another sighting to tell about that happened only three years ago and I have a credible witness to that one who I&#39;m sure will talk about it. I&#39;ll fill out another report on a different form to report the second sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought the witness does not indicate that.  PD))<n>

They were flying what i figured to be about as low as a passenger jet readying for landing, for i also figured they were at least just as big.  i watched them carefully, not taking my eyes off of them. they made no sound.  even with the street traffic, i can hear aircraft that fly that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the sky was patched with clouds.  The sky where i saw the craft was cloudless and dark and starred with the night.  the objects were as dark as the dark sky, with wings near the angle of flying wings. there were at least eight white lights on the backs of the wings, like one would see on the wings of a passenger jet.  there were no headlights, no blinking wing lights, no tail lights, blinking or otherwise and no body lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no body per say and no tail.  It was just a wing, kind of a long triangular shape, but with a dip in the back middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were side by side, wing tips nearly overlapping. One of the &#34;wings&#34; was slightly in front of the other.  As they were both moving across the sky, the one behind moved just slightly in front of the one that was in front before.  Also, the angle of the &#34;wings&#34; was a bit different for each craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew slowly north and disappeared into the clouds.  I saw them for about a long 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported it to the Oregon chapter of Mufon, I think it was a few years ago.  They came back with a link or links to aircraft pics for me to look at, to see if it looked like any of them.  The flying wing was the closest; however, the wing angle was different. They said that either stealth or the flying wing (don?t remember which they said.  Cant find the report in my puter stuff) wasn&#39;t known of by the public in 1981/82.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told them that I knew of the flying wing at least by then, if not before. I had sent them links to the aircraft that looked most like in part, as well as links to flying wing sites and pics. Never heard back from them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We both saw three silvery-white disks in a triangular formation above south Boulder.  Each disk looked like a yo-yo on its side, with the top section a little smaller than the bottom.  They were close enough or large enough for us to see that each one had several windows or portholes.  They moved very slowly and were visible about 10-15 seconds before they faded out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.

Then from the East it flew around Forked Butte and came at us less than ten ft. off the snow covered ground.The vehicle then rapidly (popped) approached us from the East and landed ten ft. in front of us, turned out its bright white light and turned on an interior light revealing the semi-transparent red, green &amp; blue lens. The vehicle then exited rapidly and climbed into space and disappeared behinfd Mt. Jefferson. The vehicle emitted sparks from the stern much like a 1930&#39;s &#34;Buck Rogers&#34; space vehicle. On Sunday evening at approx. 10 pm Dec. 22, 1981 myself, my 11 yr. old son and another person were &#34;buzzed&#34; by over 12 of these same vehicles. We witnessed them flying up to a larger cigar shaped vehicle and started orbiting around it. The whole system then rose up into the night sky and disappeared. I interviwed Police catain Ellidge ! and Lt. Horton who recieved over a thousand phone calls concerning individuals from Eugene in February 1982. I reported the incident to the FBI. Since then we have studyed in depth the technology we were shown and hence got a U.S. patent ont the technology in 1989. We intend to build and test prototypes soon. Please visit our website to review this technology at http://www.unitelnw.com. The Medford incident may be the same vehicles. I believe they are our own vehicles that we are about to build attempting to return to the correct spacetime departure point. Thank you, Sincerely,<n>

Sterling exits and were already past the Montgomery Clark County line. We turned back towards Mt. Sterling on I-64. At the next overpass we saw a large metallic saucer shaped craft hovering about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left Morehead, where we lived before dark and headed towards Mt. Sterling on I-64, which is about 35 miles away. We were driving leisurely and talking, and stopped at the Owensville / Frenchburg exit in Bath County to get a soft drink. We got back on the interstate, still talking, at almost sunset. It was a warm fall day and we were riding with the windows down, having a great time just enjoying the ride. Somehow we must have driven right by both Mt. Sterling exits, but neither of us has ever had any memory of it. All we know for sure is it was dark outside and when we realized quite suddenly that the terrain didn&#39;t seem right and we started looking at the mile markers and figured out we were about fifteen miles past Mt. Sterling. We couldn&#39;t figure out how we had missed not one, but both exits...but had no choice except to turn around and go back. We were just inside Clark County at that point and got off at the next exit we saw, which is a rural exit on to U.S. 60, and turned around heading back into Montgomery County on I-64 towards Mt. Sterling once more. We were still perplexed about how we had gotten there when we came to the first overpass. There was a large metallic saucer with what I&#39;ve always thought of as multi-colored &#34;running lights&#34; on it and portals visible. The saucer made no sound we were aware of and didn&#39;t disturb the surrounding treetops and other vegetation as it hovered in mid air about twenty-five feet above the embankment to the right of the overpass. We both stared and I slowed down and started pulling off the highway, coming almost to a full stop in front of the craft before my friend freaked out and yelled &#34;hit the gas&#34;. That snapped me out of my stupor and I did as I was told, hit the gas and pulled back out onto the highway. We arrived in Mt. Sterling much later than we anticipated, even considering the fact we had gone fifteen miles out of our way, which accounts for an extra half hour traveling time, but we were never sure how much time, if any, we did loose. Since then ! I have realized if we hadn&#39;t been headed for Mt. Sterling and had been going on to Winchester or Lexington, we would never have taken note of the fact we didn&#39;t see the two Mt. Sterling exits and we also would not have turned around in Clark County to turn back towards Mt. Sterling, so we would not have seen the saucer hovering over that overpass because it would not have been visible from the other side of the interstate (we didn&#39;t notice it as we went by the first time as we traveled the other way ... and that must have been about where we were when we realized we missed Mt. Sterling). Neither of us have ever remembered much more than that and remained for the last 18 years afraid to tell anybody.<n>

I was waiting for the time of their arrival.  I spoke to no one of this at the time, and have only shared my experience witha few extremely close friends since the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I would be called to the site telepathicly when they would arrive in my area.  It wsa Sunday afternoon around 4PM, when I felt drawn to Stevens Creek Blvd.  I  entered Town and Country Shopping Center&#39;s parking lot a &#34;back way&#34; and when I pulled in, there was a group of people standing under the craft, which hovered about 20 feet in the air--- just above the rooftop.  It was close to a Tobacco store.  The man who worked in the store was one of hte witnesses.  I walked closer to the group, and had made the decision NOT to go with the beings prior to this physical encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After standing with the  group[ for a ew more minutes---looking up to the bottom of the  craft, the craft raised upward without movement of air, or sound --no heat was felt---nothing.  It increased speed rapidly, and then dissapeared in an instant.  We all looked at each other, and dispersed in silence.  The experience was profound, and even more so because we had witnessed it together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking in various places to see if any of the other witnesses have reported it, but I have not seen evidence of the sighting.  It affected me so  intensly, Ihad to report it--even though  it occurred all these years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one was abducted to my knowledge.  My comunication with them was indicative of a volulnteer scenario, and I was not willing to participate, but have the connection with them telepathicly.  I had a spiritually uplifitng sense, and was not frightened by the beings in the craft.  I never made visual contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was just getting of work in the late afternoon. My co-worker was also off, I was on my way to my car in the parking lot. It was a very clear evening and I had just glanced up. The building where we work is situated on a hill so the view is beautiful, anyway I looked up and I saw it. It was moving steadily but low above trees. It had no lights, no wings, just like a long black pencil but rounded on each end. It was a long ways away so I couldn`t see any detail. The wierd thing was it made no sound at all, that`s what really spooked me. When I saw the T.V. show a police officer also reported the light he saw made no sound, and I remembered what I had seen that day back in 1981.  I remembered asking my co worker to look at it, and he was amazed too. It moved so quickly from horizon to horizon and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were the only ones on the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a Thursday morning in October, 1981, we decided to go home two days early on our week vacation.  We were camped at a location across from the boat ramp.  When we left our camp, we noticed how calm the lake was and that we were the only ones there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the boat ramp, we saw something moving through the water and thought it was a beaver, however, when we pulled alongside it, it was a mule deer doe swimming across the lake towards where we were camping.  We thought that this was unusual as they run in herds and not singly as white tail deer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((TC)) and ((MC)) wanted to drown the deer and take it home and butcher it for meat and I refused to let them do it because I was the boss at the time.  It would have been easier for the mule deer to walk around the lake by the ramp rather than to swim across the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we loaded the boat, we drove south from the lake to the first hairpin corner.  As we turned, ((TC)) slammed on his brakes and jack knifed the boat to where we could not leave.  Hovering above the small box canyon on the sunny side, was a large shaped object as big as a football field from end zone to end zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shiny like crumpled up aluminum foil and as it changed colors from the sparkling of the sun, we noticed it was vibrating and making no sound.  At this time we knew it was somehow mechanically operating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((TC)) asked me to get out and walk up to it but I refused because I was in fear of my life and told him to do it.  He pulled out a 12 inch barrel 357 magnum and wanted to shoot at it, ((MC)) and I told him to put it away.  We were frightened and felt that we were being watched by the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled up the windows and locked the doors and watched it in astonishment to afraid to do anything.  We watched it for about 10 minutes like it was a Mexican standoff.  Trying to figure out how to leave without driving under it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as we decided to back up and break the hitch on the boat, it took off faster than the eye could see.  It went straight up and you could see the curvature of the earth as it went straight up because it left a shiny image behind.  It actually left so fast you could see the shining image behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We made a pact together not to say a word to anyone because they would just say we were drunk and we had not drank anything that morning except coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a police officer I faced many conflicts were I could have been shot or stabbed and still was not as afraid as I was of the flying object seen at Apache Lake.  As a police office, you learn fight or flight, however, I was scared to the point that I could not hardly move, talk and felt like vomiting.  I am willing to take any type of lie detection test to verify the truth of our sighting.  As a police officer, I have taken many lie detector tests and have never failed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report this to someone before my disease takes my life because, of all the nay sayers and scientists saying people who see unknown flying objects are crazy.  It’s hard to deny when you see one in broad day light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what machines are because I served in the Navy as an engineman and was a driller on one of the largest drilling rigs in the world.  I also have been a avid bow hunter and fisherman since I was about 10 years old.  I am now ready to turn 54 and have countless hours in the hills hunting and fishing from northern Idaho and Montana to southern New Mexico and Arizona.  It has cost me two almost three.<n>

I was 5 at the time and being driven to daycare by my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling down highway 7 at around 07:30, it was just getting light out but still dark.  The craft appeared all of a sudden and I asked my mom what is that, and she said she did not know.  Her recollection is different that mine after this time.  The craft, triangular in shape had lights on the bottom and the lights would flicker on and off but in a pattern, first one goes on then goes off, the next one in line would go off and so on.  The colour of the lights were different colours.  I remember we pulled over to the side of the road and my mom told me not to get out of the car but I did anyways.  I remember seeing other vehicles on the side of the road that day with people also observing and pointing at the craft.  My mother does not remember anyone there.  The next memory I have is running from the front yard of our house to the back yard and I was chasing so! me bright lights in the sky that were travelling just over our trees about 25-30 feet tall, at a slow speed maybe 10 KM/h.  The time is now about 9PM.  I remember being so scared I could not talk and when I tried, I had a hard time breathing when my mom came around the corner.  She did not see the craft which was also triangular in shape and the lights were bright yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/1/81 20:00|Mt. Sterling|KY|Disk|one hour or more|Close up view of UFO after unexplained loss of time. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91212.html|12|ndxe198110| Close up view of UFO after unexplained loss of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was October 1 or 15, 1981, as best we can tell because weather records indicate October 8 was too cold.  It was early on a Thursday evening and we were on our way from Morehead to a bar in Mt. Sterling with high hopes of getting the weekend started early since I had no classes the next day.  At least that&#39;s how it all began that day, as normal as any other day.  By dark things were anything but normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the car topped the little rise on the four lane we saw it in the distance.  It was sitting there in mid air, perfectly still and amazingly silent.  My first thought is that from this angle and distance I could understand how one of these things could be described as cigar shaped.  That description would be totally inaccurate since it was the classic flying saucer shaped craft.  Instantly I realized the impression of a cigar shape is just an optical illusion from certain vantage points.  My friend later said there was a triangular shape to the structure on top but I was driving and never really got a good look from an angle where I could see the upper portion of the craft.  As we got closer the size of it nearly took my breath away and that eerie lack of engine noise really sank in even though it was hovering motionless at rooftop height or maybe a little higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was enormous with full running lights ablaze.  The machining was obvious, the airliner shaped windows were evenly spaced metallic depressions, and it was so close to the highway it felt like we were about to drive under it.  I’ve never known exactly how big it was, a hundred feet across is just a guess because it could have been a hundred and twenty five or fifty feet easily.  The lights were fairly evenly spaced and mostly white, with a scattering of red and amber.  There may have been some green lights as well, but it wasn’t the lights that held my attention.  It was the whole thing in its entirety and it was a wondrous sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed the car and began to pull off the road onto the shoulder.  I knew two things with great certainty.  I wanted so badly to see it and somebody was granting my request.  I also knew without any doubt this was a rare opportunity and I would never get this chance again.  I had no idea how I knew these things, but it didn’t matter in the moment.  All I wanted was to pull over and get out so I could get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when my best friend, speechless until we were nearly stopped, yelled for me to hit the gas.  There was such urgency in her voice that I immediately did as she asked, convinced she had seen something I hadn’t noticed and that it scared her.  It was only recently we began to discuss it again after years of trying to put it out of our minds.  She told me the second before she yelled out she became aware of a beam of light the craft had suddenly focused on us, something I hadn’t been conscious of although I do remember everything being lit up nearly bright as day.  All I knew was that as we pulled away it was obvious she felt we needed to be far away from this thing, whatever it was.  In the moment I reluctantly bowed to her wishes without knowing exactly why, but with a measure of silent regret for what I’d never get to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us knew how we got here or how long it had been dark outside.  Further discussion revealed we both remembered the same thing, getting back on the interstate after buying soft drinks at the second Bath County exit and driving west towards the setting sun.  As we got back on the interstate for the short drive we knew we only had another twelve or fourteen miles to go to get off at the next exit in the neighboring county.  Somehow we missed both exits for Mt. Sterling because the next thing we were aware of it was dark and it felt like we weren’t in the right place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We nervously tried to laugh it off.  The nearly total darkness of the rural country side seemed to press in on us.  There was no other choice but find a place to turn around.  We drove to the next exit, which was the first Clark County exit.  There was nothing within sight there except pasture.  There were no street lights or houses, not even the obligatory gas station visible in the distance one would expect to find near an exit ramp off an interstate highway.  We wasted no time in turning around and getting back on the interstate, this time on the eastbound side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were still wondering how we had over shot our destination so badly as we pulled back onto the deserted highway.  It was such an implausible explanation that we had somehow passed not one, but both Mt. Sterling exits and missed the sunset we were driving towards that our laughter held a hollow ring.  We were uncomfortably aware we were headed back into Montgomery County, a county we had absolutely no memory of having just driven through.  It was pretty weird but not half as weird as what was about to happen.  A couple of minutes later we topped that little rise on the four lane and the saucer shaped craft came into sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my friend yelled for me to hit the gas I did pull back onto the interstate and accelerate, watching the saucer grow smaller in my rearview mirror as we increased our distance from it.  It never did move.  We kept driving eastward.  The saucer remained there.  It just hovered silently exactly where it was until it faded from our sight.  When we were far enough away that it was entirely out of our sight we were suddenly able to talk again as if a spell had been released.  My friend convinced me not to tell anybody, that there was no point since nobody would ever believe us anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was right about that because I don’t think anybody ever has believed us, not that we ever told many people.  There’s that and the fact that it lacked some of the exciting elements of a classic saucer sighting like the impossibly quick maneuvers commonly reported.  The one we saw didn’t do anything but it was a lot closer to us than with most reported sightings.  The other thing is even though it was stationary and we got a very good look at it, we saw none of the occupants so they could as easily been Russian or Chinese as little green or grey men from another world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years it occurred to me it could be one of our experimental aircrafts before so much time passed.  After twenty years or so when our military never introduced a fleet of flying saucers with some new propulsion system that no longer relied on noisy jet engines I gave up on that theory.  The fact that the Russians and Chinese also failed to incorporate any radical changes in their aircrafts during that period pretty much nixed the idea that it was foreign technology from this planet.  I gave up those explanations over a decade ago when nobody on earth stepped up with this radical advancement or reaped the benefits of a viable alternative engine design with the assumed alternate fuel source that would power such a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time passed it just seemed more and more unlikely that two or three decades would come and go without some sign of these discoveries leaching into the world market, but to this day it never has.  In the last decade or so that left just one possibility to contemplate.  It became more and more reasonable to accept the saucer wasn’t from this planet at all.  In accepting that probability I’m left with exploring the knowledge I began with, the things I was sure of the moment I saw it come into sight.  At that second it never occurred to me the thing might be native to my own planet.  It was only later my mind reached for a logical way to explain what we saw without stating the outlandish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In time the event defied all other explanations.  It was obviously extraterrestrial as much as I might have fought saying it out loud.  All that was left was those first few thoughts that had been so crystal clear and in the second it came into view I never had any doubt that it was an alien craft.  I also knew from the very core of my being its sole purpose for being there beside the highway, completely still and displayed in all its glory with every running light ablaze, was to let us see it.  I can’t explain why, but I was utterly without fear and knew this was my one and only chance to see it.  I was certain it would never return and in this lifetime I would never get another opportunity.  Thirty-one years later I can tell you that so far as I know that’s still true.  I’ve never seen anything even remotely questionable in the sky since that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/81 20:00|Hesperia|MI|Oval|40 minutes|Two people in car see green oval object and lost time|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67734.html|13|ndxe198110| Two people in car see green oval object and lost time<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 8 o&#39;clock PM by the radio, my now ex wife and I, ages 26 and her 23, were traveling west along m-20 about 4 miles west of Hesperia Michigan when far off, miles and miles away, west almost due west and just slightly south we both saw a day glow/lime green tiny dot in the sky. In less than 10 seconds it dropped and came directly at us, almost straight on. In what seemed like only a very few seconds it was on us covering literally miles in only a few seconds and it&#39;s emense size literally covered and engulfed our 1979 Gray Chevy pickup. The first fear was of a head on collision. The absolute shock and fear was indescribable. At this point we were both covered in a brilliant and unbelievable lime/florescent green light that completely blocked out any view outside the truck. We were both completely illuminated in green light. At this point I was in complete un describable terror and total shock like I have never known before or since. I turned to my now ex wife literally screaming with out hearing myself, wondering if I was personally going insane or God knows what only to see her in the exact same state I was in. The look of terror on her face was some thing, much like the entire event, that is so vividly etched in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok now this is the part that haunts me every day of my life since. My next memory and hers seems like literally a second later from one of shear terror is one of &#34;Hmmm that was weird&#34;, and looking at her being totally calm and myself the same way. Our truck was in the exact same place on the highway going 60 miles per hour just as it was when we were in total terror what seemed like only a split second before. There was on my part no swerving or even time to react before we went from complete shock to Hmmm that was interesting. We both watched the green oval object fly off in a south west direction, more southerly than it had approached, over the trees and off into the far distance and up into the sky disappearing from sight as it seemed to climb far off in the distance. We continued the last 3 miles to our house on Loop rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not have a watch or a car clock. When we got home it was 9 o&#39;clock. Then I was even more confused. Where had the near hour gone? At this point I called the Oceana sheriff office and made a report, just in case someone else saw or experienced this. The officer was very nice and took it all seriously and stated &#34; I have known officers that have seen things they couldn&#39;t explain too.&#34;<n>
10/1/81|Texas City/Galveston|TX|Unknown||UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981.  Anyone remember this?|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59782.html|14|ndxe198110| UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981.  Anyone remember this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening about 10:00 pm I had left night class at University of Houston Clear Lake campus to drive back to Galveston where I lived.  There was only one other car on the I45 South Highway around Texas City area.  The car came up next to me and I could see with peripheral vision that the driver was pointing upwards, but I was afraid to make eye contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning there were newspaper reports of an UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, my roommate and I, drove around Galveston Island looking for the UFO.  I was driving.  An extremely bright light coming from the sky blinded me, whereby I let go of the steering wheel to cover my face with my arms and immediately it was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly put the car in park and we both jumped out of the car to hear if maybe it were a helicopter, but it was totally quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone validate the sighting in this area during this time?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
