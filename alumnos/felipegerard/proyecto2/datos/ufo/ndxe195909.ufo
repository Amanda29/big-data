The saucers were a sky blue color but darker than the sky. They could have came from the direction of WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB. They circled once then climbed out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night on WHIO-TV they had a report from WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB. The repoter said 20,000 people had seen the saucers. The USAF sargent said: &#34;What everyone saw was the sun reflecting off garbage can lids.&#34; Then he held up two lids.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the amount of people that saw them, I can&#39;t find anything on the WWW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We ended up somewhere around Goldfield, Nev. south of Tonopah. One night we were in the back of a pickup off a main highway. There were four of us in the truck, which had run off the road and was stuck in the sand. We had spent hours trying to dig out or drive out, but the truck was buried up to its hubcaps. We decided someone would have to walk out in the morning and try to get help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile we were stargazing. We started talking about &#34;flying saucers&#34; as we called them in those days. My girlfriend said, &#34;Let&#39;s see if we can contact a saucer to help us.&#34; So she and I started trying to telepathically contact a saucer. Not long afterwards we all saw a light approaching. I don’t know the direction it came from. It looked just like a bright star except it was moving towards us. It got much brighter as it drew overhead, about the size of the blunt end of a pencil held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment we felt the truck move. It rose straight up in the air about a foot or two off the ground, floated to the middle of the road, and gently set down. Then the light moved back in the direction it came from and blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memories of that experience were verified by my friend when I contacted her for the first time more than 40 years later. The first thing she said was, &#34;What do you remember about that night?&#34;  We agreed on all the details except I remembered screaming and she remembered laughing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates he works in the newspaper industry.  We will invite him to have the other witness(es) submit corroborating reports.  One of two interesting sighting reports by same witness.  PD))<n>

Iwas on scope that day.  We got a call by phone from the control tower that the navy operated.  They said that there was somthing hovering near the mountian to the west of us.  the mountian was about 35 to 40 miles away and appeared as a permanent echo on our scopes. They wanted to know how high up it was. The radar height finder was next to my scope, I measured its height at 4 to 5 thousand feet, we reported this to the navy ops,  we then opened the barn type doors located behind the plotting board, they faced west, we took our binoculars and looked at a flying saucer!  You should try to talk to other military radar operators.  thanks  read report not 1950 but 1959<n>
