It had no lights but was apparently light colored and reflecting lights from the city. As best as I could tell it was L-shaped with the long arm parallel to the direction of motion. It also seemed to have a second short arm a short distance behind the leading short arm. It may have been a flock of light-colored birds but it seemed very rigid (no individual motion), rapid, and not a V-shape as I usually see during the day. I think it was silent but couldn&#39;t tell as a very busy street is only several houses away. It happened directly above my house.<n>

When I told my wife to look in the same direction, she noticed it immediately! The object was flying south east and made no sound at all and there where no lights visible. We observed it for about 15 seconds then we lost sight of it when it passed behind some trees. There is an Air Force base just north of Little Rock.<n>

Typical movements included circular loops and some very rapid vertical motions followed by rapid change of direction to horizontal and then followed by a loop terminating in about the original position. one characteristic was the instantateous change of direction of flight. another feature was the very brightness of the object: it was brighter than any nearby star and it did not flicker at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I determined the motion of this object by referencing two stationary objects and sighting along to see what the motion was. the most rapid motion was vertcally downwards which happened perhaps four or five times during the two hours of observation. it was a very crisp clear night though a bit of fog developed later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> other than the rotation of the earth displaying ever unfolding vista through the night, the only other bright object with motion was an aircraft flying basically north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> certified true and correct ((name deleted)) B.

I was outside on my deck at approximately 1945 hours the sky was spotlessly clear and the air was crisp approximately 25 degrees F.  I was looking up had just mused at the fact that I could only see about thirty degrees of night sky over head.  I have a canvas awning over a portion of the deck and it limited my line of sight to about 15-20 degrees either direction from 90 degrees straight up.  I would often look up at the stars and have on numerous occasions been able to see sattelites.  I noticed some motion against the motionless backdrop of stars and saw that what I had originally thought were stars were moving! There appeared to be three lights at the &#34;tips&#34; of a dark triangular shaped &#34;craft?&#34; moving slowly north.  The crfaft was able to precisely, fluidly change direction towards NE and then towards the NW.  The craft was low, approximately 1,000&#39;-2,000&#39; in altitude.  It moved SILENTLY, and it seemed able to change directions within its own radius (turn on a dime) but it was not moving fast.  It reminds me of the fluid, silent turn/roll of a sailplane.  For a moment I thought that&#39;s what it was, but I have never seen any sailplanes around here and I have lived here for 44 years.  I eventually lost sight of the craft against the backdrop of the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest thing I have ever seen.  It happened tonight about 1.5 hrs ago.  I have been back outside straing my neck for a chance second peak.  But I know what I saw, and I DID SEE THEM.  I KNOW YOU ARE HERE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to the witness, who elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

The first object first brightened then dimmed (reddish color) then disappeared, this occured over 4 cycles and then remained a constant light.  While it travelled in a direct line at the 2 o&#39;clock position (became white) moving rapidly, much faster than a satellite.  It then began to make an s-shape and headed down towards the tree line where we could no longer track it.  The second object was a faint white light, and appeared in the same location a minute or two later but followed a straight path down in the 6 o&#39;clock position.  The third object was also a faint white light, that appeared again within a minute of losing sight of the last one, in the same position right above us this object went in a straight 5 o&#39;clock path until we could no longer track it.  All three travelled at about the same speed and did not leave a trail.  The time was shortly past twilight, clear skies, dark night at Namakani Paio Camp Ground at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.<n>
11/30/02 17:45|Yuba City|CA|Triangle|2 minutes|Three large lights in triangular formation spotted near Yuba City, CA on 11/30/02.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26367.html|7|ndxe200211| Three large lights in triangular formation spotted near Yuba City, CA on 11/30/02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark and overcast, at about 5:45pm on Saturday, November 30, 2002. I was driving north on a busy stretch of Highway 99, 5-10 miles south of Yuba City, CA. Roughly 1-2 miles ahead of me, I saw a very large white/yellow light hovering at about 1,000-2,000 feet in the air, approximately 100 yards off the highway. As I approached (about 1/2 mile away), I could see three large, distinct lights in a row, and one small red/orange blinking light on the left (west). I assumed the blinking light was a landing light on a wing, so I briefly dismissed it as a plane or jet. But the object continued to hover (as far as I could tell, it never moved), and as I began to pass underneath it, I realized that the three large lights were arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. I couldn&#39;t make out an outline of the object, because the three white/yellow lights were too bright. Unfortunately, there was too much traffic to find a place to safely pull over and observe the object. But there were 3-4 cars in front of me and 5-6 behind me, so I have to assume that someone else saw what I saw. I know that Beale AFB is roughly nearby, so who knows what it was. I suppose it could have been a Harrier jet, but as near as I could tell, it wasn&#39;t making any noise. I&#39;ve seen hundreds of military and civilian aircraft in my life, and I&#39;ve honestly never seen anything hover like that before. I am a senior at Chico State University in northern California, and to my knowledge, I am not insane.<n>

I then called my daughter to come out and see it. After watching for a few minutes she ran in to find the camera. By the time she came back out it had winked out. A few minutes after that two helicopters coming from Supmter (possibly the Air Force Base?) came out and started circling the area. About tem more minutes two more came out. Approximately 7:00 pm I saw a streak of light across the shy, it happened very quickly. One of the helicopters cut across the sky towards where the streak had been. More helicopters came out after that. I then saw the second streak around 9:00 pm and another helicopter proceeded to fly towards that streak, but both streaks were too fast. The helicopters stayed around all night.<n>

I heard a siren type noise, and it seemed to be coming from every direction. I walked off my porch and saw what I thought were five search planes because they had a bright light in the center of them which slowly blinked. They were, I&#39;m guessing, about two hundred feet up. They all came really close together, and then the siren noise stopped. They flew over the ohio river, and just stopped there. Then, there was a weird swishing noise, like you would expect to hear at the beach. One of the lights faded out, and the rest of the lights grew brighter, and it happened again and again until there was only one, extremely bright light. The light started to dim, and then it changed from a weird ball shape to a more of a ring shape. The ring was about 15 feet in diameter, not very big at all. The ring started to spin, and then stopped. The light fell into the water, and then came back up again, kind of like when you are flying a kite and it goes down and up. From what I saw, It looked like it was making the water come out of the river and flow straight up like a rod. The water stopped when it was around ten feet off the river. Then, the water dropped back into the river and the ring formed a ball again. The ball just kinda fell into the river and the light went out. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but I am pretty darn sure it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n>

At 22:10 a fourth appeared, the four then began to fly in what appeared to be a predetermined pattern in which they came together and flew apart changing every second sequence.  They did this for approximately 20 minutes, then as they flew apart they flew up and disappeared.  The sky was cloudy and the best description I could give of them is that they looked disk shapped with the brightest portion as a line in the center.  I did photograph the four of them and hope to have some good pictures to share.  It was amazing.<n>

(I am not sure if that was the time) a couple of friends and I were driving around Cordova when this blue ball or light or something fell out of the sky.  A bunch of other people saw it too.  It wasn&#39;t like a craft it was a ball.  It made the kind of noise that you would here a missle make.  We were freaked out and called a bunch of radio stations and it just sat there in the ground until these people came and picked it up, but by then we were gone so I couldn&#39;t see if the one&#39;s who took it were police or FBI or whoever.  It freaked the hell out of me! I thought that for sure it would be all over the news, but it wasn&#39;t.  The radio stations kept it going for maybe an hour and then we heard nothing about it.  I don&#39;t know if it was some kind of light from an air plane or what!<n>

It was stationary and to the north north east part of the sky. just slightly east of the peaks. as we pulled onto the main street, Route 66, then it seemed the move straight  away from us  until we could not see it ( this lasted about 2 second) It did not look like a landing lights turning off, it was to slow for that, but we looked for a few seconds just in case to look for the flashing lights of an air plane but nothing was there, and the airport was pretty far away in the oposit direction.<n>

This object was dimly lit though. It glowed a light orangish color. It also had no blinking lights. It looked to be shaped like a disk that came to a point at front and rear. It was also very high in the sky. It was very fast and moved from north to southeast when suddenly at one point the object turned at one point. It didn&#39;t turn gradually, instead, it &#34;darted&#34; off at about a 30 to 40 degree angle at a given spot. More like a slingshot. After it changed its direction it slowed down and then just darted out of sight.<n>

Looking south of my location in Reading, I saw what looked to be about as big as one of the stars I was viewing (it was super high so it looked as small as a star). usually a very high plane or jet would look to be moving slowly and take a while to cover such a distance viewing it from down here on the ground. This object covered my area of viewing in a matter of seconds. It was not a meteorite. It was out of sight in about 5 to 7 seconds. It was very white bright, with no flashing lights.

I was not thinking about anything special, the usual pressures of life. It was a nice dark, clear night. As I was gazing towards the heavens, I noticed this red &#34;dot&#34;. I estimate its height in the sky between 20 to 30 miles up. The reason I estimate its height, is due to the size of the object. I can only compare it to, looking at a laser pointer dot, 30 feet away. While I was staring at this object, I did nothing unusual, at first; I had thought it was a twinkling red star. Then the dot began to move. The dot moved slowly vertical, from it&#39;s position. I estimate, about 1 mile. Then the dot stopped. The dot stayed stationary for about 5 seconds then moved at a 90-degree angle, and stopped again. After about 5 seconds the dot moved again, zig zagging at an incredible speed, in a northern direction. The dot stopped suddenly, zig zagged backwards for about 5 seconds, then stopped for about 3 seconds, and moved strait up, and disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from Pennsylvania for this date.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> bright object that seemed to be affected by the gusty winds ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> looking to the south, and slightly to the left and down from orions belt i noticed a bricght light. At first I thought it was a planet because it was a different intensity than the stars. But when it moved it caught my attention and I called my wife and son over.  My wife said it was a plane, but I worked around airplanes and airports for almost 20 years and I knew it was not an aircraft. There was no regular beacon and as we watched an aircraft did fly over and you could see the difference.  It was quite windy at the time with gusts of at least 40 kph and I thought it might be a helicopter because it seemed to be affected by the wind but there was no noise and it had to be at least 5 miles away, and for the size of the light, it had to be bigger than any helicopter I have ever seen.  On closer inspection, we could see it was sometimes triangular, then looked like a straight line and other times a dot.  About 15 min after I first noticed it there was a streak across the sky.  Wheter it was related to this or just a meteor i can&#39;t say.  As for colour, (I am colourblind) I deffinatly seen it as red, but overall the light in the sky was a blueish. (Kind of hard to explain.)I think it must have been rotating at times because I could see the tip of the triangle pointing to the left(east) then at other times right or down, and i thing someitmes when it turned is when it appeared to be a straight line.  I did phone the city police to ask if anyone else had reported it but noone had.  My son and I drove in our car to a place about 3 km outside of the city to get away from the light pollution and try and get a better view, but it didn&#39;t make too much of a difference, it was still hazy.  On the way out of town itI had the light on my forward left, and it was in line with the street lights and the next time I glanced up it was to my right and my son said it had shot over.  Then it shot back to where it was origionaly.  We watched it outside the city for about 20 min but the only thing that really was different wa! s that i t &#34;flashed&#34; about three times over a 15 min period.  I didn&#39;t see this but my son was saying at times that balls of light were leaving and returning from it.I called a couple of people because I wanted them to see it and not think I was making it up, but one neveranswered the phone and the second was in a location where her house was behind a highway offramp that blocked her view to the south.  I also tried to call the Saskatoon airport but only got a recording.  Since nothing extraordinary was happening and my wife thought I was nuts, I stopped watching at about 0345 and went to be.  When I arose at 0800 there was too much cloud cover to see if anything was still in the sky.<n>

They were so close that at first I thought they were a low flying jet going over the top of the hotel, but immediately realized that the lights were irregular, all bright white and some left a faint streaking in the sky. They went over the top of the hotel, 90 degrees, and blinked out at about 60 degrees northerly. I feel certain that the cluster was a break up of some space vehicle (satellite, rocket etc), it was reminiscent of the debris that came over Seattle some years ago that created quite a stir. However, there&#39;s a chance that it could have been meteoroids, but I&#39;ve spent many hours observing meteor showers with some real close ones(one even exploded over my head and made an explosive sound and left a cloud that sat in the air where it exploded for over 10 minutes), and this was bigger than any of those spectacular meteors, and the fact that it was all in a cluster moving at the same speed and in the same direction, suggests to me some sort of space debris re-entering earth&#39;s atmosphere.<n>

I live in Glen Ellen, in the Sonoma Valley of California, and that would put the light in the direction of Oakville (over the mountains in Napa Valley).<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I thought odd about the light was that it was particularly bright, a combination of blue and red lights that bled one into the other.  It was fairly low on the horizon, about at 20 degrees, which would put it along the ridge line of the mountains east of here (The Mayacamas).  There are no airports or private airfields around here, so it&#39;s unusual to see lights like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the window to see if there was any sound, and it was dead quiet.  I live in the country so it can get pretty still at night around here and sound travels well.  I should add at this point that it was pitch black with no cloud cover at all and the stars were very prominent in the sky tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement of the lights was unusual in that they glided on a path from NE to SSW, and the movement was slower than a plane would make.  I got my binoculars and went outside to investigate.  I couldn&#39;t make out any form other than the lights appeared to outline a wing-shape, sort of like the flying wing, but not as elongated.  I&#39;m not clear on this because the shape was vague and I could only make it out for a few seconds - the brightness of the red and blue lights bled one into the other and made it hard to tell what they were attached to, even with the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it did something strange - it just stopped.  For about two minutes it didn&#39;t move at all.  At this point, it was in the direction of the town of Sonoma, to the SE of my location.  It was much higher in elevation now than when I first saw it.  There was no reference point to compare it to, but I&#39;m sure it was at around 10,000 feet at the very least by now (whereas it looked to be at around 3-4000 feet when I first noticed it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After not moving for a few minutes, it began heading southward, deviating slightly from its previous SW motion, and the lights began getting very small as if the object was gaining altitude.  Finally I lost track of it as it kept going south and getting dimmer.  Again, it was very quiet outside and I didn&#39;t hear any engine noises that would make me think it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s probably nothing like I said, but still, there was something very strange about the movement of the lights.  When it stopped like it did, I found it to be very odd, not natural at all.  It wasn&#39;t circling or hovering, which would cause the lights the move back and forth somewhat.  This thing just flat out stopped moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, for what it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s what I saw.<n>

Tha craft seemed to rotate,as it flew across the sky, and was almost transparent in nature.  It seemed as if you could see right through it, but definitely had a shape and lights around it. From the way it was moving, it seemed to leave some sort of trail,it almost reminded me of when you see a ship re-entering the atmosphere and there are vapor streams from friction or something. We all saw it zoom across for about 10 seconds or so and then disappeared.  It did not make any noise whatsover. We were all at awe of this insident.  This happened in Santa Cruz, California, Thanksgiving evening. Did anyone else see it?<n>

The limited view from my windshield was short, but a huge fireball the size of a plane with a long tail of flames and smoke lit up the night sky.  I crossed the interstate at exit 370 and turned off my lights but could see nothing...  once in town I told friends of the siting and several of us went back out to the crash site and drove through large pastures looking for the site of impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously we were the only people out there.  I called the county sheriff&#39;s office and was told that other people had reported seeing a meteor or were concerned of a possible plane crash... but the object I saw was traveling far too fast to just be a falling plane.  Surprisingly there has been nothing in the local news of this event and the only other witness I know of is my 14 year old daughter who I&#39;d left at her mother&#39;s when I went into town, she said she saw the very same thing on her way out to feed her horses.  I&#39;ve searched the internet and found nothing of a meteor being reported and am surprised this hasn&#39;t been a local media event.<n>

My fiancee was driving, and I was a passenger in the backseat with her elderly grandmother in the front. I told her to take a look, but since she was driving, she only caught a short glimpse of the object. Her grandmother was unfortunately unable to turn and look at it. My fiancee told me she had seen it, and asked if I could tell what it was, to which I replied, &#34;not sure, but it doesn&#39;t look like any kind of plane I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34; As she continued to drive, the object was hovering slightly above the field at about 20 feet or so, then began to &#34;sprint&#34; in the same direction as our car was traveling (north). It quickly caught up to our speed (about 75 mph.), and then rose up to about 200 feet or so and stalled, then dropped to about 20 feet again, turned 180 degrees and took off in the opposite direction (south). Once more it stopped, hovered for 2-3 seconds, then turned once more and took off at a fast pace. Finally, we were to far down the highway to see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not an aviator or engineer of any kind, but from my distance (about 200-250 yards away), it appeared to be approximately 20-25 feet from &#34;wingtip&#34; to &#34;wingtip&#34;, and was about 4-5 feet wide in the middle. It was all black with no visible lights, and was in the shape of an air-foil or kinda folded wing; like an upside down, elongated U. It appeared to have no external propeller or engine, and no &#34;cockpit&#34; or apparent area for a passenger. I saw no people anywhere nearby in the field to make me think it was some sort of radio-controlled airplane; if it was, it was the largest radio controlled object I have ever seen! It was broad daylight at about 10:30 am with partly cloudy skies, and a slight wind from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have included a map showing the approximate area we were, the direction we were traveling, the direstion(s) the object was traveling, and an illustration of what I saw. I hope this information is helpful, and I hope someone else saw what I saw.<n>

I stopped and observed through my window for a few seconds and then got out and looked. I was in town and there of course are homes and trees to deal with.  But in a clearing between some trees and houses I was able to see these objects.  They were rather low...not high in the sky...a bit above tree top level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four &#34;streaks&#34; -- one was the &#34;leading&#34; streak and very large...the other three were following the first and were a bit behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were glowing a white/yellow hue, a silverish hue and a light blue hue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first looking at them I thought-- Wow these are some huge meteors!  But when I kept observing them they were much too slow! They traversed about the speed that you would observe an airliner off in the distance.  They were going across the sky from a northern direction heading Southeast AND they were pretty much going straight across with a slight downward direction...like a very slow descent perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were going more in the direction of north to southeast but more south than anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I held my arm out fully extended and then used my thumb and index finger to measure the size of what the larger one was...it was the size of the space between my thumb and index finger fully extended...about 5 inches! The front part, of the leading object, which seemed to be about a two inches or so of more &#34;solid&#34; looking while the last 2 or 3 inches seemed to be more &#34;tail&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last three seemed to be about half the size of the leading one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be reflecting somewhat from the soon coming sunrise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as long as I was able to see them...I lost track of them behind the foothills. There was not any blast of light -- like I would have expected to see if there was a hit on land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did wonder for a bit if maybe they were missles as I have no idea what they may look like going across the sky.  I had even thought for a moment -- well this is it folks! I think I have dismissed the missle theory though...they were just moving too slow for that I think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had looked around to see if anyone was up and about but I seemed to be the only one around to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else had seen this though...I am truly perplexed! Quite a Thanks Giving wake up!<n>

IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT, LOOKED LIKE A STAR AT FIRST. IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO BE A STAR. IT PROCEEDED TO COME CLOSER TO THE HIGHWAY. WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS AN AIRPLANE. BEFORE EXITING OFF TO HIGHWAY 10, WE SUPSPECTED IT WAS NIETHER AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER. IT ZIG-ZAGED, AND WENT FROM BEING VERY CLOSE TO US, TO LOOKING LIKE A DISTANT STAR WITHIN SECONDS, THEN CLOSE AGAIN. WHEN WE GOT ONTO HIGHWAY 10 GOING WEST, IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS GOING TO KEEP GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, THEN QUICKLY TURNED AND WAS FOLLOWING US FROM BEHIND. WE HAD EVEN IN FACT, PASSED A SMALL AIRPORT, ON HIGHWAY 10, WHICH WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD LAND, BUT IT KEPT FOLLOWING OUR VEHICLE. THERE WERE NO BLINKING RED OR BLUE LIGHTS, THAT WOULD INDICATE A FAMILIAR AIR CRAFT. WHEN WE GOT TO STREET EXIT, HANSON BLVD., WE PULLED OVER IN A VACANT PARKING LOT. WE OBSERVED THE U.F.O. HOVERING TO THE EAST, STAYING AS A BIG BRIGHT LIGHT TO JUST A SPEC IN THE GALAXY. WHEN DRIVER PROCEEDED TO DROP ME OFF AT MY HOME, AS SOON AS I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, THE LIGHT GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER, UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED. I WENT INTO THE HOUSE JUST FOR A MOMENT, THEN CAME BACK OUT, I SAW THE SPEC IN THE SKY. THE DRIVER THEN PROCEEDED TO HER RESIDENCE, NOT SEEING IT THE ENTIRE WAY HOME, UNTIL SHE PULLED DOWN HER STREET, WHICH IS ABOUT 15 MINUTES NORTH TO ANDOVER, WHERE SHE SAW THE LIGHT BEHIND HER HOUSE. IT WAS BIG, BRIGHT, AND HANGING LOW. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SHAPED LIKE AN ARROW HEAD ALMOST FROM THE LIGHT.<n>

However, that is only a guess.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have on film an unexplained large,odd shaped ,colorful object in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me tell you , We are not nuts, We are very sane normal everyday people. With better things to do with our time than to watch things in the sky. Especialy 4:00 in the morning. I actualy feel stupid tell you about this. At First We thought it was a plane coming at us . That what we were seing was the headlights. I was up getting a drink of water. And my kitchin sink window faces the back yard Where my garage is. Up over the garage in the sky was this really huge light. Larger than any star I&#39;ve ever saw. I called my husband to see. Even he couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. We both tried very hard to analize rationaly what we were looking at. &#34;North Star? &#34; ruled that out ,it was getting closer and seamed to be moving. &#34; Headlights of a plane ? &#34; ruled that out, usualy after a few moments the plane would turn and you could identify it plus it would have a blinking light on it , which it did not, and it never revealed itself to be one. It was a VERY clear night. Other stars were out. This was 10 x&#39;s or so larger than other stars. I told my husband we better film this. I acutarly had to sit in my kitchen sink in order to steady my hand and take the film. I tried real hard to zoom in on it , to get a better look at what it was. We still tried to believe it was just a really bright star. We even had to rule out a commit, because there should have been a tail. Every time I tried to zoom in on it , it would dissapear from my lense. And I couldn&#39;t figure out why that was. So instead of just zooming right in { I Have a very powerful zoom in movie camera} I would tap on the zoom . I got in pretty close. This is when my husband and I were really confused. It was changing colors. It would be a bright neon green on the outside and red on the inside. It kept pulsing { getting bigger than smaller] in and out. We just figured that was the automatic focus. This would occur if the object in the lense was moving. So it would automaticly re-focus. I did not have a tripod to steady it. So we just thought this would! be that my hand was shaky. It was completly round. When it pulsed bigger. This is when you would see the red center. Than when it pulsed back it would turn to its bright white. Eventualy it started going behind a tree. I then moved into my bedroom window where I could see if I could get a better view. This was better, Also because I could set the  camera down on the window sill and it would stay in focus and we could see if it was my shaky hands moving or the object. WELL. this was incredible. I got a better view and was able to zoom in VERY GOOD. This object kept going out of my view frame. Telling me that IT was moving and not me. And it had change shape. Stars don&#39;t do this. It changed to the shape of a , &#34;Get this&#34; a CHristmas Bulb. Sounds strange but I do Have it on film. It had two  white rings around the center, that were very close to it and each other. It Appeared to have a smaller ring in the center and off the small ring went four bars like an x. The top had gotten flat. It was purple in a perfectly shaped window at the top part that was square. The rest was round underneith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I forgot to mention. When we were in the kitchen window it got flat on top, then it changed to flat on the left side of it. In my video after viewing it on my tv. You could see the gararge too. Which gives you an idea of how large it looked to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept filming hoping IF it was a UFO. That I wanted to get it on film taking off. But My battery ran dead on my camera, And I had to get up early to put my turkey in the oven. So I just gave up and went to sleep. If anyone thinks this is just a bright star. Please let me know. We are really puzzled. We want to know what it was. Usualy if a planet is going to be really close and really bright they let you know on the news so you can watch it. Well I havent heard of anything. I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT WAS.<n>

I first caught sight of the planet Jupiter, rather bright and imposing, shining away in the eastern sky. Several winter constellations were also visible overhead and in the south, shining through a thin layer of haze and broken clouds. It was a rather chilly evening so I decided to leave my telescope indoors and just do some &#39;eyeball astronomy&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes I suddenly noticed an object midway up in the east (about 50 degrees altitude) moving south. Its appearance was that of broadly V-shaped gossamer contrail, three full moon diameters wide, without any lights or form of illumination. I expected the object to begin to disperse and dissipate as I watched, due to its thin and wispy appearance. It did not! The object continued to move south steadily. I lost sight of it after twenty seconds or so when the object moved behind a bank of clouds in the south. It made no sound the entire time that I had it in view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being an amateur astronomer for the past twenty years has given me the opportunity to experience a good amount of sky phenomena. I have never seen anything in the night sky that I didn&#39;t have an explanation for - until now! I would be very interested in any and all plausible explanations of the object I spotted. My only explanation - birds flying south for the winter - was quickly discarded when I witnessed the object move behind the clouds.<n>

I saw it up there, toward the cliff house- it was silver with some spikes sticking out, jutting out of two of its sides- like black poles which were sticking up. It also seemed to have a tail at one end- kind of like a stalk stem of a mushroom. I looked around me to see if anyone else was seeing it. I stopped and tried to see if I could flag someone down to look, too. I kept thinking, &#34;God, is that a UFO?&#34; There was noone likely to stop, it somehow didn&#39;t seem appropriate and the beach wasn&#39;t that crowded. It was sunny, clear, I know what I saw and it was very weird. Anyway, the even weirder thing is is how I actually felt looking at it- extremely serene and calm; it was almost like whoever was in charge of it or actually in it wanted me to see it. It lasted a long time, about 1 minute. I remember thinking, &#34;This is like on Art Bell.&#34; I&#39;ve neevr felt whatever it was I was feeling before or since when I saw it. I also rwemember thinking, &#34;What&#39;s gong to happen?&#34;  I kept my eye on it and next thing I knew it was gone. One second there, the next, out. It was a ways up in the sky- you&#39;d need to be looking at that patch of sky to see it or be looking at that general area and then maybe it would get your attention. Like I said, I&#39;m used to looking at that area of the sky on walks-. I told someone I know &amp; he said it sounds like a secret military craft- I can&#39;t recall the word he used but it sounded right- some sort of very light craft. Thanks<n>

Given that the witnesses observed the object for an estimated 35 minutes, it almost certainly could not have been an aircraft.  It may have been a high-altitude helium balloon at very high altitude, although they generally are not seen to move in the manner the witness describes.  One of two different sighting reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

Considering it seemed more like a few thousand feet away, it must have been going at least 1000 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had witnessed this at night, I would have assumed it was a &#34;shooting star,&#34; but the sun had been up for an hour.  It was foggy, but I could still see the blue sky clearly.  It left a short contrail that faded at both ends.  The incident and contrail seemed to close to earth to have been a meteor, even if it were possible to see it during the daylight.<n>

We watched the object for around an hour (at 4:30 am) and then went back to bed. It seemed to wobble, change shape and it definitely changed its brightness. With the binoculars it went from a narrow light too a round light, changed intensity and generally pulsed with a red hue around it. It is the brightest thing that I&#39;ve ever seen in the night sky. We really couldn&#39;t tell how high it was. We were situated in the Richmond District of SF looking East towards Oakland and Berkeley. It could have been over the bay or over SF or even further East. However, it did not appear to be outside of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.Did anyone else see an anomoly in the SF night sky that morning?<n>

When the lights dimmed, I saw a triangular shaped objects with color lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occured on November 26th, 2002 at 9:58 pm.  I lived at the time in a beach Condo in Oceanside, California.  I was alerted by my security light going on down below my beach condo which is on the beach.  I went out onto my deck and could not see any person or thing that triggered the security light.  It was a clear night full of stars.  I was attracted to a brilliant bright light about 35 degrees to the South West out approximately 2,000 yard out over the beach.  All I could see at the moment was the bright light.  At first I thought it was a star but then realized it was too large and too close.  It hovered for a few minutes then started to dim.  As it dimmed I could see all kinds of colored light eminating out from the center.  As it dimmed I could see a diamond shape object that immediately took off directly to the West over the ocean.  A few seconds it returned and then I saw two objects the same size and brillience.  I grabbed my digital camera and started to take pictues.  I then grabbed my 35mm Cannon and took the remaining pictues on the roll.  The second object seemed to dissapear and the first object staged stationary for the remaining of the 35 minute period.  The last object then dimmed, I saw the color triangle and it just took off at an angle and dissapeared to the West.  The size of the triangle object appeared to be the size of a full moon from my vantage point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I talked to a contractor friend building a home next to mine.  He told me he was out flying in his Cessna 174 around the same time the previous night and said the object headed directly for him and caused him to dive down to the ocean level and return to the Oceanside Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent the digital pictures to a company in Irvine to be analyzed.  I was amazed to see the color triangle and a what appeared to be a beam of light from the object to the ocean.  I developed the 35mm pictures but there was nothing but a bright light image on about six pictures.  I sent them off to Irvine and I was told that the same light eminating from the object to the ocean appeared to hit the lense of my 35mm camera. No specific images on the 35mm pictures could be ascertained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after the incident I had a significant headache for about three days.  No other reactions have been noticed.  The object did reappear about two weeks later for an a few moments late one night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my wife had wittnessed object on two occasions in the previous month.  One while driving down High-way 1 from Monterey and the other driving back from Reno, Nevada near the Sierra Nevada Mountains.<n>

Looking out a second floor window facing west.  Was looking for a winter storm that&#39;s forecast for today, Sky has wispy clouds and the half moon is visible.  I noticed X&#39;s in the sky.  As I watched, a large silvery jet at a fairly low altitude flew a pattern crossing a long branch of one of the X&#39;s.  There was a passenger jet higher up, flying northwest, and the contrail was minimal.  There is definitely a storm coming from the northwest.  What would be the purpose of this? I wish I had a camera, because the trails are perfectly straight and the pattern is very consistent.  I kid you not, its tic-tac-toe boards in the sky.<n>

It had no observable wings or tail and looked like a cylinder with slightly rounded ends. It was pale white and seemed translucent like a cloud. It had two, very faint, contrails that were very close together at the rear where the tail would have been. It may have been such a small plane that the wings and tail did not show, like a fighter but is something that I have never seem before. It flew in a straight line quite slowly compared to a normal airliner but didn&#39;t dart about or vary its trajectory, Maybe a plane but if it was it looked like Wonder Womans Translucent plane from my childhood comics<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> slow moving object evolves from a light green colored embryo shape to a full saucer with tent top and wht bulb like trim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object appeared, without the use of camcorder, as a bright white round light the size of a pencil eraser in the Southern skies of Santa Fe. As I started to film, the object looked like it was starting to fry like an egg until you started to see the bottom appear to start rolling up from the bottom. The object all the while started to pitch a pointed roof on top as the bottom rolled up to the middle where there was a slow revolving red light. As it continued slowly rotating, the pitch of the roof started to flatten out as round folding table top looking wings started to develop. The object then evolved itself into an object that looked much like a garlic or acorn. This means that the pitched roof on top of object sucked itself in like a flexible piece of aluminum while the bottom body remained looking like the bottom part of a garlic. As I continued to film for 15 minutes more, the object flattened out for another 3 to 4 minutes, meaning you could no longer see the top at all, however, the bottom finally started to flatten itself out horizontally like the traditional frisby like looking disk. As I filmed for another 3 to 4 minutes, the object popped (or should I say sprouted) it&#39;s roof up from the inside up then out just like a mushroom or a volcano. Once the new top was on the craft, you could see  small little white light-bulb looking type fixtures around the trim of the disk. The bulbs appear to be revolving or e-volving around the craft slowly like maybe 2 to 3 miles an hour. I continue to film this object every morning if skies are clear. I have tried desperately to get help from various individuals from media members to my friend who is a priest. I have cordially invited several individuals to join me as I film but have not been succesful. I don&#39;t know whether they believe I am crazy or if they are having a hard time manipulating all the detail seen on the video? Either way, I appear to be the only one to this point to be enjoying an extra-ordinary show the rest of the world will miss unless they ! finally take a chance and come outside to look.<n>

The reason I am sending this to your database is that I did not know it existed until I got the book, &#34;The worst case Scenario Survival Handbook: Travel, in it is the phoine number and e-mail address of your web site.  I had written the entry on the page about Alien Abductions which was humorous.  Anyway, the fire ball travelled from North by Northeast to a Southwest by Southerly direction, initially it was bright red like the Japanese WW II symbol only on fire with a fiery tail.  It then turned a bright Light green color which was flourescent.  This all lasted 2 minutes near the town of New Salem of of I-72.  I was travelling east bound and the sky was relatively clear with many stars.  But what really caught my eye was the fact that it was slower than a shooting star.  Lats it was BIG, I mean I estimate the head end to be at least 100 feet in diamter and the tail to be 200-50 ft long.  There were no sounds.  I was heading to my brothers house up in Peoria, IL that evening after having left a company meeting in KC.  I was looking forward to thanksgiving and spent an evening pointing some celestial bodies out to my relatives, brothers sister in laws, nephews and nieces.  I am an amteur astronomer.   I am a mathematician-statistian by training and did not believe UFO&#39;s until I saw this.  This was definitely not of earthly origin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is a few days after the annual meteor shower, which peaked on November 18-19 in 2002.  However, a meteor would not last for 2 minutes.  They usually last for just a few seconds.  Moreover, the witness identifies self as an amateur astronomer, so he almost certainly would be able to identify, and quickly rule out, any type of pedestrian celestial event, we suspect.  PD))<n>

Me and my sister are fond of looking up the sky, star gazing when suddenly, an unidentified flying object caught our eye. We thought it was a plane, or a commet or just a simple star. But to our amazement, the star move in a circle, zigzag and a wavy direction or motion. We are still not convinced, until we saw a plane that same night, and the it just move on a straight line. By then, we figured out that it was not a plane, a commet, or a star either. Until now, me, my sister and the rest of her friends belive that it is indeed a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Dripping, a tail, and variable at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving East on US 30 as dark fell.  US 30 runs directly east &amp; west for 40 miles between Tama and Cedar Rapids, Iowa at this location.  I saw a brighter than usual light in the distance a few degrees south of due east through my windshield as I was eastbound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light grew brighter until it appeared like a brilliant Venus would in the morning sky.  It even had a liquid appearance at times just like Venus at its most intense.  After about 5 minutes I noticed that it had not moved relative to the horizon.  This eliminated a plane coming in from a great distance to the Cedar Rapids airport which was almost directly to my S.E. from my positon.  Suddenly the light doubled in intensity and appeared for a time to have a forked tail pointing downward and it seemed to throw off a particle or two.  At one point I thought I saw a faint line coming down from it.  It stayed in the same place for over ten minutes.  It briefly faded down to a bright ball of light but then flared again to a brilliant white shimmering light more than three times the size of Venus.  About twenty miles away the red blinking lights of 1000 foot towers around Cedar Rapids, Iowa were now visible.  This object was twice as high up as their tops.  I estimate that it was 15 miles Southeast of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Highway 30 turns SE as it approaches the outskirts of Cedar Rapids and at this point the light disappeared or went out.  It reminded me somewhat of the Rendlesham, England sightings as it appeared to be fluid in its shimmering.  It was above the point in the atmosphere at which rising stars shimmer and are magnified by passing through the atmosphere.  As I drove straight east for over twenty minutes this light did not change its location at all.  A moving plane on a flight path would have shown some change relative to my own movement.  The variation in intensitiy of the light also argues against a hovering helicopter.  It may have been farther away also and much higher up but it had to be at least  2000 feet up compared to the 1000 foot plus communication towers in the distance.  It had an appearance similar to the &#34;Star of Bethlehem&#34; pictures we have seen at some point in our lives.  I have just checked star charts and verified that Venus is now a morning star.  I am a long time amateur as! tronomer and  can verify that this was not Jupiter or any star.<n>

The lead ship was flying very sporatically moving up and down and sided to side like it was survaying the ground. All three ships stayed very close to each other. When they past the moons light I lost them. I waited about an hour following the moons movement and sure enough they passed going in the opposite direction. I though maybe it might have been a satalite but I ruled that out when I saw them again in the opposite directions. They were moving fairly quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have requested more information about the incident.  PD))<n>

The light dimmed as a falling star may.  I think at first I thought it was a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking in that spot that the light came from, and it had a mass.  The mass was really deep in contrast to the sky.  The haze from the sky did not match the mass, so it was really out of place.  Especially seeing the light for that one second, then the mass the other second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mass was clear, it looked like a submarine, but in terms of size their is no way of telling the proportions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel like I looked up at a time when it was only visible travelling at that speed.  It was gone when I checked again, and there is still no site.  I guess it is something that you have heard before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really into the moon changes, and star constallations, and this is something that was too quiet to be a jet and to fast for making no noise at all.  It was not a aircraft, it was nothing, just a shape of dark contrast that was flying probably around ten thousand feet, making no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was desperate to know what it really was, so i kept looking. It got boring after a while. a couple minutes later i turn back and the object was turning, going the other way. This continued about 7 times. the UFO was going around in a circle about 7 or 8 times and it could have been the air force but I think it is very unusual for something go to in the air 7 times in the same area. The object was blinking and dissapearing for a second, then blinked again and came back. The color of it was red.<n>

Its then When my I called my brother Attie, and he saw this aswell.  The object hovered for about 2 - 3 minutes like that, then another object aproached the hovering object, and they shot off again.  I saw the same thing on TV 2 or 3 weeks ago.  The objects were about 2 to 3 km above me.  Dont think its aliens, but definitly something thats able to move far beyond 2000km/h.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved quickly over my head and the vanished into the clouds.  This was about 5 minutes before the sun began to come up.  My friend saw it to, so i know i wasn&#39;t seeing something normal.<n>

I looked into the Northern part of the sky and saw a small, white dot in the sky moving rather slowly no flashing of lights, no colored lights, no cascading of any kind. This was a couple miles away, there were no sounds. It was traveling from the North where I first saw it to the West, towards Johnstown, PA. It seemed to mostly stay at the same speed but at varoius times it did decelerate when its speed increased it was where it left off no faster. It also kept it&#39;s original level flightline moving from my right to left. I was looking at it through binoculars and was moving laterally with it. About half way through this it either stopped or was now moving directly away from me. In my opinion it stopped because it didn&#39;t become smaller and harder to see. There was intermitent clouds but all in all it was clear and cool with a full moon. After it stopped it started to move back to where it was coming from the North. The speed seemed a little more accelerated at this point. Again same level flightpath. I kept viewing it while continuously moving to my left to get a better view. I also had to do this because it was going behind some large trees in my neighbors yard. I then lost total site of it but at that moment two other lights appeard where it seemed to stop one headed west one north. I stayed with the westward one because it was easier to view. This did flash white and red and could have been a plane. Whether or not it was something this object ejected or a plane I do not know. This isn&#39;t the first time I encountered strange things in the sky over the years. I have had 3 seperate encounters that makes this fourth one seem like nothing!<n>

Initially I was attracted by a series of reddish flashing/shimmering lights, arranged in 3 groups - forming the corners of a large triangle.  The lights moved from the corners down the edges of the object, then reaccumulated back at the corners.  I watched this object for appx. 2 minutes, and as I watched, it passed in front of several stars, verifying it&#39;s solidity between the 3 corners of lights.  It moved quite slowly and consistently from East to West, about 30 degrees above the Northern Horizon.  Before passing behind a stand of trees, 2 large spotlights appeared on the rear end of the object.  The spots moved in large, circular motions before disappearing.  I lost sight of the object after it went behind the stand of trees.  It made no sound that I could hear.  With no reference besides the trees and stars, I&#39;m hesitant to hazard a guess at the size of the object, but my intial feeling is that it was quite large - perhaps 100 on each edge.<n>

Wash.  Shortly after midnight, I was turning off the lights in my living room when a bright light caught the corner of my eye as a cloud illuminated, in which a round bright object bolted out from it (South to North).  It sped at a VERY fast speed over Boeing where it then shot upward and disappeared into either another cloud or it just vanished into thin air.  It could not have been an aircraft as it was completely silent and it was moving too fast.  It was moving too fast to be anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1-1/2 years ago, I experienced another incident that I reported to the National UFO Reporting Center via phone, but no one called me back.  I was living in Kirkland at that time and was awoken by a beam of light in my window and a loud &#34;swish-swish-swish&#34; noise.  The VCR was turning on-and-off by itself.  I woke up my boyfriend who was as startled as I.  The next thing we remember is waking up in the morning. The clocks were off by 3 hours.  I called Puget Sound Energy, but no outages had been reported that night. Then I noticed that there was a small purple crescent-shape on my right shoulder.  It looked like a tattoo and it eventually faded after about a month.<n>

It was dark outside but it was clear and the stars were visible. Although there were many trees around there was an open field around me for at least 500 to 700 meters. I saw out fo the corner of my eye an object with no other lights except a dull green color. I know that most aircraft have red, and plain white lights with at least one blinking light on either wing. The object was at least 300 to 400 meters ahead of me flying at least 500 feet or tree top level from a south to north direction. I pulled over on the side of the road and noticed through my sunroof that the aircraft was diamond shape with 4 dull green lights at each corner. There were no discernible details ofthe aircraft but I could see its shape against the sky. As I rolled the window down the aircraft had already crossed my path, but I heard no engines or propellers. The aircraft just left without a sound. I have just fin ished a 20 year hitch in the Army, I have jumped out of C130, C141, and other rotary aircraft and know what they sound like. But this aircraft left no type of exhaust or other sound signature behind. I never beleived in UFOs untill now. Ft. Bragg and Pope air Force Base are only 50 miles away, but their aircraft fly through this airspace all the time. These aircraft do not I repeat do not fly as low as this aircraft flew.<n>

It was also extremely quiet out with no extraneous sounds observed.  I saw an object that seemed to have three lights on it and at first thought it was an airplane inbound to Bloomington airport.  I noticed a beam of light extending from the front of the craft which I assumed was landing lights.  The beam extended such a distance that I called my partner outside to observe the light trail.  The object did not appear to be moving, so I assumed it was heading towards me.  After a few minutes, the object moved roughly 10 degrees horizontally to the west, then a few degrees back to east, and then again a few degrees to the west.  At this point the craft came again to a standstill.  It then began to drop slowly towards the ground and was occluded by a line of trees.  This is the last I saw of the craft.  As a last note, I noticed strange cloud formations that seemed to lead to the original location of the object.  While this could have been coincidence, the clouds looked like an entry trail.<n>

(160 degrees magnetic and approx. 20 degrees above the horizon. My house is approx 1 mile NW of the Pollock Post Office and situated at 3200 ft. ASL.) When I viewed the light through my 7 power binoculars, it appeared as a bright light that was about 1/8&#34; in diameter. The edge of the light was clearly defined.  The object stayed stationary during the time we were able to view it, 20 minutes, and then was obscured by clouds.  My wife thought she saw a red light circling the light - that is it would disappear on the right side and then reappear on the left side.  When she gave me the binoculars, clouds obscurred the object before I could see the red light.  During the last 5 minutes of viewing the light seemed to take on a crescent shape - like a sphere the is being illuminated by the Sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to check again tomorrow morning, or on the next clear morning, to see if the object is visible again.

11/19/02 05:45|Lake Panasoffkee|FL|Other|15 min|Moving starlike objects|11/20/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26138.html|108|ndxe200211| Moving starlike objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background first: I am a 20 year AF vet., pilot and aircraft owner 67 years of age. I have never seen a UFO although I have been looking for one for a long time. Early this morning from about 0520 to 0610 I was out in an open field watching the Leonid meteor showers. At approximately 0545 I noticed a bright, very high object traveling across the sky. I was standing at the edge of a treeline to my back, which blocked my view from the SSE to the NNW. When I noticed the first object it appeared in the sky about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, the moon would have been about 30 degrees to my right. It traveled in a straight line across the sky. Since the sun was about to come up I could see the arc of light that the sun made in the eastern sky. The arc extended from the ENE to ESE. The first object traveled across the sky ENE. I first took it to be a satellite but I have seen satellites before and this one seemed to travel faster than the ones I have seen before. As it reached the upper edge of the arc the sun made it disappeared from view. About 5 minutes later another bright object appeared in the same area of the sky and traveled in the same direction, same speed and the same altitude as the first. It disappeared from my view in the same area of the sky, which would have been about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon. I think the thickness of the atmosphere caused it to be hidden to my view. All this time I was seeing the meteors as they entered the atmosphere and burned up. The third object appeared in about the same area as the first two about 5 minutes later but traveled more in an easterly direction. I know there is a lot of space junk in orbit so I can’t discount that. But I don’t think that many satellites would have traveled across the sky that close together in time. It took the objects about 20 seconds to travel the distance that I was able to observe them. There were other aircraft in the sky at the same time but they were airliners and much, much lower in altitude. Do satellites orbit ! in this direction and do they orbit in these numbers and this close in time? The objects were definitely not meteors or aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing satellites, which were being illuminated by the rising Sun in the east.  However, please see other reports for this date, which seem equally serious-minded, and which apparently do not describe orbitting satellites.  PD))<n>

The objects were a dimly lit orange. They traversed the sky (from North to South) in seven seconds or so. They made no noise or trail. They held formation. This is my first sighting. Just curious if there were any other reports of this since so many eyes were viewing the event. It also happened at the so called &#34;peak&#34; of the event(05:30-05:40 am). Conditions were clear (no clouds). Formation looked like this: ^ ^ ^<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

In the process of watching the sky my daughter thought she saw a star move across the sky.  She asked me to look and to my surprise I also saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky.  It was not a shooting star because it did not seem to be falling but moving in a horizontal direction over the sky.  As we were watching this happen we saw another object, that also looked like a star moving towards the first object.  We continued watching and proceeded to notice several of these star looking objects moving all around.  They appeared to stay in pairs except for one that stayed seperate from the others.  As we watched them move we saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight and seem to be suspended in air.  They would make right angle turns and also appeared to be doing 360 circles within there air space.  They were not spinning in one spot but literally doing a full circle in the area and would go from that motion into either a 90 degree turn or shoot straight across the sky.  They almost appeared to be &#34;dancing&#34; across the sky but always within what seemed to be their &#34;area of space&#34; and in pairs except for the lone &#34;star.&#34;  It was simply amazing.  My daughter and I woke my husband up and he too came out and saw the phenomena.  My husband was in the Marines for several years and I know that there is nothing yet that can make such amazing movements and seem to suspend in air after a immediate stop in mid-movement.  These object did not fly down or come even remotely close for us to see them as anything more than waht appeared as &#34;stars&#34; that moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family has never in our life seen anything that we would even say has come close to a UFO so we are not used to this, admittedly we were a little &#34;freaked&#34; out yet completely amazaed and unafriad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always beleived that it is very arrogant to have the frame of mind that in all the vast spanse of space the earth is the only place where life of any form can be found so I do think that what I saw is for real and not something from this planet.  I just feel priviliged that I now have a personal experience with this type of phenomena.  I can only hope that we were able to catch it on video--I am only worried that they were so far up in the atmosphere that it will not show up.  I will be checking tonight when I get home from work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this date.  PD))<n>

After a while, a V-shaped formation of approximately 5-10 lights flew overhead in perfect formation.  Both leg&#39;s of the &#34;v&#34; were perfectly straight with one light in the front leading them.  The &#34;v&#34; flew with the convergence point pointing forward.  It flew from north to south.  The lights traveled quickly, probably not any airplane formation, since it made no sound.  The lights lasted about 10 seconds and the disappeared behind the roofs of other houses.  A picture was taken, but the environment was too dark, and the nothing can be seen.  The distance of the object from the ground could not be determined.  Later during the day, at school, another student claimed to see lights flying in a v-formation.<n>

I estimate the craft to be 150 to 100 feet in length, traveling at a speed of 300 to 400 mph at an altitude of 1500 to 2000 feet, and emitted no sound. There were circular, dimly lit, pink-orange lights on each corner of the object. No other light was being emitted from the craft. The object was solid and cast a definitive triangular shape against the night sky, blocking out stars as it passed by. The object appeared to be matte-black in color and had no distinguishable detail other than some contrasting color that was situated in the center of its triangular shape.

However, if the object moved, as reported below, the object could not have been a star, of course.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Large Glowing Orange Ball &amp; Meteor Shower<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me say that I would have bet my life on the fact that I would never be reporting a sighting or anything resembling a UFO. It&#39;s taken me 4 days to get enough courage to even begin to explain what all I saw in the early morning hours of Nov. 19, 2002, approx 13 miles Southeast of Stover, Mo. First let me say that on this date, it is also Deer hunting season in Mo. At approx 1:30 AM my neighbor &amp; I set out for a neighboring field where we usually hunt. We had left early so we could have a good view of the Leonid Meteor Shower and not have to venture far afterwards for hunting. We parked my truck at the west end of the field facing West as we were trying to get the light of the full moon behind us as the &#34;showers&#34; were to be best viewed from the East. We got in the bed of the truck with heavy sleeping bags that would hopefully keep us warm as I wanted the best view possible and boy did I get it. The beginning of the unusual sightings were not that impressive but changed quickly so now I&#39;ll try &amp; explain what I saw. At approx 3:00-3:30 we saw what we first thought to be a plane rise from the tree tops on the west side of the field,(It had a milkly like appearance &amp; was kind of pear shaped with what looked like 2 legs at the bottom) but there was no sound. This was approx 150-200 yds away. We both looked at each other like what is that!! It hovered there for about 30 seconds and then slowly rose straight up &amp; very slowly headed South until out of site. Then every once in awhile you could see faint white objects resembling kind of the same shape just going back &amp; forth accross the sky at different speeds &amp; with no set pattern. At approx 4:15 at the southeast end of the field at ground level I saw what looked like a porch light or headlights through the trees. This area is completely wooded with no homes or buildings nearby. In maybe a 5 min span it flickered on &amp; off 4-5 times then this HUGE GLOWING ORANGE BALL rose right out of the trees &amp; stayed right at the tree tops swaying just a little back &amp; ! forth an d never any sound at all. I wish I could accurately tell you how big it was but all I can save was it was unbelievable. I looked back over my shoulder once at the moon and this ball appeared to be maybe 1/3 the size BUT the Moon was a long way off and this ball was only about 800 yds away. Anyway this stayed in same position for about 10 minutes then rose up slowly about 80-100 ft or so &amp; then just changed to a BRIGHT WHITE still in a ball shape. During the next 30 min it rose maybe 30-40 feet &amp; then gradually changed its shape into kind of a rounded triangle or pear shaped with a pulsating light (only visible at times)from what looked to be a small protruding area on the center bottom. At 3 different times when this light would come on &amp; back off it would then make the easterly sky appear as if daylight was approaching but just lasting a few seconds. The figure gradually rose straight up with a Very slight drift to the Southeast. This was a very bright &amp; clear night and at 7:15 AM you could still see the object high in the sky but appeared to be a ball shape again. Also at about the same time the ball turned from orange to white a jet appeared from the west flying fairly low &amp; at slower than normal speed, and what I thought to be an irregular pattern of the normal blinking lights that planes have when flying. Then it appeared to be stationary for 2-3 seconds &amp; then at a high rate of speed it shot straight up &amp; then immediately veered right &amp; headed down directly towards the ball &amp; then flew right around the back of it. Then went back east with a jet stream behind it as if nothing was unusual but within 5 minutes there was 5 or 6 jets in the air but none went as close as the first one had. They all had jet streams behind them &amp; just kept flying randomly overhead until the object was just barely visible. The following morning at about daybreak 2 neighbors went within a mile of there &amp; said they just saw a solid looking white ball fairly high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UPDATE: 11/24/02  I finally got up enough nerve to go back to the same spot to see if I might be to see this again &amp; maybe take a few pictures. At 4:35 I saw the orange ball again &amp; it appeared to be low but at a much farther distance. It immediately started rising up &amp; went white &amp; within 30 minutes or so it was so far up it almost looked like a bright star but was much bolder &amp; solid looking than a star. It almost looked like it changed shape &amp; also appeared to get brighter at times, but it was to far away to be certain of this. I took 4 pictures with my old 35 mm but as far away as it was I doubt if it shows much as it was hard to even detect it thru the lens. I&#39;m sure this all sounds very weird but I give you my word this is the Gods truth. I was absolutely scared to death when the jet headed towards the ball as I had no idea what was going to happen. I&#39;m hoping someone else spotted the same objects that I did!!!<n>

Time from initial discovery to loss of visual contact was about 20 seconds. The object had a strange sort of movement that I think can best be described as a jerky, low frame rate film with maybe 1/30 second gaps between movements. The color shifted from gold to brown to orange. The overall effect was a muddy orange coloration. The objects direction was straight at first, almost like a satelite&#39;s but traveling at about 2 1/2 times faster across the sky than a satelite would normally be seen travelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object turned slightly south east for the last five seconds that it was seen. The object slightly dimmed after the small change in direction for about two seconds. It then turned SSE for no more than probably 1/4 second and instantly vanished completely. During the first five seconds or so, I was looking at the object with my naked eye. For the next maybe 15 seconds, I followed the object with my 15 x 70 astronomical binoculars. Visually the object looked like a dim but larger than Jupiter object with light intensity changing +/- by as much as 1/3. When seen through my binoculars, it had a totally different look. Through the binoculars the object looked like a giant autumn leaf flying through the air as though alive. Again, while seen through the binoculars, the object had a beatifully fluid although slow frame rate movement. I say fluid because the frame rate of the movements remained pretty consistent. I am a serious amateur astronomer and spend about 8 hrs a week observing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded credible, and we believe he probably is an exceptional eyewitness.

Because of the full moon and because of city lights visibility was very good. While looking northeast we noticed what looked like a string-like cloud in the very distinct shape of a bommerang moving towards us. It immediately caught our eye because it hung so low for a cloud and it moved at a steady clip. We kept watching it expecting it to dissipate but instead it continued on a steady path southward and began morphing into different shapes, ungulating as it moved in the way a deep-sea jelly fish might move. But this thing was much more elastic, at once spreading out like a string then shaping into a V, curling its tails around then gathering into more of a cloud shape and again stretching out. It sometimes broke up into little tails or simply stretched out uniformly, like someone pulling at taffy. It felt as if it was scanning the city, never rising, never dropping, justing floating by at a constant speed completely silent. We thought we saw faint lights at the ends of the tails and it shimmering in general. We also smelled a distinct acrid burn in the air, almost like an electrical fire, that would appear, disappear then reappear (in keeping with the ungulating nature of movement?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first reaction was it had something to do with the meteor showers, a &#34;terminal burst in the lower atmosphere&#34;. But then, not knowing what that looks like, I would expect that to have the characteristic of linear progression i.e. dying out, like striking a match. Instead this thing was in no way disappearing. It had the feeling of  living matter and we watched it continue its path through the city till it passed from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded credible to us.

It was moving at the speed of a commercial airliner. It was &#34;V&#34; shaped and there was no sound coming from the object. There was several colors of light along the entire &#34;V&#34;. I observed the object moving in a North East direction for several minutes. As the object moved away no sound was ever heard coming from the object such as would be in the case of a jet or prop plane. It was a very clear night with a full moon. The only sound heard was dogs barking from a distance. When first observed the lights at the left end of the &#34;V&#34; shape from the rear seemed to be spinning in a circular motion.<n>

They appeared to be as high as the stars. (Not airplane height but way higher)The 2 stars appeared to be 2 orange hazes lights moving parallel with each other. Than it stopped, suddenly shot foward again parallel, than stopped again. The 2 lights started to circle each other (like a figure eight pattern) Than they shot across the sky again, stopping and zig-zagging. Both lights staying close with in each other. I told my wife to look up I think its a ufo. See couldn&#39;t find the lights and they began to zig-zag, stop and go &amp; disappeared. I thought I was seeing things, but I know I saw something, But what? I have chills as I write this. It was not a satelite, meteor or airplane.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> An erratically moving object was observed during the NASA Channel&#39;s live broadcast of the Leonid meteor shower 11/18/2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember if I reported this to you before -- I recall posting this information to a web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early on the morning of the 2001 Leonid meteor shower (11/18/2001), about 1:30 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. or so, I had driven to a ridgeline near my home in Lake Arrowhead CA.  I watched the meteor storm, saw several hundred meteors and a great number of fireballs (some of which buzzed with audible radio waves).  I drove back home and turned on the NASA Channel&#39;s live coverage.  Thinking that my kids, who were at my ex-wife&#39;s house, might not have gone out to watch the meteor shower, I plugged a videotape in to my VCR and taped the coverage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was more hoping that the droning voices would put me to sleep, but I was also enjoying what was an incredible light show.  At about 4:00 or 4:30 a.m., I was still watching the coverage.  I believe the feed was from Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, but I&#39;m not certain of that.  As I watched the coverage, a dot of light moved slowly across the screen.  I remember thinking, &#34;Oh cool, they&#39;ve got a satellite on there!&#34; and it looked very much like a satellite -- a dot of light moving very steadily in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;dot of light moving in one direction&#34; then veered at a sharp angle and began moving away, then changed course again.  I must&#39;ve had the dumbest look on my face.  My jaw dropped, and I said, &#34;Son of a bitch -- that&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  I kept watching as it moved away from the field of view of the televised telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the shot was stationary.  I assume the telescope tracked very slowly to keep the radiant of the shower centered, but the camera/telescope wasn&#39;t moving -- it was this object that was moving.  No satellite can make changes in direction that acutely, nor can any aircraft.  As I mentioned, it gave the apearance of a distant satellite, but its movement was definitely atypical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My videotape, BTW, burned when my home was lost in the October 29, 2003 Old Fire in the San Bernardino Mountains.  I wish I still had it, for on it was incontrovertible proof to me that something odd was in the skies that morning.  I don&#39;t know if anyone else has videotapes of that broadcast, but if they are available, I&#39;d sure love to have a replacement copy!  I have to say I&#39;ve always been a skeptic.  I felt that way about religion, too -- if I saw a burning bush or if God booked a showing on Larry King Live, then I&#39;d be convinced.  I do not know what it was I saw that morning, but I&#39;m certain someone somewhere also recorded that live broadcast by NASA and has this on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:<n>

I don&#39;t know much about astronomy, but I look at the sky a lot at night.  As I stared, I realized it was moving very slowly.  No flashing lights like a plane, and much too slowly.  About 15 minutes passed as I watched it.  As I realized it was getting brighter, it sped up, and looked like it was fading.  About 2 seconds later, it was gone.  It had travelled about 4 times the distance it had traversed in the last 15 minutes in that final move.  Then it was gone.<n>

I also knew that it was diamond shaped because of the sillouette it made against the starlit sky. It was quite high up but was moving very fast indeed.

I was looking to the northwest and saw a fast streak of fire light.  That light looked close to the earth.  Next I say a bright light that seemed to move through the trees and bushes. IT looked to head to the southeast.  The lights seemed to go low and then dured into a pale glow. Then it seemed to go out like a flash light with a low battery. Now that fast streak of fire light, it was in the shape of a line(not a strait line but a line) The shape of the craft was unseen. The sky was clear, the wind was low, It wasnt very cold out.  No fog, no mist. The only people around was my cousin sister and father. The only people that say the fast streak of fire light was me and my cousin. The others only saw the bright light moving to the southeast, and then go out like a flashlight with a low battery.<n>

I played the recording for several people, and they have never heard anything like it before either.  I called a local computer store, played it for them, they said the same thing.  I am wondering if I could get you to listen to it as well?  It is rather a strange sound.  I cannot get my sound recorder to work, or I would have recorded it on there.  I recorded it on my portable tape recorder, by placing the recorder by the speakers.  I would really like to know what this sound was and where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have listened to the sound, and it may be a garbled voice, transmitting on single side band.

There were two lights as headlights with a pale green tinge to the light.  The object did not change in any way as I approached.  As I drew closer  near 122nd street and the exit from the Kilpatrick turnpike I could see, looking up at about a 45 degree angle the object the lights were attached to.  The object was black, and cylindrical with two small wings or fins on the body.  The headlights were in front of the body.  The object was blimp like and my first description which still seems accurate is that of a large catfish.  The object was about 6 car lengths long and about 4 car lengths wide.  The black color was a matte finish as opposed to the glossier finish of the sky.  The object had texture as black felt against black satin of the sky would look.  The object was completely stationary.  When I exited at Memorial road, I was directly underneath the last placement of the object but I could no longer see it.  Tinker Air Force Base in in the vicinity, and I do not know if this object is domestic or alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite lucid and objective in her description of what she had seen.

It was a block or two away, and it was up a bit higher than the treetops.       I stared at it believing it must be tethered to a used car lot or something, but it looked way stranger than anything like that; it actually looked like a fat flying saucer - almost like a little, tiny Saturn - however, it wasn&#39;t silver, it was covered with very bright lights, a light gold color.  The &#34;ring&#34; around it was also lit up and much smaller than anything in the old sci-fi movies of the fifties.         I couldn&#39;t pull over as there was nowhere to go and I would have caused an accident, so I kept my eye on it for the next several seconds till I lost sight of it due to trees and surrounding buildings.        It never scared me because it looked harmless as if there were a logical explanation for it, which, of course, I thought there had to be.  During the next several seconds while I&#39;d lost sight of it, I wondered whether maybe a blimp could have &#34;dressed up&#34; as a flying saucer for some kind of promotional.  When I saw it again, it was about a mile or two away traveling south.  There was no way a blimp moves that fast or has the shape that I saw.  It was perfectly round with a small ring around it and clearly was not tied to any structure.  Still riding in my car after a few foiled attempts to pull over, I lost sight of it completely.  Somebody else had to have seen it.  It was above a densely populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Distance indeterminate.  Objects were about the size of a B-B held at arm&#39;s length.  At first I thought they were a group of approaching aircraft as just 5 minutes earlier three bi-planes (flying in echelon formation)had approached from the same direction and area of the sky heading north.   However, the six dark objects seemed to stop and hover at about 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon and then assumed (while hovering) a U-shaped fromation.  They held that formation and postion for ten to fifteen minutes remaining completely stationary.  Then one-by-one the objects moved slowly away from the group to the west about 10 or 15 degrees when they seemed to be obsured by clouds.  As the clouds appeared to be of the high altitude variety, I assumed the objects to have been quite large to be visible from that altitude.  There were no lights and no sounds.  Visiblillity was almost unlimited.  Dry weather.<n>

I had just taken a picture of a commercial jet travelling west to either Perth or Adelaide simply because I liked the look of the vapour trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started watching two feathers floating in the air. They were joined by a spider web and meandered about on the very light breeze. There was not a cloud in the sky. I then spotted what I thought was another white feather or possibly a thistle down floating in the same vicinity. The quite odd thing about this object was that it wasn&#39;t floating about aimlessly like a wind born object, it was going dead straight from west to east across the sky. It was difficult to focus on because it was a fair distance away. I stared at it for a few seconds before realizing that I&#39;d better take a picture. I moved out onto the lawn I took one photograph despite the size and distance. As I stared at it longer it diminished in size and eventually stopped eastward movement. I realized that it was heading directly upward from my position at this stage.

I was at my high school working on our drama clubs latest production.  I was getting a ride home from one of my upper classmen friends in his mini-van just talking and stuff.  I looked behind me out the back window, and there was a big triangle shaped craft over downtown.  It was really low, because the clouds are extremely low tonight, and it was flying well below them.  It was triangle shaped, with alternating red, blue, and pulsing white lights on each angle.  At first it looked like just a plane. Like a cessna or something.  But all of a sudden it did this weird dead stop, and just did a complete v turn in the opposite direction.  It sped off really fast but turned around again, like it was circling something.  My friends didn&#39;t believe me and didn&#39;t look, but I know what I saw.  My house isnt far from the sighting, and I sat in my driveway watching for a while.  I&#39;ve seen things like this before, one time an object almost exactly the same passed over my house, just above my tree, then 3 others followed it, but ive never seen one do a turn like that and then speed up.  Anyway, I soon went in, but as far as I know, its still cirling down town.  It may be coincidence, but last night there was a fire at a house near mine close too downtown, 3 brothers were killed in the fire, but they have no idea how it started, its absolutely puzzled them as too the cause.  Probaly a coincidence, but Im so shooken up, my mind is racing faster than my hands.  Never the less, i&#39;m going too go out and look again.  My curiosity is getting the better of me. Nothing, nothing at all.  It&#39;s now about 10:30, and as far as i can tell, there is no siqn of the craft, an interesting note though, I thought i heard the roar of scrambling F-16&#39;s, I&#39;ve been down too wright-patterson, i know what they sound like, and it damn well sounds like them out there.  Anyway, this is all i can say for now, but ill keep watching over the night.  Please believe me, i am not making any of this up, i only hope someone else saw the ! same thi ng.<n>

It also made unusual side to side and sweeping maneuvers and was simultaneously shooting blue streaks of light at the ground underneath it which caused small dust clouds to jump around. We had stopped at the side of the road and were outside of our van watching this object and basically both concuded that this flying object was making movements that no craft we knew of could make. After about 10 minutes of our watching this object it suddenly shot straight upward and disappeared frow our view. We did not report this sooner as we did not know of this internet site and after awhile could not remember the exact date as we had made a lot of trips between Los Angeles and Arizona during a two month period to buy property. We are now aware that there is a USMC testing base in that area but do not believe this was a military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/15/02 17:30|Arcata|CA|Light|10 min|Four globes of light in formation|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47424.html|159|ndxe200211| Four globes of light in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, let me apologise for the approximation on the day and time.  Though I cannot remember the exact d/t, based upon where our lives were at the time, I do know that it had to be fall of the academic year 2002-2003.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just picked up my daughter at around 5:15 or so, and we were heading home to Blue Lake via Jane&#39;s Road/Guintoli Road in the northern reaches of Arcata, CA. (in a development area called Valley West).  The sun had set, the sky  was darkening to a deep purple, but there was still enough sky light that the hills to the northeast were clearly silhouetted, with some slope details still visible.  There were a very few stars starting to show the skylight combined with a hazy sky allowed only the very brightest to emerge at that time.  It was this paucity of stars that brought my attention to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading north, approaching the point where Jane&#39;s Rd curves east to become Guintoli, when I noticed a formation of 4 very bright stars over the hills just northeast of us.  As we began climbing the overpass that Guintoli takes over US 101, I could see these stars more clearly and thought that there was something odd.  I interpreted them as a familiar constellation made peculiar by the selective manner in which the atmospheric conditions permitted its bright stars to appear earlier than the rest.  Honestly, I thought I was looking at the Big Dipper, but only its brightest components.  Still, they were preternaturally bright and they didn&#39;t seem high enough in the sky to be the Dipper.  I grew very puzzled and unsure of what I was looking at.  I called my daughter&#39;s attention to the &#34;stars.&#34; Apparently she had already noticed them and was also trying to figure out what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, there was no place to pull over and observe.  However, we got the definite impression that these &#34;stars,&#34; these lights, were moving.  What other real stars we could see were not near enough to confirm this.  Our direction was toward the lights, with those northeast hills between us and them, so there was not much in the way of lateral relative motion, making absolute motion easier to detect.  Since I was driving, I couldn&#39;t watch steadily, but my daughter could.  She was able to tell, after a little while, that they were  moving as a solid group as if in formation.  There was a stop sign along our route, and we were able to briefy watch them, and yes, they were definately moving in a northerly direction, perhaps somewhat east of north since they seem to be moving inland slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is an airport in a town not far to the north (McKinleyville), and I thought maybe we were seeing some kind of commercial aircraft or maybe something being flown by the Coast Guard which has its Air Station next door to the airport.  We dismissed these possibilities after watching while paused at the stop.  These lights did not flash nor pulse, and they were large, opaque, globular, almost solid looking, if light can be said to look solid.  Their color was a brilliant white, no other colors, no prismatic effects, no bluish or reddish hue, just white like wedding cake frosting.  They were not phosphorescent or neon-like, not fluorescent, but more like incandescent, though that&#39;s not quite right either.  They did not twinkle, nor dance, nor do any of the things that starlight does under atmospheric influence, they were dead steady.  In size, they appeared to be slightly larger than a large bright planet, Jupiter, on one its closer approaches, maybe, but clearer, with more well-defined edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we were travelling in a car, we don&#39;t know if they emitted a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded on through the interesection, and I began looking for a place I could pull over to watch the lights.  We turned off Guintoli onto State 299 (the hwy we would take home), trying to keep the lights in view.  The lights&#39; altitude was low enough and our relative positions and vectors were such that those hills rapidly got in the way.  As we were passing the lights (yes, rapid paralax changes also clued us in to just how close and low the lights really were), seeking a way off the road, one light suddenly disengaged itself from the formation and arced over its neighbor in a smooth curve.  Before we could see the final shape of the maneuver and the resulting formation, the crest of the hills and its trees obscured our view completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swung off onto a side road that would take us back the way we came, got back onto 101, and headed north toward the neighboring town, McKinleyville.  I had hoped that since the lights were heading more or less north and didn&#39;t seem to be in a big hurry, that we could pick them up again and watch them some more.  Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten back to 101, the lights were gone, either too far to the east to see past the hills, or they simply disappeared like these things have a tendency to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so excited that I phoned by son as soon as we got home.  He sees odd lights and objects all the time, so I knew he&#39;d be interested in this.  As it turned out, he and his girlfriend had seen two simliar lights over Eureka just minutes before we first spotted our lights over north Arcata/Valley West.  This is why I put 4 witnesses in parentheses, if they were the same lights, then four of us saw them, not just two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to him and his girlfriend, they were in my mom&#39;s back yard watching the sunset.  The house is in west-central Eureka.  Not long after the sun had disappeared, his girlfriend noticed an odd bright light approaching from, if I remember right, the west, and my son saw one coming in from the south. The sky was still fairly bright for them, and these lights were quite brilliant despite the light sky. Note: At this latitude, at that time of the year, there are no long lingering sunsets, the sun would have fallen to the horizon as if gut-shot and the sky darken within 15 minutes or less.  That means their sighting could not have preceded ours by more than a quarter hour.  The two lights approached each other, one fell in behind the other, and both continued on in a northerly direction, heading toward Humboldt Bay, which lies between Eureka and Arcata.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sounded like two of the very same lights that my daughter and I observed.  We surmised that they picked up two other companions somewhere between Eureka and north Arcata, and continued on north/northeast where we saw them disappear into the hills which skirt the eastern frontage of our coastal towns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you look on a map of northern Califormia, you will see that Eureka, Humboldt Bay, Arcata, and McKinleyville line the coast only a few miles from each other.  I will try to create a map of our sighting and mail it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our family has had a lot of weird sightings and other &#34;paranormal&#34; events.  I&#39;ve often thought of writing them all down and sending them to someone doing research into these things who is looking for raw data, but I wouldn&#39;t know who to send them to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found your sight while looking for information on anomalous sky flashes such as the one our area experienced last Sunday.  (That has been explained, apparently, there were distant witnesses who saw a bolide).  If you would be interested in any other reports for your stats or whatever, let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I would like to know is if you received any reports of these same lights from this general area, or points north of here.  There was nothing in our local paper and I&#39;ve not heard of anyone else who saw them.  My son is wondering if this isn&#39;t an example of the &#34;Pearl Necklace&#34; that has been seen in times past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Routine event of every evening was underway, when this writer made usual glance into above sky to determine weather conditions; (area is rurual).  After walking a few feet, while looking into the sky, suddenly a white and yellow lit oval object came into view.  It was approaching the NW sky from the NE area, at approximately 10,000 feet.  The front of the oval was bright blue, shining like a mica type color would, in a reflective way.  The object disappeared from sight as it made a gentle arc in the sky, but it did not disappear on the horizon level, but some distance above.  The moon was almost full this evening, but paled in comparison to the brilliance of the unknown object.

A minute later a chemjet flew over head leaving a huge ploom of chemtrail almost in the same spot the UFO was hovering!!!coincidence???Very strange sighting<n>

I went down stiars to get on my turn tables like always. At about 4:30am or so I wanted to smoke a cig, but they were out side in the truck. So I then went to get them. As I walked out of the front door I felt like I was being followed. As I got to my truck I looked up into the cold night and saw what seem to be a bright star high above my house. As I got my cigs out of the truck I then looked back up at this bright star when it started to move. It moved side to side at very high speed and then started to back away as if it knew I had seen it. As it moved side to side it started to back away from me and get very tiny as if it didnt want me to see it anymore. Then it was gone. Not sure about what I had just seen I got very scared and ran back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

She saw an orangish yellowish light in the sky to the west of us.  She said that it got brighter on and off and then dimmed out after a few seconds.  I wasn&#39;t sure if she was mistaken or not until she saw it when we were at a traffic light in Comanche and pointed it out to me.  It got bright then dimmed out again.  As we headed toward the west side of town, we saw it again in a different part of the sky, so I&#39;m not sure whether there was just one or if there were more than one. The second time that I saw it, I think I observed a small dark speck in the middle.  It was definitely hundreds if not thousands of feet up, and we are absolutely certain that it wasn&#39;t a plane nor any sort of flare. It remained stationary during each of the sightings.<n>

It had three blinking red lights and it appeared to hover in spots and then zig zag about the sky eventually diving like behind a group of trees. In a few seconds it appeared again off in the distance at an even lower altitude. At the same time another craft like, maybe a plane with a very bright light and what seemed to be  two red flashing lights appeared behind the same group of trees and just seemed to hover there in the air! I have never in my 36 years ever seen a plane with three flashing, not blinking,rather large lights like these!!!      Also for the past 8 or 9 months we have observed a passenger type aircraft with a extremly bright ,huge, double headlight that can also hover in one place for any amount of time. It also can turn on a dime! It doesn&#39;t have to make a large turn like a regular plane. My husband and I have watched it for periods of 20-30 mins.It is strange to watch. At first we noticed it only after 11:00p.m.(I work at night alot).   Now we have recently seen it as early as 7-8p.m. and in different areas around where we live.Do you think it could be some new type of craft that the govt/army might be testing? We do have an Army base nearby. If anyone knows we would like to be informed. I don&#39;t think is really an UFO! It is however something new we have never seen in the skies over middle Georgia!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

I didn&#39;t feel good so I was laying back in the passanger seat looking at the sky my boyfriend driving.  We were driving down Hacienda from the hill when I looked at turnball canyon (a mountain with lots of houses surrounding it) and saw a huge round object with lots of red &amp; white lights around it. At first I thought it was just the houses porch lights or something.  Then I saw the object more clear as we got closer it was round like an upside down charcoal gray bowl with red lights around the rim.  I could see some white lights underneath the object like as if it was looking for something not one beam of light but like little white lights just enough to see very dim.  I didn&#39;t realize that it was a ufo until I saw it move hoovering moving toward the other side of the mountain.  Thats when I yelled &#34;is that a ufo&#34; My boyfirend freaked as he saw it moving to the other side but, he only saw half of it because it was already starting to leave.  Out of excitment, terror, or amazement I stared tearing.  I have no idea why.  This thing was huge maybe as big as an air balloon when you look at it while it is still on the ground. Just as fast as I took that look is how fast it was gone...<n>

My window is facing eastwards. I suddenly saw a small light in the distance- it was like a tiny star-at first i thought it must be s star until it started moving. I then thought that it must be a meteor-but then this was wrong again because it started moving in a strange way-bobbing up and down in the sky and moving all over the place. Because of it&#39;s movement i deduced that it could not be a satellite or a meteor or a plane, helicopter or any other type of known aircraft -i have seen plenty of these in the night sky and it was not like any of those that i&#39;d seen. It was not an illusion for certain- i was so curious that i switched the radio off, jumped out of bed and opened my window-and there it was-travelling across the sky! It was not extremely fast as it took quite a while for it to travel across the sky. It was a very bright object but also distant-so i coudn&#39;t quite make out what it was. It was the queer way in which it moved that puzzled me more than anything- sort of hovering and bouncing up and down! I watched it till it went out of sight-it was quite low in the sky when i last saw it. I have no idea as to what it was- but it definitely wasn&#39;t a plane,meteor or sattelite-so i thought that it could be a UFO.<n>

At first, I thought they were joking . But when I saw the seriousness in their faces ,I quickly ran outside to see it . But I was too late!They also stated that the craft was just above the tree lines,  making a weird humming noise.And that the craft was not a airplane or something manmade. We live near a airport and we see alot planes flying our skies daily. They&#39;re sure of what they witnessed!If anybody in the flint area ,saw or witnessed this craft please report it serious in flint<n>

Where I was standing before the trees were  in the way.Then I could see a ball of light directly in front of the jet,the jet was clearly in pursuit of the craft,I yelled for my little girl to come take a look and she thought it was really cool. so as the jet gained on the craft the next thing I saw was wild,It turned out of the path of the jet and went straight up and it was gone, a few seconds later here came another jet in the same path.These jets 4 of them circled the erea for at least a hour,Strange.

The craft was moving very slowly, it took about 1 1/2 -2 minutes to cover the distance of the coal pile kitty corner. This is ruffly the distance of 2 football fields I guess. I watched it, trying to figure out why a plane would fly so low or close to the buildings. As it reached the coal belt tubes I could see it had two huge flood lights on the front. It then banked off to the west and I could see the shape. It reminded me of the stealth bombers. It also had three smaller white lights underneath it. I later described the craft to a co-worker who has military experience and asked him what sort of craft it was. One other thing that is probably important. I never heard any sound from the craft except possibly a very soft high pitched whine at he edge of my hearing but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was from the craft or the plant behind me. I thought the craft. in a blink it was gone. Anyway, my co-worker said no such craft exist as we know it. A stealth bomber is niether slow nor quiet. A hareier (?) jet would be the only thing that could fly that slow and they are not quiet either. He said either I had good drugs, which I don&#39;t, or it was a UFO. I don&#39;t know. Only know I saw but didn&#39;t hear. This was not the first time I saw this craft or one just like it. On sept 11, 2001, yes, the day the towers were hit, thats why I remember, I went to the store in the evening, probably around 21:00 hrs and on my way home saw the same type of craft coming toward me just above the trees. It too, was moving very slow and not making any noise. I put my head out the window and looked up the craft. it was almost directly above me, I felt I could have reached out and touched it. I watched it for a while, it continued as it was for a few minutes then took off. As it was heading in the general direction of Mitchel field where there is an air force base, I assumed it was a stealth bombe! r called out because of the events of the day. Until I talked to my co-worker about the latest episode I was unaware of the actual flight limitations of the stealth and that &#39;stealth&#39; does not mean slow and quite but un-detectable by radar. So I don&#39;t know what I saw. Maybe you do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT ABOVE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> correction to previously filed report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to determine the correct date for a report filed for 11/06/02, The correct date is 11/11/02.

It was an orange, flame colored, star like object that was moving slowly east. Slower than a plane, it all of a sudden seemed to just disappear - maybe possibly into the nighttime clouds or haze behind it, and then I briefly saw it dimly flare again, and then it seemed to be totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed other, more traditional aircraft in the sky over the next few minutes and none of the operating beacons or landing lights had this same strange orange color that the object we first observed did.<n>

The size of it was half of a full moon. Clear sky, stars can easily be seen. The light became a shape what you describe when you sit on a blown up balloon. Oval to a more flatter shape at the end of the flash moving in a Northerly direction. Also just thought of it. There was a very short tail of light. Lasting one second long. Let me assure it was not a shooting star or light from a helicopter or plane etc. I have seen enough in my lifetime to know the difference. This was a one of a kind which I have never seen before.<n>

The light seemed to move a large distance while making the circle and was smooth in its movement.  Then when it had came back to the same spot, it took off at a great speed heading straight up.  I used to fly as a flight medic in a helicopter and have flew in planes, and I have never seen anything move so fast in my life.  I also must add that I did notice a plane fly at or about 30 thousand feet heading west.<n>

I was seated well aft of the wing on the starboard side of the plane with a clear view of the ground.  I noted a light shining on the ground at about our 4 oclock position.  I at first thought it was a police helicopter shining it&#39;s searchlight on the ground.  It was traveling in essentially the same direction and speed as our plane (B737-800).  I suspected it may be a light from our aircraft, but eliminated that possibility when the light went under some scud...and the scud was back-lit.  It would reappear on the next opening in the scud. That happened several times.  We were in clear areas for long periods of time when it would look like it would do zig zags at right angles to our path and then return to the same direction as our path.  None of these manuevers were in tune with aircraft attitude changes, except for it&#39;s general direction.  I called it to the attention of a man seated next to me and he too followed it&#39;s progress and witnessed it going under a thunderstorm cell and reappearing on the other side of the cell as we passed by.  He too had no possible explanations for the light.  Once in a while it would flare out to a wider area like a flashlight being raised slightly, but most of the time it gave the appearance of a cars headlight shining down a wooded road..with the flashing as trees obstructed it.  The squared nature of its movements would also give the impression of a car going on checkered board roads.  But, we were now moving at a ground speed of 525+mph and at 30,000+ft.  The light would not be as bright going through towns, but one could follow it&#39;s progress through them in the same general direction and occasional zig zag.  It would appear more brightly out in the open country.  We came upon a real strong band of thunder storms and the light went under them and except for one break was not sighted again on the flight.  Clouds obscured the ground on the descent into MSY, ! but when the ground did appear, the light was not there again.  All in all, probably the most interesting flight of a flight filled life.  The thunderstorm band was spectacular, it was the night of the devastating tornados just NE of our flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the passengers witnessed.  If the report is accurate that more than one passenger witnessed the alleged light, and that it did, in fact, disappear behind clouds, then it could not have been a reflection from the inside of the aircraft.  Had it been a daylight flight, a possible explanation of the sighting might have been the phenomenon known as &#34;Broca&#39;s Spot,&#34; in which a spot is seen on the ground where the plane&#39;s shadow is cast, but this phenomenon does not occur at night, obviously.  We are confused by this one.  PD))<n>

The line of orbs started above and in front of  the plane and trailed behind. The plane was about in the middle of the line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the orbs were farther away in the V formation and were darker in color.

We were driving south on Rt. 295 in New Jersey, and were maybe a mile north of Exit 31 (Lawnside, NJ). We were returning to Maryland and Virginia.  I was in the front passenger seat, and it was approximately 1:30pm..  Driver saw something to the left and ahead of us, and called my attention to it; it would have been in the southeast quadrant of the Rt. 295 and White Horse Pike/Rt. 30 interchange (Haddon Heights, NJ).  I got to see it for perhaps at most about three seconds; I feel if I had gotten to see it for even a few more seconds, I would have been able to decide more definitively how anomalous it really was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a large, dark rectangular object, oriented horizontally, just above the trees, about 1.5 miles away.  It was the length (left to right) of two of my thumbs held at arm&#39;s length, and it was about 1/4 as wide (up/down) as it was long (this estimate of &#34;thumb width&#34; was done later, not at the time).  It was either black or very dark gray, and it was somewhat &#34;fuzzy&#34; in its outline, in a way I can&#39;t quite describe; it looked strange, unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before.  We were currently driving down a hill, thus the object, which I happened to see as the bottom of it just started to go below the treeline, continued to descend below the treeline (being on Rt. 295, we couldn&#39;t stop or slow down, of course).  The driver, who saw it for a few seconds longer, said she thought it was moving horizontally and downward, very slowly; I had the impression it was moving downward as well (since WE were moving horizontally and downward ourselves, it made it hard to discern how much of the object&#39;s motion was from it, versus us, but we both had the impression that it was moving itself, but very slowly).  We had our windows closed, so we would not have been able to hear any sound from it even if there had been any.  It was definitely not an airplane, nor a conventional blimp, and certainly not a helicopter; there were no wings of any kind, nor anything hanging down from it, such as the cabin of a blimp.  Had it been a human-built craft, it had to be landing, and quite slowly (far more than any plane could), and it appeared to be going down in an area that was fairly dense with trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were startled enough by this sight that we pulled off at the next exit, Exit 30 (Lawnside, NJ), which was only about a mile ahead of us.  Of course, it was impossible for us to tell exactly where it had been, but we drove though an old residential area to about where we thought we had seen the object.  Naturally, we saw nothing.  We pulled into a large shopping center (the one having the tall tower with the White Horse on top; no, the object we saw was NOT this well-known landmark that I knew even as a child growing up in NJ).  We looked around the skies in all directions, saw nothing.  After looking for about seven minutes or so, we got back onto Rt. 295 at Exit 29a, and continued southward.  For the next ten minutes, I kept looking out the back window of Sue&#39;s car, scanning the skies for any object, but saw nothing (not even any planes).  The weather was a bit chilly, but the air and sky were very clear, with visibility of (I would guess) tens of miles, with some very high clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As to the estimation of the size of the object: it was the length (left to right) of between one and two of my thumb widths, held at arm&#39;s length.  My thumbs are approximately 2cm wide; the distance from my eyes to my thumbs, approx. 60cm.  Using simple geometric proportion, the following table estimates the range of possible lengths of the object (ObjectLengthInMiles=ThumbWidths*2cm/60cm*MilesAway): Thumb Widths (2.0cm): 1.0 1.5 2.0 1.0 Miles Away 0.0333 0.05 0.0667 1.5 Miles Away 0.05 0.075 0.1 2.0 Miles Away 0.0667 0.1 0.133 Taking the middle estimates of 1.5 thumb widths, with the object being 1.5 miles away, gives us a UFO length of 0.075 miles, times 1600 meters/mile equals 120 meters, with the range being between 53 and 213 meters.  The 747 jets that NASA uses for the space shuttle program are 71 meters long, so the middle estimate puts the object at being 1.7 times the length of a 747.<n>

I was staring in the sky when I went out to smoke a cig in the yard, and then, probably in the southern part of the skies I have suddenly saw a strange thing - it looked as if a new star in the sky has lighted up. Maybe this star was there in the sky already for millions of years, so I thought then that this might be only some kind of mispercepcion of the eye. But then, this &#34;new star&#34; gradually started to become more and more bright. I could even hear the sound of it - it was something like a humming sound of mid-frequencies, but it gave me an impression like this sound is very far away - or should I say - this sound was like a plane sounding, but very far and contextual. On the other hand, this sound was very interesting, even relaxing and somehow hypnotising - maybe it was only because I like minimalistic music style. OK, it doesn&#39;t matter for now. The next thing that happened, was even more strange - it was really something. This &#34;new star&#34; - after it reached some kind of certain level of brightness - started moving - or floating - in the sky. I don&#39;t know how to explain in the words, but this view was really fascinating. But the most amazing thing - it was the figure, that this star has drawn in the sky (it left no trails, no nothing). this figure was that of a question mark - like this - ?, but with no point at the bottom. after making such a figure, it started to become less and less bright (i.e. the reverse process of the beginning has started) untill it has reached the same level of brightness as in the beginning, and went back to its place - the place in the sky, where it has appeared (or maybe it did not appeared - I don&#39;t know). But then, the thing happened, that really shaked me - this little star, after going to its place - actually was in one of the three corners of bigger triangle in the sky - i.e. in each corne! r of thi s triangle there was a star, although, there were no lines, no nothingwhich was connecting those corners. So, after all the thing that I saw, could be named as the &#34;spy, sent out for investigation from the corner of the triangle in the sky, the origin of which - I am 1000% sure - was xtraterrestrial.<n>

The circular object had 4 pairs of lights positioned at 10:00 2:00 4:00 and 8:00 (if the object were a face of a clock). As I noticed the object and walked out onto my back lawn away from my back porch light the pairs of lights on the object went off and the object seemed to change shape. It sort of undulated as it morphed shape. As it morphed it  took shape of a boomerang for a second and them back to it undulating shape and then took a 45-degree right hand turn headed now south. There seemed to be a white light flashing in the middle of  the changing shape at this point it was moving away from me. The whole sitting lasted for probably 50 seconds ti 1 munute. Very bizarre!<n>

We saw a flashing light that we thought was lightning but the flashes were very fast and bright.  We got out of bed and looked out the window.  We saw over the adjacent Mountain ( Queen Mountain)  there was a light flashing.  It was lighting up the entire sky and the valley.  The light was flashing white then red.  At first we thought maybe a car had hit a power line because after we saw the flashes the power went off.  But we went down the road where the lights had been flashing and we found nothing out of the ordinary.  Our neighbors had power.  We still don&#39;t know what could have caused the l;ights.  We don&#39;t live in the city, we live on the outskirts of a small town.  Farming areas.  We have never seen anything like these lights ever.

She said she had seen a brilliant green shooting star earlier in the evening. When she told me this, I automatically looked up to see if I could see one too. At the same time, my daughter and I were looking up and we both said, &#34;Oh my God,what is that&#34;? We both were looking at an object that was boomerang in shape, no lights, gray or dark-sky color, and made absolutely no sound at all. This craft was headed north and was immense in size. It was so big that the only way to see its shape was by the fact that it was blocking out the stars behind it. The event passed and my daughter and grandson left. I returned to the house to try to continue watching a movie with my neighbor. Later, at 1:00 a.m., I asked my neighbor to walk outside with me; I wanted to look again. As we walked off the front steps and looked up, my neighbor yelled and pointed up. There was the craft again! This time, the object was moving to the southeast and was directly above the house. It seemed to be in the same &#34;orbit&#34;, as earlier I had noticed the Little Dipper was nearby the object the first time and then as the night wore on, the position of the stars had changed too.Again, the object was near the Little Dipper. Another note; the neighborhood dogs were barking frantically when both events occurred. I do not know if this is significant or not. I was always a little skeptical but have tried to keep an open mind about these things. Today however, I am changed. I really want to know if anyone else saw this craft or not. I am going out again tonight to see if I can see it. I know it was not a stealth fighter or bomber - I have seen both, living close to McConnell Air Force Base. This thing was really, really big. It was scary. During both sightings, I also witnessed shooting stars near it. This may be significant too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Tempe, AZ, for same date.  PD))<n>

11/9/02 11:51|White Hall (near)|VA|Other|not known|Dome shaped object at great distance over mountains near national park in mid-day, clear sky.|11/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26021.html|212|ndxe200211| Dome shaped object at great distance over mountains near national park in mid-day, clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday morning November 9th I took my family to the reservoir at Sugar Hollow near White Hall, Virginia just outside of Shenandoah National Park (park was due west of our position).  Our position was approximately 78 degrees 44&#39; longitude, 38 degrees 07&#39; latitude. I was using a digital camera to take photos of the kids and scenery and did not notice any object in sky while on site.  On Saturday evening I was reviewing images on the computer and noticed a distant object in one scenic shot of mountains due west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dome-shaped/triangular/??? object appears in only one shot taken at 11:51.  The other shots I took were probably spaced 30 seconds to several minutes apart, most of which were in the same general direction as the shot with object.  My first thought was debris on the CCD sensor (highly unlikely, sealed housing and all other shots clean) but I do not believe this to be the case. If this is indeed an object and not some kind of digital &#34;noise&#34;, I estimate that its position places it somewhere over the National Park or beyond. Obviously, I have no information on possible movements, velocity, etc., however, I think object is slightly blurred, which would indicate very high rate of speed given distance to object and sunny conditions  If object is real I probably did not detect it on site because I was taking pictures with CCD camera through low res. LCD viewfinder I have absolutely opinion either way about the existence of UFOs but do feel that there is no reason to suspect other than an earthbound explanation for such events - whether or not such an explanation can be readily obtained in all cases.  There is a county airport some distance away and hot air ballons are very popular this time of year in the county.  If it were a balloon, however, I would have likely imaged it in one or more photos I took before and after the one that recorded the object. I report this only as an unbiased curiousity that others may find helpful.<n>

I was watching two Navy Jets (trainers orange/white) practice formation flying and then begin to dog fight.  They were having a good time of it and all over the sky.  I am not sure of the altitudes, but it was probably never lower than 8,000&#39; to 10,000&#39;  I was watching them with my binoculars for about 45 minutes to an hour.  The sky was clear of clouds, but a bit hazy.  I was looking to the north with the morning sun behind me.  The two jets joined up in formation and started flying to the east by northeast.  I guess flying  back to the Naval Air Station in Kingsville.  As I watched them depart, an object slowly entered my area of vision in the binoculars.  The object was moving in the same direction of the departing jets, west to east, but moving much slower than the jets.  Maybe 150 mph based on the jets speed in departing.  Hard to tell.  I heard no sound, but had heard the Navy Jets very well all morning.  The object was in the shape of a long cylinder.  It looked to be narrower in the center and the ends were the same thickness.  The narrow center section of the object was a hazy red color while the rest of the object was silver.  The front, middle and back section were all about the same length.  I know the object was about 3 to 4 times the size of the Navy Jets, because while I was watching the object, the two Navy jets returned and buzzed the object two times (under and over) before departing again to the east by northeast.  I could hear the jets after the first pass, but nothing ever from the object.  The object did not have wings or a tail that I could recognize.  The object continued to the east at a steady rate of speed until I lost sight of it.  I don&#39;t know why, but I got the feeling that the object had been watching the Navy Jets practice too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the individual who submitted this report, and we found him to be quite credible, and we suspect he is an exceptionally good witness.  He is a former military jet pilot.  The witness, based on his experience, believes that the two aircraft were aware of the presence of the unidentified object, and that they many have left the area because of its presence.  PD))<n>

The strange thing was that it wasn&#39;t &#34;shooting&#34;, it was &#34;falling&#34; vertically down towards the ground. I saw it for no more than 4 to 5 seconds. It was bright white as a star, but became visible at a certain piont in the sky and faded out at a certain point. It was no longer visible a few hundred feet from the ground. The white light went out. I ask that anyone who was in the Annandale area of Virginia, and think they saw something similar late Sat. night, 11\9\02, to file a report on this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There may be some confusion with the date.  The witness seems to indicate that the event occurred after midnight on Saturday night, which would mean it occurred on Sunday morning, November 10th.  PD))<n>

After we came out with our food, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There are many potential explanations for the event, we feel.

I could then see that it was not a rainbow trying to form, but the sun was reflecting off of it. It was like something in stealth mode, but because of the clouds behind it, I could see it because clouds seemed to disappear behind it. It had like a clear and orange tint from where it faced the sun.<n>

They seemed to be following one another. At that time, I noticed a bright object resembling a star in the same vacinity as the aircraft. The bright object dissappeared from my sight and it was at that time that both aircraft made a sharp right turn and were coming in my direction (aircraft were going north and made a turn to the south-east). I then looked straight up and noticed an object above resembling an aircraft body but was unable to distinguish any wings on the object. The aircraft were leaving vapor trails but the object was not. The aircraft then made another right turn as if following the object. I could not tell what type of aircraft they were because of their altitude, I assumed they were military. The object was shiney silver in color and appeared to be large. The following day, I told my brother about what I had seen and he informed me of the object seen by the photographer for FOX TV. I then found the picture of that object on this website and it appeared to be similar in shape to what I had seen. Could it have been the same object? Were there any further reports from this area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

At first, I thought it was just that... a stationary formation. It looked like stars in the daytime sky. There were some bright stars and a whole bunch (maybe 100) smaller ones. Then I noticed that some of the stars seemed to be moving away from each other. Then I noticed that the whole formation was moving slowly West and that the stars were starting to become less visible. Some of the brighter ones were moving apart noticeably. I observed it for about 15 minutes before they faded from sight. I didn&#39;t have time to go home for a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the movement, I surmised that it might well have been some type of explosion in outer space and what I saw was a debris field reflected in the sunlight.

It was then I heard a strange noise, it sounded like a generator or the engine of a diesel truck running but a deeper sound and the interverals were not as fast as you would here the revs of an idle engine.  It was loud but I could tell it was from a distance.  I couldn&#39;t pinpoint where it was, so I went in the middle of the cul-de-sac looking down the street thinking that someone had a generator hooked up to thier house or something like that, then I saw some flashing lights in the sky red, white, and I think blue.  I really couldn&#39;t tell exactly how high the object was, maybe a mile or two high.  I would have thought it was a jet except I heard the murmur before I saw the object and it did not sound anything like the sound jets make breaking the sound barrier although I never seen jets go this fast before or this low.  My guess it was an experimental aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was fast, I&#39;m in the suburbs so there isn&#39;t much light in the sky at night and it was very clear, I could see the star constellation Orion the Hunter without a problem what-so-ever.  I never heard that noise before or seen anything fly  by that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it came over head I didn&#39;t hear the murmur anymore, it made a higher steady pitch sound for a brief moment and then it was out of hearing range.  It was hard to make out the exact shape, however I did see some lines that came together, kind of like a diamond shape but not solid all the way through.  It was really dark and really can&#39;t make out the shape all too well, but all the lights were alternating strobes that flashed approximately twice within in a second, although I didn&#39;t count them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was coming from the Southwest (more West) and heading towards the Northeast (more East) in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured it&#39;s probably some test aircraft the Air Force has been working on or something to that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw or heard anything like it.

This object was sighted by 5 people each watched for different lengths of time.  My nephew was sitting in the living room and noticed an object over the lake that is over the lake, (Lake Champlain) It was large and was low over the the lake.  The top appeared to be a light and below there were other lights. The bottom lights were possibly green according two witnesses.  He watched the object come off the lake and fly very low and circle around the house.  He could see the bottom of the object and it was like a white light.  The bottom part was rotating where the lights were.  They were kind of greenish.  It disapeared out to the west.  About 10 minutes later it reapeared in the front of the house kind of diagnally from it and just skimed a huge weeping willow tree that is out front near the driveway.  Possibly 50 ft or so.  Then it went back over the lake.  He could see the object stop and hover over the lake for a few minutes.  At this point a beam of light came out of the bottom of the object.  it was a yellow white.  It beamed down onto the lake.  It went down and right back up.  It came back at this point toward the house.  About 50ft away it stopped. Came a little closer and then stopped.  He was standing on the railing of the deck on the front of the house.  It was about even with me in height.  Then it moved straight up and quickly passed.  At one point my sister started to watch it from the window My nephew went in to tell my mom.  My sister saw several lights hovering over the bushes near the house across the street. Then it headed towards the house and then over.  My mom came and looked out the window.  She described it as very large, and she could see greenish lights on the bottom. She saw it over the lake and it just hovered there then started coming back towards the house. She called her neighbors who live across the street and the women said her daughter said she was watching a strange plane out the window.  My other nephew who is 6 also saw it.  My nephew said the was no noise from the object. My nephew said it look like a dome shape on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one has had a chance to talk to the neighbors sense the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the party who submitted the report, and she sounded quite credible to us.

A photo of the contrail was published in Aviation Week and Space Technology in roughly 1990-1992. It was refered to as the&#34;Pearl Necklace&#34; contrail. The aircraft flys at altitudes high enough that there is no acoustic footprint. Those of us in the industry that are not privy to the details of the propulsion system guess the pearls are the result of a pulse jet type systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

11/6/02 23:00|Atascadero|CA|Sphere|five to six hours|fast moving orb behind clouds|11/9/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25964.html|233|ndxe200211| fast moving orb behind clouds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside my apt. and it was overcast. Looking up I saw a glowing orb, going counter clockwise almost directly overhead. It was north of my position. This was at appx. 2300. I went out thinking it was perhaps someone shinning a flashlite which was reflecting off the cloud cover so I moved toward it, it moved away from me cont in a northward manner. I had a large magnum flashlight which I shot upwards to see if it was something like that, but my beam did not produce any reflection off the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and moved back to my apt and was going to get in my car to drive out on the street to see if I could locate the source. Thought it could be a saleslite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there was no beam from the ground up, and this orb looked as if it were behind the clouds. As I drove out, another person drove in, I stopped and asked this person if she knew what that lite was. She told me it had been seen at Atascadero State Hospital (which I live next to) from the courtyard all night and no one could figure out what it was. She remarked on how fast it was going, I also asked if it appeared to her that it was moving somewhat jerkily, she agreed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 23;30 it suddenly disappeared. I drove out to see if I could tell where it was coming from, there is a new blockbuster but it is not close to this area, and the orb was centered over where I live. Blockbuster shut down at ten pm. I drove there but could not see any of the equipment used for producing a saleslight. I will have to go in and ask them if they had a sale lite up, but if they closed at ten pm and it went off at 23;00  there should have been someone there taking the light down and I went right over and the place was locked up with no sign of anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several UFO&#39;s in this area this week, also have two other people in another part of town. This is a samll town, it was very strange to see this orb and it moved very fast in a counter-clockwise motion with no light coming up from the ground. I only saw it short time, if I had not stopped to ask this person if they could id the light for me I would not have known it had been viewed for several hours from the State Hospital. Cannot firgure out where or what it was. Silent also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was viewed for 5-6 hours, we doubt that it was a UFO.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glowing orb moving counter-clockwise very fast veiwed my several witness in different locations<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is in regard to earlier filed report I made of glowing orb seen in clounds above my apt in Atascadero, California. I called the police of Atascadero and reported my sighting and asked if they had recieved any calls of a similiar type. The dispatcher said that at about seven pm they had recieved a call from Templetom reporting the same object. The Dispatcher said no police on patrol during the evening saw this orb. Clound cover was about 500 feet. Templeton is located about 6 miles north of Atascadero.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

We did this and about 30 seconds later, noticed an object moving south.  We thought it was a plane and then it stopped.  It sat there for about 2 or 3 seconds then moved back to the north.  It moved north for about 5 seconds and then changed direction again to the south.  It did this for another 5 to 7 seconds.  Then it moved rapidly in an easterly direction and disappeared.  The object was yellow almost a gold color About 4 minutes later, I saw a circle of 6 to 8 lights (gold dots) moving at a very fast pace to the south.  These lights were very small.  I followed it in a southerly direction and then they moved out of formation and looked like they were going to dive and then they were lost in the clouds.  This last sight lasted about 10 seconds.<n>

I sent you the video. No need to include this in your database. Thought you might like to know that this happened again. But this time there were so many planes and lights all over the sky (from EVERY direction in the sky) for over a 30 min period. The lights strobed as they did before. There were lights that were headed in one direction and turned on a dime and headed in the opposite direction. I personally witnessed not one, but TWO objects that were moving so fast they appeared to be meteors (shooting stars)...that is how fast they moved. I couldn&#39;t possible describe them as they were just a blur. Military jets came out for the occasion and circled the area. I certainly can&#39;t state whether they were part of this anomoly or checking it all out. They normally fly over during maneuvers, but not at night. There was one jet that flew a complete 360 and then a second. It was incredibly busy out here tonight and oh so strange. I would love to get this on video, but don&#39;t know what to use to capture this activity so that it is visible. I might add you CAN hear the planes.....there were a couple over the 30 min period that WERE planes and then the military jets. But I would say there were thirty to fifty objects that made no sound, made no sense as far as movement and of course the strobing lights. I just can&#39;t imagine that one would see thirty to fifty planes in the air within a thirty to forty five minute period. Curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just FYI and for the record. I fully expect to see this again and maybe it will be another two years, but I will be watchful.  ((name deleted))<n>
11/6/02 05:50|Tucson|AZ|Light|10 seconds or less|Two large bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson.|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69153.html|238|ndxe200211| Two large bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an addendum to the report already filed for the same date, time, and location.  I rewrote paragraph 2 only, so you can replace the second paragraph with this one.  The rest is the same.  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6. I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn&#39;t there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn&#39;t want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyon! e else s aw it, but no one was around. That in itself was odd. There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.

There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like &#34;ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?&#34;  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I&#39;ll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There&#39;s simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won&#39;t give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The &#34;that&#39;s not my job&#34; philosophy definitely applies here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I&#39;d check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don&#39;t see any that match this particular sighting.  So for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s my one and only sighting.  If I see any more, I&#39;ll let you know.<n>
11/6/02 05:00|Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt)||Light|20 mins|Bright light observed moving erratically at great speeds. Acceleration and deceleration of craft was great.|11/9/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25987.html|240|ndxe200211| Bright light observed moving erratically at great speeds. Acceleration and deceleration of craft was great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on holiday in Egypt, at the top of Mt Sinai, viewing the sunrise. In the twilight before sunrise I noticed a single, fairly dim white light, which initially appeared to be a star, in the direction of the sunrise position. The light then began moving left to right to left in a mainly horizontal plane. The movement seemed quite random, i.e. the object did not appear to be travelling toward any particular destination. As an example of the motion observed; the craft would sometimes move to the right, stop, then continue moving to the right. Other times it would move to the right, stop, then begin moving to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the craft varied, from a slow drift, to a speed so great that it is difficult to explain how this speed was achieved. The craft accelerated extremely rapidly, from an apparent standstill. The craft also decelerated to a stop almost instantaneously, even after it had just accelerated to a great speed. This rapid motion was all in a horizontal direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for 20 mins or more. All the while, the craft was very gradually drifting higher in to the sky and to the right. This was happening at the same time as the sun came closer to rising and the twilight became brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the sun rose, the craft seemed to disappear by fading away. I am not sure if this was caused by the brightness of the sun washing out the light from the craft, or if the craft was in fact moving further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the craft was 10-20km away, and at least 10,000ft altitude. I take these estimates from the fact that the craft occasionally disappeared behind clouds. The clouds appeared to be at quite high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some photographs of what I saw, will need to check the developed pictures to see if the object is clearly visible in the photo as it was quite distant and the camera is only a pocket 35mm type.<n>

From where we were they appeared to be hovering over the outskirts of Moundridge.  As we came closer to Moundridge they seemed to dim and fade away.  We lost track of them for about 15 sec. then they reappeard again and still seemed to be to our North-Northeast.  We than turned from the center of town and travled Straight North from Center of Moundridge,KS toward the north exit of Moundridge(I-135) which is about 3 miles.  When we arrived at the exit the lights dissapeared again.  We started back South toward town. about 1/2 mile away we saw the Yellow lights appear again and now there were four of them. We turned around and got on the interstate and headed North toward McPherson.  The four lights were again to our North-Northeast by the time we reached the Elyeria exit the fourt lights seemed to lower from the sky and disappear.  They never came back or we never saw them again.<n>

I would estimate the duration as being approximately a minute and a half.  As I watched through my binoculars, I saw a white light stream out in front of it that was about twelve times the lentgh of the red light.  Then it suddenly disappeared. It did not have any other colored lights and did not flash.  It moved at a steady pace and made no sound.  The light and the color did not vary at all as it passed.  It was much brighter red than the port light of a jet and was much brighter than any light I have ever seen from an aircraft.<n>

11/5/02 18:47|Temecula|CA|Light|4-5 minutes|Bright lights over Pala Rd in Temecula|11/9/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25968.html|244|ndxe200211| Bright lights over Pala Rd in Temecula<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 6:47pm, my family and I pulled out of our drive, and turned right onto Pala road.  As we came around a bend in the road I noticed a bright red light in the sky in front of and to the right of us, at about a 1 o&#39;clock position.  It was very big and very bright.  I commented about how big it was and asked J. if he thought it could be a satellite.  He said it was too big, he didn&#39;t know what it was.  I watched it for about a minute and a half, the time it would normally take us to get from the end our our drive, to the gas station that is a mile away.  The light was hovering stationary in the sky, and had not moved in that minute and a half I was watching.  Then it moved across the sky from a 1 o&#39;clock to a 9 o&#39;clock position.  I am not sure, but I believe the car in front of us was looking at it as well, because as soon as the light began to move, the person driving the car in front of us slammed on his brakes. The object moved very steadily, there was no wobble or anything like that.  It moved across the sky and then stopped and went back into a hover.  We were passing it at about that point in time.  As I caught my last glimpse of it, it appeared that there were now two red lights.  They were only red lights, no other color.  They were not blinking, like the smack lights on an aircraft would do.  For lack of better words, I would say the light was pulsating, but not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was about as big as half of my pinky nailbed if I were to hold it at arms distance away from my eye.  That would mean either a very large object, or a very close object.  There were no sounds.  A helicopter would have made a sound. I was a helo mechaninc in the Marine Corps and I would have been able to distinguish which helo by the sound of the engine. There was no sound. The only other craft I know of that can hover like that is a Harrier, and that, too would make a very loud and distinguishable sound.  We continued on along Pala Rd and I lost sight of it once we passed the Pechanga Hotel.  I had it in my site for about 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I went outside after dark and watched the air traffic around the area.  There is an airport to the north of us and a military base to the south of us.  I noticed that none of the lights of the planes that were coming and going were as large as the light I saw on the 5th.  I also noted that the direction these planes were coming from were not consistent witht the flight path of the light I saw.  I would love to know what it was!<n>

The thing kept wobbling right and left. There was no sound but lots and lots of wind coming from its direction. It twiched one way, then another then it zipped left faster than any human ship could reach, and then moved up slowly, the top turned red and dissapeard into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked out to the East, in direction of Jones, Oklahoma.  I saw strange strobing white lights.  About five of them in the shape of a upside down - horizontal &#34;checkmark&#34;.   I cannot tell the distance, but my guess is 10 to 15 miles away.  If I held my thumb up at arms distance, the UFO would be about 2 inches long.  There is a major miliary base in that area.   My guess is they could have been military aircraft, but I have worked as an engineer for the Air Force all my life and have never seen this effect in the sky.<n>

I love to watch the night sky and all the constellations as they shine brightly in northern Maine on a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise (aircraft or vehicle) breaking the silence.  I was under a tall lodge pole pine tree waiting for my dog to come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out from under the tree and looked up into the northeast sky at about 01:00 when I saw a large white light about the size of a full moon.  It was at an altitude of several thouand feet.  I stood there in amazement at the brightness of the light.  I just stood there, watching, wondering, where it came from and where it would move too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes the light moved upward at a high rate of speed, disappearing within 2 to 3 seconds.  The light has never reappeared since this crisp morning in November 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every time I look up in the sky, I wonder, when the next contact will come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The now closed Loring AFB is about six miles from my home.  The object (light) appeared to be hovering over the old base.  Even though the base is officially closed, the military still has a presence on the base.<n>

What&#39;s that in the sky?&#34; I looked up and saw a strangely lit disk shape with a white or blue light blinking on top and bottom.  The UFO was lit in a very peculiar manner.  It seemed every inch was perfectly lit, as if the object itself was glowing.  The color was a pale greenish.  there seemed to be a ring around the disk that was a darker color, perhaps black, though it still was completely visible against the night sky.  The moon was not out, as it was hidden behind the clouds.  The only light source I can imagine was from the UFO itself.  It hovered stationary, it seemed, though we were in a car.  When we pulled into our driveway, the tree line in our neighborhood blocked our view, so we lost sight.  If the UFO was moving, it was doing so very slowly and in a kind of sliding manner.  I am going to go and look for it again.  Hopefully i will have more to add, along with photos, in a short while.  Oh, one more thing.  As soon as we got out of the car, we heard jets roaring.  We live near an air station, so that is not abnormal.  However, the jets were flying in 2 pairs, away from the direction we saw the craft.  The speed and throttling of the jets seemed to be slightly abnormal for the weather and night situation.<n>

I noticed a large object that was shaped like a triangle crossing the sky.  It made no sound, nor did it leave any trail of exhaust stream of any kind. It moved at a slow speed, gliding across the sky.  I am glad to read that someone else has seen this object.<n>

I thought it was a helicopter except the light pattern suggested a different shape, as the lights were where wings would have been. But it didn&#39;t act like a plane by its maneuvers. It swooped down toward the ground then back up again. There were no other aircraft in the sky and I don&#39;t know what was on the ground below the object, but it seemed to be searching for something on the ground. I only watched it for about 2 minutes as we drove north and couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It just seemed &#34;odd&#34; in its actions and appearance and the lights didn&#39;t seem to fit those of an aircraft. The lights didn&#39;t blink but were constant. I have no idea what it was; it did not glow, but only had those lights. It stayed in the same area until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It just seemed &#34;different&#34; from any aircraft.<n>

The light went out and a large white cylinder shaped object was visable.  Estimate its altitude=6000ft, length=200ft and diameter=40ft. It was stationary. I pointed out to my wife and pulled to the side of he road to look at it. 15 seconds after we stopped it slowly accelerated toward the east.  We followed it for 30 seconds maintining the same speed as the object until we reached 75mph.  It continued to accelerate until out of site 30 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is our first observation of a UFO. We are both Christians, enjoy Star Trek, and do not beleive that non-human aviation exist. I served in the Air Force at NORAD.<n>
11/3/02 16:30|Livermore|CA|Unknown|2-3 minutes|Bright stationary object momentarily visible in late daytime sky behind drifting cirrus cloud in otherwise clear sky.|11/9/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25945.html|253|ndxe200211| Bright stationary object momentarily visible in late daytime sky behind drifting cirrus cloud in otherwise clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While out mountain biking in Morgan Territory my friend and I, both avid sky watchers noticed a small bright object at 45 degrees above the horizon (near celestial equator), due south by southwest from the top of Morgan Territory Road.  The sun hadn&#39;t set and there was ample daylight.  The light was perfectly motionless and appeared brighter than any normal celestial object (including Venus).  It was not Venus or a satellite.  It was as bright or brighter than Venus at it crescent phase.  We didn&#39;t have binoculars but after 3 minutes or so, it faded and was lost.  Sitting and using a branch as a reference point, no discernable motion was evident.  It was first noticed visible through a cloud (cirrus) and would have never been seen except for the momentary interest of the cloud.  The cloud moved east, but the object didn&#39;t.   We were certain it was celestial until it disappeared.  I&#39;ve found no record of any similar object in any of my web searches and I am a amateur astronomer familiar with most bad identifications of &#34;possible UFOs&#34;.  It was clearly not a planet or any routine aerial phenomenon.  It was not a geosynchronous satellite flare because it was too bright - these are reported but never as daylight objects - these are night sky telescope objects.  It wasn&#39;t an Iridium flare because it was stationary.  I&#39;ve seen those and the international space station in orbit.  It seems it could be include possible a very high altitude balloon (but seems that it would have remained visible or would have drifted), or it could be a bright, but previously unknown celestial event (such as a nova) but much shorter lived (gamma ray burst?), or ... some other unknown aerial phenomenon.  It would have been unlikely for a casual observer to notice it because of the relative brightness of the sky and small angular extent.  It wasn&#39;t until I gave a very explicit set of location information (relative to the cloud shape which attracted my attention) that my companion even could see it.  His observations were consistent ! with min e.<n>

At first I thought it was a train (there is a track approximately 1/4 mile from my house). After about thirty seconds it became clear that it was a helicopter. I thought at the time that it was quite strange for two reasons: first, I don&#39;t remember seeing any helicopters at the lake before, and two, it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I ran down my steps and into the clearing near the water. We then saw that there were two helicopters flying very low and fairly fast. There was enough ambient light that we could clearly see the silhouettes of the helicopters. It was several seconds before I noticed that they appeared to be chasing two &#34;points of light&#34; that were traveling equally as low and fast, staying about 750 feet in front of the helicopters. They were moving independent of each other and the helicopters, but there was no &#34;silhouette&#34; of any kind associated with the two objects that I would estimate as being 3-5 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend works as a project engineer for a contractor.

It was bobbing up and down and swaying east to west. I called my family outside to verify it. It hovered for about 5 minutes, and was spraying down a red vapor that turned to white. It moved slowly to the northwest upwards and then disappeared. At first we thought it could be a flare, but it didn&#39;t go down it hung in the air, and the size was way bigger than a flare.

It was still very|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25918.html|262|ndxe200211| I was walking towards City Market Supermarket on Rood Avenue (going west) today. the sun had just set minutes before. It was still very light out but there was an orangish coloration on the mountains (they literally surround Grand Junction but the City is extremely spread out being in a mountain Desert valley).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was absolutely completely clear- not a cloud i site and the sky was a lighter hue of blue at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught my eye. I looked up and saw and object that at first I thought was a passenger jet. I&#39;ve never seen a UFO in the two years I&#39;ve been here so I thought &#34;eh it&#39;s just a jet&#34;. Jets pass that way all the time. But the thing that caught my eye was this &#34;starish&#34; shine it had. Then after the that faded (in about ten or so seconds), I could see that it was a metallic object and it appeared to be going away from my position (westward), yet it was somehow slower, a lot slower than a jet. It just kinda &#34;hung&#34; there or &#34;drifted&#34; in a strange way. Another thing that stood out was that it appeared to be two pods melded together. If you saw the photos on Jeff&#39;s site of the &#34;four pod&#34; craft  it was similar to that although it was hard to really make out too much detail because it was much further up in the sky . I&#39;d have to say it was a good 7 to 10,000 feet up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still skeptical this was not just a Jet that I wasn&#39;t making out too well when to the diagonal lower left of it (closer in my direction) ANOTHER ONE apparently appeared!! I thought I just didn&#39;t see it and that it emanated from the direction behind me to my line of sight. But the odd thing was, as I was observing the first object I WAS looking elsewhere around in the sky and saw NO OTHER objects 360 degrees around (the skyline is pretty low along in G.J.-especially on this wide avenue) So I&#39;m looking at the second one now and it looks EXACTLY the same as the first one except closer. Now I did begin to think it was a UFO and checked to see if the other one had &#34;blinked out&#34; and that maybe this was the other blinking in somewhere else. The other one was still there but farther away. A couple of times I couldn&#39;t see it and then I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I looked closely at the second object: still that weirdness to it that didn&#39;t quite look like a jet with apparently two pods (although the &#34;pods&#34; weren&#39;t as vertically cylindrical-like as the one on Jeff&#39;s site).It was more horizonal-ish but with those two bubbly portions left and right. Think of a shorter and fatter cigar shapes craft hanging horizontally in the sky but with two pods for each side bulging..very odd. It also appeared to be subtley changing shape too as I observed it.  A closer inspection of the object revealed a slight exhaust coming out of the &#34;tail&#34; of it. Very faint spray of fuel exhaust but much lighter than even the lightest jet fuel sprays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O.K. here&#39;s the kicker: So I look for the first one and I still see it -after not seeing it for a moment .....I go &#34;o.k. this is all going to be explainable because that&#39;s  jet fuel exhaust&#34;(still thinking about number two while tracking number one).<n> <n><n> <n><n> O.k. then I go back number two and It&#39;s GONE!!! Then I look for number one and it&#39;s GONE!!! There is absolutely nothing in the sky- and there is a whole helluva lotta sky in front of me that believe me I would see stuff up there if there was anything up there. NOTHING NADA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This had me scratching my head. No conventional explanation exists for what I saw today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects reflected the very orange color of the setting sun this evening at a few points which tells me they were metallic in nature. As far as I could tell there was no sound, but a major thruway was a block away, so it was hard to tell.<n>

It unfolded like this: At 2am of november third my oldest daughter and her friend were awaked by a very loud sound, described to me to sound like a rocket leaving the earths atmosphere(lot of thrust), upon looking out the window, which faces west and is right alongside bed, she saw over the trees of our property a rocket shaped craft speeding toward the sky at a reasonably high rate of speed and holding a steady course up. She then awaked her friend who was sharing the bed with her, as well as my girlfriend laying a bed away, to look out the window at the rocket ship ripping through the sky. The window is on the second floor and faces west. The visibility of the area of sky, from top of trees on property to highest visible point of sky is ample as the trees are low and the windows high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  this morning i had both my daughter and her friend both seperately draw what they had seen and they were exactly the same. Also, my girlfriend cooborated the intense rumbling at the time of the sighting, so i know the children weren&#39;t fantasizing/dreaming/playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: A perfect rocket shaped craft, long(vertically) shape with a conical tip. 2 to 4 unblinking yellow lights sat at the top area of the craft and did not flash or otherwise blink in such a way the FAA would require of an aircraft. They also described the presence of intense flames shooting from the rear, in true rocket fashion, as well as the possibility of some sort of window(s) along the lateral side of the craft. Lights were also seen at the bottom portion of the craft above the exhaust area. As it moved skyward it created a contrail of either smoke or steam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting may have lasted no more than a couple minutes, long enough for it to appear over the treeline until it was no longer visible from the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not being a scientist or otherwise, i immediately assumed it was a launch of some type of rocket or military type craft headed for the great void. This after some thinking didn&#39;t sit well with me or make any sense for the following reasons. First off there is no known base in this immediate area, the description of the size was that of a large house, this coupledwith the level of detail they described led me to believe it was much closer than any launch from neighboring states etc. Also, my girlfriend, whom never turned to look at it as she was tired, described a dopplereffect. The sound she said began as a low rumble and peaked so loud she believed whatever it was would crash into the house, so it was close. The sound was that of a space shuttle launch on takeoff and not the whine of a passenger jet turbine. The most dramatic feat in question is that of it changind direction i.e altering its course in a marked fashion by turning about 45 degrees and keeping a course more or less straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, first thing after hearing this i phoned the local police station and was promptly accused of making a crank call. I spoke in length with the desk sargeant about this and he soon realized it was no joke an listened. He claimed no one els\e reported the event after checking through the nights log and so on. I also asked him whom i should call to report the event and claimed he didn&#39;t know and furthermore there was no reason to as any military activity would have beed reported to them beforehand, which it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could you please contact me with any information regarding this event, military rocket activity, etc.? And did anyone else see this in the north jerresy area? I thought maybe it was a Vandenburg rocket launch, but whywould it be so close and so lowhere in new jersey?! thanx and please contact me when you can<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

I also seen that light with what looked like a strick of light after it sorta like a comet trail, anyway they are not lieing. I was looking out at the stars as I always do I am fasinated with them, anyway I saw a bright light fall what seemed in front of a house, but was only for a second that I saw it, because it went down in front of the house, this accured up by MT.Way elementary school, where I live, well I have sinced moved, I would have reported it sooner, but I just got my internet connection back. So yes I darted right to your web page. I was surprised to read that someone else besides me saw that light. It seemed just to have apperared like it was falling from the sky, at first I thought a Falling star maybe, but not that big, plus more than likely it would have burned up before it got that close to the ground, then I thought maybe a metor, I really don&#39;t know what it was, but I know it really scared me so I went to bed. Like going to bed would have helped me, but at least my husband was in there, so it made me feel a bit better all I know is at that moment I not longer wanted to be alone watching the stars. I really felt fear!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

We were on Winn St in Woburn MA when my wife pointed out a strange object that appeared to be shaped like a diamond in the sky. The Light&#39;s on each corner appeared to change color several times. My wife and I pulled over to the side of the road to oberve it further where it hovered for several minutes before streaking off into the far horizon out of our sight. From being in the military the object wss like nothing I have ever seen.

But it was lights on an aircraft gliding slowly and silently to the southeast.  One side of the V was shorter than the other.  I think there were about 7 pale yellow lights on one side, about 5 on the other.  The lights appeared oblong, not circular.  Our line of sight was obscured as it moved behind a lone tree, but then it didn&#39;t come out from behind the tree. It disappeared. No sound. I&#39;ve only seen photos of Stealth Bombers from above--do they have lights like this?  Are Stealth Bombers silent?  We are located close to Camp Peary and other military bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found her to be an exceptional witness.

I was standing on our lawn in the front of our house.  My body was facing East towards another row of townhomes in my development (the different rows of townhomes form a square.)  I had my head down because I was watching my dog but something caught my attention. I glanced up and I noticed lights directly above three of the townhomes in front of me (the homes are approximately 50 ft. away.)   I noticed there was a structure or formation to the lights.  The formation looked like the right wing of an airplane except the &#34;wing&#34; was very large.  I initially decided it was just a low flying airplane and I convinced myself that I couldn&#39;t see the rest of the plane because it was being obscured by trees. The lights appeared to be along the perimeter of the triangle or the &#34;wing&#34;.  From what I remember all of the lights were white.  I can&#39;t remember if any of them were flashing. As I watched this structure I realized there was no sound associated with it and that it was just hovering.  At some point it just seemed to disappear and I couldn&#39;t figure out where it went. I didn&#39;t know if the trees had just obscured my view and it was just a plane that had flown away or if the &#34;plane&#34; had really just disappeared.  I remember being perplexed and a little excited/weirded out. My gut told me I had just seen a UFO.  I ran inside and told my husband about what I had seen (my husband was not impressed.) I also drew a picture of the &#34;plane&#34; in case I had seen a UFO.  I then called the police (at the risk of sounding crazy) and asked them if there had been any reports of unusual aircraft sightings or UFO&#39;s in the area and I was told &#34;no.&#34;  I felt like an idiot after calling the police and decided I had probably just seen a plane.  However, after reading accounts from others on this site, I am now doubting whether or not this really was just a &#34;plane&#34;.  I really feel that what I saw was a UFO.  Am I going crazy? The best way to contact me is via e-mail.  Thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

There was low clouds that day( by low I mean they were about 400 yds above the tip of the Bellagio tower in the center of the building) As we were heading to our hotel on I15 my nephew noticed a strange object gliding next to the freeway at the same level of the clouds going about 30 or 40 mph (or at least that what it seemed like), this made it difficult to see the complete craft, but we could certainly see the V shaped and ballon like lights that morphed and changed shapes. First it was a v shape then it would morphed into a semi straight pattern and then back to V shape. As we approched traffic we saw how the craft made a turn towards the Bellagio Hotel and went right over the tower in the center of the building and that is when we lost track of it as we were blocked by the building. By compraing the size next to the bellagio hotel and the distance from the building, I would estimate the size to be the entire span or larger than the length of the Bellagio hotel. I am pretty convinced its some type of craft being tested from area 51 and what a better place to test Stealth than the mainstrip in Vegas.<n>

The rest is trees&#39; and bushes.  I took my dog outside around 8:30pm.  Looked up and noticed how clear the sky was.  The dogs in the neighborhood were barking in a way, that was not normal for them.  I watched the sky, while my dog went about his business.  As I was looking up I&#39;d noticed a very, very bright star, circle, what ever was moving.  It moved in jerks, zigzag, up, down.  This star as I call it was, I guess staying basically in one area.  To far up in the sky, to really identify.  Called my husband outside and he confirmed what I was seeing.  I then called my girl friend and her husband up on the phone as they live up on a hill in Bremerton.  Told her what to look for and about where they might see it.  She also confirmed what I was watching.  Now they live close to the Bremerton Naval Station.  To her surprize and ours, three helicopters&#39; took off from the base as we spoke.  Two towards the star and the other in the other direction.  Something else is puzzling me is that the sky was so unusually clear.  There were other stars, only not as big., spread out about.  What was so different about them was how the light&#39;s would dim on them and then be so bright again.  I do live in the area where planes and helicopters&#39; go over us, but this time there where no sounds; from them.  Color of lights was white.  So, anybody know what it was that we saw?<n>

They were well over the horizon and traveled in a straight pattern for a short period of time.  They appeared to have a tail similar to a comet&#39;s.  The objects then veered opposite of their current direction fairly quickly.  One of the objects then stopped moving and started to spin, and then quickly disappeared.  The other ball of light then began to spin for a second or two then disappeared like the other did.  That was the last that we saw of them.<n>

It was moving in an even fashion. Since it was at night, I saw only the lights. There was one large red light in the middle that blinked and slightly smaller white lights forming a triangle that were on steady. I thought at the time that it could be a stealth bomber, so did not note the date. Later I got a good look at stealth fighters on TV and they have smaller strobing lights. I also found that the description fits other reports of triangles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone  with this witness, and he seemed serious-minded and credible to us.

The sighting lasted 3-5 seconds. Just long enough for me to query &#34;Did you see that?&#34;...It apeared much like a falling star with an exagerated descent except for the closeness and the size of the object. We both had never seen anything like it and were looking for other places such as news programs to see if others had seen this as well.we both have had many years in aviation and sky watching. This was a novel sighting for both of us. There were aircraft in the sky at this time as well in that we live close to MHT airport. We were hoping that maybe a pilot might have witnessed this.<n>

They were all a glowing orange in a chevron shape and about the size of large stars. The first three flew in a V, one in front and two on either side and slightly behind. The fourth flew to the right of the three and just before disappearing fell into formation and the four were a diamond. I don&#39;t think that they were Earthly crafts because of how fast they flew and the odd orage glow they gave off. Not to mention they appeared to be far away and did not appear nor disappear into a horizon. It was a clear night and they just were there, flew over my head and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other seemingly similar reports from KS and VA for this date.  PD))<n>

Then the five lights moved around to form a huge triangle with the brightest light at the top and two at the bottom and the two other lights at the sides which turned into outward slashes similar to jet contrails with a pinkish tint. A few minutes later the brightest of the lights turned into a slash and headed to the left while the other lights disappeared. This lasted around 10 minutes.

11/1/02 16:45|Calgary (Canada)|AB|Sphere|1-2 minutes|Observed sun reflecting off object following behind and to the right of commercial aircraft in Canada.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36133.html|286|ndxe200211| Observed sun reflecting off object following behind and to the right of commercial aircraft in Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Learned of your site tonight listening to Coast To Coast-  This occurred sometime in November or December of 2002. Driving home from work on the Trans Canada Highway on the western edge of Calgary proceeding west- I observed a commercial aircraft overflying Calgary at cruise altitudes proceeding west ahead of me.  The sun had just set below the horizon, however the sun was reflecting off the commercial aircraft and the vapor trail behind it.  The sky was bright blue, clear and this sight was very pretty.  At this point I noticed a reflection off an object slightly to the right and to the rear of the commercial aircraft. The reflection was also moving and was matching the speed of the commercial aircraft.  From my position driving my truck down the highway-the commercial aircraft and object were approx 45-50 degrees above the horizon and my estimations were that the object was at the same altitude as the commercial aircraft, approx 1000- 2000 ft behind it( less than a mile) The 2nd objects speed and distance remained constant for the duration. There was no vapor trail behind the 2nd object, and the commercial aircraft did emmit a vapor trial 3-5 miles long.  As they proceeded westbound the reflections changed slightly  - and I was left with the impression the object was much smaller than the commercial aircraft and was spherical in shape.   Eventually as they proceeded westbound they dropped below my feild of view ( Large hill just west of Calgary ) I have a 25 year background in aviation including over 5000 hrs of flying and found it very odd to have two aircraft flying formation and to have only one emitting a vapor trail at such altitudes. My hobbies include astronomy and following the USA Space Programs and I am familiar with Planets-satilites- the Space Station -Shuttle re-entry  and most things which we see in the sky.  This was something very different than I had observed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/02 12:05|Santa Cruz|CA|Circle|15 minutes|Small, high-altitude reflective object moving steadily to the south over Santa Cruz, CA.|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25896.html|287|ndxe200211| Small, high-altitude reflective object moving steadily to the south over Santa Cruz, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 24 year old waiter and substitute teacher living in Santa Cruz, California.  At approximately 12:05 in the afternoon I went to the curb to take out the garbage.  I heard the sound of an airplane overhead, and I looked up to spot the airplane as I often do.  I saw the airplane travelling along the usual course that I see airliners take, but before I got back to the task of taking out the trash I spotted a strange, small bright light in the sky.  The light was about 45 degrees from the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky.  At first the light looked stationary like a star, but then I perceived it slowly moving towards me to the east.  The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptively.  As I continued to watch the object, it became clear to me that it was moving to the south.  At this point, the object seemed to start moving slightly more rapidly, but that could have just been my perception.  The object seemed very far away and appeared to reflect light much like a star or a satellite.  The object appeared to be circular to me.  About five minutes into this encounter I ran inside to get my phone and called my neighbor who was out running errands.  As I talked to him I continued to watch the object travel south at a steady pace.  Approximately ten minutes into the encounter my neighbor came home and I pointed out the object to him.  He admitted that he found it strange.  He suggested that it was a balloon, but a balloon would not reflect light like that.  Could I have perhaps seen the space station in orbit? This is not the first strange encounter I have had with unidentified objects in the sky.  Please contact me if you can provide any explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS is not visible during daylight hours, under most circumstances,  and it certainly is not visible from the ground for 15 minutes.  It usually passes out of sight of an observer on the ground within 1-4 minutes.  Moreover, although the ISS was visible over Santa Cruz on this date, it passed over at 04:27 and 06:00 hrs. (local time).  Please see the following URL for details:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.heavens-above.com/passsummary.asp?lat=36.974&amp;lng=-122.030&amp;alt=21&amp;loc=Santa+Cruz&amp;TZ=PST&amp;satid=25544&amp;Date=37554.8333333333&amp;Mag=<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that Santa Cruz sits on the California coast probably reduces the likelihood that the object was a helium-filled balloon, since it would have had to drift in from the ocean, since the winds apparently were generally from the west at the time of the sighting.

11/1/02 07:20|Traverse City|MI|Other|3-5 minutes|Very large, dark object flying very low over water, moving too smoothly and silently for airplane of any kind|11/4/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25911.html|289|ndxe200211| Very large, dark object flying very low over water, moving too smoothly and silently for airplane of any kind<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 07:20 Fri. 11/2, sitting in my car in a local parking lot, watching the snow clouds move from North to South; saw what I thought was another, darker cloud moving, but realized it had a shape, sort of like a wingless C-47 cargo plane but no sound whatsoever, and it was moving AGAINST the southbound clouds. It moved first to the north, then very smoothly--no jerkiness at all--it started toward where I was sitting (I was west of it), then again moved in another direction, heading south, and one more time to the north, then it vanished without a sound. I&#39;ve lived next door to our local airport for 49 years, so I know it wasn&#39;t a plane--they&#39;re never soundless, nor do they move so smoothly, and obviously cannot change direction so quickly. I don&#39;t know if anyone saw this; there was a lot of traffic, but all work-bound toward downtown Traverse City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was no more than 500 yards away from me, and very low in the sky. Traverse City is sited on Grand Traverse Bay, and it was the bay that I was facing. I got out of my car as soon as I realized this was something unusual so that I could determine whether there was any resemblance to plane engine noise; nothing but car and truck sounds, however. Size of object would have been about the size of a 777 plane, but nothing larger than a DC-10 or a very small jet can land/take off from our small airport, nor does anything fly that low over the bay (my guess would be approximately 500 hundred feet above the surface of the water, no joke)except the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, who are here each summer for a couple of days. Again, there was absolutely NO SOUND AT ALL, NONE WHATSOEVER, TOTAL QUIET as far as any plane engine, and much too smooth of moves and direction changes to have been a plane.<n>

If you cannot read Chinese, here is a basic translation from me, please execuse my English.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The news: On Nov 1, 2002, from 2:30 AM to 6:00 AM, a UFO was hanging over the eastern sky of Yi-NING city, XinJiang Province (the province is located in Western China, near Russia). Four journalists observed and photoed this UFO from different angels and areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Nov 1 at 2:30 AM, one caller called the hotline of a newspaper and said &#34;come out, there is a flying saucer in the estern sky!&#34; One journalist said, over the eastern sky, he saw a bright rice sized object emitted  with yellow, blue, and pink lights. Around 4:20 AM, all fo the sudden, the object became big, the color changed to deep red, the shape is ball-like. The size of the object became 1/4 size of the moon that night. The surface of the object has different cycles. Later, the object moved to the south, a few seconds later, it became a rice size again. Around 6:05 AM, the object became big again, seconds later, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A professor at Nanjing Scientific Observation of Chinese Science Academy studied 27 pictures took by the journalists, he believed the object came from somewhere rather than the earth, this is not a natural formation like weather etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said the object is NOT a ballon, airplane, cloud, rocket, or lights from skycrapers, neither a satellite because satellite won&#39;t be able to seen over the eastern sky of Xinjiang (Russia). He also estimated this object was turning and emitting some small objects, the height of this object was about 10000 meters above the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The link: http://news.creaders.net/headline/newsPool/8A150802.html The image: &lt;a img=http://news.creaders.net/headline/newsImage/A150802.jpg&gt;<n>

The light was pink in color and it darted all over the sky in a somewhat jagged pattern.  It moved much too quickly to be any human craft that I&#39;ve ever seen.  At some points in flight it seemed to stop and hover for a moment much like a humming bird.  This could not have been a meteor because the pattern of flight was too controlled.  Also, I was most intrigued with this sighting because we saw it on a mountain at a city overlook where light pollution is highest.<n>

The object was a black square shape and moved five times as fast as any aircraft I see fly over my house towards Austin-Bergstrom Int&#39;l airport. The object was also very large and had no lights at all. After the object moved across the sky to my left and behind a tree I ran in to get my roommate and when I came back out it had moved straight up or past the large tree. This thing was unbelievable and I am hoping there were other sightings of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
