It took place sometime during the mid-1950&#39;s most probably, as I remember her stating that my oldest sister was in the vehicle with her and my second oldest sister was a baby (she was born in 1954).  She stated it was during the spring or summer, as her car windows were down at the time.  She said it had just gotten dark outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother had been at the local hospital visiting my grandmother and was leaving to return home.  The hospital was across a 2 lane street from the water (Bogue Sound) and on the other side of the sound is a small strip of beach which directly faces the Atlantic Ocean.  Our beach runs east-west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she was backing out of her parking space she saw a round, saucer shaped craft approaching from the south (over the water).  She stated it wasn&#39;t very high &amp; made no sound (again, her windows were down at the time).  It was low enough that she could easily make out round, what she called &#34;portholes&#34; around the periphery of the saucer.  She stated there was yellowish/white light coming from the &#34;portholes&#34;.   Unsure whether it was actually windows of a sort she was seeing or if it could have been round lights?  She stated it was moving slowly and silently.  It was flying, again, from the southeast to the northwest, over the hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was basically following the same direction she would have to go to return home, she decided to try to follow it.  She followed it as it flew over the treetops a couple of blocks and turned left to head west.  She stated it also seemed to head in a more westerly direction, up the highway.  As she reached her turnoff at 20th Street, she stated she lost sight of it heading west-northwest over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she got home, she told my father about it but he advised her not to mention it to anyone or they would think she was crazy.  She only ever told the family about it.  However, a couple of days later, in our local newspaper, a local businessman who owned &amp; operated a service station around 25th Street (5 blocks from where she last saw it) reported seeing it and described exactly the same thing she had seen, at almost the same time.  He said it flew right over his service station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to tr to locate that newspaper article.  If I can find it I will forward it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We lived in Dumas, 47 miles north of Amarillo.  We heard jets flying overhead and went outside to see them as this was not normal to have any air traffic over our community with the exception of large military aircraft that flew over at very high altitudes during the day.  We were delighted as youngsters to see the lights of the jets as they chased some odd looking lights overhead.  The lights appeared to be about the same size as the jets and they would let the jets get close then they would change course immediately.  My mother and sister were also witnesses.  My brother-in-law was stationed at AFB and told us that after the jets returned that night, the base was locked down for 24 hours.  I don&#39;t recall that there was any further news about it and the family never discussed it again as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was playing outside with my friends.  There were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a whirling noise and looked up.  I saw a cigar shaped object above us.  I thought it was a cloud.  I told the kids that there where no clouds in the sky.  It sat over us for a few minutes and when, I looked up, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still remember that time. This was in the 50s and Lubbock had the unidentified lights going on.  I think it had to do with Reese Airforce Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to a gentleman at Roswell and he thinks I may have seen something at my young age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The other 2 women looked &amp; started screaming for their kids to come out.  I was a child of 7 when I flew out the back steps and saw a huge spacecraft take off straight up and disappear.  My mother, aunt, and neighbor were shaking and running in all directions. The women were in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s, sane women, and the neighbor&#39;s husband was in politics in Redbank, NJ. They ran up to the local grocery store and heard other people had sighted UFO&#39;s that winter on the beach.  At that time Long Beach Island was scarcely populated during the winter months. In June, the season had not quite started. My mother &amp; neighbor are now deceased, but my aunt is still alive, and lucid.  The UFO made no sound.<n>

It then proceeded north at a great speed and stopped at about the 2 oclock position.  It then returned to nearly overhead, stayed there for maybe a minute and then shot off to where it came from.  We decided to investigate on our own and some of us checked with weather to see if any balloons had been sent up.  Some of us checked to see is anything had been picked up on radar.  Some of us checked the flight schedule for aircraft.  NOTHING showed up on any reports, we concluded that this could have been a UFO.  There were approximately 35 airmen in that squadron.  This happened at Chanute AFB&lt; Illinois in 1955.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was after dark. The tide was low. I looked out to sea where the breakers were visible in the moon. Suddenly I saw three large fire balls, lined up in a row parallel to the breakers. They were the size of a house each, moving very slow along the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first fireball reached a point, it suddently accelerated rapidly, left to right, and moved 90 degrees up, into the night sky. As each of the other two fireballs reached this approximate location, they, too, accelerated rapidly and moved 90 degrees up into the night sky and disappeared (growing smaller and smaller until I couldn&#39;t see them)  Hard to judge speed, but I would guess hundreds of miles per hour once they started to move up into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was frightened and turned to head back to my house and litteraly bumped into a strange man standing on the beach. He didn&#39;t look at me. Stared at the fireballs. Said in a detached way, &#34;Ball lightening. It was ball lightening.&#34;  I ran home and have never forgotten that vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Located Northeast of Youngstown near Pennsylvania. (PA is apprx 30 to 40 minutes from where we lived. The Year? Maybe 1955 to 1956.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ****************************************************  I was apprx 3 or 4 years old (not yet started school) when I was up early in the morning w/ my mom and dad. Dad was preparing to go to work and it was in the summertime. I recall it being early in the morning (break of dawn) and walking outside w/ dad, giving him and hug, kiss, and waving as he drove off for work. I was in the driveway on my red bike (along w/ my Cocker Spaniel named Pedro). I looked up towards the north and saw a huge black blimp-looking thing moving (from east to west)over our house and moving over the apple/cherry trees that we shared w/ a long distance cousin next door who we called &#34;Cousin Odell&#34;. It was moving at a slow pace and as I stared at this huge black thing...it slowed down and hovered over the orchard trees and just stayed there. My dog and I moved closer towards it and Pedro was barking at it when suddenly his tail tucked, ears went back and he ran up on the breezeway and sat down. I was so intriqued by this gigantic baloon and  I just stood there in awe! I stared at it for the longest.I then heard a faint humming sound. When it made this humming sound I saw these tiny red lights (like dots) around the belly of this &#34;balloon&#34;. And because it hovered so long..and then made this humming noise, I dropped everything and ran into the house to tell my mom to come outside and see this &#34;big gigantic and huge black balloon&#34; She finally adhered as I grabbed her hand and led her outside..only to find that this gigantic balloon was gone. I tried to explain the big baloon to her, etc. etc. That was it! Nothing else. Nor have I seen it again. Whether my mom mentioned it to anyone else or whether other phenomonen was reported...I couldn&#39;t tell you...I was very young at the time. Although I looked for it incessantly until I was in my teens and thought nothing of it until one day, I saw a report on TV about UFOs and saw a picture of what this person had seen...and wala! There it was! Exactly the same thing I saw! It was shaped just like a huge gigantic black cigar! It was black (kind of like the goodyear blimp w/out the tail, etc).This object is still vivid in my mind today. I wanted to share this w/ you because looking in retrospect....I definately saw a UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The light is burnt into my memory liked it happened only this morning. I am now 54 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience happen on a farm in northwest Missouri.  I have not talked about this experience much in my life because its sounds like a little boys dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little history about my family.  I am one of 17 children, 8 older and 8 younger.  This happened one summer morning.  My brothers and sisters slept in the upstairs of the house.  There were 2 rooms, a boys room and a girls room.  The bed I was sleeping in that night was up against the east window. This bed had a old rot iron head board that you could see thru.  I was awakened that morning from a voice that kept saying wake up over and overuntil I was awake and sitting up.  The voice then said look out the window, which was open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked out the window I noticed that there was total silence.  This time of the morning there are usually chickens, birds and other animals making some kind of noise.  The voice then told me to look up in the sky.  It was pre-dawn and just starting to get light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up I noticed a bright star or light about 45 degree from the horizon in the middle of the sky.  As I watched the light it moved verticly down to the horizon then all the way up to the top of my vision, about 90 degree from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then went back to the center of the sky and moved horizontal to the left of my vision then all the way to the right of my field of vision and then back to the center of the sky.  The sun came up then and the light disapeared. I looked around the room and my brothers wwere still sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experince scared me so bad that I ran down stairs and climbed in bed with my Father and Mother.  My mother woke up and ask me why I was shaking so bad.  I said I had saw something and was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have often thought about this experience and wondered if I was having a dream or nightmare.  To me this was real and not a dream.  I was awake and aware of what was going on around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of my brothers woke up during this experience and I never mentioned it to them for several years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only one I told for a long time was my mother.  I have never! in my l ife had this type of experience since that day.<n>

It was orange in color and very large. One could associate it as the moon, except it was in our atmosphere.  After watching it for a few minutes I went into my parents house to get a flashlight, in an effort to send a morse code toward it, hoping for a response, but unable to find a flashlight I went back outside.  This is when this ufo had moved into the eastern sky.  Then coming from the north are four jet airplanes heading toward this object. They were probably scrambled from the national guard out of Indianapolis after radar picked this ufo up on their screen.  The size comparison between these jets and the ufo would be like four toothpicks attacking a beach ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after these jets got nearby the ufo the ufo, still dull orange in color, zipped to the south into infinity.  The jets were going nowhere, except to eventually turn around.  I checked the daily newspapers for two weeks following this event, assuming that others had seen this ufo or at least a report on scrambling these jet, but to my surprise nothing was printed.  Later, during that same time period, while walking, I noticed what appeared to be a ferris wheel in the north-west sky.  Thinking that could be a reflection, possibly from a fair, until the objects going around the center took off in different directions, as well as the larger hub itself.  The color of these different units were metalic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was dark on a summer night, my two older brothers were asleep, and I believe my Mom was also. I remember I was talking to my Dad, as our car came to a rise on the road a bright light appeared over a ridge and my Dad told me there might be a forrest fire and to awake my brothers, my Dad woke my Mother All of us were dumdfounded at what was before us, the egg shaped craft landed about a hundered feet down the road. It sat there for 5 or 6 minutes. There was no sound, smoke or any thing else. My Dad said it must be from Oak Ridge which was about 16 miles away. The craft rose as in slow motion, Nothing else was said about it by family. My dad was in the war, and he told us kids it was not right to poke our noses into something that might involve or critize America or to tell any one about what we saw because they would only laugh at us.

Bronze saucer/cylindrical craft; approx. 3:30 p.m., no life form sited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was such an amazing sighting.  The craft was deep bronze in color with a glow about it, probably due to the time of day and the sun&#39;s position.  This was in a relatively remote suburban location, and we were simply in the large back area having a family picnic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared suddenly at some (miles?) away and slowly approached us...however, it did not attempt to get too near, but instead laid back at a distance for a little time and then suddenly veered to its left and disappeared. The object was absolutely huge. At no time did we feel threatened in any way...it was almost a protective feeling.  We did not report the incident, but rather just took in in stride for some reason.  As I reflect back now, I feel that it was a direct emissary from God.  We saw no evidence of life form, except for the magnificent warmth of color of the object and obvious intelligence of the crafters of same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I managed to break free of the (mind) control just before they left. Over the years there has been return visits by more than one type of being.  One did not want for there activitys known by the other. At 10 years of age I was made to forget.  When my son was 5 years later they returned and wanted to know about any activities with other aliens. They imployed mind control on both myself and my son, both of us broke from there control just before leaving the house with them, I was unable to move, but was able to tell my son to fight them, he kicked and punched two of the aliens near him.  When hit they did not respond in any way?  They seemed like puppets being controlled remotely, arms and legs of at least 6 (small greys) aliens move together (in sync).  When hit they went blank (stopped moving). At this point I no longer felt fear, and they again had control of me. My son also remembers this encounter, only about 2 or 3 minutes.  After that I only broke out 2 other times for very short periods of time.  One: as they took me into there craft (a joke looked shabby). two: laying down inside being interrogated. When 10 years old on the day I was told I would forget, I wrote what I knew down on paper, put it in jar, buried it behind our home and started a fire on top of it.  Then I went a got the cattle for my dad too milk.  This is were they said I would think of them for the last time.  Coming back I was surprised by men in the woods putting out the fire that I started.  At first I couldn&#39;t even remember that I set the fire. Years after I remembered I had started the fire and had buried something.  I have looked but would need to dig up a space of around 30 sq feet.<n>

Myself &amp; group of peers where playing in a &#34;weedfield&#34;, we spotted three saucer shaped craft very low to the ground, approaching us. That&#39;s all we saw. We all where chastized by our parents for getting home so late. No one was hurt, nothing was missing. After being grounded for 3 days because of getting home late we returned to site location &amp; found three large &#34;swirls&#34; next to our &#34;fort&#34; where we where at when first sighting those three objects. That was about 45 years ago. I would like to send you a zipped file containing information that may be related to this event. But first I need to know if you are able to print out DCAD2 schematics. If not, I will be forced to send that program as well. In that event, I want assurance that you will use it only for the purpose of printing out the relavant information &amp; that you will not use it for anything else. My texts are in Lotus Wordpro format, can you print those out? Let me know. Reply to me @ ((address and name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))<n>
