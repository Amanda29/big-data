We thought at first it was some sort of game but hovering right on top of a house was a disk shaped object.It was about eight feet long and five feet high.It made no sound at all but you had the feeling it was aware of you.This was Not man made or ball lighting.While we were watching it a man drove up. He had been following it across the desert from highway 395.The strange thing was , he was in the military and said he had seen this type of craft before outside a base in Colorado but only at night.Stead is a decommissiond Air Force base.After a few minutes it slowly rose up,again without a sound reached a height of a hundred feet or so then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on a winding road late at night and saw red lights ahead.  Thinking this was a truck I tried to catch up to it to help drive better on this road.  Before I knew it I was going about 75 mph in a little toyota corrolla and it was shaking from this speed and probably bad alignment but the shaking brought me to my senses that what kind of truck could this be.  I stopped quickly and so did the lights.  I stared at them seeing a mercedes symbol like shape without the ring around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Scared I backed up about 50 yards and looked at it.  I couldn&#39;t tell if the center of object was closer or farther away then the 3 points it was molten red in color.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was in front of me or refracting off my windshield from above.  I was a pretty wild young man at the time and I don&#39;t know why I did what I did next only that I wanted to prove what I was seeing was real.  I drove for it straight at it shifting gears as soon! as I apprached it speeding up it took off with me almost like a magnet would repel its polar opposite.then just as quickly it accelerated at a high rate of speed and was gone<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was looking south at the night sky (from an outdoor terrace)  and up and at least 10,000 feet in the air there was a light that travelled from point A to B in milliseconds and then stopped.  It travelled in jaggered, supersonic right angles and then stopped and then disappeared.  It then returned (moments later) in the western sky but lower around 2,000 feet and then stopped and didn&#39;t move, it then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: Point A to Point B must have been at least 5 miles from each other, considered the height that the object was travelling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/20/75 17:00|Hudson|NY|Unknown|30 sec?|I was alone, travelling north east on a local side road (Harry Howard Ave.) coming out of Hudson and on my way home from one of our bus|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46039.html|4|ndxe197511| I was alone, travelling north east on a local side road (Harry Howard Ave.) coming out of Hudson and on my way home from one of our business locations.  As I rounded a turn in the road just past the New York State Firemens Home, I could see the  intersection of Joslen Blvd  approximately a quarter mile ahead of me. On my left I was approaching the newly built Hudson High School.  I was traveling only about 25 mph. since it was a school zone. It was dark already by about 4-4:30 pm, in mid November.  There were no leaves on the large old trees which lined Joslen Blvd. at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point I saw two large bright lights off to my left, in the distance, approaching from the east, above a house located on Joslen Blvd.  I took my foot off the gas and rolled down my window.  I was sure I was seeing a large plane with it’s landing lights on, about to crash. At the same time, I noticed there was no sound of jets or any engine noise at all, except my own car engine.  The lights came over top of  the house, then sharply turned south, following the road.( Joslen )  The lights flew in what seemed to be perfect unison, above the roadway, maybe 15 to 20 feet in the air, ( judging from the height of the trees along the road ).  The lights followed the road for a few seconds.  At that moment I thought it was going to crash into a small grocery store to the right of the intersection.  But when it got to the intersection , it changed direction again and shot quickly up in the air, and over the trees going east toward route 9 and out of my sight. The same lights remained visible even after changing direction and heading away from me. I could see no outline of any air craft, only the 2 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of going home, I turned right at the intersection and immediately drove over to the shopping center on route 9 to see where it went or if anyone there had also seen it.  I found no one else had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home, I realized that the trees along the back road could never accommodate the wing span of a plane that size without some contact or damage.  These lights were the size of what you would see on a large passenger plane or jet coming in at night for a runway landing. But these lights did not seem to throw light into the distance as the landing lights do on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and told my children and my husband what I saw.  I don’t have to describe the reaction.  And, since no one else had seen it, I have never spoken of it again. Thanks for the chance to relate my experience to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is it possible that someone else has witnessed something similar?  I have heard many different types of sightings described, but not any description similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Two came down in my direction, one moved to the east the other 30ft overhead of where I was.  it changed light color as it was comming down, and when it reached 30 ft of me I saw that it was metalic and had windows and someother things on the outside.  It hovered and sort of dipped up and down in the front. suddenly a very bright light burst into my room, It was a orange shade of light, and I blacked out. I woke up standing up at about 04:00 hrs and was very shaken and afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval and a more narrow front than back, It looked to be about  12 feet long and about 5 or 6 feet wide in the center. It had windows in the front and on each side. also there were other objects on the front that were what looked to me like lights mabe or what I don&#39;t know they had a blue color to them. It made no noise that I could hear,  I could feel a prickley sensation, like sound would make if the base was turned to high. When the light burst suddenly into the room I only saw it for about 2 seconds before I blanked out.  When I woke the room was as it was before only I was by my door instead of the window. I was completely terrified, I Didn&#39;t  leave my room for several hours. In that time I was unable to believe what had happened. I told my mother when she got up and was in the kitchen.  The raido was on and on the news we heard that a police officer reported a UFO sighting about the same time as mine, He was located near burdines mall on Kendal drive, which is southeast of where I was.<n>
11/16/75 03:00|Miami|FL|Teardrop|1 hour|UFO lights in night sky, one came down and was wittnessed by young girl.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94476.html|6|ndxe197511| UFO lights in night sky, one came down and was wittnessed by young girl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 3:00 am at  XXXXX SW 39th Terrace, Miami, Florida 33175.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 16th 1975, I was awake and looking out the window in my bedroom at the sky.   As I was scanning, and looking for different stars, I saw about 12 lights moving around each other.  Then the lights grouped into pairs of two, and went into different directions.  Two of the lights began to fly into the direction of my area, and then they began to come down and as they descended the light they emitted changed color.  As near as I can remember, they started out as white light, then red, then orange, then yellow, then blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost site of one of them, but one came over the yard in back of my house, between my house and the neighbor’s house.  The light was very blue and everything seemed bathed in that light. It was a craft that was mostly teardrop shaped. It had lights in the front and on top and it kept dipping slightly in the front, as it hovered there.  There was a sound, but I cannot explain it.  I have never heard it before or since.  I became terrified and I tried to drop down to the side of my bed and crawl under it, but just as I started to move, I saw a very bright burst of light and I think I was knocked out.  When I came to, it was around 4:45 am.  I was shaken, and when my Mother got up to start breakfast, I told her about it.   My Mother had turned on the radio and we heard the news man tell about a police officer in Dade land who reported a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never spoken of this to anyone else, and was afraid to report it.  I did not want to look crazy.  I have never forgotten it though, and lately saw footage of similar lights on a tv show.  It prompted me, and I have now made a report of my incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((initials deleted))<n>
11/15/75 23:00|Townsend|MA|Circle|20 minutes|Bright object resembling a full moon with strobe like chaser lights going around the bottom. Used a spot light then left.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52041.html|7|ndxe197511| Bright object resembling a full moon with strobe like chaser lights going around the bottom. Used a spot light then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place back in 1975-1976. I never reported this as I thought no one would believe me. Recently, I was watching a special UFO show on the Discovery channel and just about fell off my bed when a photo showed a UFO that was EXACTLY like the one my Mother and I saw way back when. Perhaps I will now come forward and hope my experience will help you and those researching UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my sighting took place, I had been in bed with an illness. I was laying on what my parents called our &#34;sun porch&#34; it was a room filled with windows and hanging plants. It was around 11:30 PM as my Father and Mother were watching a Football game on the TV. I&#39;m not sure if this was in October or November but it was definately one of those months. In any event I had been laying in bed and noticed it was getting very light outside. I thought that odd, so I looked out the window to investigate. I was shocked to find hovering over our barn a very large circular object that looked like a full moon. It definately was NOT the moon as the moon was in a different area of the sky. It made NO noise at all, NOTHING! I screamed for my parents to come and look but my Father just laughed and continued watching the game. My Mother on the other hand, did come out to investigate with me. We opened the door and went out side to get a better view. The object was approximately 20-30 feet above our barn and was very bright. The craft had a metalic type appearence in the shape of a full moon and the same brightness. I ventured out to the lawn while my mother stood on the porch watching. I can still remember looking up at this object while standing on the cold,grass. I waved at it and yelled up but it just continued to hover over our barn. I then noticed lights which looked like chaser lights in a strobe like fashion going all around the bottom outside of the craft. It continued strobing for about 5 minutes then suddenly a bright light focused directly onto me. My Mother began yelling for me to get back into the house immediately. I will NEVER forget that night as long as I live! My hair stood up similar to when your wearing stocking feet on a carpet. The light was fixed directly onto me and what ever was operating the craft definately saw me and focused a spot light of some kind directly onto me for about 10 minutes. I felt as if I could not even move it was very weird sensation which is very difficult to even describe. I could hear my Mother yelling for me to get back into the house and suddenly I was able to move again and ran as fast as I could back into the house. The spot light continued to stay in place even after I was back on the porch. With in a few minutes the spot light disappeared and the craft continued to hover above our barn with out making a single sound. Then it suddenly disappeard. It just vanished and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mother and I went inside to tell my Father what had happened. He told us we were crazy and wanted to know what we had been drinking. My Mother was a Nurse and worked for a local town Physician. Townsend was a small town and my Mother and I decided not to mention our experience to anyone as we felt no one would believe us, or they would definately make fun of it. Even so, I had a difficult time trying to explain to friends and neighbors why I had a sun burn in the middle of fall when I had not even been outside due to my illness. My Mother and I came to the conclusion that the spot light from the floating object caused the sunburn. We had no other explanation for the redness of my skin. I had gone to bed pale and woke up with a sunburn! Why? I have no clue! Since that time I never forgot that and probably never will. I was NOT taken into the craft or saw aliens or anything like that. I have no idea what my Mother and I saw that night but it definately was NOT military.  When I graduated High school, I went onto spend 2 years in College then dropped out of College and went into the United States Navy. My military training consisted of working in a PatWing where I saw lots of planes. I spoke with several fighter pilots and worked as a radio operator with a TS clearance. Several pilots spoke to me about things they had seen but were unable to discuss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless of that, I&#39;ve always wanted to know if anyone else had ever seen what my Mother and I saw back in Townsend Mass on that chilly night. I&#39;ve rarely spoken to anyone about that particular night but feel that someone should know. Hopefully people like you who research this for a living might help to shed some light on the sightings that I and so many others in this World have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place many years ago. Like my Mother, I also went to Nursing School after I was discharged from the Navy. I only tell you this so you will know I am a reliable witness to what I saw. Perhaps one day we will all have an answer to what is happening in the skies of our World. I know for a fact that our Government and the Government of other Countries keep things from the public which I&#39;ve never understood why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your research and I wish you luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely ((initials deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in November 1975 is approximate.

It first appeared rising from the glow of city lights west of us. At first I thought it was an airplne leaving MIA, but quickly thought otherwise as there was an orangish pulsating glow around it. It&#39;s speed seemed incredible. As it neared us it appeared to be disk like with green &amp; red lights alternately around its edge. When it was about overhead it ssuddenly shot straight up &amp; then headed north as a circular glow that very quickly dissapeared. The other three observers were my wife, an author, who owned the boat &amp; his wife. The next day my wife &amp; my friend independantly phoned the Miami Herald to ask if NASA had sent anything into space, &amp; if anyone had reported anything unusual in the skies. The answers were negative. We kept quiet less our friends &amp; business associates miht think us looney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/75 21:30|Girard|OH|Oval|45seconds?|low flying oval light with zig zag bands on it .|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44421.html|9|ndxe197511| low flying oval light with zig zag bands on it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the exact time of night but it must have been at least after 9:00pm because my mom told me to take out the garbage . I was always forgetting to do this and this time was no exception.  I walked out of the back door grabbed both cans and walked around the corner of the house. I had taken maybe 6 steps when the thought to look up occured to me. I mention this because it seemed kind of odd to me afterward that I had this thought. I looked directly up(12:00) and saw bright, white, oval or elipse shaped light . The light had diagonal bands or lines that were in a zig-zag pattern across the short diameter of the elipse . The lines were on the apparent bottom and were darker in color than the rest of it. The light was moving due north at slow steady speed. I was facing south . It was kind of a blustery night with strong winds and a very low cloud ceiling . The clouds were moving in a southerly direction at a really good clip . Racing across the sky if you will . At first I thought it was a spotlight shing on the bottom of the clouds but the light was shining down THRU the clouds and I could see wisps of cloud partially obscuring the light . The light was so intense though that I could see  right thru them . There was NO sound at all. As near as I could tell the object/light was just above the cloud layer which seemed to be somewhat less than a 1000 ft. Thats a really uneduacated guess but the best I can give. I was really stunned by this sight and stood there watching it until it went out of sight and for a good while after. What really got me was the fact  of having seen it DIRECTLY over me .I mean if you had dropped a plumb line from it I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT THERE and that precise second is  when I looked up. A  half a second later and I woulnt have seen it at all because it would have been out of my field of vision. The odds of that happening the way it did seemed to be important to me in some way at the time. When I went back in the house my mom asked what had taken so long and I was surprised at her question and I told her nothing! I dont know why I didnt tell her but  I did tell my brother who was very unimpressed . I remember staying up all night thinking about it over and over . Thanks for listening and for the work you do .<n> <n><n> <n><n> p.s. I almost forgot ! The size of the light object was slightly less than a lemon if you held it up to the sky . Im also somewhat of an artist and plan to send a drawing .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/75 21:00|Anderson|IN|Disk|5 minutes|Large craft with lights and whirring sound. Object stopped mid air. Lights sequenced. Object darted and stopped twice.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27668.html|10|ndxe197511| Large craft with lights and whirring sound. Object stopped mid air. Lights sequenced. Object darted and stopped twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the fall of 1975,  I was newly married and enrolled in graduate school at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.  My husband had been a US Air Force pilot of T-38s and other aircraft.  He had been trained to recognize the configuration of aircraft.  We had visited my parents at the farm in Morgan County, Indiana.  We were driving back to college on a dark Sunday evening in the fall of 1975.  There had been a heavy snowfall, but the weather had cleared.  There was a bright moon and puffy clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving on I-69 between Indianapolis and Anderson, Indiana. I saw lights in the sky, and at first I thought the lights were coming from a large aircraft that was in a steep bank (turning). Then the lighted object seemed to bank the other direction.  I watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  I had never told my husband about seeing a UFO in 1965.  I said, &#34;Is that an airplane?&#34;  He said, &#34;No.&#34;  We watched the lights getting closer. We were traveling northeast and getting closer.  The lights were so close to us, that I said, &#34;Pull over.&#34;  A couple of other cars pulled off to the edge of the interstate.  We were parked on the east side of the interstate, and the object stopped in the air over a large lighted parking lot of a factory or shopping area on the west side of I-69, near Anderson, Indiana.  My husband rolled down his window to get a clear view without reflection.  The lights on the craft were in a horizontal row, similar to lights coming from inside a lighted passenger compartment of a jet.  There were also red and green lights on the object.  We could hear a whirring sound, but not a roaring sound.  Then ... the lights appeared to start moving in sequence ...left to right.  I wonder now if the object was rotating on a horizontal plane and if the object was turning rather than lights coming off and on.  The object darted to the east and in about one second appeared to be stopped again to the east of I-69, maybe about two miles away from us.  &#34;Follow it.&#34; ... I said.  My husband exited the interstate and headed toward the object.  The object then darted in the air to the west side of I-69 and stopped again.  Then it went behind thick clouds, and we couldn&#39;t see it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our drive to our apartment on the Ball State campus in Muncie.  We stopped and ordered a pizza.  It was very late at night - maybe after 10pm. We told the pizza guy about the UFO, but we didn&#39;t attempt to report the incident to the FAA or even to the Muncie airport.  We had college on our minds, and the next day was just another day.  I felt so blessed that my husband, a pilot, actually saw the object, heard the whirring, and saw how quickly the object could move.  I also felt fortunate that I could have seen two UFOs and that I wasn&#39;t just seeing things back in 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if there is a kind of convergence of solar systems that makes space travel easier about every ten years.  I live near the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where supposedly the wreckage and the alien victims of the Roswell, New Mexico crash are kept in a secret area.  Most of the people who know about it are probably in their seventies or eighties.  I wonder if any of them will ever talk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We doubt that the Sun, or its planets, come anywhere close to any other star system.  If such occurred, we would see two stars in the daytime sky, not one.  Date in November 1975 is approximate.

It stayed with me all these years, I never told people what we saw, but I always knew it was not of this world.

Now my eyes have been searching the night sky ever since i was 17.  Im now 42 and ill always stare into infinity wondering, will i ever see anything like that again?  My friend and i remain close after all these years, and have talked of returning to that same spot with camcorders in hand..........just in case!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Sorry, but at the time there weren&#39;t any reporting agencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually stood within 50 feet of a flying UFO that was only 30 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound.  There was no wind. The stars were out and what I saw was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.  It was round, but had a magnificent display of lights that seems to rotate around the circumference of the disk like object.  There appeared to be a dark hole in the center and the disk was probably only about 300 ft. in diameter.   I thought I saw windows at the top, as it made its way around the old cotton mill.  That part of the building was only about 25 ft. high.  But, the UFO was near the top of the building&#39;s outer edge.  I was looking at it from an angle.  I was standing on a walk way that led to the street that was between me and a parking lot.  The UFO passed over the street lights of the parking lot very slowly.  It appeared to be moving about 20 miles an hour.  I and a friend of mine watched it as it slowly made its way up river towards Greenville, SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time seemed to stand still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

11/1/75 06:00|Australian outback||Unknown|Six minutes|Outback UFO appeared to be observing us, while we observed it.|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38743.html|19|ndxe197511| Outback UFO appeared to be observing us, while we observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1975 I was returning to my home town of Albany Western Australia with three friends. About ten months earlier we had headed off in a car on a working holiday around the country. Most of our time away had been spent in the city of Brisbane, Queensland. Brisbane is on the other side of the country from out starting point. We had stopped for the night on the Western Australian side of the Nullabor Plain. This is a large dessert area that separates Western Australia from the Eastern States, and at the time the almost straight road was mostly unsealed. We were really in the middle of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early morning. It was partly light, but the sun was not fully up. As we were packing up sleeping bags etc, (two of us had slept outside the car) one of the group said &#34;If thats not a flying saucer, then what is it?&#34; We looked up and there was an object moving slowly across the sky. It would have been below low cloud hight and had a bright look, as if it was reflecting the early morning sun, which we could not yet see. If it had kept moving across the sky I may have explained it away, but it didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after first seeing the object, it stopped. Not directly overhead of us, but at a slight angle. It sat there without moving for about two minutes. We heard no sound whatsoever. After about two minutes it moved back in what appeared to be exactly the same direction it had been coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assume we must have watched it till it had moved out of sight, but for some reason I can&#39;t remember that. I remember clearly one of the group saying &#34;lets get out of here&#34; and we got in the car and left. In my presence, we never spoke about what we had seen again. And I&#39;ve long since lost contact with those friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/75 02:00|Camp Pendelton|CA|Flash|45 seconds|On Camp Pendelton a UFO zig-saged across the base and zoomed off at the speed of light.|10/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39843.html|20|ndxe197511| On Camp Pendelton a UFO zig-saged across the base and zoomed off at the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before I got out of the Marines I was on manuvers and while on guard duty at about 2 AM I seen in the western sky a flashing light moving toward the east. As the light got closer it appeared that the light was skipping across the sky in a zig-zag motion. Being a Marine my hair was short but I could feel electricity pulling my hair upward and an electrical charge on the back of my neck. As the light got closer the faster it skipped until directly overhead I noticed a electrical snapping sound. As the craft skipped from ont point to the other it went pop----pop----pop---- until it got faster pop-pop-pop- and finally when directly overhead poppoppoppop-zoom and instantly it flashed off easterly at what I suppose to be the speed of light. Eight other Marines seen the same thing from other positions because the next morning the C.O. asked if anyone seen anything strange the night before about 8 of us stepped foreward and we were debreifed one at a time by a officer described as a NIS officer. After the debriefing we were put together in one room and we were told it was an Air Force experement. Instantly and in unison we all said no way... no one can do what we seen. The Officer then said beleive what you want but it is Top Secret and if you ever talk about you will go to prision for violating your security clearance. I have never seen anything like it nor do I exspect to see anything like it again. Even now I hesitate to talk about it 29 years after the event because I think the Naval Investigation Officer was serious. Government cover-up you better beleive it!!!! They kept me quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  If the event lasted 45 seconds, or so, it could not have been caused by a typical meteor.  PD))<n>
