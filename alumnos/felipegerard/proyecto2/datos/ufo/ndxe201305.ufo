As they were moving they were changing distances from one to another.  They moved for about 30 second to our right. The first one in the row took an almost 90 degree turn upwards.  The other followed. They aligned. The distances between the dots were now equal.   After the alignment, the distances got bigger and bigger.  They then faded.  Two of them reappeared once then faded for good.  I kept looking at the sky to for a few minutes to see if they would reappear, they did not.<n>

After another few seconds, it readjusted course NE.  Then a few seconds later, it switched to its original SE course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when it went behind the tree line and contact was lost.<n>

They were not in formation, they bounced erratically, darting almost like moths to a lightbulb, he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching a movie on my iPad, so did not see all he saw, but he tapped me on the leg and asked me to look and I saw them for about a minute before we passed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright and round spherical shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed them I looked back at them.  There were no red signal lights or running lights to indicate it was an approved airplane, etc., and the erratic way these lights darted place to place were unlike any airplane or helicopter would be capable of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The color of the light was green with a hint of blue.  The light was moving east and I could just glimpse it behind a group of trees.  Then the light reversed direction.  As I watched, the moved around in an irregular way, east to west and back again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into my apartment and asked my husband to come outside and look. It took him only a few seconds to come outside but by then the light was gone.  We stood outside for about 30 seconds before he went back inside.  I came outside again about 1 minute later and the light was back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband out again and this time he also saw the light. We watched it move now not only east to west, west to east, but also north and south. As I watched I saw a man in a car parked across the street. He got out of his car and stood in the park and was filming it. I did not include this man in the data I provided as I did not speak to him.<n>

5/31/13 22:00|Hudson Bend|TX|Unknown|30 minutes|We we saw was unexplainable, but amazing and scary at the same time.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98307.html|8|ndxe201305| We we saw was unexplainable, but amazing and scary at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the RV park at the La Hacienda.  Me and my girl friend walked outside and we were looking at the stars...well we thought they were stars until they started moving.  There was a group of like ten then all the sudden a group of at least a hundred showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started going in a single file line the more showed up as they traveled east then more showed up the ones in the back liked like they were bigger then the ones in the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all stopped, then started flashing on and off(the bigger ones) some of the bigger ones started to rotate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They split up and went west and east the bigger ones stayed together while the smaller ones kept going. It was really creepy we thought they were setting up to do something catastrophic.  For about ten mins the big ones stayed in the same spot then gradually moved to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed outside until the clouds cover them up until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore. It was not a plane or any aircraft mad by man.  It was entirely to high for any aircraft and there were no red flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a firm believer that we are not alone,and I&#39;m 100% sure that we experienced and had our first sighting of a massive group of UFOs this statement is a 100% correct and true I will even take a lie detector test.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE ARE NOT ALONE!<n>
5/31/13 22:00|Austin|TX|Sphere|30 minutes|100+ solid white objects/lights traveling SE to NW at 500-1500 feet overhead.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98558.html|9|ndxe201305| 100+ solid white objects/lights traveling SE to NW at 500-1500 feet overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While at a friend&#39;s house for a pool party, I happened to glance up at the southeastern sky and what I saw was unlike anything I&#39;d seen before.  To my amazement, there was approximately 100 solid white lights moving very rapidly in formation in a northwesterly direction.  At that point I asked the group to look up and confirm what I was seeing.  Everyone was in agreement as to the description but no one in the 7-10 people there could explain what we were seeing.  The objects were moving at a high rate of speed (100+ mph) and there was no sound!  The formation was random with the objects following a consistent flight path.  As the group thinned, there were several small clusters of objects and finally, one was following at a considerable distance behind the others.  The large cluster and subsequent smaller clusters as well as the last few solo objects/lights traveled directly overhead, approximately 500-1500 feet directly above us as we watched in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the event was probably 20+ minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the objects fade into the distance over Lake Travis or in that general direction, the sky began to get hazy with some low level cloud cover. We continued to watch the sky and probably 15-20 minutes after the initial event subsided, we glimpsed a similar formation much higher, above the haze/clouds traveling in the opposite direction. This time since the objects were much higher, they seemed to be moving much more slowly and at times appeared to stop. We eventually lost site of the objects/lights after about another 15-20 minutes as the cloud cover increased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions: clear sky, no clouds during the first period of sighting then low level haze/clouds during the last period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all snapped multiple photos with our phones and recorded video. Unfortunately, most photos and videos were way too dark to see any significant detail. I have posted the best two photos we captured. What we witnessed could not be explained that night and we still have no explanation.<n>

We were going to my car, and when I pulled from out of her driveway, we saw a big rounded rectangle that was a bright fiery orange.  We just jokingly said, “Look it’s a UFO!” then, as we watched it we noticed its flying pattern (south to north).  It had no blinking lights and it hovered more than it flew.  As we watched it, it started to flicker and while it was flickering, we saw three light sources.  It then disappeared.  We used logic to discount anything that was illogical. We did not have a camera on us to take a picture or video.  We proceeded to go inside and do some research.  We read many accounts that saw the same things we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Sky was clear and no other objects noted.<n>
5/31/13 21:30|Cassadaga|NY|Triangle|5-8 minutes|We had 2 sightings of multiple craft within .25 mi area, within a span of one minute, 2 very different types of craft.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/100/S100450.html|14|ndxe201305| We had 2 sightings of multiple craft within .25 mi area, within a span of one minute, 2 very different types of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First sighting (of two):  At 21:30 on May 31, 2013, driving south on Route 60 in Cassadaga, NY, I saw from the rear seat what appeared to be a tall tower of light.  I asked the others in the car &#34;What is that?  What are we looking at? It looks like a tower of light.&#34;  The driver said &#34;There is no tower of light in that field.&#34;  As we watched, the white lights seemed to be emerging from the earth or from Cassadaga Lake, 1,000 feet or so to our left (west).  There appeared to be dozens climbing vertically, one after another, at a relaxed speed.  When the craft reached an altitude of approx 500 feet, they leveled off and headed east.  They were traveling ahead of the car and, in a split second, I had to turn my head back to continue seeing them, now behind us.  I cannot say if there was missing time, but it was a strange sensation.  Each of these crafts had 2 or 4 very bright white lights and were climbing as if on an elevator, one after another.  At one point it appeared that the tower of light were falling over, but it was an optical illusion as they started leveling off and heading east.  They appeared to be moving fairly slowly and yet we observed them for only one minute or less and they had moved quite a bit in that brief space of time.  We could not see the body of the crafts, only the bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting:  The driver had not slowed down, nor had he looked towards the lights, as the remaining 3 of us had. Within .25 miles, we made a right turn onto Dale Dr in Cassadaga ( now heading west).  As we turned, I was still looking above us at the night sky and saw more lights.  I called out &#34;Stop !&#34; &#34;Stop !!!&#34; and when the driver kept driving, I said &#34;Pull the car over !!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all got out of the car and stood under the lights, which appeared to be triangular.  The reason I say triangular is because each set of 3 lights vibrated slightly as they traveled east-south-east.  The vibrational movement was horizontal and each set of 3 lights moved as one.  We had missed several lights, but we watched 3 of these triangular-shaped craft flying in absolute silence, directly above us, at a speed of perhaps 30 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car stopped to ask if we were OK, we said &#34;yes&#34;.  That car drove on.  A second car stopped and the man asked what we were looking at.  I said &#34;We&#39;re watching UFOs go by.&#34; He said &#34;Thank God! I thought people would think I was crazy!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stopped his car and  then he and his mother stood with us watching the remaining craft go by. He had first seen the lights from his home and got in the car to get closer to the lights. As I observed the lights they appeared to be made of fire.  They were circular and under the crafts.  Others described what they saw as red lights, or yellow lights or orange lights.  The crafts were flying in a straight line formation.  After the 3 sets of 3 lights went by, there were 2 more crafts with single lights and they were not following the same straight line pattern, they were off to the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these craft, in the second sighting, were emitting a thick black smoke from the edges to camouflage the lights.  It looked like cloud material, only black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were pictures taken with cell phones, with some blurred effects on one and with only 2 of the 3 lights showing on another.  It was difficult to estimate the altitude of the dark crafts, possibly 100 feet to 400 feet above us?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sightings:  The next day, June 1st, 2013, I was told of a woman who saw 30 lights in the sky around 21:30 on May 31, 2013.  I have since spoken to her and she told me that she saw them while sitting at her computer on her front porch.  She counted 30 lights, which were the same ones from our second sighting, but we caught the tail end and saw only 3 of at least 10 triangular craft traveling in a one line formation.  She was located slightly west-north-west of us at the time of her sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion:  It would appear that at least the White Light crafts were emerging from Lake Cassadaga or very nearby and the possibility exists that the dark triangular-looking crafts may have emerged from the same location, at almost the same time. This area is a well-known vortex and Lake Cassadaga is known to be quite deep with some type of connecting spring system running beneath it. Was there a meeting occurring just before our sightings ? or is this a coincidence ?  My background:  I worked for a major Canadian airline for over 32 years, staring in 1973. I never witnessed any unexplained phenomena/ sightings in my career, although I heard of many sightings/experiences from pilots over those decades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backgrounds of the other witnesses:  The driver of the car is an accountant. One of the other ladies in the car is a nurse. The other woman works in mediation, if I&#39;m not mistaken. The woman who saw 30 lights was a legal secretary for many decades.<n>

My kids and I couldn&#39;t figure out what they were.  At first I thought helicopters, the.  With the amount, I thought maybe military helicopters, but them i noticed that they were just hovering.

We live along the Appalachian in PA near the Susquehanna river.  We are about 30 minutes away from the closest airport, so we do have some air traffic.  We are completely aware of what planes look like and do not mistake them as the UFOs.  Most of the time the UFOs seem to be an orange ball of light that we seem to notice around dusk just before the sun sets. Sometimes there are 3 of them that seem to just hover but then dissipate one at a time until they just completely vanish.  They always seem to be close to the river. We also do a lot of star gazing and we can see satellites with our naked eye but a few times we would spot them and then all of a sudden the pin of light would grow into a big ball of light for just a few seconds before returning back to its original size.  It almost seemed as if it was beaming light towards us because it changed its appearance only when it was directly ab! ove us! The most bizarre sighting was a couple weeks ago.  The sun was setting and I just happened to be looking east when from a distance I saw this light slowly rise from the trees between two mountains, which seemed to be close to the river.  I stared for at least 10 minutes as it hovered there with no movement or sound before I called for my husband and his friend over to see what I was seeing!  After 5 more minutes of no movement it finally started to move towards the mountain, it rose as if it was outlining it until it reached the top.  Then we all heard &amp; saw a helicopter coming from the west. The light then dissipated and in place of the light seemed to be a white disk! We couldn&#39;t believe what we were looking at! The disk then shot off into the sky as the helicopter came closer! We can&#39;t come up with a good explanation for any of these sightings?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It was a windy weather and not very sonny because the clouds here and there. About 6 pm I was lying in the boat contemplating the sky.  Nothing special at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I realize the clouds around were elongated, stream-like and pointed in a center above my head.  It seems strange.  Then I perceived the sky above me was darker, behind the clouds and I startle.  It was like something very big and dark hided there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it must be an optical illusion because it was almost a perfect oval with its center just above my head. It was big, very big, and bigger than a large city!  I was impressed by the “phenomenon” thinking that is natural – the sky is darker above the head and lighter further on.  About a half an hour I realized it moved slowly to east!  So it was not natural and not an optical illusion I thought.  The clouds were attracted to it or been sucked by it.  I thought the thing is sucking the water from the clouds?  It must be!  I don’t know how long the phenomenon occurred but after an hour or so the dark spot was smaller and smaller like it was moving upwards.  The spot was definitely not a cloud!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really hope somebody else experiences the same, so I am not crazy.<n>

One silver, shiny object seemed to appear.  There were no clouds but it was slightly overcast or hazy.  The object did not seem to be moving much, maybe slowly toward the north.  There appeared to be a very bright spot on the object, maybe the sun’s reflection.  I looked at it for a few seconds and then looked back to the road (traffic was heavy).  I looked back up within 1 or two seconds and the object was gone.  No smoke or trail, just gone.  I continued to look for it but did not see it again.<n>

It was getting late and we were going to stop to sleep. It was night, and my British husband and I were looking off into the night horizon on the highway I64 West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When a haloed blue 3 light triangular shaped aircraft appeared out of nowhere, that didn&#39;t seem odd at first to me as I assumed it was a plane until it moved.... It moved down and and back up so fast that no human aircraft could have done that, in almost a U shape then it disappeared into thin air.  A plane flying away will gradually FADE out of your vision....not just simply vanish.  We didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t know what to think.<n>

We were both looking over to the eastern part of the sky and saw a big, bright, teal-colored sphere with a foggy aura about a quarter of the size the moon would appear in the sky but lower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just kind of manifested and traveled to our left in an arching trajectory then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was partly cloudy, but the aura of the object didn&#39;t appear to be caused by clouds directly. It seemed to have a second layer of fogginess around it, but it&#39;s hard to describe exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bigger than anything I have ever seen in the sky.<n>

It was in a descending pattern. I only saw it for approximately 5 to 7 seconds.  I had no time to get my camera on my phone pulled up before it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you imagine a star as a pinpoint in the night sky, this object was, by comparison, roughly the size of a plastic pop bottle.  I am 100%  positive it was within our atmosphere.  It is hard to estimate how high in the air it was. the ground across the road from my house lies on a small hill.  The object appeared over that raised area and to my thoughts was close to say 500&#39; possibly 1000&#39; in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and no trail behind it.  This was not an aircraft or a helicopter or any other man made device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried for the last 4 days to think of how to describe it. The only thing I can come up with is an elongated oval. It was not circular, or cigar shaped. it was not oval shaped, it was more like an elongated oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was duel colored. The entire somewhat oval shaped exterior was a luminescent, neon, glowing green. The brightest green I have ever seen in my life. The interior was a solid glowing yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:05 pm that night, one minute after seeing the object, I called the Athens, Ohio branch of the Ohio state highway patrol, and spoke to dispatcher Saunders and told him what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear this to be true on my eternal soul! I will never forget it as long as I live!  I reported this event to the hotline on Saturday evening/Sunday morning at 12:26 am EST. The gentleman I spoke to was about to go on the radio and didn&#39;t have much time to talk and asked me to submit this form.<n>

This happened twice as it reappeared, did the same movement, then disappeared again.  This was clearly no airplane, helicopter, or any other aircraft as it did not behave or move in any recognizable fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I stared at it, the background stars were blocked out as it passed in the shape of a large dark triangle with some star-like lights in a smaller area in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All planes in the sky had flashing lights on them and moved much slower.

I happened to be looking out my front window which is a south eastern exposure and saw a blinking series of lights on what appeared to be an elongated craft which seemed to be rod or cylinder shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled about the same speed as you&#39;d observe a fighter jet or shooting star passing through the atmosphere - extremely fast.  What made me consider the very high altitude of the object in the atmosphere was the fact that the lights faded out far above the horizon, as a shooting star would.  It was only visible for what seemed to be a fraction of a second, however long it takes to witness a solid shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned!  There was no sound.

I was in the Beartooth mountain range 30 miles outside of Cody, Wy, and noticed a bright white light to the west of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light first looked like a airline headlight, which was very bright given the height of the perceived object.  The light made its way to the east and lasted approximetly 10 seconds before it disappeared.  I stood outside for 5 more minutes to see if I could glimpse the craft which I thought could have possible been hidden due to the sparse clouds.  I did not see the light again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21 year old girl. Outdoor enthusiast, studying natural resource biology.<n>

Almost right after she said that, a very chaotic, unecplainable event started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 10 years in the Marine Corps., I learned how to take detailed notes and reports, so thats what I did when I got home.  First, there was realy strange lightning all around us, but no thunder, and it seemed to be far away and at a high elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the lightning got lower, brighter, and closer to our car.  It was so bright, it was lighting up the whole sky.  But it looked different, unnatural, and was completely silent.  The next thing that happened was very scary, and the craziest part of this whole sighting.  The sky was filled with strange objects of different sizes and colors.  My girlfriend was so freaked out she almost wrecked the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were multiple crafts with with three lights in a triangle shape and red lights in the center pulsating.  There were.  Small, bright white circles, that zigzaged through the sky. Some of the small white balls would zoom in, a big black cloud would appear, and the object would zoom away veey fast.  One object was really close and looked like about 5 oblong white circles right next to each other, and stoop approximately 15 feet tall.  There were HUGE dim white lights that moved slowly through the sky, and appeared to be 5 or 10 miles wide.  There was objects that looked like thunder but had only 90 degree angles and stayed lit for about 5 seconds.  There were bolts of lightning that kind of looked like jelly fish and moved slowly across the ground while they stayed lit for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, the aircraft&#39;s disappeared and there was a huge mushroom cloud that took up about a quarter of the sky, and a very loud but low and deafening rumble for about 10 minutes. And wind coming from it so strong! it almost knocked me over.  Then, everything ended and was qui! et. We t hen got back into our car and drove home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, there were the strangest clouds I&#39;ve ever seen, followed by a tornado warning, not sure if a tornado actualy happened though, but in the same area we were at in Moore the night before.  That night, we saw the same strange lightning and about 20 of the same triangle shaped objects. They were go back and forth in the sky.  I showed the neighbors, and called my family. I plan on watching the sky tonight with hopes of recording them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got multiple videos last night, but really only one good one.  I would have recorded the events in Moore two nights ago, but we were so freaked out we dident even thing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never before seen a UFO, and swear on everything I love that these statements are 100% true.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I need some answers!<n>

Its light dimmed and suddenly stopped.  After about two minutes, it glowed brightly like a beacon, (still suspended) and dimmed out again.  This was witnessed by my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it proceeded with half its glow to move towards the opposite direction of the sky (moving east towards me).  Finally, it moved back towards the northwest sky, with very minimal light, extremely fast speed and disappeared.  This is not the first time that this has occurred but this is the first time I am reporting it only because it was witnessed.<n>

I was in a room with a small light on, facing a window.  I suddenly saw something in the middle of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was a plane, because it had clear red and blue lights similar to a plane.  But it was moving only vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that it was some sort of remote-controlled alien spaceship toy, because it seemed in the stereotypical saucer shape even though the lights were only in a slightly curved horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t think either of those options is possible, because it seemed much too big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It rose slowly straight up,  I saw it for less than three seconds and jumped up to turn the light off and get a closer look, but when I looked out the window, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to see if it was still there, but there wasn&#39;t anything in sight, even though the sky was open and there weren&#39;t any trees or anything blocking part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a firm non-believer in aliens, so this was bizarre for me to see and I don’t know what it could have been.  It was much too large to be a satellite.  The only “rational” explanation I&#39;ve come up with is that it was a helicopter, though my windows were open and I heard no sound, and I haven’t seen lights like that on a helicopter before.<n>

I was standing by the window so I pulled back the blinds thinking I would see a C-130 but to my surprise all I seen was a brilliant rear illumination as if there was a side by side Solar eclipse about 350 feet off the ground.  The sound was like a turbo props low powerful hum but not quite the same.   speed was incredible. My mind started processing what I just seen.  Then I realized the flight path was all wrong!  The brilliant rear illumination and the sound did not match.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of the size but it appeared to be half the size of a C-130 but not like a V-22.

I thought at first that it was a satellite but it was too big to be one and the shape was all wrong.  The simplest way I am able to describe it is, is to think of a drawn five point star but with a round body and points in all angles around the center.  It was definitely not a plane but it was not a star!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got it on video and its on my YouTube but it said not to put any contact info.  The whole event happened a duration of around five minutes.  The objects stayed in one place for most of the time but the second one would occasionally disappear for a split second and then reappear around the same area.<n>
5/29/13 04:00|Palm Beach Gardens|FL|Other|20 minutes|Girlfriend and I witnessed some shape shifting shadow on the beach at 4 am..|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109769.html|62|ndxe201305| Girlfriend and I witnessed some shape shifting shadow on the beach at 4 am<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whom it may concern,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting this report from the encouragement of my friends who have informed me of your website.  Due to the date in proximity of it&#39;s 1 yr. anniversary I have decided to tell my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last summer my girlfriend and I frequently visited Juno Beach in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.  On a few occasions we did witness ufo&#39;s in the sky at night. According to people in the area, apparently this beach is a hot spot for that type of activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night almost one year ago, my girlfriend and I fell asleep on our blanket and awoke at almost 4am in the morning.  We gathered our stuff and decided to leave when I noticed a shadow figure by the shoreline giving off a blue blinking light. 1-2 seconds then blink...then 1-2 second and then blink.  But the movement of the shadow was very weird.  It went up and down, to the left and to the right.  Next thing we knew the shadow darted across the shoreline about 50 feet to the left.  My girlfriend decided to find out what it was.  Just an fyi: we were not under the influence of any drugs/alchohol and there was no one at the beach at this time.  It was dark and empty at 4am!  Next thing we decide to go down to the shoreline.  When we were near the moving shadow figure I decided to shine my cell phone light over it.  It was then that we both witnessed the figure shift it&#39;s shape to form arms and legs.  Completely black, no face with a blue light that would not allow us to see a face if there was one.  The figure then puts one arm out near us and we immediately ran back up and went home.  Before we left the sand, we looked back and saw the figure had left.  We couldn&#39;t see the light anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We&#39;d like to clarification if anyone within this organization knows what this thing might have been. Thanks!<n>

Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside around 10:00pm, enjoying the warm spring night. Looking to the south I thought I saw a jet flying west toward Green Bay, but much too low.  I thought it was in trouble, and sent a prayer and good energy to all aboard (all I could do, really).  It seemed to even out and gain a bit of altitude and arced toward Green Bay.... but continued coming closer and and closer still.  The odd thing was, it made no noise.  The lack of sound had apparently made me think it was a jet and much farther away than it actually was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a jet at all but a small, single-engine airplane sized, brightly lit (large blue and red lights on the sides, none on underside) extremely maneuverable COMPLETELY SILENT aircraft flying VERY LOW 50&#39; feet or so above farm fields behind my home.  I could see the plowed fields lit dimly by the lights of the craft.  Could not get proper idea of shape of craft, lights were too bright.  Perhaps the body itself was black, I really could not make it out at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No attempt at concealment.  Flew around very low in the fields behind my home, over to the woods, back around. It didn&#39;t do anything alarming...the nonchalance of the flight (did not seem furtive) made me think it was a DEA plane checking for pot fields....but totally silent awesome little planes zipping around?  I do not think we have such things. Kinda creepy though... I crept in the house after watching for 10 min or so, scared b/c I may have witnessed a... I don&#39;t even know.  I peeked outside after another 10 minutes or so, and it was still swooping around.  Unnerving.  I think I&#39;d rather have it be visitors from space than a spy plane, truth be told.  Did I summon it by sending prayers and positive energy?<n>

I just saw it a few minutes ago when I uploaded photos (including this one) from my iPhone to my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could be anything, but I&#39;m emailing you because it doesn&#39;t appear to be a bird.  Rather, it appears to be disc-shaped and possibly metallic, because it looks like it is reflecting light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have the equipment to blow-up the photograph and otherwise make a determination as to whether this is a natural or artificial object in the sky.

5/28/13 03:00|Orlando|FL|Flash|~45 minutes|Large flashing light in the sky,directly over head that lasted at least 45 minutes.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98202.html|75|ndxe201305| Large flashing light in the sky,directly over head that lasted at least 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 0300 hrs on the morning of May 28, 2013, while at work, I received a phone call from a co-worker (we both work at a local theme park) urging me and my other co-worker to meet them at their location as he was witnessing a flashing light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We packed up our tools and hurried over to their location.when we arrived there,both the co-worker who had called me and his co-worker were both staring straight up at the sky.  I then, along with my co-worker, looked up in the same area of the sky and witnessed a flashing light that appeared to be clouded in mist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds in the sky and we could see the moon and the stars.  The object appeared to be about the size of the moon at times, had an amber color to the flash and at times appeared to have a blue color as well.  The flash continued for approximately 45 mins getting progressively faint until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must note that there are large search lights stationed at the entrance to the theme park which remain on all night.At 1st we thought that perhaps the lights were illuminating something in the sky as they scanned that region (where the lights seemed to converge) but then we noticed that the flashing did not really follow the same timing as the search lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times the object appeared to be football shaped. It also appeared to me as if it were a beacon flashing in mist. Being that this object was directly above us,we ruled out any radio antennas. There was no other clearly definable shapes over head such as a blimp or helicopter.The object did not make any sound.We also pointed a laser pen at it&#39;s location.When we did this it appeared to move as the flash would emanate from a different location thatn before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total there were 4 witnesses to this event. I did call a friend of mine who was in another location of the theme park and asked her to go outside and see if she could see it.She said that she only saw the flash once.<n>

A couple months ago I tried interacting and inviting a E.T to my location with Steven Greer&#39;s exercise. I didn&#39;t have the laser so all I could do was remote view and show them where I was. Nothing happened that night, so I forgot about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since Tuesday night (05/28/2013) what ever it is has been in my family&#39;s rainforest waking my mother up in the middle of the night to see a large light moving back and forth for three nights straight so far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also last night two heavy lamps suddenly fell in my parents room that was close to the window that shows the rainforest, my mum heard it fall but all my dad could hear was a very light bell ringing sound that he thought sounded very calming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing too, on the first day this unidentified thing started showing itself my dog&#39;s eye was damaged quite badly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with it, but I thought I should add it in since it&#39;s very coincidental to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I&#39;m reporting this is in the case of anything more happening in the next few days.<n>

I looked up at the sky to view the stars, while looking I could see the stars slightly clearer since several blocks were out of electricity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking in a southeasterly direction and one star began to move I told my wife to look and she saw it as well, the star (UFO) starting moving north and got smaller and smaller (climbing in altitude I suspect) until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo was twinkling just like any other star in the sky but it started moving after watching it for a few seconds just sitting still.  The encounter took no longer then maybe 5-10 seconds at the most.  Lately I have been seeing things like this lot (this is my 4-5 sighting this year).<n>

There was a bright orange light that at first I thought was a landing light of a small aircraft.  This bright orange light (brighter than surrounding stars) was heading east.  I was looking up from my location about 80 degrees vertical from horizon.  This light sped up rapidly then slowed down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time this light was flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was partly cloudy out and I realized that the abjoect was above clouds.  There was a little light left from sunset.  I thought it was a glare from an aircraft off the sunlight.  This object had to be well over 60000 feet up.  I never saw a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light started to flicker like a candle was burning out.  The object slowed down once again and it started to make a turn to the south.  When it did this, it fkickered more and more and eventually it went completwly out into a clear sky. I observed closely afterwards and never saw any more flashing lights like that I would see of an aircraft.  It left me, my wife, my friend and my kids completely puzzled.<n>

My husband and I were sitting on our back porch which faces south.  Behind the city line we can see a mountain range, and at about 9:00 Pm two orange orbs apperaed to be moving in our direction (North) above the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two orange lights seemed to be coming closer, they seemed to hover for about 2 minutes, then simultaneously they turned (East) and slowly they both disappeared from our sight.  We walked in that direction to see if we could spot them again but we did not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:10 Pm that same evening, approximately 5 minutes after the orange lights disappeared, we saw a white light come from the same direction the two orbs came from (South).  The white light then followed the same path as the orange lights (East) then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We seemed especially intrested in these sightings because we witnessed the same two orange lights two years ago on July 4th, 2011.  The lights came from the exact same place as the ones on May 27th (South) but on July 4th the lights quickly reversed into the same direction from which they came from (South) and quickly shot out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with husband and wife, and we found them both to be sober-minded individuals.

I noticed that in the first minute of the video I had also captured something strange that I had not noticed during filming, probably because I was looking threw a small digital display while filming.  However, the video clearly shows a dark, round object that appears to come down from a higher elevation, behind the man made aircraft which was heading North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO then appears to catch up to the airplane and it appears to be flying parallel to the airplane before it vanishes behind a cloud.

I had been taking a few pics with my phone to show my kids the view from the plane so It was handy.  The object seamed to stay in line and in time with the plane only much further below us..  Then it started to move away from the plane.  That is when I snapped a picture just before it stopped moving forward and it appeared to stop as we continued on.  It was out of site in a matter of a second or two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a picture of what I saw... then I enlarged the object a little too.<n>

It started slowly moving around town then it stopped. We followed it and the light just vanished.  It was like it knew we where following it.  When it stopped the ufos turned the lights off and you could still see the shape of the UFO. We tried to follow it but it was gone.  So we drove back in town and that&#39;s when we seen two more and this time they where circling each other.  We where going to park but when we was driving both of the ufos vanished like the other one.<n>

I could not tell how far away it was but it was extremely bright and sparked my interest.  I pulled over within a matter of seconds into a parking lot and we got out to take a look at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen a Facebook post earlier in the day mentioning that there would be a few different planets visible tonight so I had figured that it might be a planet.  However, once we were out of the car we realized that the object was beginning to move silently but quickly towards the North.  Within a minute or so the object was so far away that it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed almost as if the object had noticed the unusual behavior we were exhibiting, abruptly pulling over into an abandoned parking lot and quickly exiting the vehicle.  I got this feeling because how low and slow it was flying  right as we exited the vehicle.  It seemed to be slowly gliding at first and then its speed steadily sped up without any sound.  The object quickly got progressively dimmer and farther away until it vanished, almost as if we had spooked it.<n>

At a 45 degree angle and 1.5 miles due west was an red orange orb.  It moved north slowly, stop and move again.  Sometimes it  would just hang there and the light would go out and come back on.  It moved slowly.  No sound heard. After 15 mins. the lights went out and it was gone.  The height was just below the wisp cloud deck.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter, no lights, just red orange orb.  Not a plane, no lights and would have fallen out of  the sky because it moved slow.  This caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday May 26, 2013, I went outside at 10:50pm.  Due north from me about 3 to 3.5 miles out was the same red orange orb in the sky.  It was heading due north slowly, farther away for about 2 mins.  I said to myself, darn I wish it would change direction, do a 180 degree and head towards me.  About 1 min. later it stopped, hung in the sky and started due south from a north position. It did not turn around.  It stopped and started slowly directly towards me, south.  It was about 4 miles out moving 10-15mph at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly sharpened all my senses because I wanted every detail of what this was.  About 1 mile from me the orb changed to white. I don&#39;t know if the color changed or it appeared to change because the angle of view changed, but it was a white orb now, heading directly over me, just below the light cloud deck.  At half mile from me the orb went from white to a very dim dull Grey orb about 10mph. just below the cloud deck.  I had to bend me neck to look straight up at it.  There isn&#39;t a light bulb on it, the air around it glows or is ionized. No light bulbs just glowing air, surrounding a circular craft inside this orb of light.  From  the center of this craft to the arc of the circle is perhaps a door. It is not lit up.  It was dark, the rest was lit.  It was 200 to 250 feet directly above me, at 10mph. There was a layer of air  unlit between the craft and the lit air around it.  I was able to see this clearly because the cloud it  was under was very white which made details stand out.  There was no smell in the air and it was silent, moving due south. No sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly  over the ridge of  oak trees and I lost sight of it.  It stayed a dull Grey as it moved away and never increased speed and never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were seeing what they were seeing, but my brain was having trouble filing info like this because it was something it never was dealt before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a distance I viewed it 5 more times over the next 2 weeks.  Never close up.  Sometimes it was red orange sometimes white.  It often moved behind a cloud when I view it. Then I didn&#39;t see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A guy on YouTube videos it  off in the distance. He stopped his motorcycle to use his phone to capture it.  Same thing I saw, but on May 26, 2013, I got an up close and personal view, right over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I saw this I quickly realized what I was viewing was either alien or government.<n>

These lights were in somewhat of an arrowhead pattern and as they moved in an east to west path, they slowly, one by one, started to disappear or dissipate from the pattern until all of the lights were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, I exited my vehicle and attempted to capture a photo of this unexplained pattern in the sky.

They had built a fire and the husband was cleaning fish that they had just caught.  My daughter happened to look up at the stars and saw 7 objects.  They kept changing formation.  She called me and asked me if I thought that they were US aircraft practicing for a Memorial Day show and after I looked at the picture she sent me, I told her I was very doubtful about that being what they were.  I decided to submit this for her with a picture.<n>

The object moved across the sky at a steady pace and in a direct path toward the opposite horizon.  When it was directly overhead, another appeared rising from the same spot just to the left of the moon.  This continued until we had seen 15 objects between 22:50 to 23:25 pm Central time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we saw the sixth one, I began snapping photos and taking videos with both my iphone and my pocket Leica.  To the naked eye, from afar, the objects appeared as a tiny white light, but as they got closer they appeared as a shimmering orange light and I thought I could see a definite circumference of either a circle or a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In one of the videos, I can hear myself say, “it looks like a triangle with rounded corners inside of a circle”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects never moved “in formation”, changed direction or speed.  They just moved steadi! ly across the sky one after the other in exactly the same path as the one before and all were completely silent.<n>

After a few seconds a smaller, flashing, red light dropped down from underneath and quickly faded/disappeared.  After about 2 minutes the main object/light slowly drifted directly away from my viewpoint, got smaller and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound so not a helicopter, and it definitely wasn&#39;t a Chinese lantern as the main light didn&#39;t flicker and I&#39;m very used to seeing lanterns in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was unable to record or take a photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably unrelated as it&#39;s a holiday weekend here (and no doubt busy for the police etc), but just after the main object/light disappeared a helicopter started circling some 150-300 yards away.<n>

But it was too bright, too low and too slow.  Since there is a hospital nearby we assumed it was perhaps a helicopter.  Then a second one appeared coming from the same direction.  They both hovererd for a short time a few miles away it would appear.  The first one that arrived seem to drift down and go out of sight.  The second one hung in the sky for quite some time and eventually climbed up into the sky and then the light vanished.  Hard to determine the shape but they were both bright orange in color, I would have to say it was cylindrical.  Took video and a still.<n>

The object and kite were 1500ft away and the lighted object resembled a Beach ball as it had vertical light and dark pannels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an Orange light emanating from INSIDE the sphere. Sphere was not all illuminated just the orange light from inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took eyes off object for  5 seconds to retrieve my camera from my pocket.   Looked up and only the kite was visible.  Went behind the house to search entire NW sky and did not regain object.  Object was moving about 5 mph as it passed behind the kite.<n>

While traveling south along a residential road, we all noticed ahead of us in the sky, five to seven orbs or spheres of light that appeared to be red or orange in color.  They appeared to be stationary in the sky at about a 45 degree angle from our position.  We all commented at how weird they looked.  At first we thought maybe some sort of lantern, but they did not move in the sky, nor did they flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We dropped off the friend, and began traveling down the road in a westerly direction.  As I was driving, I couldn’t maintain eye contact so I would watch the road and occasionally glance up at the lights.  At one point, about 1 minute after dropping off the friend, I looked at the lights, then glanced back at the road for approximately three seconds, then looked back at the lights, and found that they all had vanished.  My daughter didn’t see them vanish either.<n>

It was about 10:30 pm.  This is not first time we have seen a UFO over there.  But this was like nothing I’ve ever seen, it looked like a spot of fire in the sky.  It came out from behind some trees in  the sky and went across the sky slowly.  It stopped or slowed way down and just went out of sight as if it was rising further and further out of our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a half hour later the same light in the sky was spotted again and moved slowly in somewhat the same direction and also disappeared in the same way as the first time.  It was a very bright orange color and it was as if  a piece of fire was traveling across the sky.  It was moving northwest both times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the last year we have spotted several UFO’s in the western sky over Lake Wedowee.  The other ones didn’t look anything like the one we saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not alone!<n>

As I watched it I noticed it was headed in a downward motion at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Knowing there is a airport at the navy base it is not unusual to see planes and helicopters in the area.  The more I watched it the more it seemed to look like a fire ball than a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 to 45 seconds all at once it seemed as though a fire just went out then all at one time it flickered becoming as bright as when I first noticed it.  That is when I was sure it was not a plane unless it was crashing so I got everyone outside to look, we watched for about another 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large hotels and trees blocking our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us could really agree on what it was I say it was a meteorite others say it was a plane crashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two things we all could agree on is that it was not a plane or helicopter unless it was crashing the other was there is no airport in the direction it went down only water.<n>

Appeared to be moving very slowly and following a straight path.  It gradually got dimmer until gone.  It did not appear to disappear because of distance, but rather just gradually “go out”.  Then another appeared about 30 seconds later and followed same path and did same gradual disappearance.  When this second one was overhead, another one appeared over the trees behind house.  They were close together.  This “trail” of lights following same path, moving slowly, no noise, and gradually disappearing involved about 10 lights over about 15 minutes.  This is Memorial Day weekend and maybe these were some type of flares floating as a result of some fireworks.  But, we live in more of a country setting and as the lights appeared coming over the trees there were no indication of firework “sounds”.  This was close to Hartwell Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I can usually see aircraft towards the top of the window flying around but it’s just planes and such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was staring out the window a pencil shaped object that had lights on it went flying by.  It was close to the ground and traveling very fast.  It made no noise and was going in a straight line from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not do drugs or drink which is why I am very confused about what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did further research about UFO’s in Old Lyme and found out a similar story that described the same craft I saw which took place five years earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks you for reading<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to determine height because if this was indeed high in the atmosphere, it was insanely large like a hundred times the size of a passenger jet or more.

The “light” went across the road from right to left.  It was only about, what we can estimate, maybe 500 feet in front of us.  It was also quite big but yet small at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving the speed limit, 55, at the time that we saw it.  I actually sped up so we could get to a clearing in the trees, see where it had gone but whatever it was, it was completely gone!  There was no sound.  There was no visible trail to indicate a meteor.  Clearly, if it had been a plane, which we knew instantly it wasn’t because it was way too fast, we would see it when we hit the clearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has completely baffled us and knew we had to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting us share.  Hopefully someone else saw the same thing and will report it just like we have.  Please let us know.<n>

I stared at this formation for awhile sitting in my room wondering if they were air crafts.  After 15 minutes of waiting they were still present and I told my mom to look out the window and she didn&#39;t think anything of it so I told my father to look and he thought they were plans in the sky.  So I argued with them for about 10 minutes and went outside on my porch to get a clear view and it was still there after 30 minutes.  I started noticing the objects change colors to red green and orange it was basically a sequence of colors.  My parents finally noticed the same thing that I was watching but was still skeptical.  But I know what I saw and they were definitely not regular airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve witnessed meteors falling but these lights continued in a flight pattern over the earth.  The lights were simply bright white orbs, not flashing.

The object appeared small at first but then got slightly larger (seemingly lowering its altitude).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object as it moved past the freeway heading Northward off I-75.  I followed it off the freeway and the object appeared to have a faint white light behind it.

It had been dark only for a little while but the lights were easily distinguishable and I knew that what I was seeing was out of the ordinary.  At first there were only four of them each following the same path as the one in front of it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately opened my front door and yelled for my mother to come out to see what was going on knowing that this was something never seen before.  I asked her to grab her phone so I could record what I was seeing.  My parents have lived in this home for something like 40 years and I grew up there.  They’re home is near the McCoy International Airport so there are planes coming and going in the eastern sky (literally) at all times.  I know what a plane looks and sounds like and these orange lights were moving much faster than ! any plane I have ever seen.  The orange light did not appear to be a beacon on the aircraft but it seemed to be the aircraft.  At one point one of the orange lights moved toward a plane traveling west from McCoy and came right up next to it, to what looked like a stone’s throw from it.  I don’t believe that any passenger plane would allow another plane to come that close or even a military plane over a civilian population.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was recording the strange lights they started to change direction from the north to south path to a direction due west and then one of them just disappeared, shortly after this another disappeared and then another until there was only one left.  The last orange light just kept heading west until I could not see it any longer and just as I stopped the recording another orange light appeared from the same spot as the other four.  It followed the same path as the previous four heading south until almost over top of me and then turning west until I could not see it any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a UFO enthusiast, I don’t watch the skies for anomalies, and I have never seen anything like this before.  I was totally surprised at what I was seeing but I can tell you this, I knew right away that what I was seeing was something that had never occurred here before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My words and even the video I took do not do justice for what I saw, it was quite amazing.<n>
5/26/13 20:45|Jacksonville|NC|Light|4-5 minutes|Three very bright orange lights above the tree lines traveling in the same pattern and direction.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98250.html|134|ndxe201305| Three very bright orange lights above the tree lines traveling in the same pattern and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night, my fiancee and I were sitting out on the front porch chatting.  Suddenly a very bright orange light caught my attention above the tree line on the opposite side of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were astonished as we got up from the porch walking to the back of the house to keep the light in sight as it travelled over the house.  It appeared to descend and turn dark as it dissapeared behind the woods.  Just as we could no longer view it we turned and immediatly noticed two more identical lights travelling in the same pattern and direction as the first one.  The first of these lights seemed to have a haze over the top, and all were equally bright.  Immediately, we jumped into the car and attempted to follow these lights, however they dissapeared rather quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that perhaps they were associated with the military base, however I quickly realized that the only aircraft associated with the base are helicopters, and these lights certainly were not helicopters. I have seen the military aircraft every day of my life for the past thirty years, however have never wittnessed anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the lights came from the west, were extremely bright, and made no sound.  As the lights appeared to be descending behind the woods they appeared to fade or darken and the shape seemed to be something of an elongated sphere.  I am not good with size or distance, however I would describe them as being the size of a smoke detector held at approximately two arms lengths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home, I called my Dad who happens to be a pilot and asked if he knew of any aircraft that had bright orange lights, he did not.  I also called my son as he is in the Air Force and asked him the same question.  His response was also the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still puzzled over what I have seen. Wish I had an answer.<n>

This lights weren&#39;t necessarily flashing,  but they seems to be different colors combined, and at certain times one color was more distinct than the others.  They moved slowly, if at all.  They moved very little, but would move in all directions.  The same light would be slowly drifting east, then it would move west, then north or south.  It seemed like everyone on the road was slowing down and looking, as you couldn&#39;t miss them unless you weren&#39;t paying any attention.  I even posted something on Facebook when it happened.  I heard this mentioned today on &#34;Coast to Coast AM,&#34; which compelled me to write this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You should feel free to contact me via email if you feel it to be necessary.<n>

Never saw anything like it and have lived all over the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange, with no sound whatsoever. No vapor trail or smoke trail.<n>

At the Creedmoor Rd. exit the lights were directly above us; still heading towards the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rolled down the windows to hear the helicopter blades and engines;  but there was no sound as the lights passed overhead.  We traveled south on Creedmoor and at the Strickland Rd interchange the lights reappeared over the car; meaning the lights did not proceed towards the airport but headed back in the direction they originally came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic signal changed to ! green so we proceeded down Strickland but never saw the lights again.<n>

I didnt tell anyone what I saw until I got higher up to where I could see farther out.  Once I approached a spot where I could clearly see the triangle, it had already moved a huge distance in about 5 minutesand was notre behind the mountain.  I pointed out what I had seen and they all saw it but were not convinced it was a ufo.  I sat there and tried to explain that triangles dont just float in the sky.  No matter what evidence I showed them no body would believe me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for 15 minutes, I said I would drive down and come up again soon and I guarantee it will be gone.

It would go from an almost yellowish color to orange and dark red. It had no blinking lights.  It seemed very high in the sky and moved at a steady rate and line of travel before fading out.  Another followed minutes later in the exact pattern and direction as the previous one followed by a third a few minutes after the second faded out.  They all reached the same point in the sky as they just got dim and disappeared.  Many people in the drive in saw and watched these objects traverse the sky and no one seemed to have any idea what they were.  We don&#39;t know if they made any sound as the sound of the movie playing was quite loud.<n>

Being a holiday weekend I decided to make the long drive with my other brother and nephew to participate in the festivities.  Shortly after dark (sometime around 10pm) my nephew pointed over my shoulder to the north and said, “What is that?!?”<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly spotted a large orange fireball in the sky slowly and silently traveling south west.  I yelled out to everyone to look (There were 12 people in the yard).  People immediately started downplaying the light as a “Chinese Lantern”, even after it disappeared in a blink before their eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 20 minutes later a second bright orange fireball appeared almost directly in the same spot.  This time it was travelling fast…a little slower than a jet, but faster than a small plane…and it disappeared in the same manner as before…like it instantly dematerialized.  Again I called everyone’s attention to it and they all saw it, but again they down played it as a Chinese lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year I had multiple sightings of these same lights and reported three out of the six sightings on this registry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever these are they are not Chinese lanterns as everyone keeps calling them.<n>

The object looked massive and was similar color as a flare from a flare gun but much, much larger and much, much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be moving slowly across the sky to the horizon behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was similar in color and likeness to a red flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to get smaller as it reached the horizon.  This made me think that the object was much farther away than it appeared to be.  I steadily watch the ISS on a regular basis and this object was moving maybe a little faster across the sky but, much, much larger and brighter than the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I saw it and I realized I was seeing something unusual, I got my video sport camera from my truck and just caught a few final seconds of the object on video.<n>

When we saw two orange lights flying at the same speed and in the same direction, we pulled over to record it using an iPad camera.  We got out of the car and recorded it for 2 minutes and 25 seconds before I turned around to find 3 more behind us.  The second group of objects was closer to us than the first two.  They emitted no sound, and all flew at the same speed in some type of formation.  They moved far enough away that they finally vanished out of our sight.  They were originally moving NW at an unknown speed (it depends on how big they actually were), then finally seemed to move out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a large fireball in the sky and told my brother took look as well.  We both thought maybe it was a plane but thought it strange since the fireball was very bright and not typical of commercial planes in the area.  Living close to a major airport we see planes on a regular basis and can identify commercial planes by there flashing lights.  Once we realized that it could not be a plane with a bright red orange color light we started walking toward the yard to get a better look at it.  At the same time as I reached for my phone to record the event the bright red orange glowing fireball emitted a smaller fireball that went straight down.  A second or less after the first smaller fireball a second fireball was emitted.  Shortly after the release of the second smaller fireball the larger fireball disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so amazed by the strange lights that we quickly checked my phone to see if I captured any of it since it only lasted a few seconds.  I did get it on video but only the last couple seconds.  You have to see it on a larger screen to see the smaller fireball but the main fireball is very visible.  Wish I would have gotten both smaller fireballs coming out of the larger one.  Amazing!!<n>

At first, my first impression was that it was a miler balloon.  I got a better look, and realized it was way too big and too far away for it to be a balloon. i grabbed my phone to get a picture, and it left towards the west very fast.  I pulled into our driveway, and tried to spot it again, but it was gone. It was a clear, cloudless bright day.  The sphere shaped object did not appear to have any lights on it. None that I could make out.  No propellers were seen, or smoke.  Just, a sphere shaped object that was still for a short time.  When it took off, there was no smoke trail seen. It disappeared very quicky.<n>
5/25/13 11:30|Borrego Springs|CA|Rectangle|8-10  minutes|Small object "floats" against the wind.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98277.html|168|ndxe201305| Small object &amp;quot;floats&amp;quot; against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near Clark Dry Lake, 10 miles east of Borrego Springs, Ca, on Rockhouse Road directly next to an official State Parks Benchmark indicating the Anza-Borrego Park boundary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 11;30 am, Saturday, May 26, 2013  I looked up from my campsite and saw a gleaming metallic object, flashing in the sun, falling, leaf-like from the sky to the north-west of my location approx 120 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was already at about 50 ft elevation and descending erratically.  It soon touched the ground directly next to the Boundary Bench Mark along side this dirt road.  I assumed that the object was a mylar balloon or piece of airborne aluminum foil judging from the way it reflected the sun brilliantly and its relative small size as well as its apparent flight path and demeanor which both suggested that it was being carried by the prevailing wind (from the north-west to south-east.).  Still I felt obligated to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked down an intersecting access trail never losing site of the now grounded, highly reflective object. It was blindingly bright and continued to flash as it apparently swayed in what bare little breeze there was at ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came closer, (approx 50 yds) the object, appearing intentionally, moved away from me as if in an attempt to hide.  It did this by &amp;quot;hopping&amp;quot; sideways.  I still believed it to be merely the wind.  As I came even closer the object quickly &amp;quot;hopped&amp;quot; behind a five-six foot high mound of dirt outside of my view.  I continued my approach. A few moment later, ( now about 40 yds away) the object raised directly up from behind the mound exposing about 80 percent of itself and then dropped back down (As if looking at me and then hiding again!).  I had now closed the gap to about 30 yds from the object and was attempting to flank it from the right when it began rising and also drifting to the west, AGAINST the prevailing wind! It rose and traveled at approx 15 miles per hour and achieved and altitude of (A rough estimate) approx 500-800 feet before leaving my field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear blue and there were no obstructions between me and it.  It also moved, ag! ainst the wind, surely strong at that altitude ( as they usually are here) about one half mile to one mile west-northwest of the landing site and now my location.  There were no marks on the ground. It was very warm, over 90 f and I am certain that heat could vector lightweight items up from the desert floor in that heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point when it was &amp;quot;hopping&amp;quot; away from me I got an excellent view of the item. Instead of being a high polished aluminum as I had thought, it was opaque, I could see right through it.  However when it turned just so it reflected the sun as if polished metal.  Also surprisingly it was completely smooth and flat as if freshly &amp;quot;ironed&amp;quot;. It appeared as if it were a plane of glass or plastic.It was a rectangle of about 3x2 feet.  It at one moment turned completely perpendicular to me and appeared then as only a black line perhaps 1/2 inch thick or less.  It had three &amp;quot;wires&amp;quot; or antenna all of even length ( maybe 2 1/2 feet) hanging from each of three corners of this rectangle.  One corner had no appendage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain of the prevailing wind, not only from lengthy experience here but there was a brush fire currently in progress near Julian, Ca, about 20 miles west-southwest of my location and in the mountains at about 4000 feet.  The smoke from that fire was travelling due east and dropping down to the desert floor nearby.  This specific location, Clark Dry Lake, typically has a wind from the west-northwest as it is a adjacent to a canyon and  is the lowest pass from the Riverside and Los Angeles areas.  The wind from the coast funnels through there to the desert floor.<n>

My first impression was that it had been launched, like a flare, because its initial trajectory was like a flare; and its brightness was also like a flare (though it was multi-colored, red/orange/yellow, unlike any flare I&#39;ve ever known of, and it lacked the sparkling/flaming aspect of a flare).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six or eight seconds later, a second object, identical in size/shape/color-scheme, appeared on the exact same trajectory.  Unlike a flare, these objects did not diminish in brightness and arc downward into the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued in their initial trajectory, in a perfectly straight line, from northeast to south, across the ocean, at a velocity of no more than 40-45 mph.  I estimate they were a half-mile from me, traveling perfectly across my totally unobstructed field of view, their altitude slowly but steadily increasing to maybe 1000 feet above the surface of the ocean.  If my distance-estimates were even vaguely correct, their mass was vehicle-sized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued in perfect silence, in a perfectly straight line, south over the ocean, and then over the coast off Kiowa Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about six minutes, the lead object faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing object continued in the lead&#39;s trajectory; and did not fade from view until after an additional two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing in my life-experience which can even come close to explaining what I saw, and I cannot conceive of any natural or man-made object that could even come close to either the appearance or behavior of these two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want an explanation.<n>

I saw one extremely bright white light shining in the sky headed northwest.  At first I thought it was a private airplane headed towards Joliet airport, but noticed it wasn’t changing latitude.  As I was watching to see if this was a plane, I noticed two more bright white lights come on which made this craft look like an obtuse triangle.  During the event, the craft did not seem to change direction and all three lights looked connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the three lights were shining brightly, I woke my husband up and asked him to look outside.  As he got up to look, only two of the lights remained shining.  These two lights were the closer of the three and they stayed on for about ten more seconds.  As my husband and I were watching the two white lights shining brightly in the sky, one went out and the other stayed on for about five more seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was only one. At first it was going straight, then it changed it&#39;s course and went in a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like looking at a small ball of fire, the light wasn&#39;t blinking or anything, just a solid orange color flying across the sky very slowly.  It made no sound whatsoever, it was silent.  It wasn&#39;t moving fast at all either, it maybe lasted at least 5 minutes before it suddenly disappeared, as if it blinked out of existence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was very cloudy and windy, the clouds were very high up, but we saw this thing as clearly as if the sky was clear.  It was like looking at a light bulb, but a very dark orange color that seemed to glow like a street lamp - that kind of color.<n>

One orange light, like a flame glowing.  No noise. We are up on the Riviera.  It was up above the city, in from the ocean, but with the ocean and full moon in the background on a clear night.  It was in a direct line up from our bedroom french door looking out to the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was lower than the moon--in a straight line from our window to start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Opened the door and walked to deck to watch it. It was still about a minute, don&#39;t know how long it had been there.  It then rose very slowly, one orange light.  It was not a perfect oval, but it was round.  It was slightly oblong, longer horizontal than vertical.  No smoke.  It traveled slowly in an upward direction and slightly to the right, a bright dark orange glow like a fire flame.  The glow maintained it&#39;s color as it rose slowly up in a line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it was moving higher up and finally becoming distant and getting smaller.  Near the end of the sighting from the distance it looked possible to then ! be composed of three lights together but couldn&#39;t tell because of the distance.  It finally disappeared.  All at the same slow deliberate pace.  Our neighbors saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She was about 4 miles north of us at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I went out and watched the sky about 1 minute later we saw an orange ball of light, it looked fairly large from where we stood coming toward us from the east, heading west.  It was completely silent and I did notice a tiny white light in the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object slowly started heading south and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband the  ever the sceptic even mentioned how odd the thing was.

We turned right onto Centenary Rd.  We had just gotten up to speed and I was looking out the right side window.  My wife asked me,  &#34;What is that? A blimp?&#34;  I asked her where and she pointed in front of the truck and up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked and it was a blimp shaped craft but I could see it wasn&#39;t moving and I told her that it wasn&#39;t a blimp because it looked metallic and the setting sun was reflecting off of it.  Because of the sun, all I could see was that it was kind of blimp shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time we had started down a hill and were going under the trees but would be turning in about 1/2 mile.  It took us about 20 seconds or so to make it out from under the trees where we would be turning left onto Chapel Hill Rd.  When we got to where we turned, we were out from under any trees and we could see for several miles in all directions.  I could not see the object any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife insisted that it was a blimp and I assured her that a blimp wouldn&#39;t be gone that quickly.   joked that it must have been a UFO and I told that well by definition that was exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked the whole way to my house, about 7 or so miles, and never saw anything again.<n>

It looked like an upside down horseshoe shape at the top, the bottom came together like a button hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be luminous, it just hung there in the sky, at first it was completely stationary for at least 7 minutes, then all at once it was further away and slightly dimmer, although in the same position in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I hesitated to tell my daughter, I was worried that she might be frightened.  But, when I pointed it out she smiled and she became very happy and excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited for years to see a UFO and now that I have, I hope that what I witnessed was a real spaceship and not some government spy craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

The speaker asked for listens to please report any type of recent sighting, with that said here is our report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last month in May, 2013 towards the end of the month, my fiancé was sitting outside on our porch star gazing. We live remotely on a small island and are privileged to have extremely dark skies.  He had noticed an object fairly brightly lit in the sky to the north of our porch.  He watched it for several minutes thinking it was probably a plane, although he thought there was something odd about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He called me out to take a look, and I was really amazed.  Right away I was certain that it was not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was not entirely full, but was ascending at approximately 50 degree’s from the horizon to the southeast side of our porch.  The object was so bright I thought to myself that the sky looked almost as if there were two moons.  It hung in the sky at approximately the same degree as the moon, just in the wrong location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared that the object almost had a headlight on it that was striking some passing wispy clouds, but the object itself was not moving in the sky.  It hung stationary for a very lengthy period of time perhaps 10 to 15 minutes total.  We really got the feeling as if the object was heading right at us, or looking at us, as it was increasing in brightness towards the end, but it remained still in its position.  To our further amazement the object made an instantaneous hard 90 degree right turn and vanished before our eyes.  I recall the object having a fluorescent green glow to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I could tell it was the jet by the sound it made. the jet came back 2 times passed right by the balls of light but the light did not move.

LOOKING TO THE SOUTHWEST AND THERE WAS TWO BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY.  FIRST ONE THEN TWO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEY ONLY LASTED FOR SECONDS CAUSE I TRIED TO PULL OVER AND GET A BETTER LOOK.  AS SOON AS I DID THEY WENT OUT.<n>

I don&#39;t recall why I looked up into the sky but I looked up and there were two amber colored lights floating across the sky.   A small airport is 2-3 miles away so I am accustomed to seeing objects in the sky but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an airplane buff since I was a kid and, even as an adult, I still look up to the sky when aircraft pass over.  I know that airplanes have red and green blinking lights and that&#39;s what caught my attention, the fact that they were steady lights and amber-colored.  They looked to be fairly low-flying, perhaps no more than 500 ft above me and flying over the spot 200 yards away from where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw these two lights coming in my direction, at first I thought, &#34;That is something big, because I was thinking it was the lights on the front of a plane&#39;s landing gear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then I could determine space between the two lights, with sky in the background, and I realized it was two separate entities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for sound but heard absolutely nothing.  No propeller, no jet engine, zero sound.  Even with the light of a full moon, I could not determine the shape of any sort of craft.  They just looked like two bright lights floating across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were traveling at a steady velocity and did not deviate from each other. They were traveling towards the southwest, directly at the airport.  Also in the southwest direction, a few miles beyond the airport, is a large U.S. Army base.  Thus, at the time, I thought I was seeing some sort of experimental military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the lights for as long as I could see them. They seemed to slow down as they approached the approximate vicinity of the airport but that may have simply been an illusion as they got farther away from me. Eventually, they were hidden by the trees and I could no longer see them so I don&#39;t know what direction/action they took once they reached the airport.<n>

5/23/13 17:06|Los Angeles|CA|Unknown|few seconds|Strange directional "swoosh" sound in the sky near LAX draws attention of 3 witnesses to look up at an empty sky.|1/10/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105660.html|198|ndxe201305| Strange directional &amp;quot;swoosh&amp;quot; sound in the sky near LAX draws attention of 3 witnesses to look up at an empty sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning a rental car at the Hertz rental car return facility near LAX, as I have done many times before at this same location (probably more than 50 times).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This day there were 2 ladies processing my return, which is unusual since normally it&#39;s a one-on-one transaction.  The three of us were standing next to the car and going through the routine process which includes questions like &#34;did you replace the fuel&#34; and so on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always hear planes flying above that location, as the place is located at the foot of the runway.  This time, though, I heard a very strange sound that was somewhat similar to a jet but sounded &#34;broken&#34;, as if it was digitally altered to sound like special FX for a movie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a loud &#34;swoosh&#34; sound that appeared to go by in the sky above us.  The sound moved in the same direction as the planes normally do as they land, that is, westbound towards the ocean.  Instinctively, and immediately, I looked up and scanned the sky from my right to my left, following the sound, only to see a clear blue sky with absolutely nothing in my entire field of view, as far as I could see in all directions, except for the late afternoon Sun.  I have seen many planes fly above my head at that location before, and sometimes I look up and sometimes not.  This time, the unusual sound drove me to immediately look up because I was curious to see what kind of aircraft made that strange sound.  But with the sky being empty, in the end the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that one of the ladies processing my car return, who was standing in front of me and facing my direction, did the exact same head motion that I did, except she was going from her left to her right, so that we were both scanning the same section of the sky at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the other lady said, &#34;That didn&#39;t sound like a plane, it sounded like water!&#34;.  I understood what she meant - that it sounded sort of like a wave at the beach, or a cross between that and a jet plane flying by if you can imagine what that would sound like.  It was her interpretation of the sound, just as I gave my interpretation above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this is not a report of a &#34;sighting&#34; per se, but I believe I heard a UFO instead of seeing one.  Right after the fact, I remember thinking to myself that the simultaneous head motion of the lady standing in front of me made me feel validated, and that there was no reason to question myself about whether I really heard a sound that appeared to come from an invisible source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I am an IT Consultant and I travel for work.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I&#39;m not adverse to being contacted about this event,  I believe I have provided all the information available.  I am making this report in case there are other people out there who had a similar experience, so that perhaps collectively the reports can have statistical significance or provide some clue about the phenomenon.<n>

I was at Manchester Apartments in Euless, Texas, about 8 miles from the Dallas Fort Worth Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first i seen one red blinking light and one blue blinking light standing still from the sky.  It looked like it was near or above the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a call from a friend over at the other side of Euless saying he was looking at it to.  Me and four other friends were standing outside looking at the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went to a field next to the apartments to get a better look, then i seen other neighbors coming outside and looking at this to.  The two lights then started moving like a pattern of some sort after 15 minutes being out there. It moved up and down and left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 30 minutes of me first watching these two lights it turned into a big bar of lights, almost like a neon grill on a cigar shaped object.  It lit up the sky.  Those lights were on but it was statio! nary for another 12 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that the bars of lights shut off, not instant but dimmed off like if you would turn a spot light off. The red and blue lights were still going for another five minutes.  Those lights faded after that.  I didn&#39;t see anything after that.<n>

I have lived here for eight years and know that there are no antennas in the area.  The area is composed of flat, open farmland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the stop sign I opened my car window to hear if they might have been helicopters.  No such luck.  The lights appeared to be bigger than a car.  Upon closer inspection the objects showed no motion other than spinning.  There was vertical or horizontal movement.  I kept going home and told my wife who was leaving for work at the time.  About fifteen minutes later she calls up and confirms they are still there and indeed are spinning.  Furthermore, she spotted a third one further down doing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have been trying to rationalize it but I can&#39;t come up with an explanation. Weather conditions were cloudy with lightning in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I went and got my friends and they came out to the road and we watched them, so after a while one of these lights fades out but we still see flashing light I thought it might be a helicopter but it flew over us we seen a triangle light pattern and the lights were not blinking in the same sequence.  They came rising up from a tree line of a near by farm house.  This place is in the middle of no where, its all farm land, no air ports or air strips for miles.  They literally looked to be rising from the field.  Some came from another directions and joined them. Repeatedly the bright white lights would shine and we could see them hovering and landing or taking off, then the white light would disappear and you could only see the blinking lights.  There was no noise at all though.  One of them looked to be going straight up very quickly and only moments before it was on the ground it seemed, and then it was almost out of site after a moment.  There were probably like 10-13 of them not to mention the ones flying by that seemed to join them.   Me and my friends got freaked out. My girlfriend and I went back home and as we were passing threw town I saw more lights like a set of lights side by side and it seemed not to be moving.  So I pull over and get out the car I could not hear nothing at all and it seemed to be moving very slow so I watched it and it was moving away I could see it was just like  the ones I had seen earlier at my friends house, then I go home. While I was pulling in the drive way it started coming back towards my home, opposite of the direction I had seen it moving in earlier.  I&#39;ve never been so creeped out...<n>

When looking at it just with our eyes it would &#34;bump&#34; up in down.  it must have been bumping up and down a pretty big distance because across the sky it would jump either a few inches up or down.  It covered the entire horizon i can see in a matter of minutes so it had to be going super fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i saw it begin at the port of olympia, and it went north following budd inlet towards and past boston harbour and burfoot park towards tacoma.  what was this thing??  there was also a plane going super quickly much much lower than the weird fire ball moving across the sky. the plane appeared to be moving much quicker than the fire thing, which is! crazy because the fire ball was going super fast to begin with.<n>

5/21/13 21:00|Cumming|GA|Light|20 minutes|I witnessed a bright purple orb traveling across my neighborhood and instantly a green orb appeared and they seemed to communicate|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97816.html|220|ndxe201305| I witnessed a bright purple orb traveling across my neighborhood and instantly a green orb appeared and they seemed to communicate<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 3 year old son and I were pulling in my neighborhood at about 9:25pm tonight (5/21/13) and I noticed a huge bright vibrant purple ball of light moving across the sky about a 1000 feet up (above the neighborhood), pretty high but very close to us.. My son says look a &amp;quot;firefly&amp;quot;.. I shut off my car with windows down and no sound what so ever and no beacon lights were coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it moving (approximately the speed of a small cessna type airplane but floating like a balloon), instantly another huge ball of light just appears in front of it (about 200 yards out) coming directly at it..  This one is bright GREEN..  Right as they are about to collide they both instantly stop in the sky at equal distance apart from each other and rotate 3 times in a perfect circle counterclockwise facing each other and then completely stop for about 10 seconds (hovering) and then they continue on side by side (the purple one slightly in front of the green one) in t! he same direction over the tree line (about 1/2 mile away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I watched for about 20 minutes as the purple one ascended and descended at a pretty fast rate (it would come up in a straight vertical line to about 1000 feet, stop, shift from side to side for about a 30 seconds to 2 minutes and then descend at about the same speed it came up) over the tree line several times while gradually changing colors (purple, red, orange, blue).. This happened 4 times over a 20 minute period. The second time that this happened, I was on the phone with my father holding my son and as the object in the distance was hovering, a bright vibrant green flash went over our head with no sound, so fast it left a green trail for a split second and disappeared as fast as it appeared (almost as fast as a lightning flash but directly over our head and heading from south to north - we were watching the other object off to our East). My son once again said &amp;quot;that was a fast green firefly&amp;quot;  My 13ish year old neighbor walked up and as I was explaining to her what we were experiencing, the purple object ascended up from the tree line again, this time morphing vibrant colors from purple, red, orange and blue. We watched this event for approximately 2 minutes before she got a bit scared and went home. I snapped 3 VERY quick pictures (each picture was taken as fast as I could hit the picture button. Milliseconds from the each other) back to back with my iphone as the one in the distance was ascending (it was blue at this point)..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s the cobalt blue light at the top of each picture.. I didn&#39;t notice until after I looked at my phone and zoomed in but, in the first picture, you see just a blue object. In the 2nd picture, you see the blue object but above it, a white ball swooping in with a tail or streak behind it. In the 3rd picture, you see the blue orb, no object above it but now a big white object with a mushroom shape to it below it. I could not see these with the naked eye, only after I looked closely at the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights themselves were much larger than anything I have ever seen before (huge) and they maneuvered like nothing I have ever seen (i think ruling out planes, helicopter, remote control vehicle)..<n>

She saw a slow moving object which I didn&#39;t observe even though standing next to her.  She took pictures of this object moving from our objective left to our right (so from east to west from our perceptive of vision) she could see it and I couldn&#39;t so I asked her to take pictures. I still couldn&#39;t see the object but the camera could.  Looking at her pictures it looks like a bullet shaped object that&#39;s transparent but with color at the flying end.  What&#39;s bizarre is I didn&#39;t see the object even with her pointing until I saw the camera pictures.  I now see the glowing shape in all the pics she took but I didn&#39;t see any real time.<n>

At a first glance, I could have mistaken it for an airplane, but it did not have small blinking lights and instead was one pea-sized bright white light.  It also had a quieter sound than an airplane, but a sound was still emitted.  As it passed across my window, I wondered if it was a headlight from a car or something of the sort,  but then I realized that my bedroom window does not face the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I concluded that the object I saw was a UFO, and I came here for your help.<n>

It either burned out or traveled far enough away not to be seen with the naked eye.<n>

It was a large &#34;fireball&#34; looking object.  It travelled fairly slow, not in a straight line, and no sound was present.  We saw another light appear from behind a tree and travelling almost in the same direction.  Again no sound.  The object almost appeared to &#34;flicker.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> They eventually just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video was taken of these objects and is nearly identical to videos of other &#34;fireballs&#34; that have been witnessed.<n>
5/20/13 21:45|Athens|AL|Flash|5 minutes|Three quickly flashing lights one after the other repeating in order and moving together|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97827.html|226|ndxe201305| Three quickly flashing lights one after the other repeating in order and moving together<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 9:45PM CT on 2013-05-20 looking North, there were three flashing (light up then go out) round white lights one after the other with each flashing 2-3 times very quickly(within no more than a second).  The flash would occur 2-3 times very quickly, then it would occur again to the left of where the last occurred about half a second to a second later, then again for a third time to the left of the previous again half a second to a second after the previous.  It would all repeat again roughly starting back to where the flashes came from the first time (they were moving) and continue in the same order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three flashing lights were moving at the same speed, at the same distance apart, and at the same height (being about the same altitude as a large passenger jet would be when circling or turning to land) as they came closer.  So it appeared that all three were some how attached.  For a brief moment I thought it may have been three airplanes in a formation and their flashing lights just happened to occur to appear one after the other. It was obviously not a single airplane as the right most and left most flashing lights were to far apart even for a large jet.  However, I quickly realized that I&#39;ve never seen any airplane lights flash 2-3 times very quickly like these did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I therefore continued to watch these flashing lights.  Together they turned and started heading West much like a large airplane would do.  The three flashing lights got closer to each other while turning to go West.  This is when I called my wife to come outside.  She came out and we watched them until we could no longer see the flashes of lights.  It lasted 3-5 minutes from the time I first saw the flashing lights to the point I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To help describe it, a very simple example would be to imagine looking at a stick (horizontal with one end pointing East and the other West) with a light that flashes on the end pointing East, after it stops then a light flashes in the middle of the stick, after it stops a light flashes on the other end of the stick pointing West.  Then slowly turn it so the end the was pointed East points South/South-East and the end that was pointing West points North/North-West.  While turning it the lights will appear to get closer to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights such as a red strobe light or any lights that were constantly on.  No objects could be seen, only the flashing lights.  I could not hear any sound but the A/C unit for my house and neighbors were running.  The way the three flashing lights appeared to be connected and how they turned would resemble an airplane(a light on each wing and one on the nose or underneath between the wings).  However the span from the light on the right to the light on the left was way to long to be a single airplane.  Maybe it could have been three planes in a formation but I&#39;ve never seen lights on a plane flash 2-3 times that quickly.  Also the timing of the lights flashing one after the other would seem very unlikely across three planes.<n>

It was as bright as a phosphorus burn, a &#34;white light&#34; and it pulsed.  I live on a lake, the lights from the tower form a reflection that is a line of light on the lake.  (1) aircraft pulsing red light and (1) light that is on full time.  The white light pulsed next to it for about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my camera and it was full!  (I left it on after the storms and it recorded itself out) I missed the video...  The light lit up a reflection on the lake that was a wider more intense beam than the radio towers and I am sure it was not an aircraft.  If the light was from an aircraft at that altitude and shining that reflection, it would have hit my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got the camera ready and the light into frame it just vanished.  Its altitude was less than 300 feet.  It was silent.  It was close enough to light up my lake same as the radio tower.  It was about 1.5 miles from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:38 it was gone.  I came in off the balcony.<n>

What caught my attention most about this light or object was that it wasn&#39;t steadily moving in one direction like any military or commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately got out of my car to closely examine this object.  When I got out of my car, I instantaneously realized the light was moving from left to right, up and down, almost in a circular motion.  It was hovering and not leaving the radius in which it was circling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew the object that was projecting the light I seen was not man made.  It was the real thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I could think twice to pull out my phone and record the object moved a bit more rapidly in many different directions, and within seconds it disappeared into the sky.  It didn&#39;t disappear like it suddenly went invisible, but it literally sped into the sky and vanished from my sight.  Faster then any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, or expect to see in my lifetime.<n>

At it&#39;s speed I first thought it to be a helicopter, due to size and altitude, but it had no noise and no visible tapering tail end.  It was shaped more like a ahort bullet and glowed reddish/orange/yellow as if it were extremely warm.  It was not a meteor.  It did not travel in a straight path but rather moved slowly on an angle, as if to steer it self a bit and then straighten out again.  I had enought time to call a witness to this from in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the oject moved over head it appeared to pulse with this heat while it seemed like it was losing some of that heat.  It was moving slowly, like a slow helicopter speed.  As it pulled away finally, after 2 minutes, it started to cool and slowly went black, not to relight.  I looked to watch it then continue on it&#39;s way, as black stone looking object as if it never been lighted in the 1st place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had no flaming, fireball tail and did not appear to be disintergrating.  It just looked aglow and seemed to pulsate with reddish/yellow heat.  Moving at a rather astonishly slow clip. Once black, it drifted out of sight to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This went on for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally they both started moving across the sky first really slow and then picked up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they went by I listens really close and could not hear a single thing from them and they finally just moved out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard your interview on Coast to Coast with George Noory, last Sunday, June 2, 2013.  You mentioned that in the previous week you were astounded that there were over 400 UFO sightings.  I reviewed some of the sitings and they seemed very easily explainable to me.  One of them, in Maine, I believe was very obviously the B-1 Bomber in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with a local AFB website (Creech AFB has a website - near my home in Pahrump, NV) and as I expected, the Air force - specifically the B -1 Squadron out of Texas) was doing Green Flag exercises from May 17 - May 31.  These are exercises which replicate exact tactics that are being used currently in Afghanistan.  They are also trying out a new targeting system which explains the sighting in Cleveland or Indianapolis, I believe, where someone saw planes flying in formation chasing a white light - it turned red (blew up), then vanished (because it disintegrated in the air).  This is typical  Air force exercises that occur at different times for military readiness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps with your quest.  I am an extraterrestrial hopeful, and am always interested in extraterrestrial life - would like to believe we are being visited, but in these cases the only vists are from Uncle Sam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> Pahrump, NV<n> <n><n> 661-((number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE TO VISITOR&#39;S COMMENTS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Ms. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your note!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could you please direct me to the website you accessed?

S. Air Force probably does not shoot down “targets” over civilian areas, or even over unpopulated forests, given the damage and injury that could occur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other aspects of your observation that I don’t understand is why two B-1B bombers would be flying in close formation, and why they would have bright lights on them.  Moreover, they are very loud, and even at a distance of many miles, they would have had a sonic signature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport, Director<n> <n><n> National UFO Reporting Center<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END NUFORC&#39;S RESPONSE))<n>

I stopped at the red light facing north at the intersection of Littleneck Pkwy and 72ave.   was with my friend when I looked in the sky and I saw about 10 mayb more dots in the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they looked like Stars.  But I&#39;m in NYC and Rarley do we see bright stars that are as clear as they were that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took a closer look I notice it was some sort of light.  It was more then one light it was about 10.  They didnt seem to have any pattern shape to them as to show if it was an object like a plane or helicopter. It more looked like individual lights floating on their own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I took my phone out to take pictures the lights that looked like dots or stars started moving around in all directions as in scattering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally took a few pictures with and without flash.  Alot of them have disappeared by the time I took the picture.  But I did get to capture! a few and you can notice the lights are not a shape to anything like an airplane or helicopter.  A few moments after I took the picture the remainder dots that was in the sky ended up disappearing little by little.  I was able to view them getting further away until it was small enough it just disappeared.  When I finally drive up to the next stop light I looked at the car next to me and I noticed that they too were in shook or disablief on what they just saw.  I happen to know the people in the other car as well.<n>

We were able to see them from several perspectives as we got off I-270 and headed north on Rt. 23.  We couldn&#39;t identify them.  If they were all part of one aircraft it would have been huge.  If they were all individual aircrafts there were a lot of them.  Yet they didn&#39;t move.<n>

It was triangular, bright orange.  There were no flashing lights, no sound, no smell.    There was a wide glow/haze around the object.   We watched it travel for about 6 or 7 seconds from East to West (slightly northwest).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tips of the triangle were rounded in shape.   It was traveling at a consistent speed in what appeared to be a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2-3 minutes after we saw the object, we did see airplanes in the sky, and could definitely see the flashing lights of the airplane, and could hear the airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we saw had no flashing lights and no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I finally went downstairs and outside to take some photo&#39;s.  I think there were about 7 or 8 of these craft following one another, and not in a evenly spaced format.  Eventually the event was over! I clearly saw, numerous glowing orbs/craft flying across the sky and seemingly ascending up &amp; disappear.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took 16 photo&#39;s. Some show nothing, a couple show three craft in a row, and some have just one object.<n>

This thing was close enough to the interstate for me to ask my wife if it wasn&#39;t just a really tall highway overpass light, pointing forward, instead of down.  She said point blank, “ No, that aircraft had two bright headlights, and it was hovering in place.”   	I got one good look at its shape, in the low light evening sky.  It was triangular overall with a disk shape up front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having witnessed the Dalai Lama speak at the Yum Center this afternoon, and this engineering marvel, I feel blessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was huge and by that it looked to be several miles long in mass and length if it were in our lower atmosphere!  If it were higher in the upper heavens then it could even span beyond miles!  There is no telling how far up it was or how big it really was.  Measuring from the top of the car&#39;s rear view mirror to the middle of the windshield is how much space it took up of that area and it looked as high up there in space as the stars look among the constellations as I lunged forward to see it better.  It tilted downward as if it were dipping and just vaporized right before our eyes but left a fa! int flash of light orange yellowish glow in an oblong design along it&#39;s outer perimeter between the bottom and middle lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She had been looking at it and trying to figure just what it was while talking on her cell phone which she immediately told her sister she had to hang up and then it disappeared in a second from her hanging up the phone. I saw it clearly for no more than perhaps only two to three seconds tops. She saw it maybe seven to eight seconds also.  But boy is it etched into my mind!  It reminded me of how the triangle craft in Arizona looked that made UFO history.  But this one dwarfed that image. And it was slanted sideways at an angle.  It was super massive. This is happening during a near full moon on a clear starry night.  There were no clouds or obstructions for it to disappear in or behind. It startled us very much and we were so relieved it disappeared as it scared us good! The wife commented how glad she was that it was now gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rode home looking out t! he windshield fervently and methodically paying close attentio! n to the skies. I actually veered of the road once and she being a woman of no nonsense would usually get on to me about watching where I&#39;m going but she was too mesmerized at gazing out the window that it did not phase her much which trust me is highly unusual behavior for her! We slowly rode home watching the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home a bright light came over the trees from the woods near our home as I was talking to my son on the phone about that massive UFO as I stood outside in the backyard. I was still watching the skies because of the earlier observation. This was perhaps twenty minutes later at 9:34 pm. I opened the back door and called for the wife to please come see this strange light. She came outside and we both agreed it might just be a plane as it was on the path planes usually come up over the woods from. But I noted there was no noise and the light was going too fast for an airplane or even a jet. She said... &amp;quot;That s just a plane&amp;quot;...&amp;#12288; but it reminded me of an encounter we reported on your site just after Christmas about a fireball we encountered up close because it was unusually bright and commanded attention. As it rose higher into the airspace it was dazzling bright then instantly dimmed away like a vacuum tube does when the power is turned off and simply ! disappeared right before our eyes just like that last fireball did we had saw right after Christmas. The sky was clear and the bright moon was lighting everything up and there was no place for that craft to hide behind or cloud to absorb into. I&#39;ve seen planes disappear like that before and wonder what causes that effect but this was totally different in the way the largeness of the craft was becoming and the brightness it was emitting. Well she exclaimed...&amp;quot;That&#39;s two UFO encounters in less than a half hour&#39;s time!&amp;quot;  My son was listening to all of this happening on the phone so he is an audio witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m reporting this out of great concern and if anyone reading this account had seen this very frightening event then you would be thinking like I am that it has nothing to do with earthly technologies and it certainly is nothing the military has hiding in the hangers.<n>

As they flew over the lake, they movrd tward the rite behind a group of tall trees and at that point I lost sight of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second then a third formation of lights flew in the same direction, and did the same minuvers as the first formation.  All in all, there were about 35 to 50 of these light/crafts, and the whole incident took about ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound at all, and they moved much to slow to be any kind of airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for their color, they were a very brite yellow in the center, and the futher from the center you got, the darker they became, till you could see an outline on the edges.  They flew very low in the sky, mabey 1500 to 2000 feet so I got a very good look at the formations.<n>

We exited the car to look closer, since the lights emanating from the craft were not the typical yellow-white lights of military craft or helicopters, but a flame-orange color, singular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flew in double-single-double formation, approaching from the North, and flew South for a distance before heading West, seemingly following Route 15 across Lake Champlain—but as soon as these crafts turned, the lights disappeared from the sky right before our eyes.  They didn’t blink like normal aircraft do when in flight, they were steady, even compared to the other visible planes flying much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flew low, but seemed extraordinarily small—likely not more than a few hundred, perhaps a thousand feet off the ground.  Still, they moved quickly, likely at speeds from 70/100mph judging from the rate of motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed easily over 20 of these lights, but anywhere up to 40. We then decided to drive about a quarter-mile past the intersection where we were stopped, and from the speed at which we closed in on the lights, I realized they couldn’t be flying high. After we made it to the closest light, no more appeared from that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though there were easily 50 cars that passed through the same intersection, and at least one coming from our direction, no one else stopped to look at the high number of unusual lights, likely small aircraft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried my best to catch it on film and I’ll see if I can brighten up what I got later.  But from what I could see, the lights did not appear on my phone, despite the brightness with which they were lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what I just saw.  At first I thought they might be military planes or helicopters, but there was no audible noise of either (and from the sheer number, there would have been some noise to be heard if that’s what they had been).  But my mother and I saw them, even if it seems no one else did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen a lot of weird things in my life, but I think this takes the cake. I don’t believe the lights were of terrestrial origin.<n>

As i walked to my driveway all i could see was roughly 24 orange lights in the pitch black sky.  There had been no sounds prior, during, or after seeing these lights.  They were all moving at the same speed in some kind of formation. Some of the lights would dim just a little bitbit but never went out.  They passed over us for about 6 minutes and then disappeared because of some trees.  To surprise i had one friend tell me she saw something similar but there was only about 5. Its possible that i even saw a couple more then 24 but not less.  They were traveling up (north) the coast.<n>

I noticed a bright orange and white ball of light silently moving across the sky from west to east.  My wife and I went outside and listen and the object did not make a sound. It just moved at a fairly fast and steady pace.  It went past the the horizon and then about ten minutes later i heard the low rumble of jets off go over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He said, &#34;What is that?&#34;  And after a few seconds for him to explain it, I got out of my van and looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three amber colored lights in a triangle formation at approximately 45 degrees from the ground, in the eastern sky and one amber colored light south of the other three.  It was motionless, silent and could not have been a flare or lantern considering the wind was already gusting between 20-30mph as a storm was approaching and it began raining at approximately 5-10 minutes after the sighting.<n>

It was on Saturday, May 18th, at approximately 8:45 p.m. when the strange lights were observed by this independent journalist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having spent the afternoon in Norman, a city 17 miles south of my home in Oklahoma City, my five-year old son and I were driving north along Interstate 35 as we approached the exit in Moore for SW 4th Street.  As we approached it, where the interstate makes a slight jog to the west, in the sky ahead, somewhere over downtown Moore, or slightly north of it, were approximately 8 faded-red lights.  There was an eerie glow about them and they appeared to hang in the sky or rise slightly.  It was mostly cloudy that evening, and slightly windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perplexed, and trying to determine if they were flares, Chinese lanterns or even glowing balloons, I kept looking up at them to see if I could make out what they were.  Realizing that this was not a wise thing to do while driving 63-m.p.h. on a busy interstate, I kept my eye on the lights as I got off at the next exit, for NW 12th Street, just north of downtown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I was on the access road, I pulled onto Pratt Lane, which feeds into the access road just south of 12th. I pulled in front of a house and could still see a few of them. However, by the time I got my cell phone to take a couple of pictures, I could no longer see them My son, interestingly enough, was captivated by the lights as well, asking his dad what the “light ghosts” were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Good question, son. I dialed *55 and got ahold of the dispatcher with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. I described the lights and where I saw them and she took down the information, saying that while she had not received any reports, she would inquire with Moore Police Department. And curiously, the area where the lights were could have been – Chestnut Avenue and Main Street – is right near the Moore Police Department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And yet, when I called the department the next day – Sunday morning – the dispatcher said they had received no reports of strange, red lights and were not sure what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Researching “strange lights Moore” online, the National UFO Reporting Center had some reports made by witnesses in Moore last spring and summer. One report – almost to the day prior to my sighting – described “yellow-orange circular sighting with ascending lights above Moore, Ok.” That was on May 20, 2012. And then, on June 26, 2012, a report from Moore refers to a “fireball object in plain view.” And another report that is similar to mine was made in neighboring Oklahoma City. This report referred to “multiple silent red orbs under power over Oklahoma City, approx. 5 min. in duration.” In fact, most of the reports made by witnesses in Oklahoma tend to refer to “lights.” Because of the EF-5 tornado that blew through Moore on May 20th, we have been unable to get back to the scene in an easy fashion and recreate the scene and try and determine exactly where the lights were hovering and a possible, scientific explanation for what it was we were watching that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hope to have more on this report at a later time.<n>

Noticed the Moon to south.  Turned to East and saw a slow moving amber light(possibly flickering but mostly solid) craft headed in North-South orientation.  I mean slow like a single prop Cessna that is just taking off from the ground, pretty slow. But these craft were fairly high up.  I began to see another craft of a similar character emerge from the heavy cloud layers, just behind the other one, maybe like a 2-3 second count behind the first one.  Then another one, and another one.  All told I counted 5-6 craft, in an F-shaped formation (with the first craft solo), all traveling at the same speed and with no noise whatsoever.  This is why I felt these craft were unusual as the cloud layer is not that high, estimated lower than 2000 feet.  I am basing this elevation on how these clouds were at or near the height of local Chuckanut Mountain (about 1600 feet) which I am familiar with.  Also, the f! light pattern is not a local flight pattern at all, and the military jets that do come into Bellingham are quite loud.  These craft were entirely unique and stealthy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -C<n>

When I looked to see exactly what it was, though, I couldn&#39;t make out any specific shape. It looked like a tiny black ball in the sky hovering around randomly, changing direction but moving slowly. It seemed to float like maybe a group of balloons tied together would if being pushed by the wind, but with the amount of altitude and directional changes, it seemed to be too active to be balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring at the object for about 45 seconds, I ran inside, grabbed my camera, attached the zoom lens as fast as I could, and hurried back to take as many shots as I could. It started NW, then made its way more North while dropping in altitude, then went back West passing low enough to be seen in front of the mountains. After that it came back up and went upwards and north. As I zoomed in and focused on the object, I noticed that it had more shape than I had seen. Once I snapped a shot and looked back on my camera to see what it looked like though, THAT&#39;S when I got excited; it was three perfect circles combined to create a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then snapped as many pics as I could to try and get any sort of different angle on the object, but after maybe 7 minutes of shooting, I decided that I needed to get the tripod because the object was moving further and further away. I didn&#39;t want the shots to keep coming out blurry, so after I ran inside to grab the tripod, brought it back outside, and set the camera up on it, the object had disappeared. It was getting pretty far away by the time I got the tripod outside, but I could see it with my naked eye ALL the way up until I got the camera on the tripod. It was as if it was there, and then simply not. THIS VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN BALLOONS, MY HOPE IS TO GET AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS POSSIBLE AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN.<n>

It was a heavy overcast.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks when I saw all of these flashing lights in sky.  The overcast was very heavy so I knew it was not stars. Plus, the lights were moving very fast in multiple directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband and friend, and we all walked to the rode to see it.  They were very faint, but the little lights would zip across the sky.  As we watched three jets flew over followed by 2 helecoptors.  We called my neighbor to come witness it.  They saw the exact same thing. As of right this minute, they are still bouncing around.  They were on both sides of the sky in our viewing area.  Sometimes, the lights would be a little brighter and then quickly zoom off in another direction.  I cannot tell you exactly how many there were, but it was a lot and because they were in various areas it could have been the same crafts.<n>

The lights disappeared one at a time, very slowly.  My husband came and got me and I looked up and saw the same lights but at this time about 10 of them making different formations.

I attempted to determine which direction the spotlights were coming from and I could not determine the origin of the spotlights.  I continued to view the spotlights and notice that there were circulating in the clouds along the edges of the clouds.  It was a partly cloudy sky, so in between the clouds there was clear sky and stars noticeable.  That is when I called my family out to view this strange phenomenon.  My family were amazed and perplexed as I was.  I was still not sure if it was spotlights or not until the clouds starting changing shapes and moving in a Southeast direction due to the wind or eart rotation.  The movement of the lights remained consistent, moving along the outline of the clouds.  My wife staring taking a video of the event and captured actual footage.  Upon viewing the video, objects were observed that we could n! ot see with the naked eye.

We were both looking at the stars while we were walking. I looked at what appeared to be a big beautiful shining star.  But then it started &#39;zig-zagging&#39; all around. We could see another craft not very far from it but it was VERY dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were white streaks going back and forth between them. Every time the streaks came from the dimmer craft there was a wide beam of blue light emulating from it.  And every time the streak came from what looked to be a star, it jumped backwards across the sky like a grasshopper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it go on for about 45 minutes.  We saw one other &#39;zig-zagging&#39; star further in the NE sky. It was by itself, or so it seemed.  They were both the brightest things in the sky and we watched them both go from one side of the sky to the other and back within minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had a lot of paranormal/supernatural experience in my life, so I want you to know that these kinds of things are very, very important to me. I have never seen a UFO before, and I am absolutely without a doubt convinced that I have now.<n>

I saw a triangular object moving from south to north.  It didnt have any lights and was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didnt have any lights on in my house or outside but could see it because there is a park and baseball field about 200 yards away to the south of my house.  The lights at the baseball field light up the sky very well at night and i could see the underside of the craft.  It appeared metalic by the way the light reflected off of it.  It&#39;s hard to say the size of the craft.  It was flying low enough to reflect the light from the ball fields so i cant imagine it being any higher than a 300 hundred feet above and it appeared fairly large at that distance.  It was out of my sight in about 10 seconds.<n>
5/16/13 21:30|Clermont|FL|Fireball|12 minutes|4 mysterious lights over central Florida.|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97917.html|290|ndxe201305| 4 mysterious lights over central Florida.<n> <n><n> At 21:15 myself +2 neighbors were talking, location was approx. 3 miles south of Clermont Florida. I was facing toward the north, a treeline is positioned approx. 1/2 mile north of my position and tops of structures, including a hospital with a life-flight helicopter can be seen in the distance; approx. 3 miles, weather conditions were calm and clear with 10+ miles visibility, upon seeing the first object my reaction was to think it was a helicopter perhaps transiting smoke from some distant brush fire, the nose light was very orange, I indeed stated to my neighbor are there any fires in the area, the &#34;Life-flight&#34; looks odd. The object was moving east to west at a perceived elevation of less than 1000 ft.  (Based on building elevations)speed appeared to be consistent with that of a helicopter in forward flight, except no noise.  All three of us watched this object, then a second one appeared above the treeline &#34;Flying&#34; what I can only describe as erratically, changing elevation and direction; best I can describe would be a corkscrew flightpath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With both object clearly visible; they now had our collective full attention, the second object I perceived to be in trail of the first by approx. 2 miles, then a third became visible, again trailing by about 2 miles, the guessing now started between three of us, a flight of aircraft on afterburner, nope, no noise, perhaps a group of cruise type missiles, we do have a bombing range 30 miles to our west, objects 1,2 and 3 were clearly visible Florida is very flat, I ran to my house and quickly returned with my marine binoculars and quickly brought number 3 into view, it even through the binoculars appeared as an hazy orange elongated ball, my wife arrived home and also observed the objects, then number 4 appeared and the corkscrew flightpath was duplicated except it was about what appeared to be at least 5 miles behind number 3 the only other one still visible.  Light number 4 then went into a flat flight for about 10 seconds and then speed up and transitioned east to west at ! an extremely high rate of climb and speed, 3 then vanished quickly followed by number 4, it did not fade out, but more like flipped the light switch, gone.  Not visible even through some very good binoculars. mysterious event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 56 years old and traveled the world, never have seen anything like this before.<n>

I was standing on the street of East Oahu, looking towards diamond head.  Object was right side of diamond head.  First I thought it was helicopter or plane, but WHOLE object got illuminated with white light.  It was moving away from me.  At first, slowly with  no sound, and all of sudden  it just vanished.  This is second time I have seen this kind of illuminating/ sometimes beams curved grey object around same area at same time.  ( My first siting was last year in this area. )<n>
5/16/13 16:35|Highlands Ranch|CO|Unknown|5-10 minutes|Floating high-altitude searchlight southeast of Denver, 5/16/2013|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97915.html|296|ndxe201305| Floating high-altitude searchlight southeast of Denver, 5/16/2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> This afternoon was mostly clear in the south Denver area, and completely clear in the direction I was viewing.  I grabbed my 12x binoculars to look at the moon and immediately upon taking my binoculars away from my eyes an incredibly bright white light was generally pointed directly at me, and sometimes varying direction randomly as a manually operated spotlight does..  This light was between 50,000 and 100,000 feet in altitude, just below and to the right of the moon from my perspective, and varying in intensity while still being directed at my precise position.  I was looking generally ESE.  Over the course of 5-10 minutes, I followed the object as it descended from approximately 60 degrees above the horizon to approximately 20 degrees.  During this descent, it paused a few times in a stationary position in relation to the power lines behind my house.  It did not create any contrails nor did it have a debris trail.  It was clearly above contrails from actu! al jets passing through the area at the time.  When the light wasn&#39;t pointed directly at me, I could see some type of round shape.  My wife also witnesses this object and said she saw two extruding portions of the shape.  I would estimate that this object was 10-25 miles away from me, based on the amount of haze between me and the object.  Passing jets were far less hazy through my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work as a professional technician with lighting and video.  I would estimate the color temperature of the light as 5600K (It did not match the color temperature of the sunlight reflecting off aircraft in the area).  It was about as bright as a Super Trooper concert spotlight from 500 feet away on its tightest focus.  Anyone who has sat on the floor of a stadium concert and been in the beam of a follow spot should understand this analogy.  I saw no standard aircraft navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched satellites fly overhead many times in my lifetime, and I have never seen one during daylight.  I have never seen a satellite linger in the same area of the sky, pause its movement, and vary its direction of movement.  I have also never seen a satellite or high altitude aircraft move so slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point while the beam was directed at me I felt a warming sensation in my abdomen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The encounter ended with the light turning off suddenly and the object fading from view in about 250 milliseconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from the west and headed east towards palomar mountain.  It made no sound and it was very big, flying pretty low but high enough to clear the mountain.  I did not chase it or try to track it because I was told that it was (Taquitz) a ball of death!!! It was in my view for about 2 min!!!<n>

5/15/13 23:45|Springfield|MO|Light|15 minutes|blue light(s) disappearing and reappearing in sporadic flight pattern|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97800.html|300|ndxe201305| blue light(s) disappearing and reappearing in sporadic flight pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my back porch enjoying a beer when I looked out between the trees and saw what I initially thought was a shooting star, but realized it wasn&#39;t because it was overcast so there weren&#39;t any stars out and besides there is too much light pollution where I am to see stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I quickly called my mom and step-dad out to witness it too.  It was a small blue orb-like light that appeared, streaked across the sky, then disappeared...and then appeared again.  It seemed to be flying around in circles, but in a sporadic flight pattern accelerating and decelerating and changing directions much faster than any modern military aircraft could do. It would appear, fly a looping, zig-zag pattern for a few seconds then disappear, only to appear again a few moments later.  It wasn&#39;t a spotlight because it was a little orb and I would have been able to see the beam of light.  There were possibly more than one because at one point my Mom saw two fly right by each other then split off in different directions, and I saw one with a red flashing light on it and then one without so there could have been multiple orbs.  It wasn&#39;t an airplane either because there wasn&#39;t a flashing white light and they flew very differently than a jet.  It seemed like there was only one, then more started popping up and then just like that they were gone.  Also, before they completely disappeared they seemed to be flying around at altitude then diving at the ground at steep angles and very rapid speeds, almost like a dive-bomber would.  I captured it on my iPhone but we were too far away and the camera is too poor I don&#39;t think you can see anything.  I first saw it around 2345 and they disappeared around 0000. It could have been going on before that but that is when I noticed it.<n>

The light suddenly burst into several smaller white lights which then began to move around each other.  When the light &amp;quot;burst&amp;quot; there were glowing streamers briefly projected out from the original light, which gave the initial appearance of a pyrotechnic.  However, after about a minute, they all suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another minute or so went by and then three white lights re-appeared in the same location as the previous lights.  These three were of a brighter intensity and continued to move around each other, but the movement was much slower than earlier.  After about two minutes, these three then suddenly disappeared as well, as if a switch were thrown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short delay, several more lights appeared, but this time there was about ten to twelve of them.  They were of different intensities and were of differing colors, red, blue, yellow and white.  These were also moving around, but at a quicker speed, like the first appearance.  The movement was deliberate, as if they were circling each other, but the entire formation itself remained stationary.  The lights disappeared about a minute later and did not reappear again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time that I have seen an unknown light over West Wing Mountain.  In February of 2012, I saw an unknown blue light early one morning, which I reported to the center later that day.<n>

Although I did not see these UFOs myself, I felt that I should report them anyway, simply because they relate directly to what I have been seeing for just over a month now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine who witnessed two UFO’s and a UGO (Unidentified Glowing Object) with me off the beach at the South end of Captiva Island on June 26, 2013, called me to tell me that a trustworthy fishing buddy of his saw four “kinda orange-amber,” intense, “fireballs” go directly overhead from where he was shark fishing with other friends. (see “Sighting #4” in “Summary of 10 UFO Sightings” I recently reported to NUFORC).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he thought that they were some kind of meteors or fireballs, but there were no trailing flames, and they were traveling horizontally. The four objects were traveling north to south, were “fast” and “high overhead.”  Several things are important here:  (1) this “fireball” / “orange light” sighting  coincides with a report, filed last May with UFO Hunters, of six amber lights, of precisely the kind I and my friend “Carol” saw on June 24; (2) at least six other reports filed with MUFON and NUFORC from this area indicate that these objects have been in this area for perhaps as along as three months, with many of these reports happening on July 4, when I too saw (and reported) them.  (3) NUFORC in particular has received recently unusually large numbers of these orange, or Fireball objects throughout the United States.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On second glance I realized that these were not normal aircraft or helicopters.   The front set was actually a green/white glow and looked like a gigantic cockpit or cabin.  The rear set was a read glow which was considering the height about ½ mile to 1 mile behind the first set.  It became apparent the this was one solid object.  I could not make out the center section but could see that it was a more dense area the night sky.  It was moving slowly at maybe 500-600 ft off the ground.  There was absolutely no navigation lights of any kind. There were no lights visible between the front to the back.  When the object got where I could see the rear end, It had steady small white and what looked like blue on both sided in a vertical fashion.  In the center was a very large read glowing light.! The red light never went dark but would flare up to a bright red at a steady pace.  It was not a strobe type light, it was a slow flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object reached  a large open area which belongs to the Bureau of Land Management.  At the time it made it’s only sound, a low pitched rumbling lasting for a few seconds.    I observed the object continue on towards the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been unable to associate this with any aircraft I can think of.  The lighting was all wrong for any navigational lights and they were the wrong type.  I thought maybe a dirigible or blimp but it was way too long I would say it was about ½ mile to 1 mile in length.  It did not have the required lighting either.  Also I had spotted a star in the night background and thought that it might pass in front of the star so I could observe the center body but it traveled too low and just under the view of the star.  A dirigible or blimp would have blocked the star from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have plenty of helicopters fly here but again they have a specific sound and lighting.   I was not going in the direction of any airport.  I have exhausted all means of explaining to myself what this was.  I cannot associate it with any type aircraft.  This was a clear night, no wind.  I was able to observe this object between 5-10 minutes.<n>

Then I worried that it might be something on fire, so I walked to a place where I didn’t have to view it between leaves on trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized that it was moving—in my direction, on a southwest to northeasterly path at a steady speed.  As it came closer, I could tell it was in the sky, though low and the “fire” became red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought it must be a helicopter and I was seeing its red light, though it was not flashing.  I waited to see the green light, or to hear the sound of the blades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling at a speed similar to a helicopter.  It ended up passing overhead at a low altitude and there was never a sound—not from propellers and not from an engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While overhead it appeared to be a light at the bottom of a triangular shaped object, ! but that could have been the radiating beams of light that created an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to describe the light itself, it was more like that from a flare as opposed to a lightbulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trees obstructed further view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 61 years old and have never before seen anything like it.<n>

Video<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming out of a Cracker Barrel Restaurant, headed back to hotel on foot when i saw what i thought was an abnormally bright satellite headed northwest.  I watched the light for about 10 seconds until i realized that i had my Iphone in my hand.  I took approximately 4 minutes of video of this thing moving through the sky in every direction.  I kept building and trees in view so as to gauge speed and movement of the object.   It would accelerate instantly then stop and change direction instantly.  The object was without doubt the brightest thing in the sky.  Stadium light in the sky would be the closest description i could give.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video gives the brighntness of this object no justice but does clearly show the incredible movement of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have saved a permanent copy of the video on my hard drive for anyone who thinks i have  hoaxed this and have posted a video on you tube under the title Yuma UFO May 15.  It was not a helicopter or plane.  Look for! yourself.   The File is in HD and 434 MB.<n>

There was also a pattern of a few simple black lines across the grey area.  It was traveling low and fast, just at the height and ahead of a thunderstorm rolling in.

I thought maybe it would be a low flying plane or a helicopter, but as I continued toward it I got right under it and I slowed down and looked up under my visor and I&#39;d say about 200 to 300 feet in the air there was a big sparkler type light.  I already had the window down to see if I could hear anything.  I did not hear anything.  I was a little afraid and decided I would just keep going.

The four objects were traveling north to south, were “fast” and “high overhead.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two things are important here:  (1) this sighting roughly coincides with a report filed with UFO Hunters of six amber lights, of precisely the kind I and my friend “Carol” saw on June 24; and (2) this indicates that these objects have been in this area for perhaps as along as three months, at least.   Reports of UFO’s to the south of Captiva at Marco Island and the Isles of Capri were of different kinds of UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was not directly under the lights but if I had to guess it looked like it might of been a triangle from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them move slowly over the hills to the east.  I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t an airplane, the lights were way too far apart.  And I don&#39;t think there would be 3 airplanes following one another.  I&#39;m certain it was a UFO, all one craft.

5/14/13 21:00|Franklin|TN|Triangle|10 seconds|Black Triangle Sighting in Franklin Tennessee, May 14, 2013|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97874.html|321|ndxe201305| Black Triangle Sighting in Franklin Tennessee, May 14, 2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all my 45 years I thought I would never have the opportunity to say this, but the other night I saw a UFO. More specifically, I saw a black triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me just state that this is probably going to be one of the most boring reports that you have received, but I felt I should share it none-the-less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 5/14/2013, between 2045 and 2100 central time, I opened my front door to let my dog outside.  I followed her, and just like always, I happened to look up into the sky.  There it was, moving swiftly and silently, directly over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was some type of drone aircraft, then I immediately realized I heard no sound.  What truly caught and kept my attention was the lighted tips of the object, which formed a perfect triangle.  Also the lights were not very bright, however they were white (non-colored)  All three lights seemed to radiate at the same intensity, and the best way I can describe that is to adjust a dimmer lightswitch to about 70%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing struck me as interesting as I reflect on what I saw, that it was flying in a &amp;quot;skewed&amp;quot; position.  Let me try to describe:  If you imagine an airplane, with a light at the nose and a light at the end of each wing, the light at the nose will always be in the lead, and the wing lights will always stay equidistant in their position, and  uniform as the plane moves forward.  The same would be true if there was no light on the nose, but two lights at the tips of the wing and one on the tail.  From a view on the ground, thee flat side with the two lights at the tips/edges would be moving forward (in the lead), followed by the light at the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object flew forward as if it was turned at about 30 degrees off the center axis, so I could not tell what was in the &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot;.  It only kept its  uniform,  steady shape as it flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.  Of course, I had no camera with me, and I did run in and inform my wife of what I saw, and unfortunately there were no other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recognized what it was from a historical fascination with &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; like this.  I had read enough non fiction about such instances to know that black triangles and the &amp;quot;cigar&amp;quot; shaped crafts are some of the most recognized shapes that have been recorded. So, I knew exactly what it was when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to try to contribute best I can to what I saw, so here are some specifics:  Shape of Tips-I did some internet research and found many descriptions as to the shape of the tips, ranging from &amp;quot;boxy&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;pointed&amp;quot;.  The tips on this sighting were definitely more blunt and rounded, not pointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed...well, I could not judge the speed but it was moving fairly fast for the sighting to only last for about 10 seconds, especially from the point of view I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size-If you take a half dollar out of your pocket and hold it between your index finger and thumb, and then extend your arm above you and look at the flat side of the quarter, that is about the size of the object from my ground perspective.  I have read that some witnesses state that these things are very very large.  Well, if they are, then from my view on the ground and the size approximation I described, it was fairly high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other features-some articles I have seen reference a light (red) in the center of the underside of the craft.  There were no other lights visible on the object that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction:  I looked at google maps and found my home, and judging by its direction, it was traveling due north.  If you continue due north from Franklin TN, you will pass by the western edge of the city limits of Nashville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps for your records.  Again, I never thought I would be reporting anything such as this, so this has truly been a fun exercise.  I just wish I had more to share.<n>

While in a tree stand about 22&#39; in the air I noticed a cylindrical shaped light moving slowly and seemingly tumbling.  I was looking at this object moving North westerly and put my rifle scope up to see it more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked through the scope, set on 9x magnification, I could see it seemed to be on fire!  The front end looked to be pointing in the same general direction and the rest of the entire object looked like a yellow/orange sparkler.  The object moved at a steady rate but in an erratic way, like the tail end was dancing and sliding around while the &#34;nose end&#34; steadily pointed in a Northwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object move for almost 10 minutes until I could no longer see it through the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out for another 2 hours but did not see anything out of the ordinary.  This object seemed to be coming from the direction of the airport in Greensboro, NC, and moving north/northwest at a slow rate of speed.  No noise, because as other airplanes were flying over I could hear them.  There were numerous other airplanes flying in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be very interested to know if anyone else has claimed to see this or something like it in the area.  I go out at least 1 night a week hunting and this is the 4th time seeing something I could not explain since 2010....in the same general area.  Nothing I have ever seen looked like this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Slight cirrus/cirro-stratus clouds were in area, object appeared to be above the clouds and the light continued to dim until it was no longer visinle.  Speed perhaps in the area of 350 to 400 knots.  It disappeared from view about 10 to 15 segrees from where it appeared.  No noise.  A jet did pass from the east heading west approximately 90 seconds to 2 minutes after object disappeared, moving at about 450 to 500 knots, and was audibly a jet and it&#39;s crew must have seen the object as well because the jet had all strobes and marker ! lights lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 23:40CDT, second object appeared, headed roughly south south west, dim, white/blue white, initially spotted almost due overhead as it moved southerly away from the star Arctrus- likely on an eclipsing trajectory in reference to my location, but object initially spotted beside Arctrus moving at approximately 250 knots at best.  It disappeared from view within about 15 degrees of initial visual appearance, and it too appeared to be above the broken cirrus/cirro-stratus layer. single light, no sound, Just faded to not visible.<n>

Needless to say by now I was very scared,and planning to get myself into the house asap.I went into the house and told my wife what I saw and ask her to come to the front porch of the house,By this time there were two more crafts coming from the same direction at somewhat faster pace{still I feel that it was slow speed for a UFO}but I felt that these two crafts were in a little faster pace , perhaps trying to catch! up  to the first four crafts.My wife saw these two crafts and! she als o could not figure out what  they were{We are absolutely sure that they were not airplane,helicopters or anything man made.as  me and my wife were looking at the two crafts,I noticed 2 more crafts coming from the same direction in the distance{4 city blocks}By now I called my next door neighbor and told him to come out and see what was going on outside,He came out and had a cell phone{Iphone5}and was able to still catch  some seconds of video of the crafts as they seemed to gather high in the Eastern sky.  Also outside was my neighbor`s grand daughter{15 years old},We have the video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10200812612894311&amp;set=vb.1133124242&amp;type=2&amp;theater<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to put emphasis on the size of the globes that I saw,They were all the same in size and color,There were no sounds,Low altitude as if they were taking a deeper and closer look at the Earth, I have a son that is a police officer ,He said that there were no calls from people reporting seeing this cr! afts.Also the Chicago-Rockford International Airport{In Rockford,IL}is located about one mile away from the location where this sighting occurred, I do not know if they detected anything that night. These crafts definitely were fallowing a route,had organized spacing,control in the speed of movement,formation and synchronization.<n>

We decided to do back country camping, and hiked down for at least a mile away from any major trails. The first night I didn’t notice anything unusual in the skies.  However on the second night, there was a strange occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, my boyfriend noticed some lights in the distance up near the main trail that seemed to bob up and down.  At first I thought they were flashlights from people walking around (it was past 9pm, probably close to 10pm, when we got back to our campsite).  The lights almost looked like they were coming toward us, so we put our shoes on just in case (there would be no reason for anyone come that way as we were a good distance from the main trail with no other campsites visible).  After studying the lights for a while (maybe 20 min, it is hard to say), we still could not tell what we were seeing.  The lights just kept dipping below the horizon line, which showed the outline of trees and other formations of the park, and weaving behind the trees or formations.  Like I said, it was hard to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally decided to just forget about it and have dinner. After, we looked at the sky. I saw several brilliant flashes of light out of the corner of my eye. My boyfriend said that he saw several as well.  However I was never able to pinpoint the source of light.  There were no clouds in the sky, but I’ve speculated that this could have been a type of heat lightning.  I don’t know if that is even possible, but that is the only explanation I could think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, and this is why I have decided to report this sighting, I saw something even more bizarre. We were going to bed, and I had just finished reading and was trying to fall asleep. I noticed an intense light from below my closed eyelids and opened my eyes.  There was a brilliant light, for some reason I have the word “spotlight” in my mind, that shined right on our tent.  It lit up the whole inside of the tent. Terrified, I tried to wake my boyfriend up. I remember saying “Oh my god, there’s a light, there’s a light, there’s a light outside”. I shook my boyfriend’s shoulders to try to rouse him. He just mumbled something, and continued sleeping.  At that point I knew we were basically sitting ducks and that there was nothing I could do, so I just forced myself to close my eyes and I shoved my head down between the blankets.  It felt like the “spotlight” just kind of moved on after a minute or two (even though my eyes were squeezed tight, I could still see light, so I knew! when it had left because the light was gone).  I don&#39;t remember anything after the feeling that the light had passed; I don&#39;t remember if I fell asleep, or stayed awake.  The next thing I remember is waking up some time later towards morning.  To note, I do not remember hearing any sound associated with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never had anything like this happen before, and it has taken a while, but I thought this might be worth reporting.<n>

The big thing upon getting closer to the shore split into three rounded triangles, all with three centrifugal ultraviolet round engines in a triangle formation which appeared to be inside the aforementioned rounded triangles of the former one which is now three large crafts.  There was a transformer like hum coming from the front rounded triangle ahead of the other two rounded triangles in a right triangle formation a possible flight mode to fool the local airport with illusory and then all three rounded triangles made a ninety degree turn and made a run for the border I assume due to the fact a Navy jet was deployed off a aircraft carried and then their was a brief game of cat and mouse and all at once the three crafts with three centrifugal lights that formed three rounded tria! ngles immerged  back into one and pulled away from the navy jet at a very high rate of speed headed South towards Mexico.  I have never seen nothing like it.  You could always see the purple glow of the three fan looking motors of all to one and then a streak that left the Navy jet at I&#39;d say at least 3800 miles per hour.  The Navy jet goes around 1300 miles per hour and this irregular large grey silver metallic spaceship went so fast it was like it disappeared right before my eyes.  The moon was out and the city lights from San Diego made a aurora which caused the viewing in the dead of night.  Something big is getting ready to happen.<n>

They were both the same size.  No lights, no glowing, no reflection, no shininess.  They did appear to be spinning rapidly, one above the other, very close together.  I would estimate their size to be approx. 25 feet.  The spheres changed position, revolving quickly around the other one to switch position.  The spheres then pulled away from each other (right-to-left) and then quickly moved back together and merged abruptly into one another, became one unified sphere, but still the same 25 foot diameter. As soon as they unified, they instantly disappeared or rather dematerialized.  No smoke, no light, no noise.  Nothing.  Just silently dematerialized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately checked my watch and it was 2:25pm.  I looked around to see if any other bystanders had noticed.  No one on the street at the time was looking up in that direction.  I asked a street vendor if she noticed anything and she said she had not.  I asked another gentleman standing near me (he was focusing on his phone at the time) if he saw or sensed anything and he said he did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting took place in less than 10 seconds.<n>

They hovered in place for a few minutes.  We then went outside to get a better look.  They headed east away from my house and quickly flew out of sight.   This all happened in about 7 minutes overall.  None of us were on any kind of medications or drugs and we were not drinking.  We are 19, 20, and 9.  My friend who is also 19 saw them as well and took decent pictures.<n>

I was out there for less than a minute when I thought I saw a shooting star in my peripheral vision almost directly above me.  Upon focusing on it I saw two white circles, not like bright directional shining lights normally seen on a plane but just white circles.  I initially thought it could be one object total but it could be two separate in the same path of travel as the white circles were separated.  The white circles were about the same size around as a #2 pencil held out at arms length and they were spaced out to fit about two of those #2 pencil diameters in between them.  It was moving very fast from East to West.  I saw it from about 90 degrees to about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I could tell it was pretty high up because the sky was clear straight up and all the way to the east but to the west there was some very thin cloud cover that I was able to sti! ll see bright stars through and I could see the white circles slightly dim as it went behind one narrow cloud then get brighter after it passed over it into the clear for a bit and then went behind more cloud cover and got smaller the further away it was and dimmed and then it was gone. This all happened very fast. I estimate the total time from it first catching my eye till it went out of sight was 4 seconds. I know for a fact it was not a plane or a satellite. Way too incredibly fast to be either. The object made no noise. It was purely silent. I also pulled up airplane radar flight records online between 12:10 and 12:20 and there was no planes flying over the city in this timeframe. I talked to an individual at a local airport about it and they stated that it could be a secret military aircraft as they fly those in the middle of the night so they aren&#39;t easily seen. Whether this is true or not I have no idea. It suppose it could be as it was headed in the direction of a ! nearby air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me: I&#39;m in my twenties, have very good eyesight and don&#39;t use glasses/contacts, have good hearing etc.<n>

It was near the end of the evening (somewhere between 10:30 PM –11:00 PM) when a helicopter flew over and put its spot light right on us which was weird but also had it on the neighborhood briefly.  We live in a quiet neighborhood in south-east Denver and just moved from north-east Denver where police choppers – especially on the weekends were common so while this was strange we didn’t really think much of it.  What was weird and unexplainable is what happened next…<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2-3 minutes after the helicopter flew over, we all were still a little sensitive to things flying overhead and we all saw a strange orange light moving quickly towards us from the south west (it appeared to be moving as fast as a fighter jet) but made no sound at all.  As I mentioned our neighborhood is quiet and neither of us could hear anything coming from this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object appeared directly overhead we could all see a light orange circular craft of some kind with a darker orange center that sort of pulsated but there were no blinking lights like you see on an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object travel north east and at which point I brilliantly decided to get a video of it on my phone but I was just a tad too late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I looked up and my wife and our friends stopped making fun of me for thinking of this after it was well over our location, the object disappeared.  It was probably 20 miles or more past our house by the time we lost sig! ht.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed another report came in from Steamboat Springs, CO that same night that has a similar description of the object we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I and our friends (also husband and wife) are all well-educated people but none of us have ever seen anything like this.  Even with that said, we all kind of blew it off but I decided to check out if there was a way to report it since I have thought about it several times in the past couple of weeks since it occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure there’s an explanation for what we saw but figured it’s worth reporting anyway.<n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were low; about as low as private prop planes or helicopters fly and speed slightly slower than these fly.  They were probably only several hundred yards apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only black night sky in between the objects.  Their north to south movement was steady and then their direction angled southeast away from me and one disappeared, leaving one bright and one dim; until the second of three disappeared leaving one until that disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration was about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/11/13 22:30|Irvine|CA|Oval|15 minutes|UFO sighting, 2 objects, May 11, 2013 approximately 10:30pm, Irvine, CA|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97750.html|354|ndxe201305| UFO sighting, 2 objects, May 11, 2013, approximately 10:30pm, Irvine, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted two very distinct objects in the night sky over Irvine, CA while looking eastward from my northeast-facing bedroom window. Unfortunately, I did not have any camera equipment or binoculars available.  I could not see the shape of the craft, but the lights appeared to be large (but different sizes), different colors of red, white, and yellow. There were approximately 5 to 8 different lights on each object.  The red light appeared to be the largest, but there were more of the yellow lights surrounding it.  I could not say for certain if the lights were flickering, but they did not appear to blink or pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights formed an oval shape.  Both of the objects appeared identical to me.  They appeared at first to be very small objects, at least a few miles to the East, traveling steadily West (towards my location).  I can only estimate speed to be somewhat faster than a helicopter, but slower than a commercial jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting was probably a full 15 minutes as the obj! ects approached my location before their ascent and disappearance.  There seemed to be a noticeable increase in speed as the objects ascended, but I can&#39;t really say for sure.  I did not hear any noise from the objects.  Everything was very quiet.  The objects followed a very similar (perhaps identical) westward flight path just a little beyond my location (about 8 miles from the Orange County airport) at an estimated altitude between 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and then ascending so high that the bright colored lights completely disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel confident that the objects ascended because they were getting smaller and smaller until I could no longer see them.  And I also feel confident that the objects would have needed to be higher than 35,000 feet to completely disappear because commercial aviation lights are still visible with my own eyes (at night while traveling at typical, long distance cruising altitudes).<n>

I then noticed that there were two more objects near the initial object I had first noticed. There we&#39;re no visible stars or were there any airplanes or helicopters in the area near by. We then witnessed the three objects start to move and make a few triangle patterns facing North and East respectively. The three objects were a bright red and did not change color. We followed the lights for about ten minutes, at one point being directly below them. At that point I did notice the lights on my dashboard start to dim a bit but didn&#39;t notice any radio interference. After a few minutes of observing the lights, I noticed that two more objects were starting to appear in between the triangular shape. As I turned the street I lost sight of the lights and at that point, my girlfriend said that two of the lights sp! ed off in an Eastern direction and the rest in a Western direction. I would also like to add that the lights did not become dim at any point and there was no trail around them (e.g. flare)<n>

When I saw it I was thinking to myself is that a star in the middle of the day? So I decided to stand there and watch it.  At the time I was wearing sunglasses and when I took them off all I could see was barely a little light in the sky.  With them on as I was watching it I noticed it was slowly moving through the sky, is was quite a ways out but I could clearly make out a few odd things.  The UFOs light was waving back and forth as it was slowly moving one direction and then all the sudden going another direction.  As I stared at it for a good five minutes I also saw what seemed like a very shiny metallic metal as it was moving around in strange ways.  There were no lights like an airplane or helicopter has and it wasn’t moving around like any aircraft I have ever seen I was absolutely sure it was some sort of UFO.  Since me and my mother both strongly believe in aliens I ran into the hou! se to get her, threw my sunglasses on her and took her out to see what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness #2 					 	At approximately 1:45 I was sitting on my couch in my apartment when my son burst through the door exclaiming that I “needed to get my sandals on and come with him”.   I had to ask him to slow down and tell me again because he was very excited.  I put on my sandals and followed him out the door and down the stairs asking him what was going on.  He told me that he had seen a ufo.  He said he had been watching it for about five minutes before risking losing it to come get me so that he could have someone else witness it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked with (behind, had a hard time keeping up in his excitement) him to the road where he started looking up into the sky in a northern direction.  He told me where it was and I looked up and was able to see something.  It was just a metallic dot in the blue sky which at first I thought could have just been a plane high up in the sky.  But then my son told me I needed to use his glasses and I put them on and could REALLY see it.  At first I wasn’t sure what I was seeing although I could tell it was metallic because it was waving (or rocking perhaps?) and as it moved, the light would shine on it and it would sparkle. I could not see the shape but I could see that it was what I would call masked or cloaked as sometimes it would appear to be larger and it appeared to have a shape kind of like an oval or tilted saucer but it was like, see-through or reflecting the sky or something.  I think this sounds insane.  I am almost doubting what I just saw because it seems so out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed it around some trees as it headed north after it went around in circles for a while, changing directions and wagging.  All of a sudden it headed north and didn’t “play” anymore.  It just disappeared about three seconds later.  It was there and then it just wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and my son touched my arm and said “look” and pointed to the sky on the other side of town and I could see a jet climbing at an unusually rapid and straight up motion, heading in the basic direction where the craft was.  We commented on the idea that it could be headed towards the craft and headed inside.  On the way in we noticed that from another point in the sky from the southeast, (the first coming from the northeastern direction) there was another jet headed in what appeared to be straight up just like the first. In the direction of the craft in the sky.  That was the last thing we/I saw and then we came in the apartment and sat down to report it.<n>

I then noticed a very small white, flashing object.  It kept changing colors (to orange, yellow) and occasionally disappearing into the sky.  It was being followed by another one.  They were both moving to the left. Suddenly, they both stopped.  After about a minute, one of them took off to the right, and the other followed.  They both disappeared after a while..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
5/11/13 00:00|Steamboat Springs|CO|Fireball|50+ minutes|Orange orbs in northwestern Colorado/Steamboat Springs sky.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97692.html|373|ndxe201305| Orange orbs in northwestern Colorado/Steamboat Springs sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overview: At almost exactly midnight, myself and three others witnessed several bright orange (about the intensity of Venus), flickering/pulsating orbs starting around the west/northwest horizon, and moved to ~45-60 degrees (deg.) in the western sky, then to the south at altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Detail: The first orb was seen at just after 12am, starting at the horizon to the west. It was very bright orange that seemed to flicker instead of strobe or blink. As it moved higher in the sky (~20 deg. elevation), a second orb that looked exactly the same started from the same area on the horizon, and followed the first. Then after about one minute of flight the second orb changed direction, and circled below the first orb (with several degrees of separation in the sky between the two).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the first orb moved to ~45 deg. in the sky, it started to move south, then  it faded away (darkened) until it was not observable. The total time it took from start to finish was between 2-3 minutes. As the first orb disappeared, the second was still visible between 20-30 deg. in the sky, and then it faded out ~1 minute after the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first two disappeared, ~2 minutes later a third started from the about same location on the horizon, and had a flight path similar to the first. It moved almost straight up to ~45 deg. elevation, then veered south, and faded out after ~2-3 minutes at ~60 deg. elevation in the west-southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only time there was more than one orb in the sky were the first two; after that they only appeared one at a time, with ~6 minutes total from the start of one to the other (~3 minutes of visible flight, then ~3 minutes until the next one started)  Conclusion: We witnessed several more (at least 10 total) over the span of ~50 minutes, starting from around the same location on the horizon, then move in a similar flight pattern to the first and third orbs. After they stopped we went inside, so there could have been more later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although they weren&#39;t in any discernible formation, they did all fly approximately the same flight pattern and had approx. the same start/finish position. It was hard to get any reference to altitude, speed, or distance against the dark sky; but I would guess they were flying anywhere from 1000-2000 feet above the ground. They didn&#39;t make any erratic movements, no sound, and their speed seemed fairly slow to moderate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were aircraft in the area at the time; but they were most likely just commercial/small aircraft that weren&#39;t involved with the sightings (they didn&#39;t seem to be following/intercepting them). Although, they did give a good reference as the lights on the aircraft were 100% different then the orbs. We also could hear the aircraft but not the orbs, and the orbs seemed to move slower across the sky compared to the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Extra details: From our position we couldn&#39;t directly see the horizon as the buildings/trees were obscuring it; so I can&#39;t 100% know if they started in mid-air or from the ground. This to me is the biggest factor, as if they started from below the horizon the there&#39;s a 90% probability they were something man-made i.e. Chinese/sky lanterns. But from where we observed them it seemed they started either right at or just above the horizon, making them harder to I.D.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do have a military background (U.S. Navy 2000-2004) with an honorable discharge. I have also studied military equipment/aircraft throughout the years, and these did not act or look like any kind of aircraft or other manned object. The other three witnesses (my co-workers) are credible with good work ethics. One is even a skeptic that was trying to explain them as aircraft lights, but I&#39;m 99% sure they weren&#39;t manned aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen a UFO while in the service in 2003, but it had different characteristics than these.<n>

I was a teenage boy at the time. I was watching adults hanging around outside the bar and chatting with a friend. A light was moving from left to right slowly across the horizon. It never looked like it was very high in the sky. It looked to be very far away. The object was changing colors. Red, white, blue, red, white, blue, in smooth transition, color changed ever five seconds or so. No blinking or flashing. It appeared to be one light. As the object got in a 1:00 position it started getting closer and closer at a very high rate of speed. Faster than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen. When it got to be about half way between me and it&#39;s original position the light got bigger. When it was about 300 yards in front of me the single orb split creating three yellow/gold glowing ovals that were layed horizontaly and stacked in a triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O O     O<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew over the bar in front of us and then over our heads what looked to be no more than 60 yards above our heads.  The orbs didn&#39;t seem to emit light like the headlight from a car.  The light seemed  &amp;quot;contained&amp;quot;. It made absolutely no sound. I could not see a center to the object.  It looked to be one object the way the lights moved in formation but I can&#39;t be certain.  It looked like the lights took up about the same space as a full size van...maybe a bit bigger.  My friend and I looked at each other and our mouths dropped because we both had no idea what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  PD))<n>
5/10/13 21:40|St. George (northwest of)|UT|Disk||Colorfully lit UFO followed my vehicle close to the ground  for who knows how long east of Area 51 in Southern Utah late 5-13-2013.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97678.html|377|ndxe201305| Colorfully lit UFO followed my vehicle close to the ground  for who knows how long east of Area 51 in Southern Utah late 5-13-2013<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, First things First, This is not my First encounter.  I am writing this because just as I thought I had figured which of the space craft were real and which of them were sensationalized on television I came across yet another.  My closer and First experience was in 1994. Those three were very different than this one.  I had a very different feeling come over myself as did my girlfriend that witnessed them with me in 1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night while wondering for hours, Northwest of Southern Utah&#39;s city of St George to the east of Gunlock Reservoir I was driving looking for a Father and Son&#39;s camp out with my First Grade son.  He had been frightened of the somewhat steep angled grade and being out in the middle of nowhere following the somewhat groomed dirt roads. I offered him a pillow from the back seat and he fell asleep.  I stopped the vehicle upon seeing a sign facing the other direction. I was worried I was going to forget the several small forks in the road that! I had passed and get more lost without bearing of how to get back to the St George area. I was determined to find where there camp was despite the late hour and the directions being rough at best.  My son was extremely sad that we had not yet found it before falling asleep which of course made me ever more devoted to using the necessary gas that I had earlier felt prompted to fill up with while back in town.  When I stopped the vehicle to get out and look at the sign on my left view-able from the opposite direction In the corner of my eye I saw bright lights shining in what seemed to be almost a kaleidoscope of colors.  Quickly it devoured my complete attention.  It slowly moved out from behind the ridge I had recently driven and appeared to be following the same single lane dirt road I had been traveling for quite some time.  At very first in the corner of my eye I saw definite blue and red colors thinking of police but was amazed to see the craft shining a wide range of color! s as it sat hovering there in mid air.  It dawned on me it seem! ed to ha ve been following me. I watched it for a short while not sure as to what my best move would be and thinking back on the  Three much closer crafts I had seen within rock throwing distance on the beach in Northern Oregon in 1994 at Battery Russell.  That was an even more incredible experience that took place with my High School sweetheart. In defense mode I went and grabbed my 40 cal that was loaded with Pest Shot and switched the magazine to hollow points self defense rounds. I quickly closed the back door and walking around to the drivers side again looking back over to where it was and wondering if I dare to keep going to what seemed like a small dead end camp site in the middle of no man&#39;s land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Realizing I had no cell phone reception, my son to protect, and no one likely within miles, I jumped into the truck and used the backward fork in the road to turn the truck around. I was nearly to Menganese springs as the distance I had traveled had been extensive and took quite some! time.  I believe it was close to Cole Springs as well.  When I hurried around to the Drivers side of the Vehicle I wondered how long it had been following me.  Though it made no noise and stayed at about a 1/3 to 1/2 mile distance just hovering I started to run different possibilities and potential outcomes through my mind. I would rather confront or make known my acknowledgement of it&#39;s presence than to be surprised in the middle of the night in a tent put up by headlights of my vehicle.  I could not find a flashlight before heading out and was pretty committed to making our own camp site at Manganese Springs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if things had not been startling enough on my somewhat quick drive back to the ledge where the road veered around an outcropping somewhat high formation of rocks I drew closer to the spot where I had seen it and shut off my lights as I got closer to the location.  Even with my lights off I could see enough to stay on the road with some amber light from the 2013 New Ve! hicle I was driving and was astonished when I saw two glowing ! dots and what appeared to be a bipedal in the middle of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly turned my headlights on only to find a large black cow starring me down like deer in headlights. Part of the reason I think I was driving for hours was the fact that I had to drive through an Indian Reservation to get to the general area where the camp out was supposed to be held. Convinced the craft was gone I thought to myself I could not venture out to satisfy my curiosity with my son with me. The curiosity from my first experience had never left me and I was once again amazed to find this single craft to be very different in appearance than my first sightings of three glowing white saucers from the beach where I failed to notice the closed at dusk sign while driving onto the beach for a small fire to make smores. That location was not far from the Peter Iredale Wreckage at Fort Steven&#39;s State Park on the Oregon coast. I drove for what felt to be hours trying to get out of the abyss of the &#34;moonlight! -void&#34; desert finding more cows in the middle of the road that I strategically dodged on my drive back to civilization. I haven&#39;t slept well of course and it happened just Friday night now being Saturday night. I stayed up late with my wife and earlier in the day she had described to me what she and her family had seen about 13 or 14 years back in Southern California. Strangely enough I believe the craft that she saw in broad daylight sounded to be very similar to the one that I saw last night. I am writing  this because I can&#39;t get over the different feelings I had that quickly followed the two different sightings I experienced. Crazy to think most people might go there entire lives and never see anything like this. Interestingly enough I was recently talking to a new friend of mine about his experience recovering an unauthorized plane that was forced to the ground by fighter jets in area 51. After pulling into my neighborhood I received a call from an unauthorized nu! mber only to find out it was the sheriff and they were getting! ready t o send out search and rescue as my phone had died before I could finish the conversation with my wife around the Indian Reservation on my trip out there. After taking some flack from my loving wife I jumped on the internet after making it home. I was a bit surprised to see that I was just east of what my friend called the HUGE airport in the middle of nowhere. I&#39;m not sure what if anything is gained by this information but I would be curious as to with whom and where it is shared. I could never deny even the first experience let alone last nights amazing adventure and if anything feel more aware by it&#39;s occurrence. After inviting an old friend over to a party I held a few years back that hypnotized my wife and her friend in front of about 12 other friends, I have been curious as to what else if anything may have taken place. Part of me would rather leave it alone but I am not one to give up the search for answers. Just for the record, I have NEVER drunken alcohol or used dru! gs in my life. I was not raised in Utah but do like the sober God Fearing people where I now live. Feel Free to share this with whom ever it may help. I took video on the dark dirt road in hopes to catch anything I pulled up on. Looking back I feel a bit ridiculous for chasing after it. I would love to see and learn more about them. Only time will tell. I don&#39;t know if time lapsed I just know the it took several hours on my search for the camp out only to find scary cows and and a colorful UFO.<n>

It was a perfect triangle shape with lights at the points that were not blinking and 3 lights in about halfway from the flat sides to the middle that were flashing.  It turned from flat to its side pretty fast but at a slow speed.

My wife was driving and I was in the passenger’s seat.  I first told her, “Hey, there’s a UFO in the sky!” and she said “Where?” and I said, “over there, on my side.”  She tried to look but couldn’t see because of her angle and because she was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly had the presence of mind to take out my camera phone and snap a picture of the object although I did not have time to zoom in; I was more concerned about capturing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photo was taken while the car was in motion so I was concerned that I hadn’t caught it on camera but when we arrived at the restaurant drive-through lane, I checked to see if I had caught it.  At first, I could not see anything but once I zoomed in and enlarged the photo in the screen, I saw it!  I showed it to my wife who was skeptical, stating, “It’s probably a bird”.  But, upon further inspection, I also caught a seagull flying through the air (very common here in Corpus Christi, TX).<n> <n><n> <n><n> And when I compared the two it was larger than the seagull and much darker.  What caught my attention initially was that it appeared to me to be a round piece of metal floating in the sky.  It was not traveling, had no wings to flap or fly with, so I knew it was not a bird or a plane, again, it was stationary, not moving at all, not even bobbing and weaving in place just completely stationary which made me think it couldn’t be a jet either because you would definitely notice distance in t! he sky covered if a bird, plane, or jet.  This object had no noticeable lights as this was in the afternoon with slight overcast skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not going to report it initially, but then decided to, after a woman in CA caught a similar looking UFO in a photograph within a week or two of mine.  I do not have photo enhancing technology on my computer but I can zoom in and can tell it is not a seagull when I compare it with the seagull in the pic.  This had no wings, no motion, and no movement that I was able to witness.  I was able to keep an eye on it for about ten seconds before snapping the picture, this whole time it was absolutely still.  If you can enhance the photo object please let me know, I would appreciate it very much. Thank you.<n>

I couldnt tell the altitude or distance from my position.  For a brief time I thought I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying close to the objects.  The aircraft had standard navigation lights and flew near the objects for about two minutes after which it flew away towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects moved very slowly in concert with one another then they moved apart. One of the objects then flickered and appeared to float downwards.  The other object flickered about 1 minute later then it moved towards the west before what appeared to be a flameout.  In all, I watched the scenario for  about  7 or 8 minutes.<n>

This is the second time this has happened to me. It started a few months ago with this circular red glowing circle that just sits above the orange tree line. This one object stayed for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed that one as, probably a star.  But know I&#39;m not so sure about anything anymore.  Last night around 9:38 again appeared the red/orange glowing light.  So of course I&#39;m curious and watch because it&#39;s moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then there were 2,and then another light somehow fell out of the second on and the red lights just stayed in there position for awhile,then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I&#39;m freaking out..I keep watching nothing happens again for 8-9 mins.then oh yeah MORE..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to count them but I was trying to get my phone to take a pic and I couldn&#39;t get it.  Then all the sudden there is 6-9 and then they start literally getting so bright that it made the sky light up..  And more happened after that but no one will probably believe me..<n>

I just happen to look straight up at my 12 o&#39;clock position and caught a triangle going in a slight north northeast position, coming from slight south southwest.  Totally silent, hard to say what altitude was at least 30,000 feet had to be larger than passenger plane. Had red lights on all 3 corners, running at a level flight.  My son caught the tail-end of the sighting after I pointed out to him, seeing the rear 2 red lights.  I found this website to see if there was any other reports in my area.  Saw the report on 4/01/13 in Brookston,IN.  Identical description and direction...went onto MapQuest you could draw a straight line in slight north northeast direction to Mishawaka IN. approx. 100 miles.  Went to internet to calculate air speed of triangle... using 30,000 ft. time covering horizon in 5 seconds at least 900 mph.<n>

Suddenly a loosely oval-shaped mass, consisting of 30 to 40 glowing white dots, appear in the Northwest sky, moving at rapid speed.  It was moving faster than a plane or birds could have flown.  I said to my friend, “what is that?” and she observed the same thing I did.  The mass kept undulating and moving rapidly across the sky.  Suddenly it changed shape into a straight-line formation, continuing due east.  The line formation lasted a few seconds and then, just as suddenly, it returned to the loosely oval-shaped mass.  Thirty seconds later, the mass disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither one of us had been drinking or was intoxicated in any way or form, as both of us rarely drink.

I saw one white light being followed closely behind by what to me looked like an aircraft with a blinking red light.  Further behind the two ufos was another white light moving in the same direction as the other two.  They were all three headed from NE to SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects moved a little further away the two white lights slowly faded out and dissappeared while the red flashing light remained on and continued on the same path.  The lights didn&#39;t fade because of distance but just faded out.  This is the third time I have seen this same occurrence.<n>

There was a wide band of little round clouds drifting to the east.  My wife say&#39;s, look at that bright thing up there, it&#39;s moving!!  I said, no honey,the clouds are moving, not that, It&#39;s a star.  I told her to hold up her finger with the star at her fingertip, and she&#39;d see that it was stationary and the moving clouds made it to appear to be moving.  It was Arcturus. I was facing due south, and looked just about straight up and saw, in between the clouds, a small cluster of real dim red lights.  They were not round, but like two small, red, dimly lit bars at each point of a triangle!!  I casually said, they must be heading to the Middle East. My first thought was that they were a formation of military jets.  From the tip of NE Lower Michigan, flying north, it&#39;s a long way&#39;s to anywhere!!  Then it registered in my head!  The lights were to close together to be a formation of j! ets!!  There was no sound.  The lights were not blinking.  If you held up a quarter at arms length,that was about the size of the spacing of the lights.  Maybe just a bit bigger than a quarter.  I didn&#39;t see any solid outline.  May have been three things!  I saw the lights for about four or five seconds before the clouds drifted over, blocking my view.  I turned around and was now scanning up and to the north for the lights to appear between the little puff ball type clouds.  I assumed that&#39;s the way the thing or things were heading.  My wife was to my left, kind of behind me, and exclaimed, Look!!  She pointed to the NE, and I turned to see a solid, white light, below the little clouds, heading to the SE.  At the same time she shouted, I heard and saw two jets at about 75 or 80 degrees, heading north, start into hard right banking turn!!!  The clouds were broken enough for me to see them.  Now, take your hand,raise your arm to about 75 or 80 degrees, point it to the NE and turn your arm! smoothly to the SE.  Now count to 5 as your turning.  That&#39;s ho! w long i t took for that solid white light to go out of sight to the SE. Before those jets completed their turn, that thing was gone!!!  They were in hot pursuit!!  I ran in the house and called the local TV station!  I asked if anyone else had called in to report any lights or unusual stuff, and he said no, but would call me back if any other reports came in.  The next morning, May 9th, the call in talk shows were swamped with calls about some lights, fireballs, and things.  I didn&#39;t get up and it never dawned on me to listen the next morning to all the excitement going on!!  My brother called me and asked if I had heard the talk shows that morning.  I said no, as I was up real late from the experience my wife and I had.  I called the talk show three weeks ago to ask if they kept the recordings of their shows. I didn&#39;t go into much detail, but said I saw some crazy stuff on May 8th, and wondered if they had saved the tapes.  He said sometimes but only for special or memorable stuff.  I turned on the station and listened as they discussed, and their news guy or someone remembered the calls from that show.  They said they were just helicopters doing training, and then one guy said I saw one of those new, big bombers!  Well guess what?  On Oct 2,2013,  My wife and I, and a friend I called, because I was so excited, watched one of those big,just a wing, bombers, fly by our house three times!!! In broad daylight!!!  One of the coolest things I ever saw!  It had a blinking light.  I&#39;ll take a lie detector test for all I&#39;ve said here.  Thank You<n>

We saw two amber lights appear over the roof – one, then the other.  Each amber light “burned out” and suddenly there were 6-8 tiny silver lights that then moved away quickly from the location of the amber lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved out in all different directions, but went in pairs.  The pairs stayed relatively close together, but did not follow a specific formation.  The tiny silver lights moved VERY quickly across the sky – much more quickly than conventional aircraft, and with no noise.   The silver lights blinked rapidly. The lights moved out of our range of vision after approximately 5 minutes.  We watched the pairs as long as we could.  We did see 3 different airplanes in the sky and were able to judge the speed against the conventional crafts.  It did not appear the airplanes were chasing the lights, however, one craft was near the path of one pair of the silver lights and seemed to be on a similar flight path.<n>

It was something unnatural, not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out with my dog on a leash to wait for my boyfriend in  his driveway, which is relatively long.   We live in an area of rattlesnakes, so I did not want to venture into the area of the driveway that was not illuminated by the yard lights.   At the end of the driveway, I saw I could only make out was a person wearing a white shirt, yet this “person” lacked 3d perspective.  It was sort of a flat presence, sort of like a big plastic bag being flung into the air and blowing in the wind, yet it was not moving, it was still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still could not figure out what this was.  Happened very quickly – maybe a one-minute time span.  My dog also alerted, and he was also aware there was something at the end of the driveway.  Well, whatever it was appeared to sort of bend over and though I could see now eyes or anything, I got the distinct impression that it was at that time this object became aware of me.  There was no mistaken that it had “seen” me, perceived me, it knew of my presence.   Again, not through any senses that such as we have here on earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am getting chills just retelling it, it was so eerie.  I was moving a bit closer and sort of trying to adjust my eyes to focus, when all of a sudden, it jetted off.  I use the term “jetted” because that is what it did.  From a standstill position to what seemed the speed of a car racing by at 100 mph.  It was gone, across the street and into the brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my boyfriend got home, I explained to him what I had seen. Well, he offered explanations, but none was satisfactory as I experienced it and I felt in my core it was something unnatural.  Well, unnatural to this earth.  Since last night, I have been second-guessing myself, but the point remains, I saw what I saw.  It is the nature of whatever beast this is to make you thing you were being delusional, imagining things, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, do you have any insight into what this could have been and perhaps tell me if other people have had similar experiences?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

It was somewhat egg-shaped, but with two protrusions on either side (engines?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound from it, but it did appear to be at fairly high altitude.  It moved slowly and steadily with no changes in direction, passing directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting note is that there appeared to be some sort of energy field around it, with pinkish waves of energy emanating in a circular pattern from the craft.  I was the only witness. I am a 20 year-old male working at a software company in Boulder, no history of mental illness or hallucinations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen odd phenomena in the sky before, but this was the first instance which I have been unable to explain conventionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am emailing a rough sketch of the object&#39;s shape along with this report.<n>

The object, around 1:41 AM just took off from a stand still and proceeded North, so I tried to grab my digital camera and video it as it went from the South side of my house to the North side but it was to no avail, as I don&#39;t have a great zoom on it, and it proceeded Northbound out of me sight.  But, I know what I saw and it was not normal.  I am not saying it was alien, but it was a UFO.<n>

It floated slowly and never changed color nor shape.  There were no sparks and it left no trails.  It looked like a fire ball. It had to be massive because it was very high up but looked quite large to me.  It floated horizontally in a perfectly straight line towards Hwy M and then just disappeared. .<n>

First, one extremely large white/blueish circle, or sphere appx 500yrds in dia followed by two more circle/spheres about a quarter the size of the first.  One obviously behind the first and low, almost to the bottom edge of the first, and the other in a similar postion in front of the original circle/sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surface of the circle/spheres was almost electrical.  They seemed almost uniformly bright but washed out white.  The electrical texture was not moving as electricty would, not moving at all.  The size was easy to determine by the position. They were before the mountains, the Sierrita Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They sat between Hilltop Road and some where over or beyond the Three-points fire station.  The light from them did not affect the surroundings, as if not emitting light - but incredibly bright and uniform themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first simply appeared, not there, then there.  The other two smaller objects appeared in a similar fashion.  They stayed there for about 15 minutes.  I was to scared to tell anyone. I was driving a small scooter at the time, no cell phone, no camera.  I drove back to Fullerton Road with these things to the right of me.  As I turned onto Fullerton, they vanished instantly as they had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car drove up at the intersection and saw me standing beside my scooter and asked if I was okay.  I said yes, wondering if they had seen it too.  I was too scared to say anything else.  They stayed for a few minutes, lending to my curiosity as to whether they did see it, and were to scared to mention it as well. I went home shaken, grabbed a camera, and accidently clicked it.  The flash was on, and it must have attracted the attention of a neighbor in that direction who must have thought I was spying on them, as they flashed a camera back towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside, and let the incident go.  I am writing this nearly a year later, before I forget any of the details.  I&#39;m still surprised that such an incredbly gargantuan object didn&#39;t create more of a stir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It looked unusual so I pulled over and we started watching it.  It was a football shaped bright metal object that was moving across the sky.  It was not leaving anykind of smoke or any kind of trail behind it.  We saw it for about 2 minutes when it suddenly just vanished.  It was a CLEAR blue sky when no clouds.  We saw nothing fall out of the sky and we sat for at least 2 more minutes looking to see if it would show up again.  It was a very exciting moment.  We would both thrilled to have seen it!!!!<n>

I was taking updated pics of our 1913 barn, about 2-2:30 in the after noon.  I was looking back and forth on my LCD screen and the shot I wanted.  I waited a bit cause when I walked on the dry grass a grasshopper and butterfly came from it, I waited till I saw the butterfly move off to the right and land on a tall weed.  Then, I took the pic, and continued walking towards the barn taking two more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reviewed the pics on my camera, but didn&#39;t notice anything unusual, until I loaded it to my folder.  Wondering what it was I zoomed in once, surprised by what it may have been I zoomed in again, and there is where I clearly saw it was not an airplane, even though I never heard any sounds of an aircraft, I only assumed it was a bird or aircraft before I cropped it.  I was informed there was no military exercise performed within the area that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also learned there was only one other sighting reported in Santee, same month, but different day.   barn is haunted, would this UFO have anything to do with it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and we suspect that the object is either a bird in flight, with its wings folded, or possibly a winged insect.

The window shades are wide opened because I like waking up to sunlight.  From my peripheral, I notice lights moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turn to look at it and thought it was just a plane. It was brightly flashing white, blue and red lights so maybe the police.  Even that would be a first because I&#39;ve never seen a police helicopter at night in the area of SF I live in.  But then after watching it for literally a second or two the lights just vanish.  I wait and nothing.  Looked at where it is suppose to be based on how fast it was moving but I didnt see it again. I know how planes would usually have flashing lights too but I have  never seen any simply disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s a fairly cloudy night and I would&#39;ve seen the intensity of the lights diminish if it went further away or behind clouds.  My skin was covered in goosebumps when it was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what I saw but I ! saw it.<n>

When I looked up I saw a white light, with no flashes nor other colour lights, heading NNW.  It was unusual for two reasons: one of which I&#39;ve already mentioned (the single white light on the rear of the craft) plus the speed it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It cleared my entire horizon in about 6 seconds, which is fast.  I&#39;m accustomed to seeing and hearing aircraft, both plane &amp; helicopter, as I live breath a busy flight path, but this was different.  I&#39;ve never seen an object, at night with only one rear white light.  I use the word &#39;white&#39; but it could&#39;ve been another colour affected by the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m simply reporting what I believe to be the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

It was spherical in shape and orange in hue.  The object appeared to flash brighter and get very dim until it disappeared.  It was moving in a straightforward advance with no abnormal movement.  At its brightest it could only compare to a raging fire or almost an explosion although there were no clear thrusters or anything that could indicate it was being propelled by this explosive ball in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of the incident was all but two minutes, but as soon as I saw it I called to my girlfriend in the window and she came out to view it as well.  When she came outside that is when the object appeared to get brighter again, then it moved faster as the light just burned out into nothing.  The object did not appear again and we could not see it in the sky in any form any longer.  Also of note, as with any other aircraft I always hear a sound, this object made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me this is my second UFO encounter in the last month and a half.  The first object, although the date escapes me, I saw was bulbous and lightless craft with no sound no wings and what appeared to be windows or possibly lights that were not on.  I have seen many aircraft living in close proximity to an airport and both of these encounters are completely unlike anything I have ever seen before.<n>

I noticed movement from the east; a pin point of light moving quickly across the sky that I believed was a satellite until I noticed it was trailed by three more pin points of light in a perfect V formation that never wavered, changed distance, sped up, or slowed down.   We had cloud cover this morning, so I lost them after about 10 seconds when they flew over the clouds in the western sky (judging the cloud height is how I perceived initially that they were as high as a satellite, along with the speed and consistency).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the impression of a formation of crafts as opposed to it being one craft or even two with one being the small lead craft and the second consisting of a triangle shaped craft.  If either of these were the case, it would have been enormous in scale.  If they were single crafts, the distance between them would have been vast – enough to see inconsistencies in either speed or distance between the crafts.  I have just never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between the “lead” light and the “top” of the triangle was exactly (or appeared to me to be) the same distance from the “top” of the triangle to the bottom left and bottom right corners, as illustrated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .	 		.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Director level professional business woman in her mid-forties.

I turned North on Hastings at the same time a caucasian male jogger was looking into the sky at the same thing I was seeing....so I know at least one other person witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a larger aircraft on final approach to runway 35 at Sundance Airpark, but then I realized it was not on approach, it was hovering and flashing red, white (maybe white spot lights).  While stopped at Surrey Hills Blvd and Hastings, the craft was hovering about 500ft or closer off the ground and about 900 feet to the Southwest, emitting no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later realized, on a subsequent trip to the area, that it was hovering over the LDS Church, which has a brightly illuminated steeple with a gold horn blower figure at its peak.  I believe that the extremely bright upward shining steeple lighting is what illuminated the craft enough so that I could see its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought to try to get video from my phone.  I turned Southwesterly on Surrey Hills Blvd and ! started the video....the craft seemed to detect what I was doing and it proceeded Southwesterly as I trailed it at approx 25-30 mph.  Note that prior to pursuing the craft, I rolled down my driver side window and faintly heard what sounded like what a &#34;thruster&#34; might sound like on the shuttle in space (an air propellant sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, I could swear that I started the camera sooner, when I was closer to the craft, but as it is, I only have a view of what it looked like pulling away from me. I thought it may be a &#34;lighter than air&#34; craft out of Sundance Airpark, located appx 2 miles Northeasterly, however I do not believe LTA crafts can operate at night.  Even if they can fly at night, I&#39;m pretty sure no aircraft can have red lights at the very tail end (flashing and in a triangular pattern).  FAA requires aircraft light markers to be white strobe at the rear and red and green static lights (port and starboard) on the wing tips or furthest protruding point on an aircraft, even helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was close enough at the beginning that I could see that it was much longer than its width, thick like a clay brick, slightly narrower in the middle like a dumb bell but not as thin as a regular dumb bell at the hand grip section; corners appeared to be at 45 degree angles, looked like it was over 200ft long and several stories high with no apparent windows that I could see over the bright lights on the belly; which were at least 6 red and 4 bright white static, flashing and strobing lights, and three slowly flashing red lights at the tail in triangular shape (one at top, two at bottom).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to the video, the belly lights were flashing in a random pattern, almost as if it was a light show; it was more likely photographing the steeple, in my opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it Southwesterly for .85 miles while attempting to video tape it; difficult due to twists in the road, shifting gears and losing the craft in the trees.  I have sketched a diagram of the craft which I can provide upon request.<n>

Thirty seconds later we hear what did sound like an aircraft.Seen through a break in the clouds this aircraft was moving fast yet not nearly as fast as the lights we saw first.  The aircraft we saw had the normal aircraft lights and around 10 extra lights that were puzzling to me.  Both craft disappeared over the north horizon.<n>

I then noticed a spherical object following the less brighter object it was powering up and down as it was following the other object, they were both moving from East to West.  I estimate they were pretty high up mile wise because where my job is at in North Auburn you can see all the plane&#39;s coming in on their flight path to Sea Tac airport. While I watched these two object&#39;s they faded in and out a couple of times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved from East to West I saw the front sphere move in a horizontal direction move toward the ground very quickly then shoot straight up back up just as fast as it disappeared out of sight the brighter sphere was still moving towards the East still pulsing then just faded out.  I stood there for a min! ute and was going to go back inside when I noticed another bright sphere coming from the South this one moved a bit faster than the other two objects.  This new object moved from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i watched this next sphere it pulsed also as it moved across the sky it faded in and out just like the other two. This new sphere grew really bright as it headed North then there was large flash and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time you could see aircraft coming in for landing at Sea Tac airport.

Four of them in a square (two vertically on top of two others) and then one floating below. They did not seem to be moving fast but they seem to move out of the square formation and were moving east slowly.  They really looked like Chinese lanterns but I have never seen anyone release one of those off of our coast before.  The thing that was so odd was how vivid their orange glowing characteristics were when compared to an airplane that was nearby.  There is also an international airport within a couple miles, however, these orbs were not any plane that we have ever seen before.  Anyhow, eventually we drove beyond a tree line where we could not see them anymore but they got really small as the seemed to be heading east.  Wondering if anyone in the area saw this as well and have a clue as to what it could be?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After a couple of seconds two more orange circles became to view.  What was very strange was that the first two objects were traveling very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the lights appeared to be two to three times larger and more intense than the airplanes we normally see in the area.  We know that the planes have colored blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four flying objects had solid orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects disappeared in minutes after they started moving towards the South.<n>

This is  first experience with a flying aircraft that I personally have not been able to logially explain to some degree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been fascinated with aircraft ever since i was a young boy, and even joined local air cadets as a teen, the drive for flight and knowledge was so great.  So for me to see something so aerodynamically unsteady flying s! o smoothly at such a low speed, has me flabergasted(blown away with disbelief).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunaly we are parents of young children and had no possibility or chance to follow it as our children were sound asleep inside our house no more then five feet from where we were watching the event unfold.<n>

It appeared to be maneuvering intelligently, and was very low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and filmed it for a little on my iphone, but was discouraged at the inability to zoom in on the object while filming.  Perhaps enhancement of the cell phone video will help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared North East in the sky, and appeared to be making it&#39;s way higher into the low hanging clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I parked my car I was hoping to have the people I live with come out and see the object as well.

It was a clear night with a handful of constellations clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking up at the stars I noticed what appeared to be a light, similar in size and brightness to a star moving across the sky.  It travelled at a speed faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, yet slower than a shooting star.  I alerted my two friends to what I was seeing and they two witnessed this light moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this light for approximately 10 seconds and assumed it was a satellite, or perhaps some sort of comet.  However, the light then made a sharp right turn, while maintaining its velocity.  In my estimation it turned approximately 80 degrees to the right in a matter of seconds.  The arc of the objects turn resembled the curving angle of a hockey stick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 seconds after making its turn the object disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we witnessed left no visible trail and appeared to be out of the atmosphere.

They were in a line formation hovering (or moving slowly east) about the distance of a small plane above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I headed east and went to my destination; upon returning 5-10 minutes later to my neighborhood.  I noticed the same fireballs (fewer) in a V formation a little north of my first sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had called my husband upon the first sighting and told him to look in our backyard.  He saw two that disappeared quickly upon his gaze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home and picked him up.  We saw 2 in the western sky over a neighborhood directly west of us.

We thought it was a helicopter floodlight or maybe searchlight since we live right on the coast.  But it didn&#39;t look like the same color as the normal U.S. Coast Guard helicopter searchlights that we see from time to time here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I stood up at the same time to walk out to get a better look, and we could see that there were five of these &#34;lights&#34; floating by in formation.  They looked like &#34;fireballs&#34; and they were flying not directly over us, but close enough to get a good long look.  They were flying at about the same altitude as helicopters or other aircraft might fly at, and flew faster than something just drifting by, like a balloon or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not make any sudden changes in flight pattern, they just went silently past us and headed southwest out over the Pacific Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just stood there in amazement and wondered what we were seeing, while trying to capture with our cell phone camera.  We did manage to get around 10 seconds of these strange lights pretty good.  On the recording, it looks part fireball and part weird lights.  Very unusual!<n>

5/4/13 21:05|Ft. Myers Beach|FL|Sphere|15 minutes|15 orange lights observed traveling near Ft. Myers Beach, Fl.|4/17/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/118/S118454.html|470|ndxe201305| 15 orange lights observed traveling near Ft. Myers Beach, Fl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Friday, May 4th at approx. 9:05 P.M. Gf and I were walking north on Ft. Myers Beach, FL.  There were no other persons present.  We both observed at approximately the same time orange lights on the horizon.  We were near the Neptune Inn when we saw the first lights.  We observed them approaching.  They were approaching from a North-northwest direction.  They were bright orange, like a street lamp one would see from a distance of a mile away or so.  We saw three at first. I thought they may have been several planes on approach to Regional Southwest Airport (RSW), as we had seen several commercial jets fly over us on the way to landing at RSW. The lights were not in a line, but they were flying in a South-southeast direction approaching. They varied in height between themselves by 500 - 1000 feet between the 3 of them as they approached. Standing on the beach they appeared to be on the horizon just to the left of the last light on a building on the beach, an! d moving towards us from the North-northwest. The light would have been between St. James City, on Pine Island and Pelican/Cape Coral cities. Traveling over the Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge which is several miles to our North-northwest. I am guessing, but they appeared to be traveling several hundred miles per hour. I had observed several jets inbound to South West Florida Airport earlier in the evening as they were making their final approach, pass over where I was at. Those jets travel at 200 mph on approach? These objects were moving at least 2-3X faster than the inbound jets were. The three traveled towards us, but not directly at us. On their current path of travel they would pass us out over the ocean on our left. As they neared the north end of Ft. Myers Beach island, the objects appeared to change direction. The objects turned in a southwesterly direction. The objects were flying well above the clouds. Perhaps at 2,500-4,000 feet. I am guessing the clouds ! were 1,500 feet ? that night. I have looked but cannot find th! at infor mation. Clouds were broken and not very large. We watched the objects as the traveled away and appear to disappear above the clouds. At no time did we observe the lights change to the standard red and white flashing strobe lights indicating a plane. We wondered what we have just seen, when 3 more lights appeared. They traveled in the same previously described manner. However the last light appeared to higher and it turned in a more westerly manner. We watched what appeared a commercial jet flight passing overhead, flying in a west northwesterly direction as we observed these lights The commercial jet appeared to be at 35,000 feet or so. These objects were well below the jet. In the approximate time of 10 minutes, we observed 15 of these orange lights approach in the same way as described, turn and head out over the Gulf of Mexico. Two of the lights traveled in a West-southwest direction. Those two appeared to be higher than the rest as they turned. All of the others traveled! in the south-southwest direction. The lights came in 3, 3 again, then 4, then 2, then 3 again. Just as one group disappeared out over the gulf, more would appear on the horizon. I live 2 miles from a large commercial airport in Illinois. I see and hear jets, and propeller driven commercial and private aircraft everyday and night. I watch them on approach from 10 - 15 miles away. These lights did not appear to be known aircraft. They made no sound. I saw no standard red/white, white strobe lights. I could not really tell shape. Perhaps round. Size ? 30 feet,  I&#39;m guessing on the first light. I got a good look at it before it disappeared over clouds. All of the lights to me had like a halo type effect in appearance.  I guess luminescent would be a good word. I am am guessing its size in comparison to commercial jets that flew over us 1 1/2 hours earlier at a similar height. I tried to take cell phone photos. Only one shows two orange lights. Nothing definitive. I didn&#39;t have! phone set to &#34;night mode&#34;... nuts. I deleted the ph! oto as Y ou couldn&#39;t observe anything of value.  What were they ? I do not know.  I reported this to MUFON almost 2 years ago.  I didn&#39;t know you existed..<n>

We were looking at Saturn and I was pointing to various stars nearby when we saw three bright white lights in a triangular formation that we first thought were stars in a constellation to the right of Spica.  As we watched them, they slowly moved away from us and within 1-2 minutes they disappeared one at a time.  They definitely were not stars and moved too slowly to be satellites.<n>

I turned to look up toward the south end of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 20*deg above average horizon there was an object moving upward at a slight arc from the east.  The object traveled at a speed of approx 2+*deg per/second across the sky towards the west/s.west direction.  This is quite a bit faster than any satellite I would usually see at this hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the object if compared to a satellite (without assuming any equal distance in orbit, but merely by observable perspective) would be like comparing the sharpened tip of a pencil (satellite) with the eraser of a pencil (object) held at arms length.  The shape was of an oval, but lacked a solidly defined edge entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could have been dismissed entirely as a massive satellite ( perhaps the I.S.S. on re-entry?) or even a commercial airliner below 20,000ft.  Instead of completing an arc across the sky, it abruptly changed it&#39;s course ¾ the way and dropped downward, as if it just suddenly fell from the sky (in a very fast &amp; controlled manner).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time this was being witnessed I had this very strange feeling that this object had become very aware that it was being watched, I felt this most intensely just before it fell towards the earth, as if offended by my staring at it.  However, the disturbing part had to be the way it was illuminated (or lack of illumination).  It was a VERY dark orange/pink color. It seemed as if it absorbed it&#39;s light from its surroundings, almost like some kind of parasitic negative image, or maybe like a black-hole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It glowed.... yet, it didn&#39;t.  It&#39;s surface was like a soft dark rubberized orange/pink haze... it glowed like it it was lit by some distant black-light tube.  But I swear it consumed the surrounding light like a vampire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not my first time seeing this phenomena in our town.  This solo one just confirmed the strange cluster formation that left myself and a friend shocked and questioning our existence this last year.  I don&#39;t believe there visiting has any distant benevolence...... none.<n>

The red light, oriented to the South of the craft, would flash first, followed about ¼ second later by the white light.  The red light was flashing about once per second.  The craft at first was moving in a Northward direction, then after a few minutes, it began to move southward. I noted that there was no sound, and the craft seemed very low in the sky, maybe 3,000- 5,000 ft.   I am not a good judge of altitude, but it occurred to me that had it been a plane, it would have been making a landing approach to be that low or close.  Also, had it been a helicopter, I would most definitely have heard the chopping propeller sound since it was so close.  There was never any jet or chopper noise, and I had my window rolled down completely in the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded southward along my route, moving from the Keyport region, into Brownsville/Illahee, I was able to periodically track the motion of the object at certain points where the view to the East allowed.  It continued gliding slowly in both directions (North for a few minutes, then South, always remaining to my East out over the Puget Sound.)  At one point during the sighting, I noticed that it appeared to have changed orientation and I could see three solid bright white/silver lights in a line, (maybe facing toward me, rather than parallel to me.)  I thought that it might be a triangular shape and that the three lights denoted the tips.  The middle light seemed to be a little brighter or larger, maybe due to being closer from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting took place over a period of 20-30 minutes between about 2:45 AM and 3:15 AM. I eventually lost my line of sight due to natural obstructions (a heavily wooded area.)<n>

I looked up into the sky when I got out of my car.  I saw what looked like 5 fire balls hovering in the sky all about the same size then slowly they would disappeared like they were moving further away.  2 disappeared and then 2 more appeared from the horizon leaving a trail and  moving up towards the others and disappeared like all the others then a minute or 2 later more came one after the other until there were no more left in the sky.   They seem to make a humming sound but it&#39;s difficult to say if i imagined that or it was just the city noises.  I did remember thinking that the humming was unusual.   They were orangey-red like a big fireball but not really symmetrical (although its tough for me to say the shape really because I did not have my glasses.)   I took photos with my phone but it didn&#39;t really do what I saw justice, the photos just make it look like regular orange lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it, that’s what I saw.  Did anyone else see this, I’d be very interested?  It was definitely not normal.   Thanks!<n>

We were upstairs getting in to bed, our room was dark, other than the TV and out our window I notice two large round orange spheres coming from the east (Palm Springs), heading directly to us (ocean is 7 miles west of us).  We watched them for approximately 2 minutes – they were staying on a level course with no flashing or blinking lights, just a steady orange glow, and kept the same distance from each other.   Our window was open and we did not hear any motor noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the two spheres approach in the lower night sky, then go out of view over our house.   We ran out to our front yard and continued to watch them both head northwest.  The first one disappeared and soon after the second one dimmed, and then disappeared.<n>

Thinking that it sounded a little like thunder, I thought this strange as it was a beautiful night full of stars and not a cloud in the sky.  I proceeded to go outside to investigate and continued to hear random &amp;quot;booming sounds&amp;quot; which seemed to originate in the distance to the east of me.  They sounded like faint artillery rounds going off (much like in the movie Saving Private Ryan).  It occurred to me that the noises could have been fireworks or thunder but the &amp;quot;booms&amp;quot; just didn&#39;t sound exactly like those noises...hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the internet for fireworks displays in the area but found nothing. It is also unusual for fireworks displays to be put on in this area at such a late time of night and this early in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately 10 or 15 minutes the &amp;quot;booms&amp;quot; stopped.  At 10:23pm, as I continued to look to the east a brilliant white light just appeared out of nowhere to the southeast of my location. It was extremely bright (much like when magnesium burns) and had no color.  I watched it for approximately 15-20 seconds as it slowly but steadily headed from south to north.  There was absolutely no noise coming from this object.  It seemed to be heading toward the direction from where I heard the &amp;quot;boom noises&amp;quot;.   I finally lost sight of it as it went behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path into PHL airport is south of me and I see planes approaching/going all the time with and without their landing lights on.  The light I saw was not like these landing lights as it was extremely bright and didn&#39;t have that yellowish color like what I usually see. It also did not resemble a meteor entering the atmosphere as there was no tail or breaking up of the object as it moved.  Also, it moved in a flat trajectory parallel to the ground and low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what this object was but it definitely was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

5/3/13 21:45|San Tan Valley|AZ|Circle|15-20 minutes|25-30 orange/white balls of light traveling across the evening sky in San Tan Valley, Arizona.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99033.html|491|ndxe201305| 25-30 orange/white balls of light traveling across the evening sky in San Tan Valley, Arizona<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night May 3rd at approximately 21:45 p.m., I was headed Northbound on Gantzel/Ironwood Road in San Tan Valley, Arizona, when I spotted in front of me white/orange glowing ‘balls’ in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that they were a group of hot air balloons that had just taken off.  But realizing that couldn’t be the case due to the ‘glow’ of the objects-my next thought was someone released a bunch of Chinese luminaries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I realized these objects were heading in my direction…at what seemed to be a fairly fast speed-and clearly were neither balloons nor luminaries.  They were coming from a northeasterly direction traveling in a southwesterly direction and I would best describe them as little ‘suns’.  They were orange-ish in color and pulsated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately reached for my cell phone and called my sister to see if she could see these objects.  She is located near 7th street and the 101 freeway, about an hour drive from me.  She could not.  As I was speaking with her and continuing to drive northbound- my excitement increased as I began counting out loud to her how MANY objects there were!   When I reached 28 in number, I could clearly see some of the objects’ light’ beginning to fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point these objects were flying directly over my head.  I told my sister I needed to hang up and roll some video.  I quickly pulled over on the east side of Gantzel/Ironwood in an office complex, just south of the Banner Ironwood Hospital.  I got out of my truck and started recording video from my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was fascinating is that these objects were not in any particular formation…again-the reason I first thought they might be hot air balloons or luminaries-both of which would have had much of the same random/scattered flight pattern as I was witnessing with these objects.  At one point one of the objects appeared to be moving much faster to ‘catch up’ with another object.  Again, something I could not explain away as anything I have ever witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes of recording video-the camera stopped and I was alerted my cell phone was out of data space.  I quickly erased a prior video and began a second recording.  Both recordings lasted several minutes, and as noted in the audio of the recordings-with the naked eye I could faintly see some of these objects still illuminated albeit they seem to disappear from the video.  Also, as they flew over my head one of the objects lights went out…but against the night sky I could still see an object.  It was silver in color and a rectangular shape.  Their altitude was about that of a small plane flying above.  I watched it continue southwesterly until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What adds even greater intrigue into this sighting-is the events that followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got back in my truck and continued northbound on Gantzel/Ironwood Road-obviously excited and wishing to hell I had somebody with me to witness this with me, I couldn’t help but feel SOMEBODY had been able to capture much better video than what I had captured.   There was not a question in my mind this had to be witnessed by dozens if not hundreds of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to call television station ABC 15.  When I spoke to the news desk-nobody had reported any ‘odd’ occurrences, and they suggested I submit my video for review via their website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next call was to the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Amazed- the phone just rang and rang and rang-I hung up and tried it again.  This time after again ringing and ringing-a recording came on and said that my ‘call could not be completed at this time.  Please try again later’.  Of course my first thought is they have been overwhelmed with phone calls and the lines are jammed.  I redialed them again-and again- the phone just rang and rang and rang….<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called another news station, and again, got the same response that no one had reported any ‘odd’ occurrence, and they too gave me information on how to submit my video via their website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I again attempted to call the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Once more, nobody answered the phone.  I then called the Mesa Police Department.  As I was explaining this occurrence-the dispatcher asked in what location this event occurred, and I told her San Tan Valley.  She then stated I would have to report the incident to the proper jurisdictions department-the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  After explaining I had tried numerous times to contact them, she seemed to allude to the fact I miss dialed or had the wrong number.  I told her I had the correct number.  The dispatcher then informed me she would patch me through herself to the P.C.S.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, nobody answered the phone.  I tried several more times with the same outcome. I placed calls until approximately 23:15, and never did anybody answer the phone.  (I am attempting to get a report from the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office on their call logs for that evenings dispatch.  It has proven to be a difficult task.)  At this time I was approaching Guadalupe Road, when  three police units passed by me in the southbound lanes of  Ironwood with full lights and sirens and driving at least 100 mph.  For some reason I couldn’t help but think this was somehow related to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was up early and scanned the television stations for any possible news reports of any ‘UFO’ sighting.  To my surprise-I flipped to ABC 15 just in time to hear them say something about all the sightings on the WEST SIDE (I am on the EAST SIDE) of a possible ‘UFO’.  After returning from a commercial break the reporter explained that these reports were actually people witnessing a ‘solar plane’ that was in the area and that they could head to the stations website to see more footage of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I couldn’t believe it!  Was this a cover up???  Surely dozens…hundreds of people saw this event!  Are ‘they’ really going to explain it away as a solar plane??  In fact, a solar plane might very well have been the culprit to what some people saw.  It is NOT what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In disbelief and to amuse myself, I then went to the television stations website and viewed the ‘solar plane’ that many reported as a ‘UFO”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me clearly state  that what I saw was nothing close to what people might have seen with this ‘solar plane’.  NOTHING CLOSE!!  Since that date I have searched online for any report from that same evening, from anybody that witnessed the same event I did..  I found only one link matching the date of May 3rd 2013-and that was from a person that apparently witnessed this ‘solar plane’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this is not what I witnessed.  I hope you take the time to review my two videos taken from that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FOOTNOTE:  On the drive home the other evening I caught a few minutes of the radio program ‘Coast to Coast AM’.  To my shock they were discussing the numerous reports from across the country of this same type of sighting and prompted people to write in if they had a similar experience themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And so you have my story…and it will be a day I shall never...ever...forget......<n>
5/3/13 21:45|Burlington|WA|Sphere|60-75 seconds|3 brightly lit amber/orange orbs moving S-SE spotted in night sky over Skagit County, WA. by multiple witnesses.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97752.html|492|ndxe201305| 3 brightly lit amber/orange orbs moving S-SE spotted in night sky over Skagit County, WA. by multiple witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, May 3rd, 2013 at approximately 21:45 hrs, while traveling westbound on Hwy-20 between the cities of Sedro Wooley and Burlington in Skagit county, WA, I witnessed three unidentified flying objects traveling south-by-southeast over the east end of Burlington proper.   In addition to myself and my companion - in whose truck we were traveling at the time - the event was witnessed by several other people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 mile west of District Line Rd we looked up and witnessed three large amber/orange orbs overhead at about 15 degrees to the right of our due-west heading on Hwy-20, moving right-to-left on a straight and level course and approaching the roadway about 1/4 mile ahead of us. Rather than appearing as merely radiant &amp;quot;light balls&amp;quot; without definable edges or borders, like one might expect a bare, bright bulb to appear at a distance at night, these objects had an appearance more like that of a translucent sphere, like a ping-pong ball, that was being intensely illuminated from within. While the light emanating from these orbs was indeed bright enough to somewhat obfuscate the object within, they were still recognizable as appearing solid and spheroid. In addition, the intensity of the illumination seemed to slowly, rhythmically, and very briefly dip very slightly, or negatively &amp;quot;pulse,&amp;quot; at a frequency of approximately once every second, though not in sync! with one another. This was not a sharp, sudden dip, but a smooth, analog change, again, very brief. We immediately pulled over to better observe this phenomenon and were quickly joined at the side of the road by several other witnesses who had also pulled to the shoulder and exited their respective vehicles. The objects were moderately large - to scale: about the size of one&#39;s thumbnail when held at arm&#39;s length - and were arranged in a scalene triangular pattern with the two objects that were closest to one another - the span between them approximately equal to the width of three fingers held at arm&#39;s length - leading the group, and the single remaining object trailing at approximately 4-5 that distance behind the first two. All three objects were at approximately 400-500 feet and were moving relatively slowly at about 35-45 kts. The objects maintained their heading, speed, and relative position until they were almost directly over Hwy-20, at which time the trailing orb q! uickly accelerated to a rate of travel roughly 2.5-3 times tha! t of it&#39; s original speed, without changing its heading, until it was approximately the same distance away from each of the two leading orbs that they were apart from one another, and resumed its original speed, pacing its two fellows and forming a rough isosceles triangle. The three objects then continued to travel together, remaining equidistant and still on the same heading, until they were approximately 20-25 degrees to the left of Hwy-20, (or 340-345 degrees to our original, due-west heading) at which time the trailing orb again began to move relative to the two leading objects, this time in a slow arc to the right (westerly), while ascending slightly, in a standard-rate, or &amp;quot;two minute&amp;quot; turn, and at about 45 degrees into this turn began to quickly grow dimmer until at about 60 degrees into the turn, while still moving, it vanished completely. The remaining two &amp;quot;leading&amp;quot; objects continued on for only a moment more - maybe 3-5 seconds - before the westmost orb! began its own apparent standard-rate turn, this time to the left, while maintaining its speed and elevation, which brought it in a swinging arc behind its fellow, until at approximately 50-55 degrees into the turn it again resumed straight and level flight, this time traveling almost exactly due east. It continued on this heading until it was almost due south of our position at the side of the road (or about 270-275 degrees to our original, due-west heading) at which time it also began to quickly dim in intensity until it, too, vanished. The remaining orb, which did not deviate from it&#39;s speed or heading during the entire event, continued on its south-by-southeast track for approximately 5-10 more seconds until it, too, dimmed and vanished, though it seemed to do so at about twice the rate of its fellows. The entire event was about 60-75 seconds in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It bears mentioning at this point that when the latter two orbs dimmed and vanished they were at a position in the sky where, from our vantage, they were moderately back-lit by the &amp;quot;skyglow&amp;quot; illuminating the night sky directly above the city of Mt. Vernon, WA, which at that moment was behind, and in line with, the position of the objects we were viewing. The net effect of this was to provide enough light value contrast to easily silhouette any unilluminated objects of that size, and there was none. The objects seemed to not only dim and cease emanating light, but to in fact disappear altogether. I feel fairly confident in this assessment as several onlookers, including myself, commented that we could clearly see much smaller, finer objects silhouetted, such as the telephone and power cables and small tree limbs in the same viewing field. I would also state at this point that I was in combatant naval aviation for years and have had extensive aircraft and attitude r! ecognition training, and as such I am confident that what I saw was not an aircraft in the traditional sense: There was no evidence of red or green right-of-way lighting, nor was there any anti-collision strobes or navigation lighting visible. There was also no sound whatsoever discernible above the ambient ground traffic noise. Several attempts were made by my companion and others to photograph the objects, albeit with less-than-ideal cell phone cameras, and while other lights and heavenly bodies were evident in the resulting photographs, no one could get a shot of the objects in question. I am not qualified to speculate as to why this was, though it did seem strange that such large and brightly lit targets were not visible to the cameras.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later two fast moving aircraft approached from the southwest at approximately 1k-1.2k ft and entered the airspace above Burlington, WA, and after having overflown the town split in a &#34;Y&#34; commenced large, half-rate turns in their respective CW and CCW circles over the township and surrounding county.  They continued to circle overhead for 12-15 minutes and then turned to the southwest and departed the area. It was speculated that these may have been EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft dispatched from NAS Whidbey Is., WA, located in Oak Harbor, WA, several minutes to the southwest by air.  But again, this is only speculation as identification of specific aircraft at that altitude at night with the naked eye is nearly impossible.<n>

5/3/13 21:15|Huntington Beach|CA|Triangle|9 seconds|Extremely fast moving triangular craft with white spheres observed over Huntington Beach.  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.  PD))|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97550.html|494|ndxe201305| Extremely fast moving triangular craft with white spheres observed over Huntington Beach<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Description:  On Friday, May 3rd, 2013, at approximately 9:15 pm (0415 Zulu) I was outdoors exercising on the Huntington Beach High School track.  The high school is located in Huntington Beach, California at the GPS coordinates (N 33 40.678, W 118 00.179).  I had just finished my run and was sitting on the edge of the track while my friend finished her laps.  There were no other people present.  I was listening to my MP3 player with earbuds, but the music volume was not loud.  As I was stretching from my workout, I looked up to the sky.  Nearly directly above my head at about 70 degrees altitude from the southwestern horizon, I instantly focused on a triangular shaped object traveling at a very quick pace toward the northeast.  I quickly ascertained that the object was a craft of some sort and not birds flying in formation because at each point of the triangle was a large white sphere.  The spheres and craft traveled in perfect coordination as if it was part of one solid structure.  Its altitude was low enough that I could also see defined lines on the the leading edges and also on what I would assume was the aft edge since its orientation was flying in the direction of one of the triangle&#39;s converging points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I could see, I would estimate it to be a near perfect equilateral triangle.  The spheres were large enough that they extended beyond the triangle&#39;s points.  In other words, it appeared that they were not contained within the inside of the triangle, but perhaps attached to the points.  I was not able to determine if the middle area of the triangle was solid because the color was indistinguishable from the dark sky above.  The spheres did not appear to be self illuminated and there were no position marker, navigation, strobe, landing, beacon, or other lights visible.  The stadium lights were not in operation around the football field.  Consequently, the area where we were located in the stadium was quite dark.  If it were not for the mercury lights of the parking lot at the Seacliff Shopping Center across the street to the north and the baseball fields to the south, I&#39;m not sure I could have seen the object as clearly as I did.  I felt as if any illumination I was see! ing was coming from the lights across the street.  Our location was shadowed from the direct lights in the parking lot because of the bleachers.  However, it seemed that the craft was low enough, yet still well above the height of the stadium that the underside of the spheres were reflecting the parking lot lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As noted previously, I did have my MP3 playing, but the volume was very low and I could not hear any sounds from the craft as it passed overhead.  One thought that occurred to me was if it were possible that this craft were constructed of some sort of lighter-than-air balloon, perhaps three weather balloons attached to a rigid frame to hold them in perfect formation.  I very quickly dismissed this theory however when the object tracked from where I was sitting, to an area to the northeast I estimate to be between 3/4 mile to just over 1 mile away.  It covered this distance in under 5 seconds.  Conservative calculations place it traveling somewhere between 500-800 mph.  There was no perceptible wind so I would dismiss any light object simply floating in the air and carried by the current, especially at such an incredible rate of speed.  I also estimate the altitude to be 700 ft. MSL or lower (calculations explained below).  There were no visible clouds in the sky except for a! faint, marine haze in the northeast section of my view.  As are most high school stadiums, the bleacher structures are built on both sides of the field, but there is no seating at the end-zones.  There is a sizable wall and gates around the whole stadium.  However, I was far enough away from the wall where I was sitting that I had a fairly unobstructed view of the horizon just to to the right of the northern bleachers.  At this angle, when the craft passed overhead, I saw it briefly pass through part of a hazy cloud.  It was such a thin and wispy cloud that I could see it move around the form of the craft, but not obstruct it from view completely.  This was about three seconds after first viewing the object.  The object continued along a straight trajectory, not descending or climbing from what I could determine.  At approximately 5 seconds, the triangle had traveled far enough away that it faded from view.  More than likely, it did not accelerate or actually disappear, but the fade was the result of the same marine haze and excessiv! e ambien t lighting from the commercial lighting described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately one and a half minutes after the sighting, my friend had rounded the track to where I was sitting and I excitedly told her that I thought I had just witnessed a UFO.  She quickly replied that she had seen the object as well.  She began to tell me what she had witnessed.  Even though we were both wanted to share details, I asked her to wait until she could write down her account, so as to try and avoid contaminating either one of our memories.  At that point, I returned to where I had placed a backpack and I retrieved my cell phone.  I called my father who lives in another state to tell him about the incredible sighting and see if he could assist in gathering current weather data from the Internet.  My outgoing call was logged at 9:27 pm (0427 Zulu).  About three minutes into the call, I looked into the sky at about the same point where I had first sighted the triangular object.  Suddenly, I caught caught sight of two more objects traveling at about the same spe! ed, but on a 180 degree reverse heading from where the triangle was spotted.  In effect, they appeared they were returning along the same vector (altitude, heading, and speed) as the first object, but they were shaped differently.  Lacking a better way to describe them, they appeared to me to have the shape of fighter jets, but they were completely white in color and flying in such tight formation that they were almost touching each other (one slightly ahead of the other).  I assumed they were either slightly smaller in size than the triangular object or higher in altitude.  It was difficult to estimate, but the two of them combined were about 2/3 the size of the triangle.  I would best describe them as having a defined nose section (such as a fighter jet) and then swept back, short wings with a broader tail section (where the horizontal tail section would be on a conventional plane).  To be accurate, I am not quite sure about the overall silhouette as this was only one qui! ck impression and they were more difficult to see than the fir! st objec t.  They most certainly did however appear to have wings of some sort and a defined nose section.  I again quickly dismissed the possibility of birds or objects carried by the wind because of their speed and lack of wing motion. As with the triangle, there were no lights observed on either one of the craft and they did not appear to be illuminated, but perhaps reflecting city lights on their undersides.  Unlike the triangle, I did note that they did appear to be uniformly solid in color (white) and not transparent or colored the same as the sky.  The disappeared over the tops of the high school buildings to the southwest, in the direction of the ocean.  Because of the time of the phone call, I estimated this sighting to be at approximately 9:30 pm with a duration of less than 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this second sighting, I no longer had my MP3 playing, nor did I have the earbuds in my ears.  There was no perceptible sound detected from the two craft or anywhere in the sky.  I pointed out the objects to my friend who was now standing about 20 feet or so away.  She confirmed my description of them.  I promptly ended the phone call and attempted to turn on my smartphone&#39;s video recorder.  I had the recorder ready in case anything else should appear, but knowing the low-light filming capabilities of my phone, I was certain it was pointless to hope to capture such dim images on the device.  Shortly after, I took a compass reading from an application on my phone and we packed up our belongings in order to quickly get to a computer where I could gather more information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend&#39;s description of the first object differed slightly from mine.  She first spotted the craft as she was rounding the track on the northeast side.  The track is oriented lengthwise from east to west.  Consequently, she looked up just at the last few seconds it was fading from view, but appears to perhaps have seen it longer than I did before it completely faded.  Her perspective of apparent motion and speed were also different because it had already passed from overhead and was distancing itself when she caught sight of it.  As recorded in her own words:  &amp;quot;I saw a strange object that caught my attention while running.  It was in the formation of a triangle, but it seemed to have several objects that were forming that triangle.  It wasn&#39;t very high, definitely not a plane, it was not illuminated.  Initially I thought it might be a flock of birds, but it was a triangle shape not a V shape and the objects were much bigger than birds and it would have taken several birds to make the triangle as big as it was.  It was almost as if they looked like styrofoam Dixie cups clustered inside the triangle.  The object didn&#39;t hover to a stop, but it was slow moving and then it disappeared completely out of sight.  I looked beyond the clouds and there was nothing.&amp;quot;   Witnesses:  At this time, there are only two known witnesses to this event- myself and the female friend who was running with me at the track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding my background, I am a 35 year old television host and producer living in Orange County, California.  I do host a popular reality and investigation-based cable television show that among other phenomena, explores reports of UFO activity.  I have spoken on the UFO subject at several UFO conferences and am known for taking a neutral and skeptical approach to investigating UFO events.  In the 20 plus years of researching the UFO phenomenon and within the several years of working on our show, I have become quite familiar with most misidentifications of birds, balloons, conventional aircraft, remote control craft, and hoaxes.  I hold a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Sociology with certifications in Criminology and Corrections.  My previous careers include working for several years in criminal and national security investigations at both the state level and as a federal law enforcement agent.  I formerly held a Top Secret security level clearance which is eligible for reactivation.! I have held a current FAA Private Pilot&#39;s license since 1995 and have piloted small single engine planes in the general vicinity of the sighting.  Consequently, I&#39;m familiar with FAA Federal Air Regulations regarding aircraft lighting requirements and the use of airspace within the Huntington Beach area.  I&#39;m familiar with the basic capabilities of commercial and military aircraft known to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is a 32 year old female also living in Orange County, California.  She formerly was employed in banking compliance where her duties required monitoring and investigating reports of fraud.  She stated she has never before seen unexplained objects such as were witnessed.  Although she has a passing interest in the UFO phenomenon, she has not studied it and considers herself skeptical to unexplained events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather Conditions:  I obtained current weather information from aviationweather.gov.  The nearest airports to my location are John Wayne Orange County (KSNA) and Los Alamitos Army Airfield (KSLI).  Los Alamitos was exactly 8.3 miles to the northwest from my location and SNA was 7.65 miles to the east.  Accepting that there would be slight differences in the temperatures and winds between the two airports, I wanted a good average.  Fountain Valley which is 3 miles to the northeast also had reported information, but not the detailed cloud heights like aviation reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:29 pm (0427 Zulu), Fountain Valley was reporting a temperature of 64 deg. F. with a dewpoint of 56 deg.  Relative humidity was 75% with winds out the the south southwest at 8 mph. Barometric pressure of 29.83 inches and visibility of greater than 10 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange County Airport (SNA) reported in a Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) at 0453 Zulu (a little over 30 minutes after the event) that the wind was out of 250 degrees at 3 knots.  Visibility was greater than 10 statute miles.  Temperature was 67 deg. F. with dewpoint of 50 deg. and relative humidity of 55%.  Barometric pressure was 29.82 inches.  The cloud ceiling was broken at 25,000 feet AGL.  Within the next 4 hours at 0900 Zulu, the forecast was expecting a few clouds at 700 feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At Los Alamitos, the conditions were relatively the same.  It was forecast that starting at 0400 Zulu (9:00 pm) the winds were variable at 6 knots with 6 or more miles visibility with clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to the US Naval Observatory, the Moon was in the waning crescent phase (36% visible) but it was not seen in the sky at my location.  The moonrise was not to take place until 2:46 am on Saturday.  This eliminated it as a possible light source for the reflecting light coming off the spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trajectory, Altitude, and Size Estimates:  I measured the trajectory heading to be 39 or 40 degrees from magnetic north.  Using aeronautical sectional charts, the plotted course placed the object traveling nearly perpendicular to the Pacific Coastline.  The beach is less than a mile from where I observed the craft.  Every indication from its speed made me believe that it had entered over land from the ocean.  If the heading is extended in both directions, it crosses directly over Catalina Island and continues down a corridor between two sides of a National Defense Operating Area where aircraft are warned of military training.  If the heading is followed to the northeast, it continues directly over Corona and then Riverside Airport, which is in the general vicinity of March Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m familiar with the marine layer that often passes over the area when I fly planes, I judged the height of the object to be less than 1,000 feet.  This was supported by the fact that the haze was clearly detailed and visible when it obscured part of the craft as it sped by.  The weather forecast in the nearby area had also expected a few clouds at 700 feet.  Using the assumed altitude and comparing the angular size of a known object, I was able to arrive at a rough estimate.  The known object I compared size to was the Moon.  Because the Moon was not visible in the sky at the time, I measured it at a later time and used its known distance and size to arrive at the unknown object&#39;s size.  My best estimate is that the object was no larger than 25 feet in length from the front point to the aft edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusions and Speculations:  I feel comfortable categorizing this event as a UFO sighting in the literal sense of the term- the craft is still an Unidentified Flying Object.  As with most UFO cases, I find it easier to determine what it was not, rather than what it was.  As stated previously, I feel I have satisfactorily eliminated any possibility that the craft was a lighter-than-air balloon or floating object carried by the wind.  Weather reports indicated that at most, winds were no more than 8 mph and generally from the west or southwest.  Wind direction corresponded to roughly the same direction the triangular object was heading, but not at all to the direction the two smaller objects were traveling.  If any relationship exists between the two sightings, which would seem logical, then the second sighting has objects flying directly into the wind and would therefore indicate self-propulsion.  Any discussion of wind driven objects is quite ridiculous in my opinion once the relative speed of the craft! is taken into account.  Nothing short of the most severe hurricane or tornado could push an object to travel even half the speed of what we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not birds.  As discussed previously, both my friend and I were certain we witnessed a triangular object.  In my case, I saw 3 spheres as part of a rigid triangle with defined edges.  She also saw a triangle with a defined outline and states that she saw several more spheres within the shape.  I also know a little more about birds and flight behavior than the average person as I&#39;m a licensed falconer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was not a hang glider, nor was it an object towed by another aircraft.  Banner towing companies will often fly banner advertisements over the beach during the day, but there were no aircraft in the immediate area and no sounds of a plane.  I&#39;m also hang gliding certified and I know of no hang gliding operations in the area.  Again, the speed of the craft also precludes either one of theses explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, the thought of some type of remote controlled plane or multi-rotor copter was a consideration.  Although some remote controlled craft can reach extreme speeds, I find it very unlikely that anything hobby or law enforcement related could travel at such a rate.  Additionally, as I know from filming with an aerial remote control copter, anyone flying such a device out of line-of-site would require doing so by onboard cameras and video transmission or via completely autonomous flight.  The equipment needed to fly POV in the dark, would be tremendously expensive.  Similarly, it&#39;s an extremely costly and dangerous maneuver to fly by programmed waypoints without visual reference.  Doing so over a very populated area known to have police helicopters and other aircraft does not make sense.  The military comes to mind as the only organization with drone capability even remotely close to what we witnessed.  However, at 700 feet altitude and at such a tremendous speed, I would ! expect to hear significant sounds of a fuel propulsion system.  The craft in both sightings were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no way of confirming whether the craft were piloted or remotely operated.  It seems appropriate to declare however that their propulsion system is unconventional as belonging to any publicly known commercial or military craft.  Although delta wing craft have been manufactured by the military, the lack of noise at the estimated speed and altitude is unexplainable by conventional means.  (Drawing description attached)<n>

We watched the object for 25 minutes.  It appeared stationary at times, but over time moved very slowly away from our view.  Planes were in view and one helicopter, all with lights.  None looked comparable and moved much faster than the object we saw.  I used a Celestron Ultima 80 scope to get a better view.  At times it appeared as two linear lights, sometimes as multiple lights in a spherical shape with a more solid vertical line of lights.  As it moved further out of view it appeared as a sphere that emitted a constantly changing rainbow of lights, actually beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon leaving my house, I saw three orange lights in the night sky (western hemisphere) going from South to North.  It was a clear sky and the wind according to weather underground was less than 5 mph from the southeast.  The three lights were in a row then they formed a triangle until they flickered out one by one as they reached the far north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my house and called my brother.  I then saw three more orange lights moving in the same direction (all the lights were moving at the same speed and about as fast as a normal plane flying at high altitude.  These three orange lights were fairly far apart and formed a triangle.  I took a photo of them with my droid phone and they look very much like the photos I have seen on youtube etc,  I assumed they were the chinese lanterns after searching for the internet, but after seeing the low wind speed, I don’t know what they were.  I have never seen anything like this before and never made a report on something like this before.<n>

I would almost characterize the light as a dim LED) slowly moving across the night sky.  After a longer look at the object (and witnessing several planes fly past the point in the sky), I decided to grab my binoculars (4x30) and a few witnesses.  My mother, step-father and girlfriend were all witness to this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the binoculars, the object was CLEARLY visible.  A triangle, with bright, multi-colored lights that traced up to the top point of the triangle, repeating.  After further observation, a ring, with the same light characteristics traced around the base of the triangle in a circle (counter-clockwise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s movement is what made it so interesting.  From a fixed point on the ground (a tree), you can see the object move, slowly and at different speeds in one direction, then in another direction. Either up, down, left or right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was clearly visible for 2 or 3 hours before vanishing.  It has re-appeared at later dates, the same size, shape and light pattern are visible and within the same timeframe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object is clearly visible from any point on Tower Terrace Rd.

The objects where semi-stationary.  When observed using a building top as reference it could be seen that they all did sway slightly left-to-right and up-to-down.  The only explanation I can come up with is 3 super large silver balloons strung together.  The 3 objects where not hard to see, as would be ballons high up in the sky.

I thought I was going to see an asteroid or something like that so I pulled over. It had a short thick line above it that looked like a jet streak then it stopped and the entire jet streak came together into a ball of white light.  It looked like it was going to land in the Foothills subdivision but would go back up. I followed it and it seemed close but the light was getting smaller then it bolted north and I couldn&#39;t catch up to it again.  There was only 1 light.<n>

Although it may seem relatively insignificant to many, I experienced what I deemed to be a very unusual sighting in the sky, somewhat near the foothills at about 3:17 p.m. this afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send a photo of the same--the details appear more clearly on my iphone, from which I took the attached photograph.  Please allow me to explain what occured so that you may have an opportunity to both preview the photograph as well as understand the nature of the surrounding events because the photograph alone (even from my perspective) appears to be relatively neutral and insignificant.  I have attempted to gain a clear picture, with details that I sent from my iphone to my email and when zooming in to view details of the photo, they were very blurry.  When I zoom in on my cell phone, the details are crisp and clear, just as I am able to view the actual license plates of the cars that are in the foreground of the picture on my iphone, in the photo off the computer, the details become quite blurry.  I would be happy to send my iphone photo somehow to someone else&#39;s iphone in order to prove this point.  Please let me know because the evidence on the computerized photo is alm! ost impossible to discern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This afternoon was a fairly clear day and there were only a few, small clouds in the sky. I was driving south on Wadsworth Blvd, just south of Belleview in Littleton.  Prior to reaching the light at the interesection of Belleview and Wadsworth(from almost as far south as Cross Drive intersects Wadsworth), I noted that there seemed to be, what I thought was a plane &#39;hanging&#39; in the sky.  It was approximately north by northwest, towards the mountains, at about 11 o&#39;clock (position-wise, from where I was driving in the left hand lane, as I approached and prepared to turn west/left on Belleview).  I didn&#39;t think alot about it but I did think it was a bit unusual because of the following features:  it appeared to have only a very, small, faint trail, different from what I typically see from a large plane; the faint trail was absolutely vertical in nature; it seemed to hang in the sky, without moving; further, it was perfectly round and bright, right to the edges of its shape, as if the sun were either directly casting its light on it or the brightness was emanating from the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a result, I kept on looking at it because it didn&#39;t seem quite right. I knew that I would be stopping to turn at Belleview and I thought that I would have a better look at it when I stopped.  As soon as I stopped in the turn lane and at the very moment that I was looking at it, another bright object, absolutely identical to the first one, suddenly appeared to the right and about (4 o&#39;clock, by location, relative to the first object) and within eyesight of the other(not being able to estimate distance, but easily just a few miles from the first one). At that moment, since I was stopped, I thought I would grab my phone and take a photo of these two, bright objects.  The second object had no &#39;tail&#39; whatsoever, it just seemed to appear out of nowhere and I was a bit flabbergasted at this.  I instantly took a photo and the instant that I lowered my camera, the right-most object disappeared entirely and then, while I was looking at the other object, it disappeared right before my ! eyes.  I was stunned.  There was no trace of the object at all. What was more astounding was the fact that the sky was quite clear...no clouds in the immediate vicinity and absolutely no &#39;trails&#39; of a flying object did I perceive.  To my eyes, the sky appeared completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned the corner and pulled into the parking lot to see what had come out on my camera.  To my dismay, it looked like an ordinary photo and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to appear.  When I magnified my photo, however, I was stunned again, because, there are TWO sets of two parallel lines that appear to trail westward(to the left) of the photo.  The one set appears more clearly, but the other set is barely visible (below the traffic lights).  This would coincide with the fact that I saw the higher object stay in the sky longer and the lower object disappeared instantly upon me taking the photo. What is clearly shown on the photo are the double lines that streak off to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my story. I have no proof or reason to share anything like this other than I am both completely perplexed and even a bit upset about what I saw today.  It was as if both the objects that I saw were either descending in a vertical fashion and/or hanging there in the sky(which is what it appeared to be, to my eyes) and then, they both suddenly, one, moments before the other, moved off westward at such an amazing speed that my eyes were unable to visualize their rapid movement in that direction.  I actually saw the one disappear in front of my eyes, but I did not visually observe the actual movement that my camera was able to capture.  I kept looking back at the sky because I couldn&#39;t believe that an object so bright and obvious, could just disappear without any trace.  The photo shows two sets of parallel lines streaking off to the left but nothing more.  I have attached the initial photo and then, I attached the photo, with circles around the lines that I noted when I enla! rged the photo on my iphone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thank you for your consideration and I just felt that I had to record this event as accurately as possible. I know that many unusual events have been recorded over the years by many individuals but this was a first for me and I felt it important to share.  I am also very curious to know if anyone else saw anything out of the ordinary at the time.  On my actual iphone, I was able to see the license plates of the cars which were in front of me.  That&#39;s why I say that this photo, when enlarged here on my computer, only gives a fuzzy appearance of things, as well as the previously noted streaks that came out on the original photo.<n>

There was only one, shaped like a large oval; it looked like it was arcing down slightly, bright yellow in the very center, but green on the outside. I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it was way too big and, I think, flying too low, at about a 45-degree angle to us. The colors were constant, no blinking or flickering, and there was not a cloud in the sky!<n>

It seemed to be less than a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a brightly shining star, but when I used a branch as a point of reference, I could tell it was moving ever so slightly- up, down, from side to side, as well as kind of bouncing about at times.  As I looked at it, I saw another bright light shining through the trees, south of the first light and at a lower altitude.  At one point, the first light shot a small white fireball towards the second light (which I caught on video). After a few more minutes, I saw what appeared to be a plane approach the first light.  It looked like a strobing red light.  It passed over the first light, then turned in the opposite direction, began to blink a white light, then sunk below the first light out of my line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time, the first light was pretty consistent, just ! hovering and moving around ever so slightly. I noticed at least one more white light (COULD have been the second light I saw through the trees but I don&#39;t really think so) hovering around the area, clearly moving, but not much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At certain points, it seemed like the white lights in the sky had one other smaller and fainter light blinking next to it, within close proximity. In addition to all of this, between 10:30-11pm a very low flying aircraft flew over my house about 7 times; on average about 1 every 3-5 minutes. Did not appear to be a commercial airliner, its wingtips were not lit up at all; just had 3 or 4 lights appearing down the belly of the craft in a vertical line.  During this time, I saw another very small fireball-looking light flash through the woods behind our house. Almost looked like headlights through the trees, but there is no road there.  Our neighbors dog began barking madly at the light. I went to bed around 11:30pm and the first light was still there.<n>

Employed by same electronic security company for 27 years.  No illicit or prescription drugs.  No alcohol.  Non-smoker.  Married, 23 years.  One child. Excellent health. Wears contact lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of environment:  Flat, level farmland with orchards. Mostly stonefruit and nuts. Trees typically about 30 feet in height.  Few structures.  No streetlights, or other ambient lighting.  No buildings taller than the occasional two storey house.  No other vehicles on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather:  Clear, dry, no wind  Landmarks:  Historic Collegeville Cemetery dating to 1871  Airports:  Stockton Municipal Airport approximately 6 miles west of location of sighting  Military Installations:  Sharpe Depot, approximately 8 miles southwest of location of sighting   Traveling west on Mariposa Road between Escalon and Stockton, California I encounted three orange lights in the roadway east of Collegeville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just passed Van Allen Road, and from about 3/4 of a mile from Collegeville, I first saw the lights. I thought the lights were an illuminated road work sign warning of construction ahead, however as I approached,  I could see the lights were in the center of the road and not off to the side of the road.  Since the area is a rural, farming area,  I thought perhaps it was marker lights on farm equipment or a semi truck parked across the roadway. I began to slow down as I approached.  The posted speed limit is 55 MPH, and I had slowed to about 30 MPH trying to discern what was in the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were round and an intense orange color.  They were in a horizontal line, and equally spaced.  The center light appeared to be directly in the center of the roadway, while the outer two appeared to be at the edges of the roadway.  The very odd thing is that while the lights were very bright, they didn&#39;t seem to cast much illumination.  I didn&#39;t see any light being reflected off the roadway, the trees on the side of the road were little more than shadows darker than the night sky.  One would think with such intense light, some shadow or reflected light on surrounding objects would be visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, I had slowed to about 10 MPH and was maybe 300 feet from whatever it was I was seeing.  It&#39;s very difficult to gauge exactly where you are when it is that dark, surrounded by trees, and there aren&#39;t any real landmarks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights suddenly became muted. I don&#39;t know how to exactly describe it.  Maybe like a piece of frosted glass was placed in front of each light and the lights began to rise into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights cleared the tops of the trees, and appeared to start traveling southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I accelerated attempting to get close enough to see what it was.  All I could see was the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the cemetery, the lights began traveling north, crossed the road, and began to gain altitude.  As the lights gained altitude, they remained perfectly level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they just winked out.  Like someone turned off a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say anything about sound due to the engine noise of the vehicle I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I can report.  It was very weird.<n>

The &#34;star&#34; seemed to have disappeared, but I noticed it was still there when I saw that it started to move in a northern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object progressively picked up speed, (~2 second duration) once it reached a speed about what a shooting star would travel it changed direction towards the western sky and disappeared.

They stay completely stationary and flash a sequence of red, green ,blue, yellow, and purple lights.  To the naked eye it looks almost like a disco ball, but with binoculars you can see them get brighter and darker as they move around in a circular pattern.  There have been 12 witnesses since the first sighting, as we have had neighbors, and other family members confirm what we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the flight path of many planes and satellites and know what they look like…these are unlike anything we have ever seen.

We would chalk it up to something random had they not appeared so suddenly, and then continued to appear night after night.  They seem to be in a perfect line over the mountain range behind us, and it’s the sudden appearance and then disappearance that has us stumped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7 adults all over the age 35 and 5 teenage kids have been the witnesses, all of whom have never before been witness to anything like this before and would have found this hard to believe had they not witnessed it themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
