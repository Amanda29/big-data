ASU is a rural-type university in the Blue Ridge Mtn. range in NWestern NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us; at the same time; jumped up and pointed and exclaimed, &#34;What&#39;s that?!&#34;  There, hovering just above the treetops in the dark, was some sort of a huge cylindar-looking silent craft.  I mean it made NO noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a long light that seemed to rotate from the top down towards us. The light movement seemed to make a humming noise.  If &#34;it&#34; did see us; it saw three young women with their jaws agape and their eyes wide as saucers!<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant, it pulled out of sight - almost as if it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at each other and then took off like mad all the way back to our dorm - scared to death.  We huddled under a blanket on the couch and tried to calm outselves and to figure what in the world that could&#39;ve been; too scared to go back out.  I realise this happened years ago but I&#39;ve told numerous people, including my husband and children over the years, so I remember this as if it happened yesterday.  It wasn&#39;t until recently that I thought to look into this on the web thus found your site.  I am not the kind of person who believes these types of things.  I&#39;m rather skeptical and a down-to-earth person.  But I KNOW we saw something unearthly or at least unexplainable that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/29/79 02:00|Ocala|FL|Changing|20 minutes|fishing over resevoir object hovered for 20 minutes 2-3 feet above water, went straight up into space until it became vanished|10/17/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32240.html|2|ndxe197907| fishing over resevoir object hovered for 20 minutes 2-3 feet above water, went straight up into space until it became vanished<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2 am while fishing with my brother, who is now a retired correction officer,at rodman resevoir in ocala florida, I became aware that the water was orange, my skin was orange,a light was so bright on the water that it was distracting me from fishing. I looked through the flooded trees and saw what I thought was a backporch light, an orange floodlight. I mentioned to my brother the light, it was annoying me and said we should move the canoe. He just stared at the light and was practically speechless. Finally I realized why, when he brought it to me attention that we were in the main body of the resevoir, there couldn&#39;t be a house there, the light was over water. After looking at this large orange light that looked to be approximately 100 yards away a most, the light starting rising, it rose directly over our heads in a crystal clear night, never making a noise. Suddenly the orange light became a light that resembled a white floating pencil at about a 500 feet up, it only remained this way for about 10 seconds, the &#34;pencil&#34; shrank to a dot, and then it literally blasted into outer space, that&#39;s the only way to describe it. It went straight up and went from 500 feet over our heads to a fading dot in space in about 3 seconds. It never made a noise, didn&#39;t emit any color or flames after blasting off, but did leave a cloud of smoke that took about 15 minutes to dissipate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a panic and shaking uncontrollably, and we left soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suprisingly my brother was shaken but calm, at least calmer than me, as he claims to have seen an equally remarkable event if not more so to him, including being spotlighted by a craft and a loss of several hours of time while in North Carolina several years earlier.As farfetched as this sounded then and even now, he is very stable,never was one to make up stories, and since I know what I saw with him while fishing was the most incredible event I have ever had, the fact the he relates one sighting with the other means my brother saw something and experienced something he feels was just as remarkable if not more so years earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me this was probably the most remarkable thing I have ever witnessed and am again shaking now 25 years later as I write this. It was something I have tried numerous times to reconcile in my mind over the years, to see something that I thought was a backporch light blast into space, it&#39;s something I will never get over or forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

A friend was following me from Kennett,MO to Hayti,MO in a car after we had visited our girlfriends in Kennett. Saw a flying triangle. I saw a craft that looked like two headlights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to the side of the road, as I had seen this thing before from a distance. Joe pulled over behind me, since we were in separate vehicles. We got out of our cars and asked &#34;what&#39;s the matter &#34;Markie,&#34; and I responded with &#34;That Joey&#34; as I pointed at the craft that was approaching. He looked up and said, &#34;well, I&#39;ll be godamned&#34; as we just watched it float by, with no sound other than a woosh of air.  I was almost in a hover, moving at no more than 5 miles per hour.  It just putted past us on the othe side of the two lane road, just past and above the telephone poles. It was triangular with rounded corners, and had green lights on the front, red in back, and white in the center. It also had a very slight dome on the top. The are that I saw this was within 35 miles of a nuclear bomber base, and I had seen it many times before and after.  I can&#39;t help but think that it is of US origin.  Otherwise they would have had fighters in the air to defend against a UFO. I realize that this is an old sighting, but it was certainly a good one.<n>

I looked out my front window and saw a fleet of what I thought were geese. As they came closer to view it looked like planes and I remember thinking maybe we were at war but then they stopped and one craft zipped from the center and went to the front then zipped back into it&#39;s formation and they all left in formation zipping in one direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

One of the subjects was the Air Force Report called Project Bluebook. I recall an Air Force spokesman saying in an interview that the entire U.S. is covered in Radar put in place for ABM and bomber defense, and if there really were UFOs they would have shown up on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By some coincidence the Air Force code name for the Top Secret  project to develop Stealth Bombers and fighters was named &#34;Have Blue&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the length of time I am not sure of the exact date, the only thing I recall for sure is that it was the week prior to the weekend Air Show at the Niagara Falls Air Force Base where either the Thunderbirds or the Blue Angels were appearing.  As it turns out the Real show was to begin much earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling on Ridge Road which is on the escarpment in Lewiston, New York.  This ridge was formed by glaciers and is where Niagara Falls started.  The Ridge Road is very near the U.S. and Canadian Power Plants which has seen a host of sightings and also Lake Ontario where at least one Air Force jet was lost chasing UFOs (or trying to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving down the road I saw numerous people out in their yards looking up into the Sky.  I stopped at one house and asked directions.  After getting the directions I asked why they were outside.  The father answered that they were just enjoying the nice weather, apparently not wanting to appear to be nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded down to my friends, friend’s house to find them out in the yard as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked what was going on and they said that you have to see this.  They pointed to some light in the sky that appeared to me to be just stars.  I said So? They told me to keep my eye on them.  All of a sudden one of the lights started from a dead stop to well beyond the speed of sound, but with no noise, and then proceeded to make 90 degree turns.  Sometimes there would be two or three moving in formation or by themselves. Most of the time these lights just looked like bright stars but occasionally they would pulse and while they were predominately white they would they would sometimes have a blue or green tint.  Another strange effect is that while watching one it would suddenly withdraw slowly up until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I belonged to the Civil Air Patrol I had the phone number for the Tower at the Niagara Falls  Air Base.  We called the tower and asked if anyone had reported an strange lights?  He said &#34;Where are they now&#34;?  He said that he could report them but they are pretty common and they are harmless.  But he agreed that tonight’s &#34;show&#34; was more impressive and much bolder than most.  He said that he doubted that they would scramble any planes as they had lost some before, not from being attacked so much as blacking out or pushing the planes or themselves past what they were capable of in the trhill of the pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later though  some jets appeared and chased the light around making a lot of noise.  It was pretty amusing as the light seem to be playing with them able to travel 10-20 times as fast, hover and turning at impossible oblique angles.  It was a very weird feeling that something was out there just a few miles away and it sure wasn&#39;t meteors, weather balloons, reflections, or Northern lights all of which we had seen plenty of times before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The time was around 12 O&#39;clock noon and not a cloud in the sky. My step brother and myself were sitting on a barn roof looking into a big field where they would make hay. There is a tree line in the distance. Looking at the tree line I noticed two, what I thought were planes coming strait at us but they made no sound at all. As they got closer I could see, they were what I would call thimble shaped. The only way to discribe the color of them is, like polished bronze. They were at about tree top level and they just kept coming, and still not a sound. These things were in a formation, as like a lead ship or whatever and the other, alittle behind and off to the side. They got over head and that was to close for me .I jumped off the roof and ran as fast as I could to the house with my step-brother in tow. I know it sounds insane but none the less, a true story. I watched them fly off out of sight from the safety of the house. That day has and will haunt me for the rest of my life....…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Object disappears, car lights go off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to point out that the following event  was forgotten for several years.  And the other person in the car at the time still doesn&#39;t remember it taking place at all.  But I do remember during a trip from Pasco Washington to Yakima Washington.My friend ((Name deleted))and I were heading to Yakima in order to get another load, I was moving to Pasco.  It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn&#39;t making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.  I continued to break and the lights came on again.  They came on again and I noticed a  field access road off the highway and not wanting to break down on the road turned into it.  ((Name deleted)) and I got out of the car and relieved ourselves by the car.As I said before, I forgot this whole event for a matter of several years.   It was only after a discussion on UFO&#39;s that I remembered the event.  This is the first time that I have reported it to anyone other then close friends and work associates.<n>

Three triangle shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were playing outside in the summer of 1979.  There were four of us ranging in ages of 7 to 12.  It was about 9:30pm.  We saw 3, totally silent triangular shaped craft either hovering or moving too slowly to have been any kind of conventional aircraft. One was very low in the sky.  It seemed to be lower than the tree tops.  It was probably at least 50 feet across.  One was illuminated by the moon and had a rounded or bull-nosed edge.  Metallic to dark silver-the color of hemotite.  the other 2 craft seemed higher up, not smaller, just fur- ther away. They moved from east to west very slowly. My brother shined a flashlight up at one, that&#39;s how low it was.  Each craft had bright white lights on each corner and a reddish orange one in the center, that appeared to be flashing.  The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes.  We were children at the time so we were not taken ser- iously by our parents and never revealed this to anyone else...until now.<n>

The sky was clear and neither the moon or stars were visible. My best friend came running into my house and was screaming and trying to drag me outside to see something. As soon as we ran out into my front yard I saw it. I yelled to her (as we ran after it!) that it was the same object I described to her 3 years ago. It was the same silent, slow-moving, metallic, dome-shaped object with a center light on the bottom and slow counter-clockwise moving smaller lights surrounding it. It once again moved off in an eastward direction along Gilmore Lane toward Poplar Level Rd.<n>

California<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember the exact date, but it was several weeks into the first summer where my family was living (Rancho Palos Verdes, California) at the time I saw the craft, and that’s how I know approximately what month and year it was.  I was 11 years old at the time and I just learned to swim a few weeks earlier, and the first thing my dad taught me was to float because if I could float I would never be afraid of the water.  Floating in the pool and looking up at the stars at night quickly became one of my favorite things to do on hot summer nights.  This particular night very hot, even late into the evening it was still hot so I decided to cool off in the pool.  I turned off all the lights in the yard and only had the pool light turned on.  It was a perfect night for star gazing because it was a clear night with no clouds.  My dad and brothers were in the dessert for a few days to ride motorcycles, and my mom was at a neighbor’s house so I was the only one a! t home.  My mom recently showed me how to find Orion’s belt in the sky and I remember those stars were almost directly above me as I floated.  After about 10 minutes of gazing at the stars, suddenly the stars in the east part of the sky began to disappear.  At first I thought maybe clouds were rolling in, but I had never seen dark clouds before.  It seemed odd that any clouds would appear on such a hot night anyways, and I didn’t understand what could be blocking out the starlight?  Then I began to see an area that was blocking the stars take shape and I could see the edges of a pointed tip slowly moving directly above me.  The pointed tip headed west, and the edges stretched from the tip down each side at an angle like a wide triangle (chevron).  Each side stretched out from north to south at an angle for about 150 feet in each direction.  Our yard was about 90 feet wide and the total distance reached beyond my yard and into the neighbors yard on both sides (the entire wid! th was about 300 to 350 feet total, the lots are big in that n! eighborh ood). There was no sound at all.  It was traveling east to west because I know the sun came up in the direction that it came from, and set in the direction it was heading.  Our house was two stories high and the craft was flying no more than 15-20 feet above the rooftop.  My best estimate is that it was about 55-60 feet from the ground.  It moved very, very slowly.  As I watched in sheer wonder, I was amazed that something this large could fly so slowly and so low to the ground and not make any noise at all.  I could hardly see the surface because it was almost the same color as the night sky but slightly darker, not quite black, but almost black.  If I wasn’t looking up at the stars and watching the stars being slowly blocked out as it passed over, I may not have even noticed it.  As the craft passed overhead for about 30 seconds, the point of the front of the craft was already over the roof our house, and it was still blocking my entire view of the sky.  I remember being s! truck with awe as faint lights started to show up through the trees that lined the east side of the yard.   The lights were different colored (red, orange, yellow, and green) glowing on the bottom of the craft.  These were not normal lights that illuminated light outward like a flash light does, but rather these areas of light seemed to be coming from an inner light source that was shining just few inches beyond the exterior of the craft, and had a very soft dim glow.  I had never seen anything like this and I starred at the lights to try to see details.  When the lights were directly above me I could see that the light was coming out of a round opening.  I looked directly up into the opening and I noticed a shimmer effect that warped the dim light source similar to how fish scales shimmer when light hits the scales. Mixed with this shimmer effect was a smoke-like effect that distorted the edges of the round shape of the lights and it appeared to me that the light source wa! s inset deep into the surface of the openings.  There were two! rows of these openings, one on the right (north) and another row on the left (south).  The distance between the rows was about 18 feet (a little wider than the width of our pool).  The lights within each row were spaced about 3 feet apart, and the size of each opening was about 1 foot in diameter.  There were approximately 8-10 openings in each row, alternating in colors. It seemed like it took about 90 seconds to completely pass over our rooftop.  At this point I hurried to get out of the pool, ran through the house, out the front door, and over to the neighbors house next door calling out to my mom.   We lived at the top of a hill, and just before I got to the steps of our neighbors door the craft was moving over the top of the houses on the opposite side of the street.  I was knocking on the door, and yelling to hurry up and come to the front yard quick.  By the time everyone came outside the craft was beyond the viewable line of sight because it was flying so low.  They missed ! it unfortunately, and I tried to describe it to them and convince them to get in the car to go find it so they can see it.  They were in no mood to do that, and they assumed I must have seen a blimp because blimps used to fly over our neighborhood.  I knew it was not a blimp because I had seen the blimp fly over before during the day and at sometimes at night.  The blimp that used to fly over would never fly that low to the roofs of houses.  I knew a blimp could never block out the sky as much as the craft I saw.  The craft I saw huge, and was not shaped like a blimp, but rather a large wide triangle like shape, more like a chevron shape and not an elongated oval like a blimp shape.  Also, blimps make noise even though they are quiet, but the craft I saw didn’t make any noise at all, it was perfectly silent.  I will never forget this, and I’m glad I can finally share my experience.  I heard about the website on the radio that encouraged to share any sightings no matter how ! long it’s been.  I hope the details I’ve given are useful to U! FO resea rch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My name is Dave Oblad, an electronics Engineer. My wife was 28, also Wendel (15yrs), Darcy (13Yrs), Karl (9Yrs) and a friend of the family (15yrs). The kids where spending the weekend with us. We had gone out for burgers about 6:30Pm. I saw a cigar shaped object on the north east horizon. Thought it was smoke but was too straight and perfect. After a bit, it became evident that it was moving towards Hacienda Heights. I decided to go see what it was. We left the burger place and went to fullerton road, north of La Habra that goes over the heights. We had lost sight of the object within minutes of heading towards it, the ufo having passed into the heights. When we got into the heights, the sun had set and we cruised the roads looking for it. We were about to give up and head home when we came around a bend and it was nearly overhead. I stopped the car and we got out. It was about 100 feet over head. At first I thought it was a big hang glider. We could not see any detail, but the shape was high lighted against the overcast sky, the clouds were lighted from underneath via the city lights of orange county and pomona. The size became apparent when we thought it would crash into a tree and instead passed behind and well over the tree. There was 2 white lights at the rear wing tips and a dull red light at the front center, but not so close to the front tip as the whites on wings. It made ZERO noise and I estimate it&#39;s speed to be about 10 mph. It was going against the mild wind heading west. It passed over the top of a hill, so we jumped back into the car and followed the road around the hill, turned right onto a westward street where we saw it again. The road didn&#39;t stay under it, so we got out again and watched as it slowly headed for Los Angles over the Hacienda heights. Before flying over any city, it BANKED right and headed north. We couldn&#39;t see it after it went into some hills just east of LA. From the heights we can see most of orange county and a lot of LA. I thought at the time we had seen a very strange shaped blimp. I supported the idea that it was some kind of USA experimental blimp/wing glider with very quiet muffled engines. My main reason is that it BANKED and was taking advantage of normal airflight via wings and banking. Most ufo&#39;s we had heard about never seemed to care about air or gravity etc. Anyway...It was a UFO because we had never seen anything like it before or since..until recently on the news. I am a VET, Engineer and Programmer with an IQ of 154. No mistake in what we saw. We went back home and called the police. They said no one else had reported it and that they would take care if it (what ever that means). So we see each other on occasion and we still don&#39;t know exactly what it was. End Report.

I was with my instructor at the time and had been flying on instruments only (IFR) for 20-30 min. At the time we were mid-way between Palm Springs and Apple Valley, which was our destination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were approx. north-east of Big Bear when my instructor said to me that “we have traffic at 12:00”. This statement was to notify me that we had converging aircraft directly in front of us. This in itself was alarming because federal regulations state that all west and east converging aircraft were to fly at 1000 feet separation plus 500. This aircraft was obviously ignoring the rules because he was heading straight at us! As this object approached closer and we prepared for evasive maneuvering, we noticed that this object was void of any type of wing surfaces, propellers, engine nacelles, or landing gear. As we drew closer the object seemed to veer and passed off our left wing at approx. 100 feet. At this distance it simply appeared as a metallic sphere. It left no contrail, had no cockpit, and was most certainly moving under its own power on a flat trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My estimation of its closing speed was that it was flying close to ours, based on my past experiences with other aircraft in close proximity. At the time we were flying in the 120mph range. The time available to see this machine was probably no more that 5-6 seconds at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it passed, I banked sharply to get on its tail. But by the time we were in position…it was simply..gone! Nothing had been said between my instructor and I during this entire event, until after we had finished looking for the object. I asked him “what was that?” His response was that he had no idea, and then told me “when we get back, don’t say a word about this ok?” And I never did. Not until almost 20 years later, when I found him again flying for a major airline, and had a chance to speak with him about it. All our recollections matched, and we both were still perplexed as to what that thing might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since those days I have acquired a commercial pilot’s license and flown professionally. I have also acquired several degrees, one of which is in Aeronautics. And in addition, I became a federally licensed aviation maintenance technician.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am a public school teacher at the secondary level and teach technology education and aviation science classes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And NONE of my training, education, or professional experiences has helped me to explain what I saw that hot summer afternoon so long ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I witnessed 2 &#34;cigar&#34; shaped objects slowly moving/hovering in the sky.  It was funny because I thought that they looked like the spaceship that Marvin the Martian flew in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was just a kid, I always dismissed this incident until I read another post about a &#34;cigar&#34; shaped sighting in Yorktown Ind. around the same time.  Yorktown isn&#39;t very far from Fairmount (about 25 miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that is story isn&#39;t very exciting, but I thought it was interesting that it was similar to something someone else saw in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So ... you never know.

7/15/79 14:00|Yorktown|IN|Cigar||Burnt circle in field|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16197.html|15|ndxe197907| Burnt circle in field<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t know the exact date, or even year, because this happened in my youth. (The 70&#39;s}   We lived by a cornfield and the corn was still green, so it must have been some time during the summer.  This happened in Yorktown Indian, right beside walnut street, a few miles out side Muncie, about 40 miles from Indianapolis.  I remember that my parents would invite my grand parents over to watch the strange lights and vehicles in the sky.  I remember seeing a few cigar shaped objects in the sky my self, but this isn&#39;t the main part of my sighting.  As a kid the neighborhood children and myself would play in the cornfields.  Most of us knew about the lights, but being young we really didn&#39;t think much of it.  What we did find that that struck us as odd was a circle burned into the corn, far out in the field.  It was as I remember a perfect circle of charred corn stalks about six inches wide, and the circle was about fifteen to twenty feet across.  The corn was pressed flat, as was the unburned corn inside the circle.  We knew the field pretty well and there was no farm machinery that went through the field during those summer months.  Out side the circle were sets of footprints that led out of the circle, but not very far from it then back to the circle.  What we found so unusual about them to us was that they were maybe 4 to six inches deep, with no tread marks, the bottom of the prints were flat with no tread that would be on a normal shoe or farmers boot.  On the surface of the footprint in the dirt was something that looked like green moss.  There were no tire marks leading to or away from the circle.  The soil wasn&#39;t soft, we didn&#39;t leave prints this deep, while we ran and played in the field, and that&#39;s what we found odd also.  I brought my mother out to the site so she also witnessed it.  She didn&#39;t know what to make of it ether.  My older brother was one of us kids that saw it also.  There are no military bases in the area, or even a airport of any size, so I don&#39;t think it was some &#34;government project&#34;.  As far as I know the field is still there, and Yorktown is a very small town sleepy farm town, so I don&#39;t think anything has been built over the area.  If needed I can locate the other people that I knew at the time to verify the story, (the other children, by brother, and mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for Listening,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

Stange for us or any teenage kids.As we were walking home i glanced into the ski and say what looked like a crumpled pice of plactic floating in the ski, like a wind blown tarp.As i watched it i realized it was not moving and had kind of a haze around it. This was on a clear sunny day and i don&#39;t think there was a cloud in the ski.It was a gray silver in color and had no lights. As i watched it took off from a stand still to out of sight in just a second or two. it shot up at slight angle   went straight for an airliner flying over head jumped over it and out of sight.i did point this object out to the people with me. they looked up at it and then put there heads down and kept walking. i did not speak of this for years but have always remember this.My brother says he dosn&#39;t remember it and the friends have sence moved away.This happend a long time ago and my memory might be flawed, this is the first time i have relayed to anyong out side my familey  amke of it what you will<n>

About two hours into the trip, I heard a loud noise and had the sensation that we were being hit by a semi-truck.  At that point, time seemed to stop.  However, there was actually no &#34;real&#34; noise that I know of, and we were not in an accident, as I had felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I felt things return to normal, everyone in the car (there were five of us) turned to each other and asked &#34;what just happened?&#34;.  Everyone in the car had felt the same thing I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my parents were somewhat concerned about feeling like time had stopped and immediately checked the clock, but it was the time it should have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone give an explanation for what could cause this sensation?  It has been a long time, but it still perplexes me.  It would be nice to finally have a reason behind this phenomen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

After reading this report I wanted to relate a similar experience I had. I was driving to work in the fog adjacent to the Fred Meyer warehouse in Clackamas and similar to the above report, I witnessed 5 round lights (smaller than the referenced report) about the size of beach balls, each one a solid color, blue, green, orange, and red. They passed in front of my vehicle at approximately 20 feet altitude, and 20 feet in front of me. These lights were following one another and oscillating (like a sine wave on an oscilliscope) in opposite wave patterns (when one was at the peak of the cycle the next would be at the bottom of the cycle). I have seen work trucks and police cars with flashing lights in the fog and this was not at all similar. There was no apparent &#34;beam&#34;, just individual round balls of light. They moved at approximately 40 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought the witness would like to know that someone else has seen strange acting lights in the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a warm night and I was getting tired of fishing and just laid back on the dock and looked up at the sky at the stars.  You could see them all great that night and I remember I started to watch what I thought was the begining of a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving across the sky very slowly and then it raced acrossed the sky and then it just stopped.  I knew then that this was no falling star.  It made it&#39;s way back in the direction it came from and would also quickly change directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I was maybe 15 years old and back then I do not believe we had any kind of technolgy that existed then or now to do the things I saw this craft do.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  All I know is that all of a sudden it just vanished.

My parents were asleep so I snuck out to lay in the cool sand of a construction site next to our house.  Arcadia is a small city that stretches along the main road for about a mile and a half or so. My house was on a hill at the end of the road, enabling me to clearly observe most of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I enjoyed looking at the lights of the city in the cool night breeze, and as I sometimes did, I stood in the cool sand and looked down at the city lights.  As I was doing this, I perceived that dogs were barking at the far edge of town.  I didn’t think anything of it until I perceived that the barking was slowly getting louder and closer.  This caused me to pay a little more attention and as I looked down at the city I saw a small patch of sky that was darker then the surrounding sky.  As I watched, I perceived that this dark patch was maybe 300 feet above Main St, and coming straight at me moving slowly.  I didn’t see any lights and couldn’t make out the shape until the thing was maybe 100 yards from my position.  I began to hear a low “rum…rum…rum noise coming from it.  As the road it was following ended at a “T” it turned instantaneously to its left and I could finally see its shape, it looked like a blimp, and maybe a third of the way up it had a row of very dim shimmery! round lights.  It was somehow hard to see, yet I could clearly make out the shape.  It moved on to my right until it went out of site behind a large hill.  At that point I couldn’t hear it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never saw it again, but it just occurred to me that maybe  2 years prior to this sighting, a saw a meteor fly over my house so low that we could hear a loud burning roar as it passed almost directly overhead.  The shape I saw was going in roughly the same direction, no idea if they are connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/14/79 22:00|Motherwell (UK/Scotland)||Light|2 or three minuets|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The objects were both orange in colour and seemed to shimmer with long flowing tendrils.|5/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36642.html|21|ndxe197907| Received: April 25, 2004  I was about 18 years old coming home from the river Clyde here in Motherwell, Scotland. ( about 1979 July or August) My Dad and I had stopped to speak to an old friend. I was looking towards the west in the direction of the town of Hamilton. The evening was warm and overcast. I have tried to show this in the attached drawing. When I saw the first object, it was emerging from behind the hills to the west, which are about 8 or 10 miles away. Within a few seconds the first object was totally visible, then the smaller object rose up from behind the hill and was soon totally visible also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were both orange in colour and seemed to shimmer with long flowing tendrils. The second object was about half the size of the first. I am a lousy artist but the objects in the drawing are very close to the things I saw. The perspective in the drawing is about correct, so you can imagine the size of the objects from 8 or 10 miles away. My Dad and his old pal were deep in conversation. When I told them to look at the fireballs floating up through the clouds they didn&#39;t seem to be able to see them. My Dad seemed to be agitated with me for disturbing his conversation and they continued to talk as if nothing had happened. I know that this was no hallucination. The objects merged together before floating up into the dark clouds. My Dad never had any time for this sort of thing (UFOS) so I never spoke to him about it. The whole thing from start to finish took about 2 minutes at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 45 years old and this scene has been in my mind since the night I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send you some more info on some more odd sightings I have had if you want. I do a little amateur astronomy and watch the satellites often with the naked eye, but when one stops and stays there for 2 or three minuets, brightens up like a flare then zooms off in the opposite direction, it makes you think. I know the Sun can catch satellites and make them brighten to about the brightness of Venus at the moment, but I have never seen one brighten as much as this and then shoot off in another direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps,  Regards,  Thank you to the person for the report and image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were away for the weekend and my brother and I were awakened by a loud rumble which was almost causing the house to shake.  It was a sunday morning and the date listed above is approximate as this was a long time ago.  We both ran to different windows in the house looking to see if we could find the cause of the rumbling when we looked out the eastward facing windows we saw a large cigar shape craft at least 200 ft long heading slowly from south to north towards a glowing triangle shaped doorway (for lack of a better word) with the rumbling and shaking being very loud, when it got to within a few hundred yards of the triangle it shot into it at incredible speed and the triangle collapsed on itself closing like a iris of an eye.  Then complete silence nothing dead quiet, we stared at each other and said what the hell was that he said no bodys gonna believe us if we tell em.  We told our parents and they didnt believe us, still dont.  I waited years and we felt it was time to at least report this as i have never heard of another report like this<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/13/79 22:00|Santa Clarita|CA|Disk|40 seconds|Up close over backyard pool|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/066/S66999.html|23|ndxe197907| Up close over backyard pool<n> <n><n> <n><n> Husband and wife state that an UFO hovered over their backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of the sighting was Santa Clarita Valley, California, United States on July 13, 1979    According to the husband it was 10.00 p.m. in the evening when he initially saw the object.  According to their testimony the object was 75-100 feet in diameter and directly overhead at a height of 50-75 feet.  The object was disk shaped and its colouring was silver/white metallic.  The length of the sighting was approximately 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He writes, &#34;It was one warm summer Friday around 10:00 p.m. in the evening in California&#39;s Santa Clarita Valley. I was brushing the swimming pool with a long pole and attached brush so that the kids could swim the following day. The pole requires you reach up to push down. I was standing on a high platform next to and overlooking the pool and about 4 feet over the rest of the pool area. As I reached to the upper end of pole, I saw a craft approaching the house from about 1-2 blocks away and from the West and heading South East.&#34;  &#34;I knew right away that it was not a helicopter or plane. It seemed flatter and wider and with lights in a circumference of the main leading edege area. I ran towards the house, some 60 feet, and called my family to see it. Only my wife came out. By that time it was stationary directly over our house and pool. It was approximately 75-100 feet above us. We stood along side of the pool deck. It made no sound whatsoever, and it was at a complete stop over us for about 40 seconds. The only motion was a slight wobble and when it moved and tilted downwards at an angle. I was then able to determine that light was emanating from it&#39;s skin and not pool lights reflection. I took the downward tilting as some form of acknowledgment. It remained tilted downwards at a 30-40 degree angle for about 10 seconds. During the entire time, we were frozen in disbelief. It is a strange sensation knowing that what you are seeing is not supposed (to exist) and very foreign. It was (like) seeing a Greyhound Bus floating over your house!&#34;  Witness claims that it had a small portholes and lights around the upper dome section, He describes the object as solid, metallic and shiny. It had a dome on the upper section of the craft and seemed as if created from a single mold with no visible seams. The lower underneath section of the object was concave towards the center and had two rectangular shapes along side each other and the length of the concave under-section. The rectangular shapes were about 7-10 feet in width and ran along the craft&#39;s concave underside center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I also noticed 2 ski like devices on the front and on each side of the front underside. What caught my attention was that the devices were not in the center or the &#34;center of gravity&#34; for the craft&#39;s diameter and design but very forward. The skis were S shaped with the top of the S facing forward but a design I could not replicate even though I scored very high on isometric drawings and IQ tests that included realting drawing sequences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon the craft leaning in a downward motion we could see a window or cockpit like glass that was situated in the underside, it was on the front lower edge of the round craft. The rectangular window was approximately 4 feet in height and possibly 8-10 feet in length. There was a glow of soft orange and blue lights from the inside but we could not see anyone or any controls&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained at a forward and downward angle for about 10 seconds. We both had the sensation of being watched. As it was angled, I noticed that light was emanating from the upper section that was not facing the swimming pool lights. Thus, it seemed to generate light through skin of the craft as the lights that first attracted me faced forward and was much lower than the upper section of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;My wife and I did not say anything to each other during the experience but she kept saying &#34;oh my God&#34; over and over again. The craft then left slowly at 30-40 MPH. I jumped on a wall around our property to continue seeing for at least 7-miles. I instructed my wife not to discuss it, to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. They matched, although mine had more detail and accuracy&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background that includes working with Group Propulsion Systems, studied aeronautical engineering followed by busines and later as an executive with several major computer companies. &#34;What we saw was close, real, solid, and a beautiful designed craft. I know from my aeronautical engineering background that mankind has no such technology&#34;, he concludes.<n>

I told my friends to look and we saw 10 lights. The first 4 were in a diamond formation and gold in color with the lead object traveling North eastward. The next 4 were in a square formation and were redish in color.  The last 2 were bluish and were in a straight line traveling the same direction as the rest North eastward. For a couple of seconds they all stopped moving, then after a second or two more each group split off in a different direction and were gone.  The whole event lasted only for a about a minute, but I looked down at my watch and nearly 20 minutes had passed. After I asked the rest what time they had we relised that all of us had lost about 20 minutes. I&#39;m 30 now, 20 years later, and I can still see it in my mind like it was that warm sumer night. It still scares the hell out of me.<n>

From the Interstate, this feature appears to be an extreme saddle-back mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suspended between the sides of the saddle-back, approximately ¾ of the way down, was a very odd craft.  It appeared to have a main body with two pontoon-like appendages, running the length of the body, below and to each side.  It was dark orange on the top and dull silver on the bottom, similar to a two-toned car.  It was symmetrical in overall shape, but had all sorts of extraneous box- and cylander-shapes attached to it.  Picture the spacecraft in any recent science fiction movie and you can imagine the overall look.  I cannot estimate it’s size, but the sides of it appeared to just clear the sides of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alerted my nephew, saying, “Look over there.  It’s a ufo.”  He looked and acknowledged, then looked away.  I had my 35mm camera on the seat beside me, but could not make myself pick it up to take a picture.  This is something I will always regret, not only because it would provide some kind of proof, but because the object is so hard to describe.  This is the reason I have put off reporting the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some years later I heard my nephew telling someone that he and I had seen a UFO.  When I ask him now, he says he does not recall the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I do not drink and was the designated driver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After dropping off my friends, at about 2:30 AM,  I drove into my driveway and stepped out of my car.  I closed the car door and then fumbled on my key ring for the key to my house. I moved away from the car using what I thought to be moonlight to find my key.  When I looked up to my left,  over my pool area there was a large saucer shaped object suspended over my house, my pool, and also sections of my neighbors house.  I could not tell how high up it was nor how large since I had no reference about the object to compare.  The moonlight glow was coming from the bottom of the object where several lights appeared around the bottom outline of the object.  The lights were not round, but, rectangular with a space between each.  The lights began to rotate counterclockwise then a round center area lit up as well.  The center was a softer glow than the outer edge.  The object moved west over my house very slowly and with absolutely no sound.  I ran to the front of the house to continue to view it, but, it moved straight upward and the lights were shut off.  I was left in darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/1/79 18:00|Desert Center (north of)|CA|Light|15 minutes|White light, aprox 10 to 15 miles away, moving in the formation of a square.|1/7/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11473.html|32|ndxe197907| White light, aprox 10 to 15 miles away, moving in the formation of a square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this years ago at my cousin&#39;s house.  I have told lots of people about it but never officialy reported it, because I did not know how.  And of course we did not have the internet back then.  I am guessing on the year because it was so long ago. It was in the summer around 1979, give or take a year.  We were at my cousins house in Lake Tamarask, CA, just North of Desert Center, CA.  We were in the front yard looking North against the mountains.  The mountains were at least 15 or more miles North of Lake Tamarask.  At the base of the mountain was a single white light.  It had to be a fairly large light because at that distance a vehicle light would have been hard to see.  From where we were at the light looked about the size of a dime.  The light was moving in the formation of a square, and again from where we were standing it was a small square, about a foot long by 3/4 of a foot high.  But in reality the distance had to be quite a large distance since the light was so far away from where we were. I am guessing it had to have been at least a mile or more it was moving.  The kicker is that it was moving very fast and at that distance there is no way that a vehicle or normal aircraft could move that far that fast and turn such sharp corners.  My older sister, and my cousing who is about 12 years older than me was also watching this, and I am sure there were more people watching but I cannot remember who. We were all very baffled by this and could only assume it was something not of this world.  I can still visualize this in my mind like it was yesterday.<n>

It was late and I was supposed to be asleep but I was kind of playing around in the dark. My little sister was in the bed with me but she was sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I heard a sound outside that sounded like humming machinery. Even thought it was like a gentle hum it was very loud. This is why I noticed it. At first I thought it was a car waiting for someone outside. Especially because it seemed to sound pull a little like a running engine. But it suddenly occured to me that a car doesn&#39;t sound like that because its too loud. But what was wierd was that it was quiet but loud at the same time. QUIET AND LOUD. Get it?????  I looked out the window and it was a flying saucer floating in the air outside and to the right of my grandmothers house, over the street and partially the sidewalk, but lower than my second floor window. It may have been the same height or a little higher but because it was a lil maybe abiout twenty feet away and I was seven years old, my proportion of height is slightly distorted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s the Gods Honest truth: This thing was a silver, disc shaped, center was slightly raised and rounded, red, blue and yellow lights around it that seemed to throb with the throbbing hum. I immediately ran into my aunt who was on the phone in the room next to me with the light on. She told me to get outta here and go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the window and the thing was crazy because it looked just like first encounters of the third kind, but it was very small to fit on my street. Something telepathically asked me if I was alone, and I telepathically answered NO, I began to look around because I was really astounded that no one was looking out of their windows. Remember the saucer was making an extremely loud throbbing hum sound that sort of radiated from it......BUT THE SOUND WAS QUIET! Does that make sense? I know it doesn&#39;t, but I have no way else to describe it. I remember trying to telepathically ask it why it was little and if there was others around,and why couldn&#39;t any one here it? I was only seven, and I had no idea about telepathy- When I say I was telepathically asking it - I mean these were the questions that came into my head at once but I knew somehow that it could hear me- Especially since IT ACTUALLY ASKED ME IF I WAS ALONE...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget that as long as I live. I maybe told one or two people in my life . I know how ridiculous it sounds but it was very real. So much so that it is what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it&#39;s movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.  Myself and my associates were all standing together talking when one of the guys said what is that coming from the &#34;North?&#34;  We all looked and then could make it out, it was awsome.  We were all &#34;on duty police officers&#34; taking a break in our favorite spot where the ambient lights of the city didn&#39;t block the stars.  The north valley is known for it&#39;s clear nights and fantastic views of the night sky.  If we hadn&#39;t been taking that break and watching the sky while we talked we would never have seen this object.  And no, I have not said anything before this time.  We all looked at each other and basically said &#34;what the hell was that thing!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all Chico or Butte County Deputies at the time who often worked the same areas of the county/city together.  This location we were standing in was on a sight rise or hill on the SE side of town, leading up to the foothills of the Sierras.  It was away from public view where we could park four or five police cars, drink some coffee and relax for a few minutes without scrutiny or criticism from passing motorists; and the sky gazing was superb from that location. We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.  This was not anything that we could possibly have built.  I don&#39;t know why I thought it was a rectangle, but I just had that feeling about it.  Whatever shape it was, it was huge!<n>

We noticed a bright light in the distance - I don&#39;t remember the color - moving oddly in some fashion.  I am not sure what actually caught our attention.  Perhaps the object was moving too slowly or in an unusual flight path.  In any case we wondered what it was and pulled over to watch for a minute.  The second we got out of the truck, the thing changed direction and came directly for us.  It moved slowly, silently and steadily until it passed directly over our heads.  Since we had no perspective for distance against the night sky, I cannot estimate the size or altitude.  It appeared to be as large as 747 and flying at say 1000 feet.  I clearly remember that it looked to be the shape of an eye with a hole in the middle where the iris would be.  I can remember seeing stars right through the middle of the object.  I clearly remember the thing looking to be diamond or eye shaped, however, with so many reports of wishbone or chevron shaped objects, I must admit that my own eye/brain may have filled in detail where no structure existed.  No sound could be heard and it continued to move slowly into the SW until disappering.  It appeared to be black and I think some lights could be seen...but not ordinary aircraft lights. I guess that it had a very bright light shining forward but I am not sure which lights had actually caught our attention.  I am quite convinced that I saw an experimental [stealth] blimp or otherwise operating out of nearby Beale AFB.  Maybe it was a stealth blimp piloted by aliens (-:<n>

I do not think that this &#39;sighting&#39;, if that is what it can be called, will be of any use to you because it happened so long ago.  But I came across your website and thought, what the heck, why not record it here anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened when I was a child (I have estimated Summer of &#39;79) and sleeping out on the beach in front of our summer beach house with a friend of the same age.  (This was in an era when it was considered safe to let children do that).  I was woken up by something, probably in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark.  I got up and stood on the beach and saw a round object with multiple, multi-colored flashing lights either on the water or hovering just slightly above it.  The object was approximately 20-40 ft. from the shore, and there was a sound associated with it; like a white noise, but at a low, soft pitch.  At the time I thought the object was a submarine.  Now that I know what submarines look like, and that they cannot come that clo!se to shore, I know that it definitely was not.  Also at the time I was certain that it was not a boat - having grown up around boats and spending every summer on that beach, I was familiar with the shapes and appearances of boats.  Well....that is all I remember!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I am not making this up; the object that I saw could have been a perfectly legitimate &#39;vehicle&#39; of some kind, or I could have a faulty memory.  Anyway, good luck with your research.  FYI:  I am 27, female, married w/ one small child.  I work part-time for a Seattle non-profit.  I&#39;m not particularly into UFO&#39;s or other unexplained phenomena, in fact I could be called a skeptic.  But I am interested, and I am convinced that I saw this object back in the summer of &#39;79 when I was 9 years old.<n>
