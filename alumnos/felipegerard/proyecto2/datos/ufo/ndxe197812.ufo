Estimate the object was 50-100 feet in diameter. Blueish pulsating light eminated from the entire cirular shaped bottom of the object. Very low frequency sound got louder as the blueish light pulsated brighter and sound got softer as the light pulsated to dimmer. Duration of event we was at least 30 minutes, perhaps longer. Observer 2 was very frightened. Observer 1 was indifferent. Observer 3 was very excited and interested. O3 eventually said to O1 and O2 that he thought it was a UFO and as soon as he said that the object vanished as if some one had turned off a light switch. At its brighest the object lit up the area like it was daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer 1 - is an visual artist by training (oil painter) Observer 2 - is a social worker by training (parole officer) Observer 3 - is a scientist by training (genetic engineering researcher) All 3 observers were students in college at the time earning their degrees.<n>

Because I used to look at the pics of a mistery book my mom had, I knew what I was looking at, a space ship floating in the distance but close enough to see its light structures. With curiosity I keep observing and notice the object is getting closer to me, infact the whole structure of it is visible; so, neive as I am I wave with a hand to say &#34;Hi&#34;. Because it was big and getting closer and lower to our building, I start to feel less confortable and a little worried, so I decide not to be alone. I go in to wake my little brother whom slept in my same room and then we go back outside; the object keeps getting closer to us and from curiosity I realize maybe it is a good idea to wake up mom. I run to wake up my parents, but feeling guilty for leaving alone my 7 year old brother ((name deleted)); when I tell mom &#34;mom there is a UFO!&#34;, at first she looks at me funny, then she decides to follow me to see what&#39;s going on, while my dad did not care, no matter how much I insist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We run back outside after turning on the lights in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With  mom, maybe also for turning the lights on, the UFO keeps coming closer a little more, then it slows down its pace until it stops and just floats in the air as if it wants to be admired. It is about 300 yards straight in front of us but slightly higher, we can see its lights, like windows, or engines? After a while ( and to mee it seemed a very long time) it gradually but really slowly (as if it does not want to intimidate us) moves away from us, while we keep admiring towards the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It does that until it is not visible anymore for it disappears in the distance behind our building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was gone we went back inside and before going back to bed I looked at the clock 2 am, wishing never to forget this event, so I believe it was around that time it occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning my parents fearing unknown consequences, not knowing whom to contact either, decided not to mention what happened; but after such a long time, with my mom, we decided at least to mention this just to let you have a record of the occurrance, because in our opinion telepathic ability on their part was possible ?

12/25/78 21:30|Cabo San Lucas (Mexico)||Fireball|45 sec-90 sec.|I witnessed a very large glow in the sky which cannot be attributable to any known aircraft and which descended into the ocean.|4/17/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62472.html|3|ndxe197812| I witnessed a very large glow in the sky which cannot be attributable to any known aircraft and which descended into the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While camping approximately six miles east of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on December 25, 1978 I witnessed a phenomenon at 9:30 PM Pacific Standard Time.  Looking north, I saw a very large glow perhaps 2,000 feet above the mountains.  These mountains were less than two miles away and my very first instinctive thought was that a 747 had exploded.  In a few seconds I realized I was viewing something very extraordinary and tried to absorb details while yelling to other campers to wake up and see what I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend&#39;s sister and mother emerged and immediately pushed the children back in the VW bus they were camping in.  One of them exclaimed it was a flying saucer--a thought I hadn&#39;t permitted myself to have.  The large orange glow must have been between 100-300 feet in length.  Within the elliptical glow were two smaller ellipses, perhaps one third of the way in from each side, which were brighter glows within the large orange glow and close to the color of a white florescent light.  One of the two women with me said there were two saucers, but I felt and still feel there was only one huge structure because the two brighter glows within the large glow stayed perfectly parallel to each other as the large glow descended to my left at about a 35 degree angel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed this descent for about 45 seconds to a minute and a half.  The glow disappeared behind a huge rock called Cabo Falso, about three quarters of a mile away.  As the glow came closer to the top of Cabo Falso the brightness began to fade--alsmost as if it were burning out.  There were no sparks, but the extremely bright glow grew much dimmer as it got close to the sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I went to Cabo to find out if anyone else saw this light.  I talked with five or six others who had seen it from an outdoor beach bar and they said the glow went into the ocean.  Like myself, they were teachers enjoying a Christmas vacation.  The next year I spoke with a lady named Elsa who was married to Harvey--a couple we camped with for about ten years.  She told me that Harvey would not permit her to talk about it, but she had seen a large saucer hovering over brush not too far from where she was camped.  The saucer then flew above the mountains where I first saw it.  The next morning, Elsa told me, she examined the nearby brush and it had been burned a brown color by the saucer.  Elsa and Harvey have both passed away--they were in their 70&#39;s in 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall trying to listen if I could hear this glow, but the only identifiable sound was hundreds of coyotes howling from a mile or more away and beneath the glow.  There was nothing surreal about the experience--it seemed natural.  I thought at the time that all you had to do to see things like this is to spend a lot of time outdoors at night.  I have seen strange lights on occasion since, but these have always been 20 or 30 miles away and not identifiable.  The experience was the most memorable one of my life.<n>

I observed directly overhead just above tree top an Chevron shaped Aircraft with no fuseluge (No it wasn&#39;t a Stealth) pass ever so slowly above us.  I could make out two rows of lights on the bottom of the wings (eight lights each row) white light almost recessed into the wings.  The object made very little noise it was not engine noise neither was their any vapor tail.  Across the road (Rte 7) was the north end of Moody AFB, and F4 (D) Phantom jets were making their approach to the flight line, this object headed directly towards those landing F4&#39;s.  I was half expecting some collision but the Chevron object flew directly above the F4&#39;s and amazingly the F4&#39;s never aborted or broke from their landing approach.  The above craft was about 40 foot long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background at that time I was 22 years old, sober and a Senior Airman enlisted in the Air Force at Moody AFB, located at Valdosta GA. Today I am a Senior Debug Techician up in Massachusetts, (Won&#39;t mention company name).  The object was Chevron shaped. Not pointed on the ends but rounded.<n>

It was early evening and I was looking out the window.  I saw some lights that started rising up and I said, &#34;Oh my God, there&#39;s something out there!&#34; and my sister and mother rushed to the window to see.  It was shaped like two pie plates inverted together with lights around the edge of various colors and a red light on the top.  It had openings that looked almost like small, round windows that were between the lights on the edge.  The surface was smooth and metallic looking.  It just hovered above the ground without a sound for a few minutes and then took off straight up into the sky in the blink of an eye.  I don&#39;t think it was more than 50 yards from the house; it was really close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really strange thing about it is that all of us have different memories of what we saw.  I remember my brother and uncle being there but neither of them remember it or think they were there.  My mother remembers it going over the house and then hovering and my sister remembers being outside and watching it go over the house, hover and then take off in the sky.  It seems like it was still a little light when I first saw it, but when it just took off straight up, it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &#34;Watch that silver disc up there,&#34; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don’t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&#34;kinda neat&#34; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn’tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!  It took awhile, but I finally fell back to sleep and to my knowledge, nothing else happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Father owned his own agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, I was a sophmore at Huntington Park High School at the time.

This is very old that was never reported; I don&#39;t think I ever made a formal report of this before -- I really don&#39;t know why not-- maybe I thought people would judge me in a bad way.  Anyhow, my brother and I saw the object from the back seat of our car as we were on a trip with our parents from Nevada to Oregon.... it was really late and the other kids in the car were asleep.. but not us 2.  It was between about 1977 and 1979 and I think it was on Christmas break or possibly summer break... exact date and year or time of night I am not sure of, but the sight was definitely clear.  It was possibly 30 meters or so from us on the right hand side of the road down in the forest... we were situated at a level slightly higher than the object and the road was pretty curvy.  The thing was about 10 feet across maybe... dome shaped with hanging down undulating legs.  The whole thing was like neon -  glowing in the dark  - even the legs. The top dome had different  colored (I think oval) lights going all the way around the dome.  It was so long ago I wish I had drawn an exact likeness, but I definitley remember these things.  It was such a beautiful object hovering just above the forest floor.  We only saw it for a moment but it was clear... no distant nebulous lights or anything.  Still, my brother and I really had not discussed it much over our lifetime. I think we might have tried to tell our parents later on, but they must have laughed it off and no report was made.  My brother and I are both highly educated. We are not red-neck storytellers or something.  I have no wish of any notoriety at all. I am just curious.  I even called my brother this evening to ask about it and he laughed and said yeah that octopus thing ...that was definitely strange.  (He was 2 years younger at the time we saw it and maybe had a less clear memory of it, but he definitely confirmed that he had never seen anything like it and he still thinks it very odd).  I would like to know if anyone has seen this specific type of object besides us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stopped to see exactly what these things might be and encountered another couple who had also stopped for the same reason. We did not converse with each other. Since it was Decemeber 10th, it was quite cold and clear. I stood on the side of the road and observed the four lights/disks for some time. To the naked eye, they appeared slightly larger than the moon. They were motionless, hovering at what appeared to be approximately 1,500-2500 feet. A more precise calculation was impossible, since there was no way to gauge their true size. As I recall, some 21 years later, the four &#34;disks&#34; changed formation while I was observing them. Since I had been at the racetrack, I had my trusty binoculars along, a pair of 7x35 magnification. Looking thru my glasses, I could only discern one thing of any interest: these objects, whatever they were, had a colored lights on the outer edges of the diameter; the colors were different; one was red, the other blue. The interior of these disks had no definition whatsover. They just looked light some sort of self-illuminating disk. They did not seem to illuminate the ground below, as far as I could tell. The one thing that was curious to me was that they were overhead in the vicinity of a small, part-time radion station, WJUN, which is comprised of a small cement block building and a transmitter tower. I stood there silently watching this phenomenon for some 10-15 minutes and finally departed due to the inclement weather and lack of any appreciable &#34;activity&#34; from these objects, aside from their changing of formation. They were still overhead when I left. The following day, someone (the couple on the side of the road?) wrote to the local paper, The Lewistown Sentinel about this event. The nitwit at the paper responded that they were probably helicopters. Whatever these things were, they were NOT helicopters. There was no sound coming from these o! bjects. As a footnote to my experience, I noticed several weeks later in the Sunday paper supplement, Parade Magazine, that folks in Australia has sighted the EXACT same four objects down there! Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. This is the first time I have recounted my 1978 experience for publication. I have absolutely no idea what those four silvery objects were.<n>

I looked and couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. it was right there but unidentifiable. it was a big &#34;something&#34;, it made a low humming sound, it had red and green lights on it. i got scared and rolled the window up, drove to the corner, turned left and parkd in front of house. got out of car, looked toward lake. it was gone. i thought wow, what the helll was that. just then eyes were drawn toward sky, i had to bend way back to look at very huge object way way up in sky, but still close enough to observe. six or eight sides, dark brown, metallic, heavy. wondered how could it stay up there? red, green, white light, made no sound, wondered how something so big got from the lake to way up there in the sky so fast with out making any noise? windows went arou! nd. i could see in the windows. saw some people i thought. i was so afraid of it, i just looked at it and said out loud, &#34;take me&#34; I&#39;m yours. and a thought came immediately into my head. said, we already took you. we are bringing you back. i ran into the house. it was getting light out. it only takes 40 minutes to get from edison to asbury park, but hours passed, at least four, i wanted to go in and call the police, but i passed out cold. in the am around 10ish i woke up ran down stairs looked in sky but it was gone. for a long long time after i heard high frequency sounds in my head, my intuitive power was heightened and to this day i have experiences numerous spiritual experiences. called police two years later. they had nothing to say. went to local hypnotist years later. said it was a dream (not).<n> <n><n> <n><n> had other encounters since then. not afraid any more. consider my self lucky for having had the experience. i have not been the same since. the experience changed my life. not business as usual. i noticed paramus 1978 had similar experience. okay. i know that i am not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Their bedroom was next to my bedroom - both had windows on the side of the house; my parents&#39; bedroom was in the rear; I shared a bedroom with my brothers in the front of the house; both bedrooms were on the second floor.)  I sat up in the bed to listen to what they were saying. My brothers then awoke and asked what was going on.  I said I didn&#39;t know, but that I heard my parents talking about something on the side of the house, so, since my bed was directly under the side window, I pulled back the blinds and looked out.  The night was very bright, like under a full moon on a clear night, and there were no leaves on the trees, so I could see very clearly (as best as one could at night) down to the neighbor&#39;s lawn next door and saw there 3-4 &#34;little men&#34; in silver jump suits with head covering pointing what looked like an old-fashioned stand-up tripod camera up towards my parents&#39; window.  These did not look like the classic &#34;gray aliens&#34;, but were probably only about 4 feet tall, very thin, and had slits for eyes and mouth and two little holes for a nose.  They almost looked child-like, or robotic.  It seemed they noticed me peering out and swung the &#34;camera&#34; over toward me in the window.  I then felt absolutely paralyzed and my vision started to &#34;blue&#34; out, as if I had stared at an old-fashioned camera&#39;s flash bulb and now saw nothing but the flash.  I then came out of this blindness and paralysis a few minutes later due to my father shaking me.  He told me the same thing had just happened to him before I looked out the window and my moth! er had t o snap him out of it.  He then yelled at all of us to stay away from the window, and especially don&#39;t look into any blue light outside, which we dutifully did.  All this time, my mother was trying to call the police but said the phone wasn&#39;t working.  She seemed to be starting to panic.  She then started turning on all the lights and ran downstairs to let our dog out into the backyard.  I guess she thought the dog would scare these things away.  We all then starting yelling at her to close and lock the door, while one of my brothers was insisting on going out and getting the dog back in the house.  Things started getting very panicky - and that&#39;s when I woke up with my heart racing.  After I relayed this to my friends and my brother, I saw him turn white and start talking to his girlfriend privately.  I thought he was concerned that I went off the deep end, but the next day they approached me and told me he had had the same dream - down to every detail.  We both got the chills and decided not to talk about it any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
