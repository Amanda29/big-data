10/15/57 20:30|Houston (Ellington AFB)|TX|Light|3 seconds|5 to 6" diameter light, extremely fast, silent, made an impossible inside 45 degree turn, and sped away horizontally.|9/17/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14094.html|2|ndxe195710| 5 to 6&#34; diameter light, extremely fast, silent, made an impossible inside 45 degree turn, and sped away horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report goes back to Autumn of 1957. One object. I first noticed the entire area outside the rec room illuminated like day.  Jumped over the couch to the open door and looked up at this huge light moving down toward me and 45 degrees. When its size (at arm&#39;s lgth) reached 5 inches in dia, it veered away horizontally and out of sight. It was as though I could feel the heat of the light on my face..no detail to see, literally like looking into a headlight. Absolutely no sound. No other lights visible. Altitude...as it vanished may have been 60 to 100 ft.  This happened so fast It is difficult estimating its&#39;size and altitude.  Duration of sighting about 3 seconds. I don&#39;t recall the moon being out, but it was dark out, cool and clear. I was wondering if others may have reported this. Should have been seen by many!<n>

10/15/57 01:45|England|AR|Disk|unknown|Unexplained object seen on a clear fall night by a reputable person. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56677.html|4|ndxe195710| Unexplained object seen on a clear fall night by a reputable person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter has been related to me many times by my mother since it happened in the fall of 1957 or 1958.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, she has never been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, and is not a drinker.  She is well respected to this day in the community, and has numerous friends who would testify to her honesty and sobriety.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In October of &#39;57 or &#39;58, my older sister, who would have been about 11 or 12 at the time, woke up in the middle of the night sick, and called for mother.  My mother heard her, and when she got up out of bed, she saw from the window a glowing orange disk or saucer shaped object hovering over our yard, very close to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in the country, and the night was clear, cool, with a light breeze.  As she approached the window to get a better look, she noticed what she has called indentations on the edge of the object.  To describe what happened next would be the really unusual aspect of this report.  She got the very distinct mental impression that they (her words) meant her no harm, and was told not to fear this event.  After watching the object for an undetermined amount of time, it went straight up at an extremely high rate of speed until it was no longer visible.  There were no sounds heard.  I have often wondered what may have happened to her during the time my sister called from her room, because she has said it took mother forever to come to her.  She actually didn&#39;t tell us about this until a few weeks later, but there is no denying the fact she believes what she saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another incident happened in March of 2000 near here, when a &#34;fireball&#34; crashed into some woods and fields close to the county line.  Second hand reports indicate a fire so hot it melted paint off the sheriff&#39;s vehicle at a distance of over one mile away.  Unmarked vehicles were seen for a few days afterwards, and the local inhabitants were not allowed to see what happened.  After all these years, I believe it&#39;s time this report was seen by more than just family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/5/57 19:00|St. Paul|MN|Light|45 secs|A bright light was apparently chased by several military jets.|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12252.html|5|ndxe195710| A bright light was apparently chased by several military jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the fall of 1957, shortly before the Sputnik satellite went up, I was in front of our house in St. Paul when I heard the roar of F-89s. The F-89 was an all-weather, 2-seater, twin engine fighter interceptor based at the main airport. With its very loud J-35 jet engines, they never or rarely ever flew at low altitudes over the metro area. It wasn&#39;t unusual to hear them take off, but it sounded as if the noise was lasting longer than usual. It was about 7:00pm, and already dark (before the Daylight Savings Time era). (I couldn&#39;t positively identify the planes, but there was nothing else located there which made that much noise. The military areas of the airport also hosted F-80s, T-33s, C-47s, C-119s, Navy Phantoms, P2V Neptune sub hunters, helicopters, and miscellaneous others - none of which made such a horrendous racket. Commercial jets were not yet using the MSP airport except for 1 French twin engine jet which came and went, one day, as part of a sales mission.) After a while, I looked up and saw a row of red-hot exhaust pipes (or exhaust) and navigation lights all westbound, coming from the east at perhaps 5,000 feet. It looked like a string of firey brands. They were making one heck of a racket, and I took them for the F-89&#39;s. Then I noticed a bright light in the sky - brighter than Venus in the western sky, except this light was in the wrong place to be Venus: it was south-southwest from me at an angle of almost 45 degrees, and hanging nearly over the airport. At first I thought it must be some kind of expensive, well-done prank. Then I thought it might be a helicopter with intensely bright lights. Finally, I noticed that the planes appeared to be headed straight for the object. The object remained in place as if it had all day to make up its mind if it were going to move or not. Finally, it DID begin to move - slowly at first - towards the southwest. The jets adjusted course to the southwest. Then the object picked up more and more speed, and finally turned off its brilliant white light, and sped away. It was still barely visible for a few moments after it switched off its light, and had a dull, glowing orange appearance, and had some small white lights around the main body. The jets followed in that direction, and eventually disappeared. All the noise finally stopped. I ran into the house and checked all the TV channels expecting to see a report on the object chased by the F-89&#39;s, but there were no reports. Nothing. Just your typical Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke, etc. Then I finally sat down to read the evening paper. On the front page was a small article which said: &#34;Mystery Object Sighted Over RAF Base. A mystery object was sighted today over one of Britain&#39;s RAF bases, but when pursued, it doused its light and sped away.&#34; I cut out the article and posted it on the bulletin board in our high school science class, explaining that I might have seen the same object.<n>
10/1/57 22:00|Northeast Cape AFS|AK||10-15min|Radar sighting and filming|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04918.html|6|ndxe195710| Radar sighting and filming<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a radar operator at an early warning radar sight. At about 2200hrs we painted a target about 200 miles west, in Soviet territory. It was moving eastward at a high rate...about 10,000kts. We had no height finding radar, so could only guess at the altitude. We thought it was a missile. In accordance with SOP for picking up unidentified targets, we turned on the scope camera. As the target continued eastbound we lost radar contact, but the next site, at Cape Romanzoff picked it up. We were later told that the target was carried continuously until it was east of Iceland, and that the total time was about twenty minutes.<n>
10/1/57 21:00|Paterson|NJ|Disk|10 seconds|Formation of approximately 8 light gray metallic disks silently crossing the night sky around October 1957 in northern NJ|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42566.html|7|ndxe195710| Formation of approximately 8 light gray metallic disks silently crossing the night sky around October 1957 in northern NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about 13 (not sure of exact date) a friend and I saw a formation of about 8 disk shaped UFOs silently cross the sky.  At the time we were both amateur astronomers (built our own 6&#34; telescopes) and spent a lot of time star gazing.  The night we saw the UFOs was clear and moonless.  I was in the process of moving the telescope from one sky object to the next when I caught sight of a v-shaped formation of about 8 circular shaped objects crossing the sky almost directly overhead.  I immediately shouted to my friend and he saw them as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each object was about the apparent size of a full moon, were circular in shape and had a dull, light grey metallic color to them.  I&#39;m not sure whether they were visible as a result of reflected light from the ground or whether they were semi-transparent and lit from within.  I am sure that they seemed metallic and definitely gave the feeling of being &#34;hardware.&#34;  Also, the fact that they made absolutely no sound left a strong impression on me.  We watched them as they flew across the sky at uniform speed and finally disappeared behind a building.  We saw them for about 5-10 seconds.  They remained in formation throughout the sighting and there was no individual movement by a disk within the formation.  I believe as they receded you could see that they were disk shaped and that the direction of flight was north to south but I can&#39;t swear to these things due to the length of time that has lapsed since my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point we were both confident we had seen something not made on earth.  Being amateur astronomers, we were familiar with observing high flying aircraft, satellites, comets, meteor showers, Aurora, etc. and I know that what we saw that night can not be explained as some natural or man made phenomenon.  We bought all the local newspapers the next day thinking that we would see our sighting confirmed by others but didn&#39;t see any related stories.  I have been watching the night skies ever since and never saw another UFO.  I hope this report helps with your data base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/57 20:30|Martelle|IA|Cigar|unk|I Fly and have been in Viet Nam and around the world and have never seen anything like it again.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18348.html|8|ndxe195710| I Fly and have been in Viet Nam and around the world and have never seen anything like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure if it was 1956 or 57 as I was only 9 or 10 at the time.  We had left my grandfathers farm a mile west of the martelle just over the Linn county line and were going north on highway 1. We were going to my aunts farm near Anamosa with my mother in the back pass side and my grandmother in the front. My Grandfather was driving and I was in the back on his side.  We were were 2 or 3 miles north of Martelle when the radio on the car stopped playing music and had nothing but static.  The car then started to stall and my grandfather  pulled off the right side of the road.  Just as he stoped it became like daylight out as a vary bright cigar shapped object appeared to the west of the car over a field. All I can remember is that it looked huge and was so bright that I was able to see all the picked corn rows in the field. It was a bright orange and with what looked like large port holes that were bright orange.  This may have been for 20 or 30 sec. and the next thing that I remember  is it being dark and that  I rolled down the window and stuck my head out looking up and seeing all the stars as it was a clear night.  We all said what happened and then just looked at each other.  My grandfather started the car and the radio came on and we went on to my aunts farm.  When we got there they wanted to know where we had been as we then realized that it was 22:00.   I have always wondered about this but as my mother is the only one  still living and she never wants to talk about it  I have never told enyone else about this event.  If anyone might have also seen this event I would be interested in what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident occurred about October of 1956 or ‘57.  At the time, I was Assistant station manager for a major airline in Anchorage as well as an experienced pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my men and I went on a caribou hunting trip between Nelchina and Tazlina, Alaska, several hours drive from Anchorage.  Without going into all of the minor details, we missed our hunting party and caught a ride into the bush with another party, hoping to find our group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were dropped off and we hunted the next morning and that evening we caught a ride back in a jeep with some other hunters.  The trail we followed was on the top of a ridge about 600 feet above the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the trail zigzagged down the mountain ridge and at the bottom while heading to climb another smaller ridge, we became stuck in a wet swampy area.  A few more hunters came down the trail and we all attempted to get the vehicles out.  They became stuck too.  Failing this, two of the nine guys who were now there walked out to the highway to get a bug swamp buggy to pull us out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there talking, we saw and heard another jeep coming along the ridge.  They became stuck on the top of the ridge.  We could hear them pushing and pulling but they gave up and two of them walked down the trail to where we were.  The other two stayed with their jeep and meat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When these two were about half way down, we saw another light coming along the top of the ridge toward the stuck jeep.  The vehicle made no sound, no engine noise whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle stopped some distance behind the stuck jeep and sat there for about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All at once this object dropped or sped straight down the mountain ridge in seconds and it stopped instantly about ¾ of the way from the bottom and began moving on in the same direction it had been going while up on the ridge.  It passed below the two hunters walking down the trail and continued on out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could distinctly hear the men talking on the ridge with the jeep and the two who were walking down the trail. Yet we heard no sound from the object. It had a steady reddish orange light which did not blink or pulsate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon at the time was full and the sky was covered with a thin overcast and scattered clouds moving below them permitting some light reflecting on the snow.  So it was not completely dark.  We could just see the outline of the jeep against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us could tell the shape of the object which had sped so fast.  The two men on top of the ridge did not see the object at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The side of the ridge was at about a 45 degree slope.  The terrain was full of scattered alders and there is no way a vehicle could make that vertical decent at that speed through the alders and stop instantly and continue on a horizontal path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us heard a sound of any type other than the jeep idling up on top the ridge and the other men talking.  I think all of us had the hair on our necks standing straight out. None of us had any idea of what this object was.  We could not tell if it was on the ground or if it was above the terrain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, yes we eventually were pulled out and got safely back to the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
