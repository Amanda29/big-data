We looked out of the window and saw a hovering cigar shaped object. It stayed in one place for a short time and then took off at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I had gone to sleep for the night, when we were awakened by our room filling with light, as if a giant flash bulb had gone off in our window. Our heads were at the window. We looked over towards each other curiously, and then wordlessly, we rolled over, slid up the wall and peeked out of the window. I saw a cigar shaped, hovering, metal looking thing with evenly spaced lights running along the side. I think they were red, or redish. It stayed for a second or two and then left quickly at a rate of speed that I&#39;d never seen before. It was out of sight in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds. We went downstairs and told our Mom. She said that it was probably a barium rocket that they were using to test the Aurora Borealus out at Poker Flats rocket testing range north of town.<n>
9/15/69 22:00|Merced|CA|Unknown|10-15 minutes|One evening when I was returning from classes at the local college, I was driving west on M Street that at that time led back into town|5/28/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44102.html|3|ndxe196909| One evening when I was returning from classes at the local college, I was driving west on M Street that at that time led back into town from where the college was located on the outskirts.  Merced is located about six miles, I believe south, from Castle Air Force Base, which at that time was a SAC base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very dark, as there were no street lights yet erected, and very little housing along the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached town I looked to my right, and out in the field there appeared to be a cone of light shining down from somewhere high in the sky.  My heart started pounding, so I pulled over to the side of the road, and rolled my window down to see if it was possibly a helicopter of some sort.  The cone of light was devoid of light in its center, which is a little hard to explain just how it appeared to me.  It was as if only the edges of the cone were lighted, and the interior was hollow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was static, never moved as far as I can remember, but every exact in its appearance.  I sat and watched it for several minutes, never hearing any sound at all.  I assumed any helicopter would have made a sound, but all was silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Merced at the time was a very small town, and there were no cars on the road, or foot traffic on the road that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there entranced until all of a sudden the cone of light sucked up into itself ... just disappeared as if it had never happened.  With my heart still pounding, and shaking like a leaf, I started the car, drove to my parnets house, and woke my dad up from a sound sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I insisted he call the air base to see if they&#39;d spotted anything unusual on their radar, or if they&#39;d received any more reports of a strange sighting.  I spoke with them myself then, and they assured me nothing unusual had been reported, or sighted ... I still, to this day, don&#39;t believe them, because I know what I saw, and didn&#39;t hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can remember how eerily calm the night was, and how totally enchanting the sight was to see a hollow cone of light shining down from high in the sky onto nothing, only a few hundred feet from my car.  As a photographer I&#39;m usually very observant, critical, and attuned to trusting my eye.  There was definetly something strange in the sky that night for me to remember it so vividly today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since ...  I have seen an irregular triangle of lights hovering above the 405  freeway on the way back from Mexico, and a strange brilliant flash of green light that covered most of the sky, as far as the eye could see, in the area around the San Onofre nuclear plant, and another time coming over what is commonly know as &#34;The Grapevine&#34;, a section of what is now Interstate Five between Los Angeles, and Bakersfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, and I both witness a bright red light bouncing all over the sky.  On the other two occassions my daughters also witnessed the phenomenem<n>

As we watched the white light withdrew back into the saucer,colored lights came on around the circumferance of the craft .Blue , red, yellow, green, started to flash in different sequences .There was no sound heard at all , from the craft .Then lights came on inside the top half and we could see porthole like windows now . We could see shadows pass by the portholes at times , but never saw whomever was operating the craft . Without a sound the saucer slowly started to move upward , to just above the trees , the lights inside stayed on and the saucer very slowly moved away staying just tree top high .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

9/9/69 21:10|Austin|TX|Sphere|12-15 Minutes|A ring of light appeared, filled in with golden light, increased in brightness while moving, then gradually faded away.|12/14/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/040/S40925.html|5|ndxe196909| A ring of light appeared, filled in with golden light, increased in brightness while moving, then gradually faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A thin, perfect circle of silver light appeared northeast of my position.  As I observed the circle, it began to fill in with a faint golden light.  The light filled in the circle with irregular &#34;rivulets&#34; of golden light until the circle glowed a uniform golden color, not unlike that of a full moon except that it was perfectly uniform with no &#34;craters&#34; or surface imperfections.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arm&#39;s length and about 30-35 degrees off the horizon.  I had a clear view with no obstructions.  The circle of golden light was well defined at first.  It then began to slowly increase in brightness until it appeared to &#34;boil&#34; with the boundaries becoming indistinct.  It then began to move in an arc toward the North maintaining a uniform elevation above the horizon.  I then began to notice that it was decreasing in brightness slowly as it moved.  It lost brightness uniformly until it was once again a distinct circle of light.  It continued to slowly move toward the North until it was no longer visible.  It moved a total of approximately 40 degrees of arc in 10 minutes or so.  No sound was apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/3/69 20:00|Rosedale (Canada)|ON|Cylinder|about 5 min.|Elongated oval object with a soft orange/red glow, moving silently.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43256.html|6|ndxe196909| Elongated oval object with a soft orange/red glow, moving silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rosedale is a small village north-east of Toronto, Ontario. My parents had a trailer in a park there for summer use. This evening, I was outside by myself (unfortunately) just taking in the evening air before returning to our home in the city. At the time, I was a university student and have since gone on to become a Laboratory Technologist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I was looking up in the night sky at the millions of stars one can only see in the country away from city lights when I spotted something rather strange. I was looking east,across the river and above the treeline at what appeared to be a slow-moving oval object.I put &#34;cylinder&#34; as the shape of the craft because it wasn&#39;t really &#34;cigar&#34; shaped as it was thicker than what I think of as cigar shaped. It seemed to be a soft red/orange color, not really &#34;glowing&#34;, just a soft orange light. I don&#39;t know how big it was because I don&#39;t know how high up it was but it must have been fairly large because when it got to about a 70 degree angle from me, it stopped and then made a 90 degree angle from it&#39;s initial direction and seemed to follow the river in a northerly direction going extremely fast. It seemed to follow the curve of the earth and I could follow it up until the time it met the horizon up river. There was no sound until it made the 90 degree angle and moved away rapidly and then there was a &#34;whoosh&#34; as it displaced the air. Can&#39;t explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/69 02:30|Walpole|MA|Oval|5 minutes|The object just hovered for a few minutes without making sound.  There was no movement in the trees and the silence was deafening.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34098.html|7|ndxe196909| The object just hovered for a few minutes without making sound.  There was no movement in the trees and the silence was deafening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early September (date is approximate), and I was 15 at the time.  I had my bedroom shades down about 3/4 of the way, and the two windows in my room opened to meet the bottom of the shades.  We lived on the second floor of a two family house that was set back off the street about 100 yards and on a hill.  My bedroom was in the front of the house and the windows overlooked the front yard, driveway, and the street.  There was also a street light on the other side of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was woken up around 2:30 in the morning because of a loud rustling in the trees.  When I opened my eyes, I noticed blinking red lights outside my window.  At first I thought it was a fire engine out on the street, but realized that I didn&#39;t hear the loud idleing engine that a fire engine has.  So, I got up out of bed to look out the window.  When I got to the window, I wasn&#39;t able to see the street, the street light, or the houses across the street.  I was met with a row of lights that were slowly blinking red then changing to white and red again, on the side of a gray object, that was level with the window.  I saw what seemed to be the bottom edge of the object, and it appeard to be oval.  The object just hovered there for a few minutes without making a sound.  There was no movement in the trees; and the silence was deafening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I backed away from the window, scared, and went back to my bed; never taking my eyes off the window.  When I was back in bed, I noticed that the lights were also visable in my other bedroom window which was on the same wall and approxiimately five or six feet right of the first window.  After a few minutes, the lights stopped, and I noticed the glow of the street light coming in the window again.  There was no noise of any kind when the lights stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never went back to sleep that night, and as soon as it was light outside, I went out into the yard and street to look around.  Nothing seemed disturbed or out of place.  I asked my parents and neighbors if anyone heard or saw anything during the night, noone did.  I explained to my parents what I saw, and they brushed it off as just being a fire engine; but I know that it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
