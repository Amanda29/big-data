One of the shifts that I worked was 5a-5p and during the 2001-2003 time period as if you were to face north at the Wasatch mountains every night there were lights that appeared on the mountain at the top.  I am not aware of any roads in this area but there is a ski resort on the other side of this mountain but about 30-40 minutes from where thee lights were seen.  There would be lights anywhere from 1-7 and thelights would be present for several minutes turn off, come back on. Sometimes they would stay on for 30 minutes or so.  The distance between the base and this location is about 15 miles and these lights are extremely bright.  I went onto google maps and zoomed into the area where these lights came from, a ridge line, there aren&#39;t any roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I was looking at the stars I noticed one started to grow larger, I gathered my friends attention and pointed it out to him. As we watched it the object continued to grow to about 5 times its origional size. After it had enlarged about 5-8 other spheres of light (looking similar to large stars) seemed to explode outwards from the origional light. After these lights spread outwards for about 10sec they &#34;imploded&#34; back into the origional light which then shrank back to the origional size of a star and then faded away. This first encounter lasted about 30 seconds and never made any sudden or quick movements. besides exploding and imploding it stayed in the same spot. After this sighting I was turning around to go back and grab my friends video camera when he convinced me not to.  About 1 minute later we were still watching the sky and we encountered the same exact lights again in the same part of the sky.  The lights were all the normal white (star) color  If any other person(s) has seen these objects in Florida I would greatly wish to be contacted. Any video or photos of these objects would be greatly appreciated!

They were extremely high in the air. They were as high as any star. They were visibally higher than any visible satellite. then later another light flwe in a straight line from south to north. Then later on another from north to south. then we saw 2 more a different time one more circling and then the last travelling in a straight line from east to west. This was not the first time we have seen them. We have seen them in summers past while we are sitting out looknig at the stars. I an very curious to find out what these fast moving &#34;stars&#34; are.<n>
6/30/02 22:00|Honolulu|HI|Circle|Years|Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54230.html|4|ndxe200206| Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first encounter was with two friends I no longer have contact with.  It was probably about 5-6 years ago around 10:00p.m.  We we&#39;re skateboarding behind the gym of an elementary school and decided to take a rest.  We lodged our skateboards into these vents against the gym wall and layed back on them.  We had a clear view of the sky that night and I noticed a green star in the sky.  It was bright and very distinguishable amongst all the other stars in the sky.  I pointed it out to my two friends and they noticed it right away.  We layed back and watched it for about 10 seconds when all of a sudden it came down right in front of our faces, all the way from high up in the sky right down in front of us in a split second.  The object was emitting a green glow that was very bright, but I didn&#39;t notice anything else light up around us.  It was completely silent making no sound at all, and this object was big.  My friends and I made no sound and just stared at it.  I just couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  It probably hovered in front of us for around 10 seconds, as if it were staring back at us.  Afterwards it shot off back into space as fast as it had come down in front of us and we lost sight of it a second after it shot directly back up into the atmosphere.  Afterwards my friends stood up screaming their heads off and running.  I didn&#39;t know what to do or think so I just followed them.  Years and years later my friends and I were just discussing UFO encounters.  This wasn&#39;t my first either, but it is the most significant as it leads to a chain of sightings.  So anyways, I told them about this one and they realized that we could try and head to the school gym to try and see if we could spot them again.  I thought it was a great idea and got excited, so we left.  At the gym we waited for a while, and sure enough my friend spotted one out of the corner of his eye.  It looked like a star, but it was movinhg, and then a few more started popping up and moving around in the sky.  They looked ! like sta rs, however some would fly low and close to the mountain next to us and these were green leaving green trails behind them.  These would move fast and then slowly, and then all of a sudden they would jet accross the sky leaving trails behind them.  We could spot up to even 6 at a time easily.  Some were straight above us, some were off in the distance.  We watched these from around 12:00 midnight until 5:00-6:00a.m.  after the sun comes up we could no longer see them.  I gathered more friends over time and we would make routine visits to the gym to spot more UFOs.  Sometimes we would see a lot, sometimes none at all.  One time one flew close to us, we could just tell it was close, especially by lining it up with the mountain next to us.  This one flew slow and was about the size of a quarter if you were to hold one at an arm&#39;s length in front of your face.  It flew from above our heads, all the way to the other side of the field and eventually passed the mountains and dissapeared behind some clouds.  There is no way these objects could be aircraft, it&#39;s impossible.  Nothing can move that slowly and then speed up that fast and maneuver they way they did.  Sometimes they would fly directly at each other as if they were going to collide and move away right before they would touch, and move at extreme speeds.  These were still flying around, the last time I checked about a year ago.  Sometimes I could see them from my apartment balcony, like one would just jet down really fast and dissapear.  I mainly only saw them at the school gym though.  I would love to have people investigate this.  I want this to go places and I was watching the National Geographic channel and heard about this place on a UFO show that they had on.  Please, check this out!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we brought video cameras afterwards to try and videotape some of these UFOs.  We were unable to capture any of them with our camera because the sky was just black and the video camera was horrible at picking anything up in that type of! setting Another thing is that the video cameras shut off at the same time while we were trying to record.  The batteries weren&#39;t drained or anything, but for some reason the cameras just shut off completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/30/02 21:00|Lansdale|PA|Formation|1 minute|3 red lights in triangular formation seen in Lansdale, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67844.html|5|ndxe200206| 3 red lights in triangular formation seen in Lansdale, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what year I saw this but I know it was sometime between 2000-2004 in the summer months.  I was standing on the front porch of my parents house in Upper Gwynedd, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.  I was catching a smoke and I looked out straight off my porch to the horizon where I saw 3 solid red lights in a triangular formation.  To give an idea of size, if I put my thumb up, I probably could’ve have covered all 3 from site.  I know this doesn&#39;t give a clear idea of size since there are too many variables.  There were no sounds from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am disheartened as I definitely dismissed this as nothing at the time and now I don‘t know when it happened.  I really always thought it had to be something that I just didn&#39;t know of.   But, I just finished watching an hour long show on the Chicago Tinley Park siting, which had supposedly been seen around the world in a matter of days.  Chills ran down my spine watching this as this is exactly what I saw.  And while the lack of date of occurrence, it is definitely possible that it happened in 2004, around the same time as the Tinley incident (which also happened in the summer.)  I will say, the minor differences, the lights in my case seemed to be closer together, and they unfortunately fell slowly below the horizon which has a high tree line.  However, this very well could’ve been the objects moving away from me, but I just don&#39;t know.  I can also say with certainty, that the objects moved in perfect unison and the lights were perfectly solid (no flickering/dimming).  There is NO way these were flares or aircraft lights.  There is a great deal of aircraft traffic in my area from Philadelphia International Airport.  Their landing pattern goes right over the Landsdale area.  There is also an innumerable amount of small plane airports in the area.  I&#39;m used to seeing commercial aircraft, small planes, military aircraft from Willow Grove Air Base, helicopters from Merck, helicopters from Medivac Hospitals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To add to my credibility, I have never seen UFO’s before, and even after this incident, I was doubtful that I saw anything unexplainable (only I couldn‘t explain it).  I am an audio video technician so I know the intricacies of video and the differences of seeing something with the naked eye vs. an image or video from a camera’s CCD or film.  These objects very well may have been the same as the videos from Chicago.  And one thing the show did not touch on is this eye/camera differences.  I can say the lights were probably the same because they were perfectly solid, and there’s little doubt in my mind that the lights seen in Chicago were just as solid.  Most people don’t realize that a camera will never see a solid light as perfectly solid.  And judging by the videos I just saw, they seemed like they very well could’ve been perfectly solid, made seemingly flickering from camera abarition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that’s it.  I’m sure I’m just one in thousands with this siting, but I wanted to add my two cents.  MUCH THANKS to the History Channel for bringing this in the public eye…I may never have acknowledged what I experienced as something important!!!<n>

Later 3 small triangular crafts, 8-10&#39;wide, 10-12&#39; alt. 45 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with a group of astronomers doing some star viewing through some privately owned telescopes.  Someone yelled and said look at that.  A huge, foot ball field sized, triangular shaped craft blacked out the stars.  It was silent, moving very slow (about 7 MPH) and only 50 feet or so over head.  There were lights at each point of the triangle.  We watched for about 20 minutes at which point it made a strange right angle manuveur and speed off.  Two military jets were chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later I saw 3 triangular crafts manuvering through the mountains.  They were very small.  About 8 to 10 feet wide.  They were fast, silent, and very very low to the ground.  Not more than 10 feet above ground.  They were gone within about 30 to 45 seconds.  I have never heard of the little ones.  Have you????<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates indirectly that the date of the sighting in 2002 is approximate.  We have asked him to attempt to determine the date more accurately.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry to inform you but I am not a &#39;mister&#39; (Mr.).  You guys sure took a long time to get back to me.  UFO activity must be getting really busy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, lets see ............. This was about 4 years ago and I was never good with dates anyway, but I will do my best.  The astronomy club met on Wednesday evenings.  So in regards to the large craft, I can say for certain it was on a Wednesday night.  It was during the summer months and there was no moon.  You don&#39;t get good star watching when there is a full moon as it gives off too much light for star viewing.  So if you go back to the summer months of 2002 and look for dates on Wednesdays when the moon was not up between about 8:30 or 9 PM, that would give you a couple of dates to go from. I don&#39;t have the tools to research that.  No one logged this that I know of but there was at least 12 or 13 people there that night.  These were all scientists.  (They usually don&#39;t believe in anything).  In fact, the president of the astronomy club, (Sirius Lookers), was only annoyed that this thing blocked out the stars and interrupted his lecture and he had to wait for it to pass.  Strange but true!  In fact, that was even stranger than the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the small triangular crafts, well, that was also in the summer months of the same year.  It was just around sundown.  These small crafts were pretty strange in the way they maneuvered around the red rocks of Sedona, AZ.  It reminded me of Luke Skywalker on the craft he drove through the woods in &#39;Star Wars&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were black, made no sound and I saw no lights on them, but then it wasn&#39;t quite dark yet, if that makes any difference.  I don&#39;t have any idea as to how aliens think when it comes to putting their lights on.  They drove these crafts only a few feet off the ground.  I was alone when I saw the small ones.  I did not log them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be more precise.  However, I did get another photograph of a UFO over Hoover Dam in 1991.  I dated that one, wrote down the time and even the type of film I used, shutter speed and the whole banana.   If you&#39;re interested in seeing it we can make arrangements for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through out my life, I have seen quite a number of UFO&#39;s.  I guess they just like hanging out with me. ????   Close encounters of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or whatever.  Name your number and I can probably come up with one.  I don&#39;t mean to sound flippant but that&#39;s just the way it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Literally, the resort is just a few sandy mountainous “hills” away from the military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was living in the midst of undeveloped desert land which somehow allowed for clarity...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting into my car to drive to La Quinta and I looked up and saw… not an ordinary BLIMP… but some silver-colored aircraft resembling a BLIMP in shape — but far more MASSIVE hovering above the houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was simply immense. Perhaps as large as 2 or 3 city blocks in Manhattan… And I would say it took up about 1/4 of the panorama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was floating in the sky fairly low. There was a thin ribbon of moving rainbow colors traveling around it’s girth like a belt and when I squinted, I could see it was actually a moving line of colored gases… I assume fuel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was so frightening, I hopped into my car and bee-lined it towards La Quinta with my dog. As I drove away, I turned back around for a moment to make certain I was not overreacting to this thing… but I hadn’t. It was just as frightening driving away. It was DEFINITELY NOT alien. This was home-grown from 29 Palms Airforce Base. I am certain that the aircraft I saw was either a WARSHIP… or a MONSTER SURVEILLANCE apparatus [to be used on American citizens... rest assured]. NO ONE reported a thing on the local news about it which only solidified my conviction that it was from the air force base! I personally know that their technology is about 100 years ahead of what they claim, so I had no illusions about this being extra-terrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another night ... late ... and right after 9/11 I saw a huge, black triangular aircraft that also just hung practically right over my house in the desert — without moving. There were lights beneath it but not bright and that too WAS NOT A UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can take this for what it’s worth... but the feeling I got from this aircraft was very negative... even sinister. And that was not my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am posting this now because I was alerted minutes ago that a Blimp-type aircraft was seen in Stephenville Texas recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I observed it for a while thinking it maybe it was a plane but after a while I noticed no movement I could see local aircraft moveing in and out of cloud cover but to the naked eye this object seem not to move I then ask for some binoculars to watch the object it seem to move very fast  up and down really fast.

I was born in Bogotá, Colombia.  Actually I’m living in California three years ago.  From the time I had opportunity to find your web side, I was encouraged to write down my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2002, when I was living in Bogotá, I went to bed 11:00 pm very tired after a hard day in my job as import manager for a big multinational.  I woke up at about 2:30 am and It was like being between sleepy and awake.  I saw just next to my bed a long figure looking at me.  I’ll describe it for you:  Very thin, as skinny as a skeleton.  More than 7 feet height.  His body was like transparent gelatin.  His two eyes black and very big.  His head was as big as our heads but small from his neck and wide on top.  He had four long fingers, 4.5 inches each one.  His hands looked like two spiders.  He had like a purple fluorescent radiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t feel fear. I was very interesting on him.  I raised my arm to touch him and he did the same. I could touch his hand with my finger, and I don’t remember anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2007, living in California I had a dream.

6/30/02 00:30|Huntsville (Canada)|ON|Flash|20 seconds|Extremely fast, bright, low altitude object instantaneously changes directions at angles of less than 90 degrees.|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23777.html|18|ndxe200206| Extremely fast, bright, low altitude object instantaneously changes directions at angles of less than 90 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 12:30am (early sunday morning) June 30, a bright white object proceeded in a flash, much like that of a &#34;shooting star&#34; or an object burning up in our atmosphere.  The object was seen coming from the west, in an upward direction and then disappeared briefly.  Then to our surprise, the object reappeared and began to move at a high rate of speed over our heads, flashing on and off at equal intervals of approximately 1 second on and 1 second off, in a straight line in a south-east direction over Mary Lake in near the town of Huntsville in the Muskoka region of southern Ontario, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing on and off of the object was observed as a streak of intensely bright light in the sky, indicating a high rate of speed.  It was very cloudy and the only bright object in the night sky was the planet Venus.  This object had a light intensity that was much higher than that of any star or planet in the sky; I would equate it to the light intensity of a full moon on a clear night, concentrated at a single point streaking across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object passed directly over our position, it became much brighter, suggesting it would have been only a few thousand feet above us (not any higher than a commercial airliner would fly) The object flashed on and off about 4 or 5 times before reaching beyond the other side of the lake just above the treeline and lowering in light intensity (as the object was seen just above the treeline, this was a greater indication of the low altitude).  The object then immediately flashed and streaked in a west direction at an angle that appeared to be less than 90 degrees. The object did not have time to slow down, nor did it appear to slow down when it immediately changed direction approximately 1 second later and moved east (in the opposite direction) at a high rate of speed.  The object then made yet another immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking across the sky, just above the treeline in a west direction.  It then made one final immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking east and then dissappearing below the tree line following this final streak of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only possible explanation of what was seen as the object flashed east and then west four times in immediate succession would be four completely different meteors entering our atmosphere at equal intervals of time, in alternating directions and with the same angle of incidence into our atmosphere (as the object moved or &#34;streaked&#34; back and forth at incredible speeds it seemed to retrace its previous path; in other words, the streak of light created was always parallel with the surface of the earth and the same height above the treeline).  The possibility of this object infact being multiple meteors in the specific formations witnessed is an extremely unprobable occurrance, thereby strongly suggesting that this object was not of this earth or of any physical phenomena that we could scientifically explain.<n>

To me, depending on the size perspective, it seemed to be either a small craft reminiscent of the old Apollo Lunar Landers, or it was something like an Autogyro, the old &#34;flying chair&#34; device that&#39;s been used in military recon missions for decades. If it was the latter, the movement I saw on it could have been the person operating it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was seen by a great many people in the parking lot and by persons on the Eastern By-Pass. UFOs are very commonplace in the vicinity of the Blue Grass Army Depot and I wasn&#39;t surprised when the event did not make the local news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw it through an open window (not through the glass).  It came in from the south at 35 degrees from the horizontal.  It traveled down in a straight line.  It disappeared behind the ridge west of town.  It was a glowing yellow in color.  It was roughly ovoid in shape.  It was the size of my little finger nail held at arms length.  I got the impression (which might not be correct) that it was a large object quite a distance away (maybe 5 miles or so).  It traversed roughly 10 degres of the sky before disappearing behind the ridge.  After getting over my initial surprise, I jumped up and went to the window and observed the sky for another half minute, but saw no further activity.  I would be interested in knowing if any other San Francisco Bay Area residents saw this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be an exceptionally credible witness.

It was about 10:00 p.m. and dark outside and I was on the front porch (facing west), talking on the phone when all of a sudden there was a bright (kind of fluorescent) light that came over the house from the back and it went halfway out to my yard. There was no sound of airplanes, or helicopters, nothing.  It was dead silent - that&#39;s what is so weird.  Everything was lit up for about 10 seconds.  Then it was gone.  As the light was coming over the house and in the front yard, where the light met the darkness, it kept in a straight line - really weird!

As I looked up to look at the clouds I looked directly at a black disk shaped object in the sky. At first, the object seemed to follow the direction of the clouds, but after a couple of minutes it began to move ahead of the clouds. It continued this for a couple of minutes and then started to move upward and back towards the clouds. It then seemed to move upward more and disappeared. We were able to  look at the object through binoculars and say the it appeared to be disk shaped and at one point my nephew saw it tilted on it&#39;s side. The object slowly dissappeared in the clouds after about ten minutes.<n>

I live in a master planned comm. in the mountains of scottsdale and have a view of most of phoenix. I was driving home at 9:45 and noticed three very large orange lights (10x the brighteness and size a commercial plane puts out)above some cell phone towers.  I thought that a mountain was on fire.  When I got home I told my girlfriend about the fire and we went and looked and the fire was gone.  A minute later 2 &#34;fires&#34; started back up followed by a 3rd.  They were on for a couple of minutes and then quickly flickered out (they same quick flicker from a rotating movement, which we would later figure out.)  Another minute later the 3 lights (obviously not a fire anymore) appeared much higher.  We got binoculars out and verified that in fact there was no mountain where these lights were.  We observed this flickering and moving for another 15-20 minutes.  During this time they moved behind a notable landmark, Camelback Mountain and hovered there for at least five minutes. In looking through binoculuars, it looked like we could see a shadow, approx 10-15x the size of a 747 behind each light.  When the lights &#34;flickered&#34; out, we could somewhat make out that the shadow was rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to get in the car and drive to a higher vantage point within the community.  We were there for approx 25-30 minutes. During this time, we observed that air traffic over phx had come to a standstill. Sky Harbor Int&#39;l Airport is one of the busiest in the country and at that time of night multiple planes can be seen in approach pattern.  For 10-15 minutes while were at this location, we observed no planes and no bright lights.  For Phoenix, this is totally improbable.  Then all of the sudden the sky filled with planes. These planes had weird lights, a triangle shape, and moved extremely fast w/o making any noise.  they appeared to be patrolling the skys and playing cat and mouse with bright lights that appeared and disappeared. A bright light appeared directly overhead and then disappeared as a triangle object that resembled a stealth fighter appeared behind it. We left the area and went home because we were frightened.  Once arriving at home (2 minute drive) we went back outside and the sky looked normal (planes in the air and landing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not call any of the local news because we felt for sure there would be many witnesses and footage.  As of 12:00 PM Phoenix time 6/28 there has been no mention of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Francis Emma Barwood, former Phoenix City Council member, for having directed this witness, and others, to our Online Report Form to have these sightings recorded.

It flew straight north at a high rate of speed, probably 100-200 mph.  It was gone in approximately one minute.  It was probably 3 feet in diameter on the top and maybe 5 feet in diameter at the bottom, this could only be seen from the side, when it was directly south of us.  When it flew over it was circular from the bottom.  It had to fly right over the Wichita airport, because we live 4 miles directly north of the airport.  It was somewhere between 200 to 300 yards above the earths surface, and did not have any noise coming from it.  It wasn&#39;t a bird, balloon or plane.  I, have a science education, geology, and have worked for Boeing and Raytheon in the past (7 years total).  We, myself; and my girl friend whom works directly for another aviation company, have lived here for approximately 3 years and have seen many airplanes, and birds (the sedgwick county park is nearby and is full of ducks and geese which fly over our neighborhood daily).  Furthermore, I grew up on the farm, and have hunted and raised all kinds of birds, I&#39;, 41 years old.  What flew over tonight was definitely not a bird, or a plane or a balloon.  It was flying at a very high rate of speed, and was probably flying under radar, without sound.  I seen it first while I was laying in the pool looking at the beautiful cumulus cloud directly to the south.  As soon as I seen it, I told Susan, &#34;look a UFO&#34;, jokingly, and moments later, the joke was not a joke no more, it was a real UFO.  The first I have ever seen, and I have been looking, but have never seen any thing like this.<n>

I thought it was an aircraft but all of a suddon the lights made an impossibly tight S turn and then shot back over the mountains. No major airliner nor the F-16s on the Base can do that.  I tried to get my neighbors to see it but by the time they took me seriusly it was gone.<n>

I was leaning against my car facing South. Something caught my eye and I looked up to see a huge orange fireball coming toward me in the sky. I shouted to everyone to look up, at which time they all did. My husband went inside to get my 11 yr old son so that he could see it as well. It traveled very fast from South to North, in a straight line, and after about a minute and a half, it appeared to either burn out or disappear. There was a very faint, low-tone whooshing or rumbling sound as it passed overhead. All of us were stunned. We are certain there is a logical explanation for this, however an internet search, and search through the local news has turned up nothing. It did not appear to be a meteor, because the duration and size of the fireball. It would have had to been an enormous meteor to have last! ed that long (we have seen them many times before, and none have lasted this long, been this bright, or made any sound that we could hear). I am wondering if it was a satellite or some kind of re-entering the atmosphere, or perhaps space junk. I would love to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it came closer we saw 4 lights on each object. 2 lights in the center closer together and 2 on the edges. It made a very low and quiet rumble as it came closer. After about 10 minutes it turned to a NE direction and saw 3 green lights on the back of both objects and had a flashing light on the right side.<n>

I noticed three white lights that looked like big stars, but they were way too low to be stars. They were in the fog, about ocean level, so I thought they were three ships. Then they seemed to go away and come back, which I attributed to fog. It was weird because the lights didn&#39;t fade in and out with the fog. So I started paying attention since I see UFOs now that deliberately look and I know what to look for. Then the one on the left silently took off in a zigzag to the left at about 150 MPH, which is something boats can&#39;t do. The other two just vanished a few minutes later. It&#39;s okay to watch them when they&#39;re there, but when they disappear that means they could be sneaking up to abduct me, so that&#39;s when I hide. Some people think it&#39;s cool to see them, some signal them with their lighters, but after my Grand Canyon experience, I&#39;m just afraid, so I locked myself in the back of the truck with my 44 Magnum and was sleeping in minutes.<n>

After hangin out and watching t.v. for a while we went to the kitchen to find somethin to eat. While my friend was searching around in the fridge I glanced over at the t.v. which was right next to two big sliding glass doors overlooking a lake. As soon as I looked over I saw a blue orb comming down from the sky towards the house in a kind of &#34;J&#34; type descent about 200 yards away. It was traveling at an exceptional fast speed because as soon as I saw it comming down from the sky it was already about 6 feet away from me. It flew through the sliding glass doors as if they werent even there. I was just amazed...I stood there for about 10 seconds as it just hovered about 4 feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball and it was bright bright blue around the outside while the inside got progressivly lighter... a very pale blue...almost white.It was pretty much a basketball sized glowing sphere of light. I didnt feel scared, I had a sense of calmness once I snapped out of being completly in awe I slowly walked closer to it until I was about 2 feet away from it. I slowly reached out my hand to touch it for some reason..maybe because I felt that I had to know it was really there. I got about 3 inches from touching it and all of a sudden it went crazy! It started flying around the room in all sorts of directions up, down,  left, right.. at a very high speed. Then before I knew it, it flew back out the sliding glass doors and up into the sky. As soon as it left I turned to my friend and said &#34;DID YOU SEE  THAT!?&#34; since he was to busy looking around in the fridge he missed pretty much the whole event except for seeing something light blue fly out of the corner of his eye. Before that I was the type of person that didnt belive until I actually see for myself. Ive looked on the internet for years trying to find out what exactly it was...a spirt/ghost...an alien probe/scout... I have no idea...Ive only been a! ble to f ind a couple of articles that other people have reported on &#34;The Yukon Report&#34;. For whatever reason I have this feeling that one day I know I&#39;ll see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

A newspaper reporter reported first seeing it at 745pm. He estimated the elipitical objects&#39; size as 1,500 meters tall. He followed it south from the airport where police and other people had gathered. Photographs were taken by the reporter. It was observed from 745-9pm by several witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8pm, I left my home to visit the store. In the west I observed a &#34;star&#34; 10x larger than a magnitude 1. I went home and didn&#39;t put too much attention as to what I saw. At 8:20, I arrived home to observe the full moon that had rose out of the west and now was quite high in the sky. In the lower left hand side near the ground, I saw abright flash of an elipitical object, one eighth the size of the full moon take off at a tremendus speed. Two helecopters were following, unable to keep up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, the full story was printed in Shenzhen&#39;s local newspaper, The Daily Sunshine.<n>

We used 14 channel hand-held radios, available at Radio Shack, for comm between vehicles. On both the trip North and on the return trip South we noticed very strong broadband radio interference with both our radios for a period of tens of minutes (while travelling about 75 MPH) in the vicinity of Mercury, NV, which is about 30 miles east of Area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tested these radios and they break the preset squelch at a distance of about 2 miles, broadcasting an estimated 500 mW at roughly 440 MHz. The interference we observed broke the squelch many times on the radios as we travelled. IF the distance between us and the transmitting antenna was 30 miles when this happened, the transmitter, apparently located in Area 51 would have been transmitting at least 5 KW in a narrow band of one channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed that the interference occured in all 14 bands of our radios, so this would indicated a broadband transmission of at least 70 KW to achieve this phenomenon. The total power from the transmitter could be much higher, depending on the actual bandwidth in use and location of the transmitting antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is well known that typical military broadband radios transmit only a few watts or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only use I know of for very high power broadband radio transmissions is to transmit over extreme distances. I once calculated that I could transmit a receivable signal over 2 million miles (the distance to Mars at close approach) with only a few hundred milliwatts of output power if I used a broad bandwidth of 10 MHz. I cannot guess what would require the kind of broadband power that I observed near Area 51.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Although we have seen no convincing evidence that Area 51/Groom Lake in Nevada is related to the UFO phenomenon, we include this report, nevertheless, principally because the witness who submitted the report is well know to us, and he is highly qualified in the field of electrical engineering and communication theory.

The object first caught my eye as a white light, speeding left to right. It stopped and i could see what appeared to be white lights rotating around the bottom. at first i thought it was a star. Then about 15 seconds later, it moved quite rapidly about 4 inches to the right and stopped. it stayed at this position for about 30 seconds, then moved rapidly right, back to its original position. this happened about 4 times. the object would first move right, then back to center, then left, then back to center.

Last month sitting on my porch I looked up and there was an bright rectanglar amber light not to far away or very high in the sky. It seemed to have 3 dark rings in it and after about 5 seconds it slowly faded out. Fifteen seconds later it slowly came back on for 5 seconds and then slowly faded out again. I stood up to look closer because there was no sound or flashing lights which all airplanes have. It just disappeared. Then about a week later my nephew and I saw the same lights, this time there were two, at a distance and both slowly came on for 5 seconds and slowly went out. They had to be about a mile apart yet they both did this at exact the same time. They did it 4 times then they were gone. Then on the 6-25-02 three of us on the porch saw the same lights come on over Greenvalley. Not very high in the sky they slowly came on and went out several times. Then it came on and before it went completly out another one would start coming on beside it and before it went completly out another one would come on beside it and so on. There were 5 of them. At first I thought that it was just one light moving accross the sky but then realized that before the first light went out the second one was coming on. Greenvalley is west of my home and to the north is an AF base. After I saw the lights on the 25th a small plane came from the direction of the AF base and flew around in circles over Greenvalley for 30 minutes then returned to the base. I feel some one saw this besides me and they were checking it out.<n>

Extremely bright amber light appeared 10 degrees above horizon, turned on and off rapidly, then stayed on, another light turned on (to the right from ny view point), the light seemed to twist or turn, hard to explain, sort of twisting and flickering (bad description)it turned off immediately, as it disappeared it immediately reappeared just to the left of the first light, it remained there for about twenty seconds, there was a flash and it turned off only to reappear just to the right of its original position. Then all flashed off, we watched for about another five or ten minutes, the main light then popped back on, as soon as it had there were three other lights immediately popped on and then off. These lights were in a triangle formation around the main light as they came on. On a count of about 10 or twelve all four turned off at once. About fifteen or twenty seconds after they all turned off, there was a white and green flash to the right of where the main light was, even though this was quick it had a shape to it. At the present over an hour after the first light popped on, the process is still repeating itself in a seemingly random manner. Our view point when we saw these lights was such that the city of Toronto was on the left of them. I would put them 5~6 miles off the coast and at a height of about 2500 - 3500 feet. The CN tower is a perfect reference for us as it is about 1800 feet high and they were just above its height. The visibility is over 15 miles as we could see the city and also the planes landing at the Island airport. These are not planes, nor are they flares. When we got home we told the kids, they immediately went to look, and I am amazed that the lights are still there. The kids are looking at them at the present through a telescope and binoculars 8x35. They are telling me that planes are passing to the left and to the right, but the lights when they turn on are still in their same location. They seem to turn off for about five or so minutes and th! en pop b ack on. These are not stars or planets nor are they choppers. Through the bino&#39;s a vague shape is discernible, I think lozenge shaped best descibes it. Our view from our apartment is facing the same direction, but 15 stories higher. Please excuse broken nature of report. The kids just told me that as I wrote this the lights have not been seen for about five minutes. Very odd.<n>

No light was coming from the object, my guess was it was probably between 2000-3000 feet high. It then made a turn and at the same time accelerated into the clouds.

To the North East was a bright light hovering just over the tree line with a red beam shooting to the ground out of the South side of the object that had balls of white light going down through it. The red beam did not stay on constantly, just every now and then it would shoot down. We watched this for probably 15 min and then I went and got a small pair of binoculars but when I looked through I could see what looked like either panels of light or windows across the body of the object. I couldn&#39;t really tell for sure. I did not see it fly away, it just wasn&#39;t there any more after about 45 min. I don&#39;t know if that was do to the clouds going by. Soon after that there was a very strong smell of gasoline on our screened in porch and there was no explanation for it. There was no one else outside and there weren&#39;t any cars on the street it just smelled like gasoline out there for several seconds.<n>

The size of the cigar object had to be huge for me to see it at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a silver ball traveling from the  North to Southwest on a clear bright sunny morning.I watch this object moving what appeared to be slow going in a straight line. And somewhat out there at a distance. Because normal aircraft was traveling well below this small silver ball.  A military jet pasted threw this area and well below with a vapor trail.  Has I continued to watch,  then I saw IT.  In the background and way further out was a cigar shaped object,  following the silver ball. This second object was dark in color as it appeared against the bright blue morning sky.  Then the small silver ball suddenly stopped. Seconds passed.  I watched and waited.  Then the silver ball began to move.  Not backwards nor in a continueous direction had it was previously.  But was heading towards the mother ship. I continued to watch till the silver ball I lost sight of. And also the larger object.<n>

I did not know what woke me up so I looked at my watch.  It said 3:00 exactly.  I then noticed that the side of the tent that faced the wetlands and lake was lit up.  I would like to tell everyone that it was no a light from a boat.  The wetlands is inbetween my house and lake and it is about 150 yards wide and there is no way a light could have been that bright off a boat.  I then saw what I truly believe to be a shadow of a torso and arm of an alien.  I watched it for about thirty seconds and saw the fingers move in a manner that assured me that it was not a inatamate object being blown by the wind.  I became frightened and hid in my sleeping bag.  I do not know how long they were there but when I came out of my sleeping bag about an hour later the light was gone and so was the Alien.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident, according to the student, is approximate.

My first impression due to the G8 summit was that it was some kind of spot lights, but as I tried to point it out to my wife I realized that not only was it a very clear night but that the objects moved in a straight line and very fast as they twisted around each other. My guess is that they were at about 5000-10000 feet, or about as high as an airliner would fly, that is one reason it was not a plane, it was to fast and made no sound at all. If it wasn&#39;t a ufo then I have no idea what it could have been,I have seen some odd things in the sky but could always figure out some kind of expaination, I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n>

It went from 60 degrees (southwest)  to 30 degrees (west)  in the duration of 20:15 to 22:15.  The white throbbing brilliance and shape varied in randomness. The shape separates into 2 circular light and then unites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The starlike object is moving steadily closer (the size of object gets bigger and luminosity increases- my estimate is that it hovered over southwest of Manhattan -at least 3 times). and backs away at unbelievable speed. During these times at about 21:00, I noticed an increase in military surveillance planes fly by. At least there was more than 10-20 aircrafts/jets with surveillance capability flying by in increasing regularity. At about 21:20 I called my male neighbor, to validate what I was seeing. He saw the steady starlke object descend and ascend. He also noticed that it cannot be a manmade object because of the fact that it remained stationary for a long period at a time compared to our constantly moving military aircraft hovering around it. The wife of my neighbor joined in at 21:35 followed by another woman neighbor. They all saw the the starlike object move toward us (from west to east) and backward at tremendous speed.  We witness a light display (luminace) and (color shift - red blue yellow and white) and shape morphing. The luminace of the starlike object penetrates through cloud covering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 3 or 4 military aicrafts passing by every 5 minutes coming from south, north, east and west by 21:35 to 22:30.  There were 3 times that the starlike object shuts off its luminace and hides behind the clouds in the heightened pursuit and surveillanc by military aircarfts. It was an amazing display of light and flight technology by the starlike object. I was also glad that I have 3 eyewitness to validate the spectacular air show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object probably was a celestial body.  PD))<n>

6/24/02 00:10|Deerfield Beach|FL|Sphere|20 minutes|White spherical light moves in circular path, then irregular path, then turns itself off and on & off like a lightbulb& zips away!|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23451.html|73|ndxe200206| White spherical light moves in circular path, then irregular path, then turns itself off and on &amp; off like a lightbulb&amp; zips away!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going to my parked car when I happened to look up and noticed a<n> <n><n> sphere of light moving above the clouds in what at first looked like a circular pattern. I was looking at the object at first trying to determine what it actually is. As I kept watching it, I was taken aback that I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. At this point I glanced at the clock on my cell phone and it read 12:10 am. What struck me as irregular is that the object illuminated the clouds below it as you would expect a flood light to do. But, a floodlight does this from the ground up. This was occurring from above the clouds  down to the ground. As I followed the path of the moving object, I noticed that there was no floodlight from the ground up that could be illuminating the clouds in what at first was a circular motion. I watched the object move repeatedly in a circular pattern for about five minutes. I was mesmerized that this object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, nor a weather balloon, or any object that I&#39;ve ever seen in my experience. As I continued to look at this sphere move in a circular motion, it changed its path and now began to move in zigzag irregular path. I had to keep my eyes carefully on the object because it was moving in and out from the cloud cover about 10,000-15000 feet up in the air where one would expect to see a commercial airliner. It then proceeded in its irregular pattern for another 10 minutes. In this time frame, there was an opening where there was no cloud cover and the object would move into this area of the sky and then back into an area where there were clouds. You could see the object through the clouds as it illuminated the area around itself above and below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then changed its flight speed and slowed down considerably and then would speed up or accelerate and again slow down. The entire time it was doing this, it appeared as a white sphere bigger than the moon illuminating the area around itself with a tremendous amount of white light.  It continued to move erratically in and out and now changing its altitude and appearing to move closer to the ground at about the height one sees an airliner on a flight path to land at an airport. It then stopped in the air for about thirty seconds, the sphere light went out(this in an open space with no clouds around it)and then the sphere lit up with pure bright white light like a flash bulb but the light stayed on for about 15 seconds. Just before it moved away at a fantastic acceleration, the bright light that illuminated the sphere goes out but I could still see the dark shape  of the outline of a sphere exactly in  the same place and standing still in the sky. After about 5 seconds, it zipped up and moved away in a southerly direction  at an acceleration that to me does not seem possible. It just took off and in a second, you could not see it any more. I glanced at my cell phone clock and it was 12:30 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am trained in the sciences and in mathematics. What this object did when it left is something which you would see maybe in special effects in a  science fiction movie but not something that at this time our technology is capable of doing. I have never seen anything like this nor ever seen anything move like this. The entire time I was seeing this my mind was incredulous at what I could be seeing. I&#39;m still perplexed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  PD))<n>

It was obviously a craft of some sort, light grey in color, it was difficullt to call it a specific form.  There were no lights on but it was deffinitely there in the light of the moon.  The craft was moving in a southern direction toward me.  When it got closer, it was obviously the strangest thing I had ever seen, so I called to my roommate, who was inside the house working, that he had to see something strange.  He came out and watched it with me for about ten minutes, then went back in the house to finish working.  As it went higher it became more illuminated by the moon, but the image still wasn&#39;t clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it was moving slowely, but then all at once shot up toward the star South of the handle of the Big Dipper.  For at least 20 seconds it  was stationary. Then moved North toward the second star down from the top of the Big Dipper&#39;s handle. Next it moved up between the top and next to the top star of the handle, making it appear the there were 4 stars on the handle, instead of 3. It stayed stationary for 5 to 10 seconds, then it started moving North, then finally faided out of  view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses about their sighting, and we do not know what it is they saw.  Given that the object did not have lights on it, the object almost certainly was not an aircraft.  PD))<n>

But one night my friends ((four names deleted)), and I decided that we were going to play a little game of the infamous Hide-and-Go-Seek. We split up into teams, each team equipped with one flash light. ((two names deleted)), and myself were on one team... the team that hides. After walking around the neighborhood for a little bit we decided to go into the corn feild. We walked for a little while and decided that it was a good place to stay. We talked for about five or six minutes when we heard something. ((one name deleted)) decided to go check it out, he tried to turn the flash light on but it didn&#39;t seem to work. We finally made our way to the edge of the feild. As soon as we got there two very bright boomerang shaped objects caught our attention. We watched for a little bit and then we heard the noise again. It was a sound so seemingly peaceful that it was creepy. ((one name deleted)) turned around and told us to look. So ((one name deleted)) and I turned around to see another craft. This one was a lot closer than the other two. It hovered above our heads for a moment almost trying to let us know that they saw us. And then with amazing speed it went up with the other two and they seemed as if they were dancing. It was beautiful yet eerie at the same time. Then they just slowly got smaller and smaller until they were gone. To this day everyone thinks that we&#39;re insane.<n>

They drifted very slowly to the east, or perhaps at times were stationary or moving in other directions. At one point in our observation of them, what looked like a white dot to the naked eye but appeared to be a plane with wings as viewed with binoculars approached one of the objects and flew in its vicinity for serveral minutes before disappearing from view.

It was weird i questioned it to myself i dont know about the other three because it was daytime so i didnt think it was real so my brother brought out his camera and it continued to sway back and forth it looked black and shiny, moving direction quick and a couple times it stopped and froze. So my sister and i were tripping out on this than my brother and my friend went into the house and i told my sister i was going to get my binoculars for a closer view so i went inside looked around and couldnt find them so i sat down on the couch and kind of doubted what i was looking at. Then my sister said &#34;what are you doing arent you getting your binoculars&#34; then something inside me told me to go check it out again so i went outide to see where the object was reminding you it was daylight so i walked outside by myself and my sister was inside for some reason so i scanned the sky looking for that object floating around it was gone but i kept looking for some reason looking in the same spot than suddenly out of knowhere i see a black disc shaped object diving, now at first i thought it was a bird swooping but that changed after i saw it go up again repeating the same movement but getting faster and higher bouncing in the air it amazed me and still is ,it reminded me of somebody skipping a stone in the sky down than up and everytime it would get faster and higher and each time, i heard no sound  then it was gone i think it was building its momentum with our atmosphere to get back to where it came, even my brother came out and i tried to point it out but it was too fast im still wondering about this but i know for a fact what i saw was real and not my imagination i wish somebody was there with me to see that hopefully there will be a report about this, ! i did se e a couple helicopters circling around that area after i wonder if they got a report but all i know is what i saw i will never forget.<n>

At first I thought It was an airliner but there was no noise and it&#39;s flight was very stable. as I watched the light it changed from white to a bright red and continued on a direct easterly course. Then the light got very bright and then seemed to implode into itself then disapear and still no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As we got to Kalamazoo I noticed this light in the sky towards the west.  The UFO had lights all over it although it was pretty far up, the lights looked to be red, white and a bluish-green color, I also noticed an orangey color.  There was no noticeable sound. It looked like other smaller craft were maybe coming out of it or beams of light were shooting off.  It seemed to speed up as I sped up and slow down when I slowed down on the highway.  It pretty much stayed with us for about 2 hours.  As we neared Muskegon it looked as though it was going towards Lake Michigan and we lost it, it just got smaller and smaller and disappeared by the lake.  As it got smaller it looked orange to me.  Then the next night we spotted the same thing at my fathers house in North Muskegon.  My father had told me that it looked like the same thing he saw 30 years ago, he saw 2 of them and one of them shot like a laser or something and hit the other one, then they both disappeared.  The one we saw the second night though was in a different part of the sky.  This time it was in the South almost by the moon.  Well since the first night, we have been seeing the same thing, by the 3rd night we were watching as it just twirled around and moved a little but mostly stayed in the same area, a plane came over us and it left but later that night as we were back at our home in muskegon we saw it again, this time with more of them....we saw what looked to be around 3-5 of them, we looked through telescope and saw like 3 circular things under it twirling in a clockwise motion, almost like balls of fire.  Last night (6/26) we went to Lake Michigan by Rothbury/Montague area and spotted 2 lights on the lake that seemed to be hovering just over the water. Dark clouds spread over us, due to stormy weather so we went back up towards the woods.  I went back down to see if they were there and they were gone.  I&#39;m sure they will be out tonight also, we! plan on watching for them again.... so I will probably be writing some more.<n>

There were no stars out, it was very cloudy.  We saw a bright light to our right, above the mountain.  We had our windows rolled down the air felt as if it was electrified.  We parked at the baseball field and watched the light amazed at it.  The mountain it was above it is impossible to go up it without being on an 4-wheeler.  We watched the light and it started to move and change colors, it changed blue, green, orange, yellow, purple and white and every color in between.  All of a sudden it zipped towards us and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 days later I was on my way back from the hospital and I took the same road to get home and I saw a light on the mountain, and it was changing colors just like it was the few nights before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later on the other mountain that intersects with the mountain in which the original light was see it looked as if there was spot lights shining up in the sky.  Nobody lives that far up that mountain at all, that mountain is classified in another county.  The lights that looked like spot lights were there every night for almost a month before they completely vanished.<n>

It moved far too quickly to be a plane,or helicopter. This object reminded me of the legendary Brown Mountain Lights,but we were not near Brown Mountain,or Linville Mountain(The obsercation point of the lights) we were below Blowing Rock.<n>

I saw it several times last fall and haven&#39;t seen it for sometime, it usually hovers for several hours, then fades away, that is what it did two nights ago. I have also seen it take off and speed away. I have seen it with my husband and with my neighbor. It is out there right now, south west of Spokane. Also the light will get very bright and sometimes get so dim it disapears, then comes back.

It was about the size of a star. It was moving very slowly in a straight line, it was not making any zig zag movements. It seemed to be either fluttering or spinning or some kind of movement within itself. It was moving to the north northeast very slowly. So I called some other people that were standing outside at the time over to look at it also. There were 6 of us watching it. We knew it was not an jet or plane because we did not hear any sound from it and because of it&#39;s movement being so slow. It was not a bird because it seemed to high for that. We though about a weather balloon but it just didn&#39;t look like a balloon to any of us. So after about 5 mnutes I ran to get my camera but when I came back out to take a picture of it, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness at some length, and he sounded to be credible and sober-minded.

Several individuals were going out and coming back looking at something in the sky they couldn&#39;t identify. I went out to take a look, and noticed a chrome sphere hanging in the SE sky at about 40 degrees from the SE horizon. It looked very high in the sky (jet level), but definitely in our atmosphere. The moon was clearly visible off the southern horizon, and the sky was absolutely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the object for several minutes, a small, brightly lit (glowing) red sphere appeared to the left of the chrome sphere. It flew to the right of the chrome sphere, then disappeared while moving quickly in a southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The chrome sphere stayed visible for about 45 minutes, as other onlookers came and went. The object disappeared momentarily, and reappeared at about 30 degrees to the horizon, in a northeast direction. Holding my fist to the sky, it had traveled about  four fist-lenghts. After that movement, the object appeared to be fading very slowly towards the SE horizon line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called several people, including a friend that lives in the neighborhood. None of us had a camera capable of capturing this object with any clarity. As we observed the &#34;chrome sphere&#34;, we alerted people walking bye to look up and witness the event. Nobody could identify the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 18:45, a rice shaped object passed slowly across the sky directly in front of the chrome sphere. The oblong object left no contrail and had no warning lights. Shortly after this object (traveling from south to north) went out of sight, an airliner was visible traveling in the same approximate direction, but lower in altitude, leaving a contrail.<n>

This witness appeared to be at a vantage point using a telescope so as to better identify the object. This is the drawing that was submitted based on that observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness in this report writes...&#34;It was slightly bulbous (i.e., not round, slightly bottom heavy) and did not seem to rotate because the positions of the dark lines which run from the top of the sphere to the middle of the sphere never changed. The projection at the top was actually at about the one o&#39;clock position in the telescope. This round projection at the top would &#34;light up&#34;, i.e., increase in brightness every few minutes to about ten times it&#39;s normal brightness.&#34; While there was no mention in this report about the dark orbs that were seen from other parts of Portland and Lake Oswego, this could have been due to when and where the object was viewed. It also could be attributed to the long duration time in all of these reports as witnesses were watching the object at different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 4:50 p.m. Lake Oswego, OR.

All of the other reports I have read perfectly coincide with what I saw. I saw this twice, the second time I stopped at the reststop near the Lemoore NAS (National Air Station) exit and was able to observe the swooping aircraft with three lights just across the freeway to the east. I got out of my car and walked up to the edge of the freeway and took several good digital photographs which I can E-mail. I could hear what sounded like a prop engine coming from the aircraft. After watching this for about an hour I must say that the pilot has superior skills.<n>

I saw two red/orange lights &#34;fall&#34; from it. Also it is overcast and raining so it must have been below the clouds. It didn&#39;t appear to move it just stopped blinking.<n>

It was night and we were sitting at the edge of water looking at the Corps of Engineers hydro electric dam. There are lots of lights on it there is a road on top of it too. We noticed a huge white light that hovered for about 20 minutes or so, and the whole time we kept talking trying to figure out what it could possibly be. Then it just took off so fast vertical and was gone in few seconds, my girlfriend instantly started crying and did so the whole way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another I saw was in the same area of lake. Me and my brother and a friend were bowfishing as we have for many years, It was night time again. I had just shot a fish and was bent down by the water getting fish off my arrow, When I saw the whole lake light up and huge light reflection in the water. Then my brother and friend start screaming did you see that, they saw huge glowing light speeding fast overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/20/02 23:15|Port Angeles|WA|Fireball|35 minutes|It was a bright circular object with mullti-colored llights in the center in the western sky over the Straits of Juan de Fuca|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23428.html|106|ndxe200206| It was a bright circular object with mullti-colored llights in the center in the western sky over the Straits of Juan de Fuca<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a bright llight in the west and thought it was a large plane with its landing lights on.  After 10 minutes or more it did not move.  It was not a planet or star, as it was too bright  for being almost above where the sun had set earlier (it was directly west over the Jaun de Fuca Straits).  We have a home with a view and own a spotting scope.  When we looked at the bright llight with the scope we could see multi-clolored lights apparently within the white light: red, organge green, blinking in no particular pattern.  After 30-45 minutes my wife and I went to bed, as the object was getting smaller, as it it were going west, or  just diminishing in size.  I am a retired clergyman, and  my wife is a registerred nurse.  Neither of us have ever seen anything llike this before and we would not be described as &#34;believers&#34; in UFOs.<n>

My wife and I live on the third and top floor of a large two bedroom apartment building in Landover. It was a Thursday night and I was working on three articles I write for a trade publication that was to be laid out the next day. I was in the smaller bedroom, which we have turned into a home office/guest room, on the computer. My wife was in the living room watching wrestling, which came on at 8 p.m. and ran til 10 p.m. I had been writing for what I felt to be about an hour when I just got &#34;the willies&#34; or whatever. Then the computer froze up. I got it going again and recovered all my data, saved it and suddenly felt very tired. I decided to finish my work at work tomorrow and I went out to watch television with my wife. When I sat down the wrestling program, which runs for two hours, was going off. I told my wife that I hadn&#39;t realized I had worked for so long. She said I had! only been working for about an hour and that it was only about 9 p.m. and she didn&#39;t know why wrestling would be going off after only showing three matches, which she named and described in detail. I checked our digital phone and it said 10 p.m. I also checked our clock radio and computer. They all said 10 p.m. I went to a website about the wrestling program and it detailed several matches that night and her descriptions were of the first two matches and the last one. I let it go because she scares easily and we both had a real bad case of the creeps that night and weren&#39;t sure why. We were really, really exhausted however and fell right to sleep, hard. I have read up on &#34;missing time&#34; and this seems to fit all the descriptions. Also, right after the incident I developed a lump under the skin between my left thigh and genital area. I have an appointment to have it looked at  next Monday. If there is anything interesting I will post on here again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Similar report from Cincinnate for an event that occurred on July 31, 2002.

It was quite high and traveling from west to east. I have seen alot of planes pass by the sky above me but this was no plane. It looked like a passenger plane without wings. The odd thing was that I could not see it in my Canon XL-1S camera. My girlfriend said it was a plane but she wasn&#39;t sure, we could see any wings. We looked at it through these really cheap binoculars and there was no way to confirm or convince us that it was a plane. It was cylindre in shape, and white in color. There weren&#39;t any windows or lights we could see. It just flew by. I was conviced this was the real thing and the fact I couldn&#39;t pick it up on camera was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> J.

There was a huge bright glowing light just about 1,000 feet about the trees.  I was shocked, there was no sound at all and the light was so bright you could not look straight had it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for about thirty minutes I could see red lights around it.  It would float across the sky.

There was no sound and we watched to see if we saw anything else but, nothing followed. It reminded me of when the space shuttle flew over that is how fast and bright the object was.<n>

Well, I was outside taking a break loking about the stars. Next thing I know, there was this pulsating light moving in a straighter north to south direction. It was a bit closer parallel to the west. I know it wasn&#39;t a satellite because they don&#39;t have lights. I also really don&#39;t believe it was a standard aircraft because they have lights other than white. they have red and/or blue  lights.

There was a group of four lights in the sky. Three of the lights were white and bright and formed a longer than wide triangle each of the lights were at the three corners of the object. A fourth light was less bright and red and it was located in the middle towards the back. The object was heading northest in a slightly circling line of travel.I could not judge the altitude of the object but it looked like it was moving about 30 mph.It was gone before I could get outside to hear if it was making a noise.<n>

As I got closer it became apparent that it was definately not an airplane or anything I&#39;ve seen before, and it was falling slowly, apparently on-fire. So I immediate think it might be some sort of incredibly slow falling meteorite, but the flashing lights lead me to believe otherwise. Also, I waited and watched in the night as I continued driving past the vicinity where I believed it was falling to, and heard no explosions. The sky also did not light up to indicate some sort of fire or crash. I have no idea where it went. Alien or not, I dunno, but it was definately a UFO.<n>

I then observed that each of the objects were circling each other. After standing around for about 2 minutes both objects took a complete 90 degree turn and were bombing toward each other at very high speeds. at the moment they were closest to each other, one of the objects blew up into a huge fireball and and kept on going. That object then turned around and started the same routine with circling the other object. Like the first time, they bombed toward each other and at the closest point, one of the objects blew up into a fireball but this time emitting two(2) smaller aircrafts much smaller than that of the other ones. The object that emitted the two smaller aircrafts suddenly dissapeared. At this point, i knew this was unusual activity and that this was no military practice. It looked as if there was a war going on between the aircrafts. These aircrafts were noticeable as they contained constant flashing white lights. After seeing this activity, i quickly sped off  toward home. before i got to where i live i saw 2 other cars stopped on the other side of the road watching and pointing at the weird activity in the sky. ! i stoppe d breifly and was glad to see that the other people in the cars were seeing what i was seeing. I got home and called the Moultonborough Police Department and was informed that hundreds of other people called in to report that they too had also witnessed the strage activity in the sky. I was also informed that there was no military activity in the area and that 2 police aircraft were sent out to investigate but they were too late as the objects quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

Location: Gilford, NH, west-shoreline of Lake Winnipesaukee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were viewing the last beautiful moments of light looking across the lake when my wife exclaimed, &amp;#8220;Look at that!&amp;#8221;  Looking to where she was pointing a glowing yellow light was visible.  It appeared somewhat stationary, though slight movement to the right and to the left was occurring.  The underside of the cloud that the light was in front of appeared illuminated within close proximity to the emitting source.  It lasted for about 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.  I kept waiting for it to emerge from the cloud but to no avail it did not. It was about the size of golf ball, relative to a softball sized Moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We next witnessed the &#34;Orb&#34;, for lack of a better word, in front of the next cloud over to the right, which was fairly close to the first yet separated by a light bluish, slight turquoise hewed darkening sky. I never saw a shape depart the first cloud to get in front of the second. The sight was more or less the same, a glowing yellowish Orb that lasted for about 2-3 seconds.  We witnessed this again slightly to the left of the first sighting.  It was then that the first of several &#34;Linked Orb Movements&#34;  appeared.  The light was ON and then OFF and when it came back on it had moved approximately 10 times the width of the object to another position.  In a skipping fashion we watched the Orb turn OFF&amp;ON each time moving a segment of length across the sky.  We now refer to this type of sighting as a &#34;Link&#34;, representing the skipping movement that appeared to be in a set of connected links.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We most definitely now felt that we were being treated to a spectacular visual occurrence.  From the nearby Laconia airport we heard an airplane approaching.  It was &#34;healthy&#34;  to hear this plane because we then knew that what we were witnessing was indeed noiseless and NOT A PLANE.  The propeller driven small plane, clearly visible in the sky was climbing, having just taken off. Upon approaching the spot of the second Orb sighting in front of the cloud, another &#34;Orb&#34; illumination flashed just below and to the left of the small plane.  This Orb was slightly larger than the others and appeared to be almost doubled, as if two of these Orbs were present with one being slightly behind the other.   The lake area was absolutely noiseless with the exception of the sound of the propeller from the plane.  We were both startled that there was not a collision.  It was very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we saw one of the Orbs in a stationary position and then it simultaneously emitted in perfect-arced unison, four distinct other Orbs.  At no point was there a trail of smoke or cloud associated with any of these sightings. The intensity of the light was constant and the arc formed one quarter of a circle. There was not a trail of light from any other place other than from the Orbs.  Once again all was noiseless.  All of the Orbs had the same yellowish hue.  We witnessed two more of these types of occurrences as well as two or three more of the skipping&#34;Links&#34;, one of which made seven distinct links across the sky, and appeared to be moving towards the South West, across the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly we saw to our left (looking westward) two single sightings as well as the last of the emitting type, of which two Orbs were emitted, once again simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that the event was over.  At about this time a boat was traveling up the lake and once again it was &#34;healthy&#34;; to here a sound.  It was loud, certainly identifiable and indeed affirmed that WHAT WE WITNISSED TRULY MADE NO SOUND.  We remained at the lake for another 15-20 minutes with the hopes of seeing something else. We did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sound travels well over the relative flat surface of the lake.  Given the size of the objects that we saw the biggest mystery to us other than their incredible movement has to be the complete silence that was associated with all visual sightings.  These without doubt were not flares, helicopters or jet planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a licensed private pilot, completing a B.S. in Meteorology and very much believe in the scientific method.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center regarding some unusual events on 6/18/02.  I witnessed the &#34;unusual&#34; event at 9:15 on my way home from work. (I am a police officer) I watched as an aircraft dropped flares approximately every 2-4 seconds.  The aircraft was approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet above ground level.  I could only see the marker ligts of the aircraft initially.  I watched this activity from my back deck for a few minutes.  I did not think much of it because I routinely observe military aircraft of various types training in and just south of the Sandwich Range (the southern most range of NH&#39;s White Mountain National Forest).  A few minutes later, I recognized a UH-60 helicopter briefly touch down at the Moultonborough Airport (I live next to the air strip). Every so often, citizens of my community become alarmed when military aircraft stray a little south of the Sandwich Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

We looked across the entire sky to make sure it wasn&#39;t any type of reflection from somewhere else.  The circular object continued to float for approx. 10 more mins before it started to drift away.  It did not move side to side or round and round.  It moved straight back with no other motion, as if it were traveling in a line.  The white lights were very bright and did not flash or blink and was much larger than an aircraft.  There seemed to be no sound coming from the object, but distance could have played a large part in that.  The object was watched over a schools baseball field so there were no interruptions or anything to block the view.  It was a clear night and besides this floating object only airplanes and stars and the moon were in the sky.<n>

I saw a cloud light up (bright orange? color almost like the sun) I asked my husband &#34;did you see that?&#34; then proceeded to pull over to look at the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After pulling over the cloud lit up 4 or 5 more times.Not as bright as the initial light that I saw. I could see what appeared to be a &#34;jet?&#34; circling the area that lit up. After a few minutes with no more lights I saw the &#34;jet&#34; head east out of the cloud. We drove home and within 10 minutes there were fighter jets overhead flying around. The jets continued to fly for roughly an hour and 15 minutes then I no longer heard them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From husband: My wife asked me did you see that??? I looked up as she was pulling over and I saw what I thought were flares being dropped from a plane but soon realised they wern&#39;t flares they were ball shaped lights..yellowish/white that appeared out of nowhere and dropped behind a cloud and dissappeared. 2 fell behind the cloud and dissappeared a third came from out of the cloud and shot upwards into the cloud from low left to high right again going behind the cloud and not reappearing.Another 2 appeared above the cloud and dropped into the cloud and dissappeared.This took approximately 1 minute for all of it to happen.Then the entire cloud lit up and my wife told me it wasn&#39;t as bright as the one she had seen then a few minutes later the cloud lit up again. That part of the event was over and then I witnessed the flashing lights of an airplane fly off in an easterly direction. After arriving home we noticed jets flying up and down the valley at a fairly high altitude tandom formation back and forth up and down the valley for approximately an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from same witnesses on Highway 25, east of Plymouth, NH.

I live near an airport and am very aware of ordinary aircraft. These lights were much larger and much dimmer then any known aircraft. The size of the craft was similar to a B2, flying a few thousand feet up. I did not hear any noise, it flew at a similar speed to an aircraft. The night was absolutely clear, and I expected to see the craft, but could not see the body. There was a ripple effect as it passed distorting my view of the object (similar to how extreme heat distorts your view of an object.<n>

I am also an avid night sky watcher, but I do not profess to have a great knowledge of the constellations.     On 6/18/01, Tuesday, at between 2045-2115 hours I was sitting in the parking lot of the local Burger King which overlooks the lake. This location looks west and north.  I first noticed the lights in the cloud cover that appeared to be fireworks but realized it was too high in sky.  The location of the lights were in the North and appeared to over the White Mountain area, possibly the Sandwich, NH area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short while I used my binoculars to watch and could clearly see white strobe lights of aircraft. I realized then it was jet fighters who have often practiced over the White Mountain area. As seen on tv shows, they were clearly dogfighting or doing practice bombing or straffing runs and dropping the the &#34;chaff&#34; or flares, to practice avoiding anti-aircraft fire. The show lasted about one half hour and they left and flew to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe there are F-16 fighter places in Vermont with the Air National Guard, and have seen A-10&#39;s many, many times in the Sandwich. NH area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several flights coming and going from Laconia Airport, at which time NO planes were aluminated by any strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was clearly and without question a training flight of some sort and nothing at unusal happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS. when the flares were released, they appeared to be in a counter-clockwise direction, forming an arc and always being about 6 in number.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps with any questions people might have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A description of this event can be found on the NUFORC homepage.

This time it was higher but it behaved in the same way, flipping or rolling over end to end. It moved very slowly upwards and southwesterly. I don&#39;t know of any manmade craft that can fly so slowly. Even a balloon would rise more rapidly. When I ran to get the camera my daughter saw it give off a whitish light. By time I got back it was higher in the sky and I took six pictures. I don&#39;t know why but there is not even a black dot on any of the images. Nothing showed up. We watched it until we lost sight of it because it got too high, 8:30 to 8:40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports from same witness.

6/18/02 20:00|Moultonboro|NH|Other|1 hrs. approx.|Lights in sky in New Hampshire, Tuesday, June 18, 2002 a military training exercise.|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23410.html|133|ndxe200206| Lights in sky in New Hampshire, Tuesday, June 18, 2002 a military training exercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a police officer in the town of Moultonboro. On Tuesday evening I received a message from my dispatcher advising me that a subject in Gilford, NH observed flares shooting in the sky in the area of Red Hill, a small mountain in Moultonboro. I and the other officers on duty set up strategic observation points and observed no such flares or lights. About 30 minutes later I was near the Moultonboro Airport, a small private unattended airport, and observed a military turbine helicopter (I was unable to determine the type because it was dark but, from my experience, it appeared to be a Blackhawk.) make an approach to the airport, land and then take off. This is not unusual as I have observed military helicopters making practice approaches to the unattended air strip in Moultonboro in the past. Shortly thereafter, I observed what was clearly a military aircraft flying in an area north of Moultonboro, most likely over the town of Tamworth or Sandwich, dropping flares. My dispatcher radioed me and advised me of a resident in Tamworth observing a military aircraft dropping flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also a pilot and have flown in this area extensively over the past 17 years. The geographic location of Moultonboro is at the north end of Lake Winnipesaukee and at the southern edge of the Yankee One and Yankee Two MOAs. These two military operations areas encompass most of the White Mountain National Forest. We live and work just south of the White Mountains. (A New York VFR sectional map clearly shows these two MOAs.) I have observed dozens of military operations in this area over the 25 years we have lived here, especially at night. I have also contracted through the Carroll County Sheriff&#39;s Department to fly drug interdiction for the Nat. Forest Service and have flown all over the White Mountains and, while doing so, have observed Military jets flying operations at tree top level in this area. I have also been involved in the investigation of a military jet crash about 14 years ago that was participating in a training exercise in this area. The Yankee 1 &amp; 2 MOAs are primarily used by reservists flying out of Otis AFB on Cape Cod, the Air National Guard out of Concord, NH and I also believe aircraft from the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME. It was also used for a training area for aircraft out of Pease AFB before its closure several years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the lights and flares I observed Tuesday night definitely came from military aircraft. I am certain that anyone else who observed these lights were watching the same aircraft I was. What puzzles me, was the number of calls that were received regarding these observations. This type of military operations in our area is not that uncommon. Granted, most military operations take place farther north, deeper into the White Mountains which is virtually unpopulated. However, this is certainly not the first time I have observed military aircraft engaged in training in our area. This is especially common at night. In response to your comment regarding dropping flares over forested land, the dozen or so flares I observed being dropped from aircraft Tuesday night burned out long before reaching the ground. I hope this answers some questions and clears up some of the mystery of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to this witness, and the several other witnesses, who submitted reports in response to our letter-to-the-editor to The Citizen newspaper in Laconia, NH.  Based on the information available to us currently, we believe that the most likely explanation for the event is flares launched by military jet fighters.  However, this explanation does not appear to explain away all aspects of the event that have been reported to our Center.  We are uncertain as to what caused the event.  PD))<n>

On 6/18/02, at 12:40, I was sitting at an outside table of a restaurant in Broomfield. I was facing west and noticed a Commercial Airliner heading west I&#39;m guessing at about 25k - 30k feet. As it approached the mountains I noticed a small shiny object in the air just south of the airliner and it seemed to me it was hoovering approximately 15k - 20k feet. My wife went to the car and got the binoculars while I kept an eye on the object. There were a few scattered clouds but for the most part it was very clear and bright. I looked at the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be spherical in shape and had a bright chrome like shine to it. It hoovered in the same spot for approximately 4 - 5 minutes and then started moving relatively slowly in an east/southeast direction. I followed it with my binoculars until it was directly above me, unfortunately so was the sun. I lost it in the sunlight and tried to find it again on the eastern side of the sunlight but could not relocate it. It appeared to be gaining altitude as it moved east. At first, before I got the binoculars, I thought it might be a hot air balloon. But when I saw it close up it was just a shiny sphere, no other protrusions or markings. There seemed to be no means of propellsion and there was no noise as it moved. My wife also saw this, but not through the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to work I called the Air Route Traffic Control Center @ 2211 17th Ave. in Longmont Colorado to see if they had seen anything on their radar. They told me there had been no sightings and referred me to the air traffic control tower at Jefferson County Airport. They told me they also had seen nothing. I was then given the number for the National UFO reporting center who I called immediately. I was asked to call the Flight Service Station and find out which way the wind was blowing at this altitude. I was told the winds were blowing out of the Southwest direction 240 @ 15 knots. Next I was asked to file this report which I am doing. Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 49 years old, I have 4 children, I have two degrees (one in electronics, and one in automotive technology).

I looked up with prescription sunglasses into the morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two black winged objects high up, soaring but with no wing flapping at all.  They were flying to the South West.  The interior side of the wings were curved inward.  I then saw a third object move closer in to join the other two just as one made a turn toward the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed too large for birds.  They slightly resembled the U-2 planes or maybe the B-2 Spirit bomber.  The wings were scalloped on the trailing edge and this was apparent even at the great distance.   I watched them for about a minute until they faded from view due to the high altitude.  The formation flight of the three widely seperated makes this remarkable.  The date is approximate within a few days.  I have watche high altitude birds fly such as Eagles and Condors and Buzzards but these were larger with more streamlined features.<n>
6/18/02 01:00|Index|WA||30 minutes|There was a buzzing noise that entered my body.|7/1/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23393.html|137|ndxe200206| There was a buzzing noise that entered my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were camping the night of 6/17/02 at Troublesome Creek campground, which is located on the shores of the Skykomish River. The rain made it hard to sleep as we were in an old VW camper van and the rain was loud hitting the roof. I had opened a window earlier in the evening for air. At around 1am I woke up from an intense dream where I was in a hospital with bright lights all around. As I lay there trying to relax, I noted that the rain was subsiding, and that the sound of the rapids was being interrupted, as if it were being blocked off, at regular intervals. Then I heard a loud buzzing noise above the van. It came closer, and suddenly I was being absorbed, or I was absorbing, this noise. It was loud in my head, and I tried to plug my ears but my arms would not move. I felt like I was on a fast moving carnival ride, but I didn&#39;t go anywhere. It was pitch black out- no lights, nothing. This buzzing inside my body only lasted for about 5 seconds, then it was outside again. It moved away, and the river still had that odd pulsing sound. Then the buzzing returned, the same as before, starting outside the van, and then inside of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And as before, it left again. The second time it left, I noticed the river sounds were normal again, and then the rain started pouring down, enough to wake-up my husband. He never heard a thing. The next morning, as we were getting ready to leave, we were approached by another camper (there had been only 3 couples in the campground. Early in the morning, I saw one of the couples leave), and I asked him if he heard any strange noises in the night. He said he slept soundly, but his wife complained of hearing things. When I told him what happened, he said it was similiar to what his wife told him happened to her. At that point, we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I noted: Before we went to bed, I left a couple of plastic cups on the table by our drinking water. In the night, it sounded like they were on the ground, being kicked or blown around. The next morning, they were exactly where I left them, with rainwater in them. Also, when we stopped for breakfast at a diner not far from the campground, we were told that there had been a lighting and thunder storm over the area the night before. We heard no thunder and saw no lighting, and we were only about 7 miles or so (about a 20 minute drive on curving roads)away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, what happened to me???<n>

My kids were outside also. I love to search the heavens and   look at stars and planets. What I believe I saw this night was either a meteor   or an asteroid. Nothing uncommon about that except.. It was pretty darn big.<n> <n><n> Later that week I read in the newspaper that we had a close shave with an asteroid.    The paper described it as being 120 yards big and got as close as 75,000 miles   which would be a third of the way to the moon. There is no way my eyes could have   seen that. If I held a nickle at arms length above my head that is how big this   meteor or asteroid would have been. The shape of it was kind of squarish at the tail side. the way I saw the shape was of the greenish color that you would see   as in shooting star. But this was pretty faint. As though it was barely skimming the atmosphere. Which is what, ten miles? As soon as I saw it I pointed towards it and said, excitedly, LOOK LOOK LOOK trying to point it out to my family.    And it was gone that quick.<n> <n><n> If this was indeed an asteroid how big was it? Did anybody pick this one out?    Was I the only one who saw this? I pretty sure I know what I saw!

We do live near a neuclear power plant also...  Do you know of any sightings on that evening in Old Saybrook, CT?  This was really wild.....  unlike anything I have seen before.

I was the first to spot the object, it was difficult shape to configure at first, it had a dull crimson beam, there was a dinstinctive hazy mass serrounding the light, it was traveling northward at sea level. I immeadiately pointed out the obscure object to my friend. He saw it as well, we immediately realised that it traveling at an enourmous speed.Our Location distinguised how fast the object was traveling, I saw it pass the port of Outer Harbour (located 30 Km away) within 2 minutes! I made an estimate that it must of been traveling at 1200 kilometres per hour to reach outer harbour in that short period of time. The object momentarily disapeared, a military aircraft followed in persuit, but obviously lost its coordinates and flew in a circle. After five minutes the aircraft left the scene. In Adelaide we have the largest airforce base and armed forces research facility in Australia known as the &#34;RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) technology and defence facility located 25km north of Adelaide. So my collegue and I were very suspicious as we knew that this was more than an unusaul craft to catch the secretive atentiveness of RAAF. Coincedentaly as the RAAF servailance craft left the scene, the undentified craft reapeared and began ascend southward north of outer harbour, then it veered Southeast closer to the shore, within a minute it was within a kilometre from us, from there we were able to define the ahape of the object, it had dark tansparent haze with a cylindrical shape but rounded dimentions like a piece of m&amp;m candy. We then noticed 2 more objects of the same nature following it further out to sea! , they t oo possesed the crude crimson lights.Within a 30 seconds these other craft disapeared. The original craft then sped southwesterly out towards the open sea, it came near the oil tankers and its lights dimmed in 20 seconds then the object vanished from our view. I have not bothered to contact the authorities as I believe they would attempt &#39;fog&#39; us off with lagitimacy E.G a weather baloon or servialance aircraft.However I thought it was wise to contact your agency about such specticles.<n>

We could tell no form or shape.  They were very obvious to us, and we suspect others saw them.  They appeared to be very close, maybe 1 mile away.  They were very bright, and at first appeared to be a large tower.  However, the lights started moving vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three large bright lights were seen from our front yard.  My boyfriend called me outside to see them because they were never present prior to this sighting. They seemed to be suspended in air, but we took the car to make certain there was no tower in the area; before we could get out of the driveway, the lights had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights were originally horizontally lined evenly.  By the time I had joined my boyfriend outside, two had moved downward.  Within 20 seconds, and while getting into the car, one of the three zipped upwards and disappeared.  By the time we left the driveway, all three had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to where we had seen the lights.  At first we had suspected a tower in the area not seen prior to the sighting, but no tower was there.  We also thought clouds may have been a factor, perhaps hiding a tower, but there were no clouds as we approached the area.<n>
6/17/02 08:20|Detroit|MI|Triangle|1 second|Saw UFO with eyes closed, woke me up with a start from dead dreamless sleep, i live alone!|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59160.html|146|ndxe200206| Saw UFO with eyes closed, woke me up with a start from dead dreamless sleep, i live alone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very easy to discribe, but you wont believe. I bought a house in detroit, and i lived there about one year and started having dreams about, well everything. Then one day i was sleeping in my bed on my side facing north and I was awoken by a three dimensional triangle. It was like GOD, and totally scared me. it started between my eyes, close to my face and moved to the left in a perfect golden(actually like a silvery) line. I will explain in cartesien coords. positive X-dir points into your face, positive Y-dir points to the right, and positive Z-dir points up. I will use the unit vector space of i+j+k. start to finish it took this path in straight lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1,.5,0) (1,0,0) (.5,.5,sqrt 3/4)) (0,1,0) (0,.5,0) a pyrimid!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> saw it with both eyes, and they were both closed. I could not open my eyes until the design was over. It was not a dream. all the lines stayed there and did not fade until the design was completed and then they all vanished at once. I have noticed stange phenominon on the abdomins of bugs. such as little spirts of light shooting directly out of one type of bug butt. all of one kind of that bug on a certain day do it exactly the same, but not at the exact same time. this is wierd because i came back thoughout the day and the light about the length of my fingure nail and as thin as a microscopic wire being lit was the same every time and from every angle, inside the house, and outside in the garden. when i look for them i can see the glittery light in my eyes any time i want now that i know what it is. I assume that it either has to do with getting someones attn. that this is the only way to comunicate from the future. such as the use of a creating a new life force with the message ebeded in the DNA, and the key is to be the first to find the new bug of the year and decode the message. I am the only one i know who also does not remember this bug from the previous year. OK, am i really that off topic? There have been more bugs that I have seen that have come in mass amounts that have not been there the year before. That bug that looks like the ladybug but was a beatle, NEW!!!. the one i saw was black, had a red v on the back and was about 2 cm long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently am around the cylotron at MSU alot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one other design that was a flash of about 1/20 th of a second and looked like a non moving design: _ &lt;X&gt;, with a lines on the sides, top and bottom. Like: &lt;<n>X<n>&gt; with all the gaps touching                                                -  I have a book on the oldest GOD dating back to 3000 years before the pyrimids were built, THOTH. the design on the cover is,  /\ /  \ /----\ / \  / \ /___\/___\ , with a dot in the middle. it is black and the design is white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you add the three designs together you get a 23 line design, in a dream i drew the first 17 lines of the puzzle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My first thought was that it was an airplane and the sun was reflecting off of it, but as it came closer, it seemed to be rocking back and forth because the light seemed to be pulsating.  It looked so unusual that I continued to watch it, expecting to hear an airplane engine or some sound at any minute, but there was no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over the house, it was still very bright, but I could see it well enough and could not see any wings.  At about that time, I heard an airplane engine, but another airplane came from the north and was flying south. I ran out into the front yard to continue watching the object, and once the object was between me and the sun, I could make out a very distinct disk shape.  (I was looking at it from behind).  It was still rocking back and forth as if in slow motion.  I always can pick out the airplanes, military planes, helicopters, etc.  Maybe the sun was playing tricks on my eyes, but I know that I can&#39;t explain this one.<n>

But last night (very early in the morning) I was sitting outside, talking on my cell phone and contemplating the sky as I did so, and I saw two white lights (kind of like a dumbell, like 2 headlights would look, but closer together) flying toward the east. My first impression was that it might have been a plane, but it was flying too fast and smoothly. It moved in a straight line, with a tail of white smoky light behind it. The lights were purely white. It looked much, much larger than a plane, I wish I could calculate the size but I cannot tell. It moved about 6 times faster than a regular airplane. It dissapeared into some hills, that was as far as I could see from my house.<n>

I have seen it clost to my house and at a bit of a distance. It is much brighter than the stars and it is obvious that is moves and hovers. I watched it last night for 1 &amp; 1/2 hours then watched it fade away. On one occasion last October I saw a craft right over my house, travel very slowly to tree line, meet with another light, about 1/2 mile from my house and hover there for less than an hour. When it was over my house it was blinking red and white. When it is at a distance, last evening for example, it is a bright white light. I live south of Spokane, just west and north of Spangle. I live on 10 acres in the open and have always noticed this light to the west of me. Have you had any other reports of this type in this area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report appears consistent with a sighting of Venus.  PD))<n>
6/16/02 20:30|Olympia|WA|Other|5-10 minutes|Four adults couldn't identify an object that flew over Olympia Washington June 16, 2012.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89735.html|151|ndxe200206| Four adults couldn&#39;t identify an object that flew over Olympia Washington June 16, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, June 16, 2012, as my wife and I went to our car after dinner with friends, our hostess noticed an object in the sky and asked, “Look, what’s that?”  An object appeared SE of Olympia HS at estimated altitude -1500 ft rising to cloud cover I estimate at 4000 ft. where it disappeared into the cloud cover.  A couple of my companions said they saw smaller objects following the large one.  I only observed one object.  The object moved on an apparent straight course that I guess to be from SW near Black Lake to NE disappearing into the cloud cover over Lacey, WA.  I estimate the trajectory to be ENE roughly following the course of Interstate 5.  I estimate the time we observed the object to be between 5 and 10 minutes.  Our host retrieved his binoculars and tried to focus on it just before it went into the cloud cover.  All four of us observed the object at a time none of us marked but I estimate between 8:15 and 8:40 p.m. with good daylight still avai! lable at this latitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Olympia winds at that time were from SW @ 8 mph on 6/16/12.   The object’s speed I estimate between 50 and 60 mph.  There was no noticeable wind at ground level.  It moved as if sailing on the wind but appeared faster than the 8mph wind.  It moved smoothly without stopping or any noticeable change of direction or speed.  It appeared to me to slowly ascend as it traveled across the sky that provided a gray background for the sighting.  There was no noticeable noise though the object moved as if powered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I viewed the object as a larger object with a smaller object or part suspended underneath of about ¼ to ½ the size of it’s larger companion.  They appeared to fly in perfect unison so I viewed them as connected in some manner.  They flew close enough to be seen as one.  I estimate the combined parts to have been 15 to 30 feet in height and 12 to 20 feet in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of our guesses about its identity added up since a helicopter would have made noise and a different shape as would a plane.  An ultralight would also have made motor noise and I would not expect an ultralight to climb into the cloud cover at that altitude.  A runaway bundle of balloons or large runaway Kite is unlikely given the mild wind recorded that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m curious whether there were any similar sightings this day or if our sighting has been explained.  To us, it was not an identifiable object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light appeared to be at low level, I would estimate not higher that 5000 feet. The light flew slowly across the sky in a straight line until it was almost due east of my position then it turned at about a 45 degree heading toward the southeast. There was no sound, which I thought odd because of the low altitude. The object was the same blue/white color as a mercury vapor street lamp with no apparent red or green navigation lights and no strobe. A few minutes after the object had disappeared behind the tree line, a commercial aircraft flew over at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and it&#39;s engines were clearly audible. I&#39;m a retired aircraft mechanic with 20 years service in the Air Force and I am quite familiar with most of the aircraft that frequent Barksdale AFB and the Shreveport airport.

I was with two of friends and we were laying down on the grass one night to look at the stars.  Something that we very rarely do.  It was about 11pm and it was dark out.  Some time passed until I spotted a circular white light above me to the left.  I could tell it was very high up in the atmosphere.  I would have to say about the height of a satellite or higher(If you have ever seen a passing satellite, you would know what I mean).  I pointed it out to my friends and they quickly saw it too.  At that point I started to get a little scared because I was actually thinking &#34;yea right, a UFO&#34;.  The circular white light then flashed 3 times and moved to the right about the length of your finger in comparison if you held it up.  I could tell right there, that no craft that I know of from this planet had those capabilities.  Because at that height, it had to have moved a good 500 miles(possibly more).  When it flashed 3 times and moved to the right, it stayed their for about 1 second, then flashed 3 times again moved back to the left.  Again it stayed their for about 1 second and flashed 3 times.  But instead of it moving to the right again , it just flat out disappeared.  I looked back down at my two friends and they looked at me and I said, &#34;You did see that right?&#34;.  They of course answered yes.  This was my only encounter of seeing a UFO.  After witnessing that, I now believe that there is something out there.  This is a true story and I very well think that &#34;white light&#34; was not from our own planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Some were saying it was an airplane.  I was saying it was a light tower.  We all agreed on a light tower because the light was not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the time we all settled down and started relaxing again the light began to move.  It came southeast towards us at a very slow pace.  We began to get uncomfortable with what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The situation worsend when the craft made its away all the way to us and turned east above the treeline behind us.  We all started to run.  The craft hovered with an ominous humming/buzzing noise over the treeline continuing east.  It then turned North and moved out over the water.  This is when the craft rapidly accelerated and turned back into a light in the distant sky.  Right as the craft dissapeard from our sight there was a very loud booming noise.  Almost as if the craft broke the sound barrier.  We have all disscused this since but none of us can explain what the craft was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

6/15/02 22:00|North Haledon|NJ|Fireball|Couple minutes|A red ball of fire, watches us, then dives away.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44265.html|162|ndxe200206| A red ball of fire, watches us, then dives away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark out already, and I can&#39;t quite recall the time of the incident as it was about 3 years ago. I was at my then girlfriends house, sitting on some steps in her backyard. She has a very large back yard which pretty much surrounds the entire house from all sides. We were sitting in the area to the left of the house, so the house was to our right. Directly in front of us was her drive way which curved from the street towards her house. I was looking up at the sky, as I like to do so many nights, to admire the stars, and as I looked to my right towards the house, I saw a red ball of fire which looked to be steady over the house. It was not a huge ball, but much larger than what stars look like, and much closer. At first glance I took it to be a flare as it had the resemblence of one. Its no movement also made me think of it as a flare as I know flares are known to stay in place in the air for a brief moment. So all this was not strange to me yet. Here is where the story gets a little weird, upon seeing it, I focused my attention on it. My girlfriend was sitting to my right, but had not seen the object yet. I called her attention to the object, and as she focused on it, at that exact moment, it seemed like the object became aware of me pointing it out to her. She saw it, but for a brief moment, because at that point the object streaked upwards towards the right and then dove down behind the house. Not saying it landed behind the house, but is shot downward behind the houses path of view making it no longer visible. I immediately realized that it was not a flare, because a flare would not have that sort of movement and speed after being in the air. It moved so fast that it literally left a streak of red behind it for a few brief seconds. This object seemed to have full control of its movements, and furthermore, seemed to be conscious of our presence, as if it were watching us. That incident freaked me out but also intrigued me as I have been interested in UFO&#39;s since a very early age. I definitely think what I saw was a UFO or some sort of surveillance device, used by who, I don&#39;t know. I have had other sightings, but less conclusive than this one. My uncle is also a big UFO buff and has experienced sightings. A flare, it definitely was not, something else, in my opinion it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects were moving from the north west toward the south east.  They appeared to be following the same path the satellites follow, except the satellites travel a different direction before they disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 objects appeared to be at a fairly high altitude. They made no sound and did not have navigational lights no did they have FAA red and green strobe lights.  They were round white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the UFO’s was moving fairly slow almost stopping from time to time.  The second was moving faster and the third object was moving very fast.  All three objects were moving across the sky in a  erratic manner, traveling in circles and moving forward then stopping and moving backwards.  At one point the slower UFO #1 started to travel to the south east. UFO #2 was zig zagging across the sky at a high speed and flew directly across the path of the slower moving UFO #1.  I expected to see and hear a loud explosion but somehow they avoided a collision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 UFO’s continued to move in a random pattern across the sky for almost 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They finally regrouped and flew south east in a single line and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no witnesses to this sighting and I did not contact any law enforcement agencies to report this sighting.   This is all of the information I have on this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this incident 7 years late because internet service just recently became available in our rural area.<n>

(I didnt really know where something like that could be reported)  I was standing next to my Dads truck and i look to my left i see about 4 lights  2 in the front and 1 on each of the sides. think of a trianle of (A B C)  AB was one leg and BC was the other leg , and AC was the Hypotenus, and there is one light on A and a light on C and the other 2 lights are around point B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well im standing there just looking at this moving... I didnt hear any engine or anything like that. and it was flying way to slow and low than any airplane i have ever seen..and it seemed to slow for a airplane to stay in the air.it went from my left to the right until it disapeared behind the trees. It didnt have the blinking lights that all planes are supposed to have to show that they are in the air . and this thing was extreamly large.. i cant imagine how something that big could stay in the air while it was moving that slow. it looked more like a bomarang .however that might be spelled<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2002 is unknown.

( it was not a year since 9/11, and there had been talk that our locks could be a target).  anyway, it started floating up again.  it took about a minute or two to jerkily float upwards and then zoom back down toward the water.  this repeated many times, and continued for about 15 - 20 minutes.  i dont remember it disappearing, it just sort of vanished.  it was extremely unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i did not report this at the time because i did not know of this site.  i actually thought there would be others who had seen this and there would be a report in the news or paper about it, and i would come forward and confirm it at that time as well.  but nothing was ever said and my husband thought i was &#39;nuts&#39;.  but i cannot forget this, it was very strange, and nothing that i can explain.  i also thought i may find something in this site about someone else who had seen this.  i am not sure of the date.  i do know it was early summer of 2002, in the mid to late evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/02 20:30|Equinunk|PA|Egg|1 hour|7 ufo's stop over the upper delaware river valley|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47594.html|168|ndxe200206| 7 ufo&#39;s stop over the upper delaware river valley<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dusk, I was driving along the pennsylvania side of the upper delaware river valley (route 191) I noticed lights that seemed strange, so I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my car. There were red &amp; white lights on the front of the ufo, about 15 or 20 lights going across. They would flash at different speeds, from one end to the other.  So you would see a red light flash on the left side, then a white light next to it, then a red and so on.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> there was absolutely no noise from the ufo, then I noticed another one in the distance, with the same type of light pattern, and then another one flying from another direction.  On the other side of the road behind me, there were many trees, so when a ufo flew that way, I could not see it anymore.  So when a ufo would come from over the trees in that direction, I could not say if it was the same one I just saw minutes ago, or if it was another one.  The most I saw in the sky at any one time was 7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that they were flying no higher than a 15 story building.  One flew right over me, and from underneath it seemed to look like a glowing egg.  The only unusual movements were two ufo&#39;s that were flying straight towards each other, instead of colliding, one of them stopped over the top of the other one, after about 10 seconds? the one on top suddenly backed upwards at a 90 degree angle.  After 30 - 40 minutes, one by one they turned off all the lights (red &amp; white) and then a single glowing orange light came on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started to &#39;park&#39; over the delaware river.  It looked like a constellation once they had all parked (7 ufo&#39;s)  So after awhile I figured the show was over and that I should go home and tell my wife,<n> <n><n> <n><n> well I crossed the river into new york state, and after less than 5 minutes driving I saw another ufo with the same red &amp; white lights as before.  So I pulled over to look at it, and it turned out there was a company located there, as I drove into the parking lot, I stopped my car and called 3 people over, saying do you know what&#39;s flying out here, the one guy with a girl, said it could be an airplane and left, the guy who stayed, I told him it was flying right over us and didn&#39;t make any noise.  Then I told him it was going to &#39;park&#39; where those orange lights were, because now I was on the opposite side of the river from where I was before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ufo parked with the other orange lights that looked like a constellation, and the guy said &#34;as long as they&#39;re not coming to get me&#34;  He then left abruptly.  This was a Friday night, June 2002.  I could figure out the exact date because the newspaper on the new york side &#39;the times herald record&#39; had a front page story a couple days after my mass sighting.  It was a story about a guy who took 15 minutes of daytime video footage of a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original spot for the sighting was a self storage business on route 191, just over the border (about 3 minutes) from Hancock, New York.  There are almost no companies on the new york side of the river (route 97) so it was very unusual to pull off the road suddenly and actually be in a company parking lot with people, usually it would just be trees &amp; deer.  This location here is about 50 miles northwest of pinebush new york, which is suppose to be the most popular spot for ufo sightings on the east coast of america.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When I first noticed it, it stationary.  I remember thinking how odd it was that almost as soon as I noticed it, It began moving horizontally from north to south, and it appeared to be &#34;dancing&#34; up and down slightly.  It was not moving very fast.  When I first saw it, the first thing that came to mind was a blimp at night, only brighter.  It also moved faster than a blimp. Living between Cleveland and Akron, I&#39;ve seen the Goodyear blimp at night returning to Akron after ballgames, and this was not a blimp, but it&#39;s shape was almost identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to see the object and when I saw it, I ran inside to get someone to come out and see it.  My sister came outside and also saw it for a short time.  We got into her car and tried to find it again once it was out of sight.  I noticed a man who pulled his car over and was standing outside of it looking in the direction that the UFO was travelling.  I believe that he saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was out on the country side and then  suddenly I saw two circular objects! Far away but I think they were UFOs because they didn&#39;t move around, they stood still. The two objects were not very large unless if they were very far away! I think they could be like 50-600 meters up, so I really have no idea... One of them was a bit larger than the other and it looked like it was red colored. I cannot say if that was an ufo, but I know that no airplane can stand still like that, and not even a helicopter would normally stand still for like a hole minute! I looked carefully if the objects could be connected to the ground, but I couldn&#39;t see that it was the case. If the objects really were standing up there, it cannot have been objects from our earth. I didn&#39;t point at the objects, because I think the other people in the buss would then just think I was crazy or something, but personally I&#39;m pretty sure that this was not human made objects. If anyone ever read this, they are the first to know about it!<n>

I thought it was just my grandmother&#39;s neighbor doing some last minute yard work, so i didn&#39;t really care. I got out of the car again and it got louder. I walked over to where it was loudest, and it was coming from this short grove of trees in the back of my grandmothers house. I just kept walking until I heard it start to get really loud. I looked up and saw a...how should I describe it...purple like blue glow above the trees. By now I was PRETTY scared, and I started reciting a couple prayers from the bible. Then this circular craft came out of the trees, and just hovered there, and it had these purple designs around the top of the dome. They were formed in circles with lines coming out of the sides, and they were just, glowing. But they didn&#39;t glow normally, they were sort of, pulsating, like blood in our vains, purple colors. It was really wierd. The, this light sort of skimmed across the whole craft, like the sun reflecting of of metal, and when it left, the craft justtook off, slow at first, then fast. I just watched it until it wasn&#39;t visible anymore. The craft was, I&#39;m guessing, ABOUT maybe thirty feet in diameter, with the designs on the sides, and it looked like it was made of a really shiny metal, and the pulsating purple was like a design or a date or something on it. Either way the whole experience couldn&#39;t have been something I made up because I&#39;m not the kind of person who makes this stuff up out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

6/15/02 05:00|Nickelville|MO|Oval|1 hour|MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  As the light was turning down the whole damn thing lit up from the center out.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73416.html|179|ndxe200206| After the night shift at a local travel plaza in mt. vernon MO me and a friend and his girlfriend went to a local hangout. We went there to drink a few beers. We were setting on the tailgate of his pickup talking about work. A few min after we got there i noticed a light to the N/W. At first i thought it was a light on a light pole at a farm house. It looked like a tree was swaying in front of it. Then it stoped flickering and begain to get brighter. It was moving closer we kept talking. I thought it was maybe an airplane but it was moving kinda strange,  you know left to right and up and down. The closer it got the more I watched it after about 30 mins I began to get a little uneasy you might say. At this time I had drank no more than 2 beers so i was not at all drunk, although that might have helped my nerves a little. The light looked like it was watching us, that made me feel very strange. My frend was downing beers i told him to check it out he said (aw! w its just a plane) I said, &#34;You think? It dosent move like a plane.&#34; (I grew up beside an airport and have seen many planes large and small military and civilan chopers and well you get the point). Well the (LIGHT) was very bright now and extremely close i was standing now I was very excited and scared and kinda glad or something I was finally seeing that thay were realy real!!! My friend was more interested in his girlfriend, and seemed to not realy care until it was directly over our heads. There was no sound other than me screaming at him and her to run or start the truck and repeating the F word many times as it set over us no more then 100 yards above the trees. It seemed to be moving slightly but so slow. I couldnt figure out if I should run or just crawl under the truck and hide. I was realy expecting it to be a choper, but when it got about 300 to 400 yards away and no noise was herd my brain just went stupid. I kinda panicked slightly but I wanted to see it so I d! idnt run. I was afraid of what it might do after seeing shows ! like FIR E IN THE SKY about travis walton I just had to stay and be sure it was what I thought it was. I mean hell its not every day you see something  like this. It was so damn close, but when it came to a complete stop it looked like it was turning its light down as if to shine on us or maybe the whole ship was tilting. As the light was turning down the whole damn thing lit up from the center out. It was like a row of floodlights but the lights werent lit the whole length of the ship, just the center edge. Now when they hit the lights I thought, &#34;O shit it was like being hit with two thousand volts, I hauled ass and ran as fast as I could for about 10 yards. I realised I wasent hurt or being picked  up. Although I was shaking so bad it was like i had been droped in ice water, the  shaking part I mean. So I stoped and looked back and they were still by the truck looking up with there hands shielding their eyes from the light. It was ripped from a scifi movie or something then the th! ing slowly drifted on past. Kinda a smooth oozing kinda glide. Just perfect and smooth my friend said it had to be a plane or chopper from the army in  stelth mode . Thats what he thinks. He realy never said any more about it. I told  him stelth meant that it was  not seen on radar. And a stelth bomber couldnt hover. A choper would put off a hell of a lot of wind. But because he didnt believe in ufos it had to be some type of military craft. What do you think???  I  have seen other things but this is the clearest and i know it wasnt a dream this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report received by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP. http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

I remeber he was telling me that a town right next to us, Dunedin, FL, had one of the highest recorded UFO sightings in Florida.  I shrugged this off, and started strumming the guitar, looking out into the ocean.  I was facing North West when I noticed 1 light far off into the distance, in the ocean.  At first glance I thought it was a star or satellite, or even a plane.  The sphere was barely a speck, red in color.  This made me consider the fact of a plane even more, until I saw it turn.  The turn was not a curved or graceful turn whatsoever, it was like the object shifted.  It was at one spot one moment, and all of a sudden, it dropped a good distance, then shifted to the left immediately.  I pointed this out to my friend, and we were both amazed.  We watched this light and 3 others that joined it for a good half hour, sliding up, down, at sharp angles, almost as if they were following a line, instead of a curve.  During that time, we saw one aircraft fly past, and the four red lights seemed to group together until it flew past their general area.  It almost seemed like the four lights were playing with each other, chasing and being chased.  Then, they started heading in a north, northeast direction, and kept going in that direction until they faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked out the passenger side window on my right and saw two rows of 6 very large and bright lights, each the exact distance from the other. The row on the left was higher up than the one on the right.  They appeared to be several football fields long and very close to us. The lights were a pale yellow and cast no light, but only glowed.  My brother, who was beside me in the front passenger seat, was lightly dozing.  I screamed for him to wake up and look out the window.  We were both amazed at the sight and kept saying, &#34;Oh, my God, what the hell are they.&#34;  The lights on the top row on the left side suddenly went out, one after the other, in rapid succession, starting with the light closest to us.  The lower row on the right followed immediately after in the same manner.  The entire viewing lasted less than 3 minutes.  The first thing my brother said was, &#34;You know we can&#39;t ever tell anyone about this because they&#39;ll never believe it.&#34; We are both middle aged Grandparents and neither drink or do drugs.  We also aren&#39;t prone to exaggeration, and my brother has always been a pure skeptic, though I have never doubted their existence.I have read about about, and seen many, many, pictures of UFO&#39;s but, have never seen pictures of anything quite like these two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three or four months later in broad day light we were driving north somewhere between Los angles, and Monterey, CA and watched one doing bizarre movements above the mountain tops ahead of us on the west side of the highway.  It flew straight up and would disappear, and then suddenly reappear several miles to the left just above a different set of mountain tops.  Then it would fly from right to left, and left to right horizontally.  It did a number of these seemingly impossible movements for about 20 minutes before it disappeared for good. We kept wondering if any of the other travelers were seeing what we did.  It was almost as if they were saying to us, &#34;See, we are real and you didn&#39;t imagine what you saw the other time.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

By the time my friend turned around the object had vanished, but he saw that I was visibly shaken.  I really hope someone else saw this one, cause it really freaked me out.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pictures of UFO&#39;s that appear during stormy weather near Clovis, New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Clovis, New Mexico. This is really strange, but it is true. I have been taking pictures for quite some time with a Sony digital camera. I love to photograph rain storms, clouds, sunsets, and things of this nature. This may seem really wierd, but it is true and I am willing to take a lie detector test if necessary to support my allegations. When I am photographing the sky, the naked eye doesn&#39;t see anything but clouds, rain, and rainbows. But, after I download the pictures to my computer, it is very noticable that their are foreign objects in the sky. They look like oval to circle shape objects. Some look like jets are in pursuit chasing them. The pictures I have taken are always in the eastern part of the sky during the storms. They have been taken over a 3 year span. In most of the pictures, the objects appear and are visible. When blown up some of them look like they could be flying saucers with what could be jets. I live very close to Cannon Airforce Base. I was wondering if anyone is interested in seeing these pictures. I swear these pictures are authentic and untouch photos. They are not super clear in nature and could be questionable, but I would like to know what other people think the objects could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unexplained objects appearing in my photos taken with a Sony digital camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other day I sent information on pictures I took during stormy weather with unexplained images appearing on them. I tried to send you the pictures that were taken, but my i.p. address or mailing client is blocked from your site. So, I&#39;ll try to send them through here. Hopefully it will go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I filled out a form under ((name deleted)). I haven&#39;t actually seen the UFO&#39;s. I like to take pictures of the sky, weather, and nature. I have taken several pictures over the past three years. When I&#39;m taking the pictures, I don&#39;t see anything in the sky. After I download them to my computer, wierd images appear on my photos.  At first, I blew it off as something on the lense, etc. I take these pictures with a Sony digital camera. Recently, we bought a new Sony digital camera, and I got the same results. These UFO&#39;s seem to like the rainy and partly cloudy weather. Especially, if there is a rainbow or light cloud cover. I live in Clovis, New Mexico, and I often take pictures of the eastern sky because that&#39;s where the rainbows appear. I swear these pictures are untouch and there has been no digital enhancements. I find it wierd that they appear in so many different photos. Some look like jets are taking them. They are not clear, but when you blow them up you will be surprised what they look like. I&#39;m just curious if it&#39;s possible that they are UFO&#39;s or space craft of some kind. Lately, they seem to be appearing in my photo&#39;s more and more often. I live really close to Cannon Airforce Base. I&#39;ve been thinking about contacting the base and showing them my photo&#39;s. No one but family members and friends have seen them. I work most of the time so I rarely have time to spare. I&#39;m sending you the photo&#39;s I have taken. They are very credible and I would be willing to take a lie detector test to validate that they are not retouched photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you enjoy looking at them and you can see what I&#39;m seeing. I&#39;ve shown them to other people and they say there&#39;s diffently something showing up in these pictures. I&#39;m sending you all the ones I have. They have been taken over a 3 year span. I&#39;m including the pictures that look like helicopters in the sky, which appeared right before the other objects. I&#39;ve also included pictures with rainbows showing nothing at first, then changing to the objects appearing, and exiting at the other end of the rainbow. That&#39;s why I believe these objects are real. Some of the picture I had were lost because my computer went down and I didn&#39;t have them backed up.I will check to see if perhaps they might have been saved on zip discs, but I&#39;m sure they were not. Some of them were even better then the ones I will be sending in this email. I hope you find these photo&#39;s interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely  ((name deleted))<n>

I like to look at the stars from time to time. This particular evening, I noticed a satelite slowly go by. Within 5 seconds, in the same location and path of that satelite, I noticed what appeared to be another satelight, then it flew in a zigzag pattern, then straight with a speed variation, then appeared to stop and then faded away in the same spot it stopped at. The distance I noticed it fly equated to streaching my arm out, and spreading my thumb and index finger by approximately 5 to 6 inches. My guess is that it was as high as satelites usually are, and the sun was reflecting on it, as it would a satelite. I did&#39;nt notice an unusual color or lights.<n>

It was about ten, maybe twenty miles from where I was. I was in a car wash station with my wife and niece waiting for our car to come out then when I looked at the mountain view, I saw this flying thing, shining from the sun which appeared to look like a disc. I wasnt certain what the shape was, but it certainly was somewhat round as the sun&#39;s reflection had a gradient to it. It floated west as fast as a helicopter although I didnt see any propellers or wings or fins to identify it as a plane or chopper. It was certainly metallic, maybe silver and it later dissappeared into the canopy of trees and power lines and buildings as I was at a vantage point with many obstructions to my field of view. I pointed it out to my wife and she gasped and saw it, my niece also saw it and couldnt believe what it was.<n>

I look up and i see five stars in a hatchet shape like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * * *          * * Well i had never seen any constalation like that before. I said &#34;dude look at the stars over there, dont that look weird.&#34; And i showed him where they were. He says to me &#34; yeah so there stars, and your piont.&#34; Well as we were walking i just kept staring at them then just as i was going to look away they started to move, slow at first but then faster, alot faster then a satilight which is what i thought it was but for 1 they dont bunch up like that, and 2 they dont go that fast. I stoped dead in my tracks and said &#34;DUDE LOOK, DO YOU SEE THEM?&#34; he looked up and saw the same thing i did( I had him explain what he saw just in case I  or he would think i was crazy). It was the weirdest thing iv ever seen. Well he did not care at all what was happening so he said &#34;lets go&#34; we were on our way to a friends house like 500 hundred feet away from where we saw it.as we got on to the porch i thought i would look again. well i found where they were all right back the way they were. But i! saw them split up and go the oppasite direction from each other. This is no lie I would steak my life on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

One of them (the tallest and possibly the leader) reaches for a scalpal knife and walks towards me. By this time I&#39;m starting to panic. However, another &#34;alien&#34; tried to calm me down.

A couple of minutes later, I noticed a bright, white light moving somewhat towards me from the NNW. I thought that it was strange to see the landing lights of an airplane near my house, as I am not in the flight path of the airport or the Air Force base. The object appeared to be flying at about 10,000 feet and moving at a medium speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the entire time as it passed just to the west of my home, flying in a SSE direction. The intensity of the light stayed perfectly consistent as it moved toward me then away from me. As it passed, I realized that if those were landing lights, then they would fade as the object passed me, but the light stayed just as intense, so therefore it could not be forward lights on a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So then I wondered if it possibly was a helicopter with a spot light, but why so high and there was no obvious beam pointing down, it was just a solid intense light. Then the light disappeared in mid air. At that point it was a few miles south of my home. Then I realized that there were no beacons whatsoever on this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any engine noise, and it was too dark to see if it had a shape. I just thought that it was odd that there were no beacons and how the light just disappeared in mid flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unusual for an aircraft, even a military aircraft, NOT to run its beacons and to be equipped with a light so bright in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed over Nebraska at 22:13 hrs. on this date.

Video footage taken of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses Email Report below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 13, 2002 I video-taped a round dark object in the sky, my kids had noticed as we sat in our hot tub just after 9:00 p.m. The object sat motionless until I started filming. Then it darted in and out of clouds, also back and forth as I tried to follow it. This was a very scary experience for my kids. I live in Hayward, Ca. and noticed on your website another sighting in the area. I&#39;ve never witnessed anything of this shape or speed in my life. I just want to get a professional opinion from someone else. Any ideas?  Telephone follow up below:  I had a pleasant conversation with the witness on the telephone. He described in detail what he and two other family members has witnessed on June 13, 2002. The man said it was something he had never saw before and was stunned at what they were observing. The fellow explained that on the night of the sighting he and the family were spending an evening in the hot tub and his daughter was playing a game , who could spot the most airplanes flying over head. The gentleman said that it is an active area due to two airports which are fairly close by. The Oakland and the Hayward airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the daughter who first spotted the object and said &#34;there is a plane&#34;. The man&#39;s son looked and said he didn&#39;t believe it was a plane. The son asked his father to look at the object in the night sky. When he looked up to see what the kids were looking at he saw a black spot which was just sitting stationary in the sky just below the cloud cover. They all could see the clouds moving but the dark object stayed in the same spot, not moving. They all wondered what could this be as it certainly looked unusual and it sat in the one position for approximately one minute and again it was not moving. Some quick thinking on the Dad&#39;s part ... had him running into their home and grabbing a video camera which was sitting on the kitchen table. He ran back outside with it. He had borrowed it from a close friend a couple of days prior to this sighting to take some footage of everyday things. Also not being really familiar with the camera he was trying his best to catch what he could of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he lined the camera up on the object, it started to move very quickly. It would duck into the cloud cover then pop back out. It continued doing this a couple of times but always remaining in the original area, not moving any distance from where they first noticed it. It was night and I wondered how they were able to see a dark object against a blackened sky. The witness said, even though it was dark out you were able to see a whiteness of the clouds and the dark object which sat below them. So it was the lightened backdrop which enabled the family to see the darkened craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the object moved into a darker cloud and as everyone watched it .... the cloud started swirling around and seemed to pull more of the surrounding cloud into the swirling motion. As it was doing this the cloud was growing darker. Again the object poked out from the cloud just slightly and moved back in again and this is when they all witnessed a strobing light coming from inside the cloud cover with the cloud starting to move closer in the direction of the family until it stopped and pretty much straight away moved back to it&#39;s original place. The total length of this sighting was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The fellow said all the time they spent outside that evening they had not seen any other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man called the Hayward airport to make an enquiry about what they saw. The folks at the airport told him there were no flights going out that night. The witness felt that was rather unusual in itself. He thought maybe because the weather conditions were not that good and socked in very badly, that this may be the reason why no flights left that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A still picture was made and blown up from the footage at one of the local universities. The Astronomy Department of the University and others checked the photograph out and saw that there was an object in the photo but no one could figure out what it was. So again the witness was left with no answers to this puzzling sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow told me after the sighting was over, they all went into the house as it certainly was a bit frightening to see such a strange sight. He told me he just paced around the home and wasn&#39;t at all sure what he was going to tell everyone about what they had seen and videotaped that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many thanks to this family for the wonderful report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

They were just hovering over my neighbors house. I dcided to go to the road so that I could see them more clearly. When I got up there I noticed that there wee 16 lights, all grouped in 4&#39;s. The groups were arranged in a diamond. All of the sudden the formation started to move. I heard no noise, an eerie silence. When 1 of them was right over me I noticed that the lights were part of a craft. The craft was diamond shaped and the bottom of the craft kept changing from yellow to blue, from blue to red, and from red back to yellow. I know aircraft and they dont have yellow bottomes that change color. Then the craft formation started to gain speed and when the other crafts became visible instead of lights, the formation sped away without looking back. This all took place in about 20 minutes.<n>

There were three of them, motionless in the sky, just visible over the buildings. They appeared to be very far away and gave the impression of being VERY large though I can&#39;t be certain of this. Each one appeared to be of the cigar shaped variety and glowed a dull white which stood out well against the darkening sky.  They were in a perfect triangular formation and never moved at all.  The sighting ended when we arrived at our destination and the building obscured our view, when we left later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have always been a believer in the U.F.O. phenomenon though I have never been convinced that extraterrestrials were to blame.  My friend on the other hand has never been what I would call a believer which makes it all the more interesting that she saw it first.

In the rear of the formation (way back) was the flashing red side lights of the helicopter, 2 lights on either side.The southern most lit craft passed approx 100-200 ft above the hill top to my south and I observed that the lit portion was only in the front of the craft.There appeared to be some type of tail or upward wing extension in the rear as I was observing it in an almost parallel view. It appeared tear drop in shape, moving at a high rate of speed,and moving as if it was skimming across the surface of water (a jerking kind of forward movement).The center craft had the same kind of motion and appearance but the real observation I had was the northern most craft that kept coming directly towards me. The front of the craft with the glowing light was approximately 100 ft up and I could see that the light area was quite wide, at least 10ft across in the front. I could see the lit  portion as it passed directly over me, the dark metallic shape as it blocked all the stars above,the passage of the craft over the roof of my house.No noise,40ft across,no wind,turbulence,nothing.The helicopter pursued that one but it could never catch up.All three shot up to the western sky across the Casinos along the river, the northern one being chased by the helicopter  which was way in the rear. I observed that I could see the lit area in the front of the crafts as they were going away from me and up which means that the lit portion is on the top, sides and bottom. They are not spotlights as they do not project any beam but seem to glow quite brightly instead.All 3 craft plus the helicopter passed almost directly over the Bullhead City International Airport probably 500 ft high. No mention of any flyovers was ever made in the local papers the next day. I wonder if any Radar reports by the Airport were ever made and of course no military reports were ever released to the media.In short,nothing ever happened and for 2min of my life, I was privileged to see something the likes of which I will probably never see again. Maybe the craft that passed over my rooftop saw that I was a fellow star traveler of sorts (25 years of astronomy) and granted me the honor of just a peek.I was never in fear of the crafts but I do fear my government which is why it has taken so long to report this event. I wish that they would give us the benefit of the doubt and let the people decide how to handle the truth.We die in wars,pay taxes ,support politicians,serve in the armed forces, and raise families to name just a few decisions that we people make,daily. Oh well, God Bless America.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to have red &amp; green lights, triangle shape and moved at a fast rate of speed.  Appeared to be very high in sky but was still large. no sound was heard.  No trail was left either.  Eventually, it just flew out of my sight but not after going across the sky for 5-7 seconds.<n>

It was a calm night and the stars were clearly visible accross the night sky.  Then we saw something. It appeared to look like a star.  He asked me if it was an airplane and I told him that it was.  But it started to move really fast.  It looked like a star that was moving.  It zig-zagged a little bit and then it turned orange and disappeared right before our very eyes.  We were freaked out with what we just saw because we never saw anything like that before.  2 minutes later, we saw a real airplane.  The lights were blinking and it was moving, but it was moving very slow.  That was the normal speed of any airplane.  What we saw moved 3 times faster than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS flew over California at 22:00 hrs. on this date.

Travelling as a passenger in a van, i seen a light rectangle in the sky in the distance.  At first i thought it was something on the window of the van, then i thought it must be a part of the moon or something, but it was rectangle.  The object never moved in the sky as we turned a corner and i watched it out the open window of the van.  It was there for 5 minutes, then it vanished and i spent another 5 minutes looking for it but it was gone.  It looked like one of them home made movies of someone filming a UFO, and you go yeah right thats a fake, well that was what it was like.  There were no flashing light, just one continous lightness through the whole object.  There were other people in the van with me but i felt stupid suggesting it was a UFO.<n>

The object had no discernable light source on its surface, and the glow may have been the reflection of city lights. Its air speed was faster than any airplane that I&#39;ve ever seen to traverse that same distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From my vantage-point, as I sat on the ground between two trees, the object flew in a straight line south. It appeared to be the  same size as a pea held at arms-length. Its altitude seemed to be slightly higher than the peaks above Kaysville. This was a quiet evening with little wind, and the object made no noticeable sound. Fifteen minutes later, a passenger jet flew by the same area and jet engines were distinctly heard, even though the jet appeared to be farther away from me than the unknown object had been.<n>

Flying north across Lorane Valley (southwest of Eugene - several miles west of I-5). White lights on each tip. One bright searchlight in center. The searchlight scanned the earth (across Lorane Valley and the hills and valleys to the west.) Because it took a long time to fly south to north over the valley (most planes fly it in a few minutes), and it was able to send the light over such a distance east to west, my sense was that the craft was at typical plane altitude or higher. However, it was so enormous that it was hard to tell.It seemed like it was in low gear - flying straight and steady. The searchlight was scanning back and forth (I thought it might be a defense operation practice). Yet, it felt creepy. It scanned my yard, and I moved under a tree so as not to be seen! When I went back into the house, I asked my friend how long I had been gone. I was only half joking. The experience was more than simply visual. It was so big, so quiet, and the searchlight was so bright that I felt like something &#34;special&#34; had happened - although not a pleasant special. I am a skeptic about UFOs - maybe because I don&#39;t want to think about how scary ETs might be. But, I don&#39;t drink, do drugs, and I am a relatively sane, balanced person. I don&#39;t usually get scary feelings; I don&#39;t imagine things. I certainly am not inclined to watch the skies for UFOs. I pushed the experience to the back of my mind, until I heard about a black triangle book, and that others had seen them. Figured I better get my visual on record as well. Wonder what they are?!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It passed almost directly overhead to the right of my apartment, then went from sight over the hill behind my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was impossible to judge altitude. Just prior to it going from sight, a BA146 jet approached Turin airport virtually in the opposite direction, guess this was around 4000/5000 ft, heard it&#39;s engines etc, but as this went from view, I watched the ufo for another 10/15 secs, completely silent, and no lights, still changing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only analogy I can draw, is the changing shape of asteroids, as dipicted in say documentaries etc, BUT, outside shape was well defined, not ragged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear evening, with light blue twilight, and the alps were clear as a bell, some 30/40 miles away.

I have seen planes at this high altitude, but am able to see their flashing lights. This was just a white sphere. The light from it seemed to dim and grow at certain points, but it could have been cloud cover, I am not sure. However, This craft had no visible blinking lights, which I thought was strange. It was moving at a good speed over the middle of the city heading in a south east direction.

I am certain it was paranormal, but have never heard of any similar occurrences and have no bases for explanation.  I can only describe what occurred.  I do not necesarily wish this information to be placed within your database but wish to receive a response informing me if others have had a similar experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have approximated the date knowing it to be sometime during the first 10 days of June.  I awakened during the night with a sense of some presence in the room.  Looking toward my door, I saw, fading quickly, something which almost had the appearance of a hologram.  Next, shadows appeared outside the windows in an erratic shape.  I thought the shadows to be from trees moving in a strong wind.  The appearance was of a storm blowing the limbs to create these shadows outside the window.However, there was no storm.  I looked out the adjacent window on the side of the house facing opposite and there was no wind at all.  In fact, there were no trees positioned in such a way to cast a shadow.  I opened the blinds to see what might be causing the shadows.  I saw what seemed to be a hologram with the shape of two small eyes moving erratically outside the window.  I was frightened and closed the blinds.  I moved to another bedroom in the house and tried to forget what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later, I was awakened late with by a humming sound and again saw the erratic shadows outside the window.  This time, knowing there was no storm or other possible source of shadows from trees or anything else, (I had investigated possible sources and found none,)I was very frightened.  I watched the shadows for 10-15 minutes and then called the police.  When the policeman arrived, we walked out on the back deck to investigate and found no visible signs of any intrusion whatsoever.  After the policeman left I walked toward the door facing the back porch and saw a large burst of bluish white light.  It looked unnatural, almost like a laser.  I wondered if something were trying to inform me they understood what I had done by calling the police.  I have not seen this since but am very curious to know if you have had anyone report a similar experience.<n>

Before going to bed I went out to check the horses and feed a little hay. As always I look up at the stars but the clouds had rolled in making star watching nearly impossible. A few starts shown through the clouds in between the breaks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking from the barn with hay to throw to the horses when I notice to the North this bright blue light coming down from the sky in an odd snake-like fashion, disappearing behind the hills miles away. Less then 5 minutes later it reappeared and was climbing back into the sky in the same snake-like motion to the North and West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was enough of a break in the clouds to see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was huge, bright and bluish in color and had no tail like a meteor would have. It skirted about the hill tops just west of here... I couldn&#39;t make out any shape other then a bright blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This afternoon I was talking to a friend of mine who is also a night owl computer person and he was out doing likewise at 3AM over in Rivertown Utah.

Aside from a series of numbers stamped on its slightly dimpled surface, the sphere offered few clues as to its origin.<n> <n><n> &#34;It looked like it may have been in the sea for awhile, but we just had no idea what it was,&#34; said Segneri, a vacationer from Tampa, Fla.  Segneri&#39;s family wasn&#39;t alone. A parade of authorities from local, state and federal agencies examined the odd ball Wednesday. All came away scratching their heads.<n> <n><n> &#34;Strange,&#34; said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham, shaking her head.  &#34;We&#39;re calling it a UFO - an unidentified floating object.&#34;<n> <n><n> Two Segneri family members first spotted the sphere Monday afternoon when the sun glinted off its surface as it bobbed in the ocean. Thinking it was giant beach ball or a stray buoy, they swam out to grab it.<n> <n><n> &#34;We tried to push it toward shore, but it was just too heavy, and we had to let it go,&#34; said Tony Segneri, Marie&#39;s nephew.<n> <n><n> The ocean eventually coughed up the ball later that day. Someone called authorities about the sphere, and the town sent a firefighter to investigate. A decision was made to leave it there and take another look when the sun was up. But when firefighters returned, it was gone.<n> <n><n> That&#39;s because Segneri stumbled across the silver sphere while walking along the beach that night with her nieces and nephews. Concerned that it was a hazard to children, her relatives pushed the sphere up a ramp from the beach and deposited it in the dunes in front of their Ocean Boulevard house, where it became something of a curious lawn ornament.<n> <n><n> &#34;We just didn&#39;t know what to do with it,&#34; she said.  Unable to determine what it is was and tired of looking at it, the family called police Wednesday. In no time, the area was roped off with yellow tape and official-looking people were crawling all over the sphere.<n> <n><n> The Segneris had planned to spend the day visiting local sights, but instead cracked sodas and pulled up lawn chairs to watch the action from their back porch. In the course of the afternoon, police, firefighters, the Air Force bomb squad, Coast Guard personnel and an inspector from the state<n> <n><n> Department of Health and Environmental Control came to examine the orb, which was parked on the ground beside a barbecue grill.<n> <n><n> Various people poked, rubbed, studied and photographed it. They contacted agencies such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but no one claimed ownership.<n> <n><n> The Coast Guard&#39;s best guess was that the sphere was some sort of flotation device used in a dredging operation. But the ball had no hooks or clamps where a line might be attached to hold it in place, Graham said.<n> <n><n> Finally, at about 4 p.m., crews hauled the sphere to the town&#39;s public works department for safe keeping. In the process, the orb cracked in half along a seam. No little green men came out, just some old seawater.<n> <n><n> &#34;There was nothing green, nothing glowing,&#34; Graham said. &#34;It will probably just go to the scrap yard.&#34;<n> <n><n> Glenn Smith covers police and crime.

6/9/02 23:30|Grants Pass|OR|Oval|2 minutes|Sighting of very fast object near Grants Pass, OR  that made strange moves, and was pursued by jets.|2/25/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27673.html|231|ndxe200206| Sighting of very fast object near Grants Pass, OR  that made strange moves, and was pursued by jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 22 Year-old son and I were on a camping vacation, and were staying at a KOA campground a few miles south of Grants Pass, OR on the highway to Crescent City, CA It was a totally clear night, and dark enough to plainly see the Milky Way.  My son turned the northwest and said, &#34;Look at that light!&#34;  I turned to look, and I saw a oval-shaped cream or beige colored light moving from the northwest to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 20 degrees to the left of being directly overhead.  It also appeared to be the size of 5 to 10 average stars, and as bright as Venus at a close approach to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving in a straight line and moving much faster than a satellite.  We saw it coming toward us, pass us and move away from us, and there was no tail or trail whatsoever.  During the time we watched it, its outline remained highly defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed us and traveled some distance away from us, it suddenly accellerated and moved rapidly forward and to the side at the same time.  It made a scallop-shaped trajectory somewhat like tracing the fingers of a glove.  At the top of the third &#34;finger&#34; it instantaneously disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I sat down and compared impressions of what we had just seen, and they were almost exactly the same.  While we were talking, and approximately 5 to 10 minutes after the sighting, several (5 to 10) jets flying without navagation lights, but with afterburners on came from the northwest along the same path the light had traveled.  When they reached the approximate spot where the object had accellerated and began the strange sideways movements.  They broke and buzzed the general area for a short time, then left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident left me with several impressions, but no facts to back them up.  I believe the object was very high in the upper atmosphere.  I also believe that a human being could not have lived through the movements this object made just before it disappear, and the speed was so great that the pursuit jets had no chance of even keeping with with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However, the International Space Station passed over the State of Washington at 22:26 hrs. on this date.

6/9/02 22:36|Bellingham|WA|Light|60 seconds|Extremely Bright Object Crosses Sky at Twilight (at least 2x brightness Sirius/planets)|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23219.html|234|ndxe200206| Extremely Bright Object Crosses Sky at Twilight (at least 2x brightness Sirius/planets)<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home at 10:30 06/09/02 I stood to have a cigarette on the front porch. My house faces north across the bay in Bellingham proper. Because of the city light pollution only a few of the brightest stars were out by this time, and quite dim. That is why I saw the object at once, it came over the roof of a house low on the north horizen. It was an extremely bright point of light, yellowish white. As it approached it became brighter. I am not good with the luminosity scale but it was definitly twice as bright as any of the planets or Sirius, and moving across the horizen quite fast. I assumed it was a satallite, although I have never seen one moving so fast, and fenitely never seen one so bright. As the object passed my position and began to move south, I noticed the trailing edge seemed to tail out slightly. The color or appearance did not change--it looked like a very, very bright star, moving very quickly. As soon as it passed over head I ran inside to get my roomate to see what he thought. In the 10 seconds it took me to run inside and get back out with him it was far to the south, still moving quickly. To the south lie mountains, but our view was abscured by rooftops. Before it dissapeared over them the object faded from extremely bright to very dim, and then faded from view. Chris (roomate) said it must have been a satallite, but I am not so sure. It faded from view a fair ways above the horizen. When I noticed it, it was just barely above the horizen to the north across the bay, and was extremely bright. When we saw it fade from view it was not even close to the horizen to the south, of which I am sure; the rooftop of our house is far above it and we were standing out in the front lawn. Perhaps the twilight can explain that behavior. I only make the report because of the extreme brightness and speed, I do not think a satellite could reflect so much light. The Space Station perhaps?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is correct.  Probably the ISS.

It was a beautiful sight. there were no blinking lights, no noise and Iknow when i am seeing a plane, helicopter, or jet, i have lived here 6 yrs and have never seen anything like this over this area, we get small planes all the time flying over us. it was awesome, i will watch every night i can now.

This road is remarkable for the fact that it is in a neighborhood that was depopulated as the airport grew.The road is closed to thru traffic and blocked, although accessable on foot.It was dark and we carried a flashlight. No one that we knew of was on the road.We were able to see and hear the approach of about three passenger jet planes as we walked. Each plane was clearly visible and fairly well into descent as we saw them. There were distinct intervals of time between each air approach when the windless quiet of the night resumed. In other words the traffic wasnt &#34;stacked up&#34;. It was during one of these interludes that everyone in the family heard the sound of something up above us.The sound was of something clearly moving thru the air,BUT!!! there were no lights no engine or jet sounds... nothing but this sound. I want to emphasize that there was no natural wind activity in the area. Everyone was perplexed and at a lost for explanation. There were two events of this nature. At the end of this section of road an airport police squad car was parked.We are wondering if anything like this has ever been reported. We are stumped. We know all of the noises and effects associated with planes overhead in this area,as we have walked it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC RESPONSE TO WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the report!  Yes, what you report has been reported to us before...I believe you heard the turbulent vortex activity generated by the tip of an airplane wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When airliners land, using a relatively high angle of attack on approach, the air on the bottom of the wing &#34;leaks&#34; around the tip of the wing.  This continuous process generates a &#34;tornado&#34; at the tip of the wing, which persists in the atmosphere for a long period of time.  The twisting air can be heard at ground level, and it is quite prominent in a calm sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is only a theory, but I suspect that if you return to the same location, you can experience the same effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> --<n> <n><n> Peter B.

I thought this was very strange - could they be birds, seed pods, planes, and kept asking my friend if he could see them.  He could not see anything. There were probably 40 or 50 &#34;stars&#34; moving slowly toward the east - they were forming different patterns as they moved (circles, chevrons, orion). At one point a plane flew across the sky below them so they were pretty high.  The movement of these objects was sideways and backwards and circular and they formed patterns.  I don&#39;t know of any birds that fly that way or seedpods that would be visible at such a high altitude. I have very good vision, have flown quite a bit and have never seen anything like this before. I am also a skeptic but I was totally blown away by this.  After I watched these &#34;stars&#34; for about 5-10 minutes they simply faded up into the sky as if they were moving away and upward.  Has anyone seen anything like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found her to be quite lucid in her description of the event.

Once you knew it was there you couldn&#39;t miss it.  Kind of the same as one I saw about 6 years ago. Only that one I had my binoculars and showed it to another person. The person I showed it to was an ex-marine from WWII. All I did was point it out and their reaction was to say, I wish we would shoot one of those down. I am a little frustrated in that I have seen at least 4 different ones over the years and have no way to explain any of it. And that most people (includes me) can go about their everyday lives with this right on the edge of sight. At any rate I&#39;m glad to unload a bit of this.

Object began a gentle turn toward the east and exhibited an increase in velocity for approximately one or two seconds.  Object then turned sharply north and increased velocity again for about one half to one second at that point the object appeared to dive or decrease at a very steep angle, straightened out to a level trajectory for a short time and again appeared to initiate a dive.  During the second dive the object left a trail behind it much like a meteor or falling star.  The object then seemed to clime back to its original altitude and very abruptly change direction back toward the south, southeast.  While traveling at a high rate of speed the object zigzag east to west while continuing in its overall south-southeast direction.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a bright object. I turned to see what it was and at first it appeared to be an airplane with it&#39;s front light on. I was facing east and the object was traveling high in the sky north to south very calmly. All of the sudden the light got dim to a spec of light similar to the brightness of the dimmest star in the sky. And finally it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is consistent with a satellite with a fluctuating reflective albido.  PD))<n>

I was facing due south and the light was approching from the SE to NW. As it came closer, within 100 feet, I looked up and saw a green object not very high up in the sky. The light was intense and green. The object passed overhead and while still in sight turned bright red for an instant and then appeared to break up. There were distinct pieces visable. I watch a lot of night sky and have never seen anything come from this direction. The close proximity to the ground really gave an erie feel to the whole thing. It was probably a shooting star, but the direction of travel has me curious.<n>

We had just sat down in the living room of my house to watch the Mike Tyson VS Lennox Lewis pay per view boxing match fight on HBO.  As we sat there talking, Mike Tyson, just put his leg over the ropes to enter the boxing match ring when an object with very bright lights facing downward. flew, glided over the top of my house at very slow speed illuminating the inside of my house through the 6, 9 foot tall 3 foot wide windows on the front of my house facing Eastward, on Bond Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw this bright thing through my windows moving Eastward. I jumped off of my couch slid the sliding glass doors of my house open and steeped onto my patio facing Bond Lake, as I looked up at a 45 degree angle I saw a triangular shaped object, about 10 foot above the tree tops in my yard moving East at about 2 miles per hour.  At this point this triangular object was about 65 feet from me, I could see the bottom and back of the object.  It had 3 bright lights, very, very bright pointing downward at each of the 3 points of the bottom of the triangle craft each of these 3 lights were about 4 foot in diameter and were projecting light downwards.  On the back of the craft was a very, very bright round light about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, but this light being well lit with bright light was not projecting light outward as the other 3 lights on the bottom of the craft were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point this triangular craft was about 60 feet from my eyes moving East over my dock and boat.  My 2 friends were beside me all 3 of us staring at this triangular object, it continued to move across the lake at about 2-3 miles per hour, at about 40 feet above the water of the lake.  This vehicle came to a stop on the East side of Bond Lake, about 400 feet from my patio.  It looked as if it was sitting on the tree tops, on the East side of the lake shore the lights on the bottom of the craft were no longer visible, they went out. This craft was about ! 50 feet tall and about 80 feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I ran inside my house to get a camera while my 2 friends continued to watch this craft from the patio of my house. When I came back with a camera the battery was dead and this craft was still sitting there hovering in the air making no sound at all. I ran into my house to get another battery for my handy cam camera when I returned to the balcony the craft was still there and the new battery was also dead.  I ran into my house again to get another battery for my camera, the new battery was also dead. I ran back to the patio the craft was gone, I asked my 2 friends where did it go?  They said it disappeared, I asked did it go right, left or straight up?  They said no, it just disappeared.  We watched this triangular shaped craft for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. The weather on this night was clear and warm.  I later learned that a triangular craft was seen by others on the East side of the state of Wisconsin, 1 hour after our sighting experience.<n>

6/8/02 20:00|Beaver|PA|Cigar|00:01:30|At the front of the chemtrail, was an intensely, luminous, white diagonal line with a dark area at its mid center.|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24720.html|254|ndxe200206| At the front of the chemtrail, was an intensely, luminous, white diagonal line with a dark area at its mid center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 6/8/02, at around 8 PM, during clear skies, I saw a vapor trail, about 1/2 inch wide, that had begun at about 40 degrees above the NNE horizon which then, ascended almost straight upwards towards the zenith, but at a slight angle towards the east, of about 5 degrees.  At about 10 degrees below the zenith, this vapor trail made a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and at this point, it appeared to continue on, parallel to the ground, moving straight towards the SSE.  It seemed to have crossed directly over my neighbor&#39;s house and it seemed unusually low for a chemtrail. This vapor trail was about 2 inches wide, overhead. I was mowing grass at about 100 feet west of this house when I noticed it.  As I mowed, I saw that it spanned about 2/3 of the way across the sky but no further. It seemed to have stopped, as though, it were freeze framed. At the very front of this horizontal vapor trail, I saw a motionless and intensely, luminous, white diagonal line that was about 1/2 inch long at arm&#39;s length. It was tilted upwards at about 50 degrees, towards the right or towards the south. This luminous line had a small, yet, definite, dark area at its mid center. I observed it for about 90 seconds and it maintained its position, just to the left side of a tall tree. Using the house and tree as a guide, I noticed no movement of either this luminous white line or its vapor trail.  I never saw any of this vapor trail being made although, it  should have been within my visual field while approaching overhead.  Everything about this sighting seemed motionless, as if, freeze-framed from my first observation to my last. I&#39;d looked away for about 30 seconds, to turn my mower around and when I looked back this luminous diagonal line was gone. Although, the chemtrail remained, its vapor stream abruptly ended at the exact location where I last saw the luminous, diagonal line hovering.This luminous line&#39;s shape was thin and rectangular but visually flat and without a shadow side. It had perfect symmetry with clean, sharp edges! . Nothin g wavered or dimmed. The horizontal vapor trail was rippled, as if, composed of many small clouds, placed side by side. The vapor trail seemed unusually sparse, semi-translucent, soft-edged and light-violet-gray in color. It wasn&#39;t an opaque white. None of this horizontal vapor trail was reflecting any sunlight. The sun was at the opposite side of the sky at that time. I saw no clouds, haze nor other vapor trails. I didn&#39;t see anything about this sighting wink-out,  fly away nor move. This wasn&#39;t a normal flight path.  The winds were calm but I didn&#39;t watch the chemtrail dissipate, either. I just forgot about it and kept mowing.<n>

The object appeared to be 100 feet above the mountains flying up and across. When I first noticed it it appeared to be in the shape of a box and not very big (about the size that a small private plane might look at that height). As soon as I saw it it tried to show it to my family. As I was pointing where to look (taking my eyes off of it for a moment) it changed shape (from its movement I believe) to a round bottem cup shape without the handle (the round section being at the top). I lost sight of it after looking away the second time to try and point it out to my family. The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds. The craft(?) was not in a hurry really but seemed to be just crusing around. I don&#39;t know how it disappeared (fast or vanished) for I lost sight of it after looking away for just a second. I am a Baptist Pastor and do not believe in little alien dudes with buggy eyes and green heads...However I do know that what I saw was not anything I have ever saw or heard of in my 42 years on this planet. I am amazed at my close encounter!!!<n>

I was 17 at the time walking home with my friend when we crossed through a park between 2 streets, We noticed things suddenly light up slightly and the clouds were glowing orange, almost directly above us was a huge circle above the overcast cloudy sky. It sat there hovering for about a minute (possibly more because i was literally freaking out when i seen it) then in less than one second it darted straight infront of us and hovered on the horison for about 30 seconds, darted to the right and hovered for around 5 seconds then shot straight ahead again and disapeared. Once it disapeared my friend said &#34;thats going to be covered up&#34; and i was in a massive panic, my friend tried to calm me down and we continued to walk home shortly afterwards. I got inside and told my mum and she laughed, I literally started crying because I had no idea what I had just seen, my sister sat down with me and i explained everything to her before going to bed about 2 hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

GILROY IS SITUATED IN A SMALL VALLEY WITH THE MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST RAISING TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 3000&#39; AND THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST RAISING TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1200 FEET. THOUGH THE OBJECT SEEMED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME ALTITUDE, I KNOW IT WAS NOT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1200&#39; OR GREATER WHEN IT FIRST CAME INTO VEIW, THEREFOR THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE ASCENDING SLIGHTLY TO CLEAR THE 1200 FOOT MOUNTAINS 8 MILES TO THE WEST OF MY LOCATION THAT IS 223&#39; FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE LIGHTS WERE SPACED ABOUT 15 FEET APART FROM EACH OTHER AND HELD A FIXED FORMATION WHILE HAVING NO VISIBLE STRUCTURE BETWEEN THEM. I AM NOT SHURE WEATHER OR NOT THE OBJECT WAS TRANSPARENT OR WAS ABLE TO MIMMIC ITS BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO BLEND IN BUT, IT WAS NOT DARKER THAN THE CLEAR DARK SKY WITH A SLIGHT GLOW IN THE LOWER ALTITUDES FROM CITY LIGHTS. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE THREE LIGHTS WERE NOT CONNECTED AT ALL. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO REFLECT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHEN IT WAS ABOVE THE MAIN PART OF THE CITY AS THE THREE LIGHTS BECAME MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER AS THEY REACHED THE DARKER EDGES OF THE CITY BUT, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OBJECT AND MYSELF AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO HAVE A SOFT WARM OFF WHITE FUZZY GLOW TO IT I WOULD COMPARE THE BRIGHTNESS AND LOOK OF THE LIGHTS TO THREE BARN OWLS FLYING THROUGH THE DARK SKY. THE PERSON I WAS WITH THAT WITNESSED WHAT I SAW CLAIMS THAT WHEN I TURNED AND RAN TO GO GET MY VIDEO CAMERA  LOCATED IN MY HOUSE THE OBJECT CHANGED FROM A STEADY LIGHT TO A PULSING JUMPING LIGHT AS IT SLIGHTLY ACCELERATED. THE WHITNESS SAID THAT IT DID NOT MOVE IN A STEADY CONTINUOUS MOTION BUT IN A LEAPING JUMPING WAY LIKE IF YOU WERE SKIPPING FRAMES. WITNESS SAID THAT THE SWOOSH! ING, RUS HING AIR SOUND THE OBJECT MADE WAS ALSO INTERUPTED AS IT MADE THESE LEAPS. I DO NOT RECALL ANY SOUND EXCEPT FOR THE AIR RUSHING PAST MY EARS AS I MOVED AT SPEED THAT PUSHED THE SOULS OF MY SHOES TO THEIR BREAKING POINT. I REGRET MAKING THE DECISION TO GO GET MY CAMERA. I SACRIFICED OBSERVING THIS OBJECT MAKE THESE JUMPS AND SOUNDS FOR A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW COUNTLESS OTHERS THIS EVENT. I TRULY FEEL THAT THIS OBJECT SAW ME RUN AND DECIDED TO DO THE SAME. I GUARANTEE THAT EVERY TIME I STEP OUTSIDE IM GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT CRAZY TRIANGLES FLYN OVERHEAD.  DAMNIT!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We would very much like to speak with him/her, as well as with the other witness to the event.  We also would welcome a written report from the second witness, since different witnesses to the same event remember different aspects of it.  PD))<n>

It was really dark out and my friend looked up into the southeast sky and told me to look up and pointed. I looked up and saw a triangular shaped craft with 3 soft golden-orange colored lights, one on each point of the triangle. The craft was approximately 1800 feet in altitude and flying in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The craft made a high-pitched noise and seemed to move in a skipping type of fashion. The craft flew at an extremely high rate of speed and was visible for only a short time (approximately 10 to 20 seconds). I was astonished and couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.<n>

The light vanished and reappeared in another location doing this about seven or eight times in a quick sequance to make a shape of a 270 degree circle and then did a 90 degreee turn. I thought to myself, that is impossible. We could not hear any sound of a aircraft overhead. I look at the skies all the time ,but I have never seen any thing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via the telephone with this witness, and found him to be quite sincere and credible.

We do not know what they observed.  PD))<n>
6/7/02 23:15|Portsmouth|NH|Triangle|aprox 1 hour|Video taped sighting  over the ocean in Pourtsmouth New Hampshire|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23228.html|261|ndxe200206| Video taped sighting  over the ocean in Pourtsmouth New Hampshire<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I where staying in a motel in Portsmouth NH and at 10:30pm we decided to take a ride to the coast and do some sky wathcing. After about 45 minutes of watching airplanes and stars, it was a very clear night, we noticed a light in the sky above and to the south of a car that was at the other end of the parking area. It was very low in the horizon and apeared odd because it was yellowish in color and had no strobe lights. We watched it for about five minutes and it just remained motionless. I got out my video camera and tried to get it to focus on the object and it began registering. After a minute or two of trying to get it to focus the car at the other end of the parking lots lights came on and I video taped a very good point of view of what looked like and at what altitude it was. After about a minute the cars lights went off and the camera couldn&#39;t focus on the image so I walked down to the car. The gentelman that owned the car came walking down from the coastal wall and I asked him if he knew what that was thinking that perhaps they to where also star wathching. He did not know what it was and when I told him I had been watching it for over ten minutes he said that seemed very odd and began whathing the object with me. I once agin tried to get the object to focus in my video camera and succeeded in zooming to around 45x and taping the object for over five minutes. In this time it became very bright, changing colors from a yellowish white to red and shades of green and at one point seems to apear as two lights. It then faded so low that I could no longer tape it so I began looking for it. It now was blinking with small soft white and red lights and almost looked like an airplane. The gentelman that was watching it with me had gone to take pictures and came running back and asked if I noticed that it was now blinking and moving. He also said &#34; what a good way to desguise your self&#34;. the object then slowly moved towards the shore slowly and then stoped moving and blinking and got very ! bright a gain. I again tried to zoom in on it and got the camera to focus and then hit record. As I whatced it through my viewfinder I now saw two lights and it seemed to be moving away from me, south, now. I then noticed a third light and the object now took the shape of a triangle and seemed to be banking. It then faded out agin. I looked at it and it began blinking again and had changed it&#39;s direction and was now traveling north and slowly kept droping, like it was making a stair patern, untill it got so low you could no longer see it. I went back to my car and watched the tape. When I came to the point that I had recorded all three lights on the object something must have malfuntioned on my camera and nothing had recorded from that point. I was pretty bumend out because this was the best part of the video and as we sat wondering what went wrong the object appeard again in the same spot it origonally started at, altough it was now lower int the horizon. I began taping as it slowly moved away from us twoards the south and the ocean. I have video of it once again just hovering in the horizon. It got very dim and then slowly moved strait down twoards the horizon and disapeard. After about thirty seconds it lit up again, still on the horizon, and then began to rise. It once agin hoverd. Then a second and third object apeard. They all hoverd for a moment and twinkled brightly changing color from yellowish-white to red and then all slowly lowered down and disapeared when they hit the horizon again. After trying to get my camera to focus on the light show for a few minutes with little sucess other then a few frames that show the lights hovering in the horizon we decided to drive down the coast to see if we could get a better look. we traveled a couple miles down the coast and could no longer see the objects so we turned around and traveled back. We came to another parking area and pulled in and there was now one single light hovering in the same spot. It once agin droped to the horizon and disapeared and then reapear! ed and r ose once agin untill finally dispearing at around 12:30. We waited a few minutes and finially went back to the room. I will submit portions of the video along with stills to this sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness over the telephone, and he identified himself as a UFO investigator and an &#34;experiencer,&#34; as well as an author in those fields.  NUFORC explored the possibility that he might have been witnessing celestial bodies, possibly &#34;twinkling&#34; stars, but he assured us that that was not the case.  He offered to send us a video tape copy, but it has not yet arrived for our review as of this date.  We will add a note here after we have had a chance to review the tape footage.  PD))<n>

One night I decided to pull over for a break when i spotted one of these unusal lights, thats when i noticed the movement of them. To give an idea of where they are in the sky i&#39;d say between 45 and 60 degrees up, and the lights will sway left right a few times and up and go real low. My first thought after watching this the first night was a helicopter and i pushed it to the back of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night i saw again this light, again noticing it because of the off color it was and when i stopped to watched it did the normal up down and side to side then in shot off stright up and was gone into the night sky. Of course after this it had my full attention and I brought it to the attention of my running partner after this. It was the following night and again I saw the light and stopped this night having feild glasses with me. I looked and couldn&#39;t get a good focus nor could he but, we both could see the strobing lights of blues yellow a purple ect. Neither of us had the time to stay and watch but both could see the bouncing around of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has to date still continued and not every night maybe one a week if not twice i at one point or another will notice this light. One night i stopped along one of the back roads i take and watched this light bounce up and down like a ekg read out, that night flipped me out i then knew for a fact that i was watching something i couldn&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were positioned at roughly mile marker 140. I looked at where she was pointing and witnessed what appeared to be a series of very fast strobing white lights. These lights repeated so fast that they appeared to be &#34;sparkling&#34;. I tried to count the number of lights and made and estimate of 7 or 8. It was rather hard to determine a shape due to our motion and the motion of the object. However the lights did appear to be strobing in a linear fashion. We maintained eye contact with these lights for about 1 minute and then the &#34;object&#34; disappeared. My wife scanned the Westerly sky for another 1-2 minutes and reaquired the &#34;object&#34; a few degrees North of its original position. The &#34;object&#34; was now sitting closer to the horizon and my wife noticed that the strobing lights now looked to contain red&#39;s and blue&#39;s in addition to white. The object cut in and out a couple of times with one disappearance resulting in what my wife indicated to be a blue beam shooting from underneath the &#34;object&#34;. We returned home and noticed that the &#34;object&#34; had circled a wide area ourside the West side of Decatur.<n>
6/7/02 22:30|Bloomingdale|NJ|Triangle|5:00|Redish-Orange light, zigzag movement, no sound.. VERY STRANGE|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23195.html|264|ndxe200206| Redish-Orange light, zigzag movement, no sound.. VERY STRANGE<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my girlfriend, we were walking across the street - it was one of the first days of the warmer weather in the summer so while enjoying the night I looked up at the sky before getting into my car.  I noticed I strange redish-orange light blinking in the sky.  I poked at my girlfriend at pointed at what I was seeing in the sky and she freaked out when I said it could be a UFO.  We turned our heads and browsed the rest of the sky noticing there were two other identical lights flashing in the sky.  They all had the same characteristics - they would move suddenly, then flash the redish-orange color.  No other colors were witnessed.  The two seemed to pair up, and then move in a strange manner across the sky - one that I believe convential aircraft could not make.  I can almost best describe it as a zigzag motion.  The third object continued on it&#39;s past in the opposite direction until it too was out of site.  No sound was ever hear from any of these lights.  The first two seemed to be relatively far away, but the third object did not appear to be a great distance from where we were standing.  Strangely, neither one of us heard anything from that object either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most intersting part of this experience was yet to come.  We drove down the road briefly to go and get some ice cream from the grocery store down the road.  We we came back to my home, we drove down to the end of the road where it is a dead end and you can turn your car around.  On the way back up the road towards my house we were looking in the sky to see if we say anything.  Within just a minute my girlfriend pointed her hand up at the sky and so I pulled the car over.  We both saw what could be best decribed as an object of some sort, what now more clearly appeared to be a red flashing light, with a steady white light.  My girlfriend is insists that the object was triangular shaped with the white light on the top, red light on the bottom.  We drove, pulled over, and watched the object until it was out of sight.  Interestly enough a couple other red lights, with white flashing lights came into site by the end of this - there was an obvious distinction between the two sets of lights.  Small planes are easy to pick out in the night sky, the patterns of red, and flashing white lights on the wings is normal for this area.. but I must say whatever I saw tonight did not appear to be of the norm, althought I cannot be for sure.  All I am now left to do is wonder..<n>

As I was staring I saw two &#34;stars&#34; Rapidly approach each other ...sort of pause... face to face...for maybe ten seconds ? and then they split in opposite directions ..not too fast...I watched it for 30 seconds maybe less....and then they just vanish off. Maybe it was some sort of space station thing? I dont know Im not much into this sort of thing. I found this web sight and thought id put in my 2 cents. I just found this odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it helps..I was lying on my back facing East.No real details...they were way up there.<n>

It seemed to hover across at variable speeds. Next I noticed the lights, all white, one red. By this time I had passed it, and it was across the highway.

It was very bright and I just stood there in shock.  I have never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Simcoe, ON, Canada just north of Lake Erie.  The ribbon of light seemed to be moving from east to west at about 30 degrees above the horizon (I&#39;m guessing).  Just shortly after this I saw a plane move slowly from north to south, also in the western sky.  The lights of the plane appeared very tiny compared to the size of the ribbon of light I saw.  I see many planes fly through this area at night when it is clear and that plane must have seen it too as it would be in front of and off to the side of the flight path, I think.<n>

We were packing up sound equipment at the stage after the mentalist and the majority of the crowd was gone. While looking to the south, several of us saw a round green light coming over the horizon, heading north toward Vegas. It did not blink or turn, it made no sound, and it took about 90 seconds to travel about 20 miles or so, followed by another round green light going the same direction and just as quickly. Air traffic that night was approaching Vegas from the east and departing to the west. Although many of the planes would head west out over the mountains and then turn 180 degrees to continue east, there was no north/south air traffic at the time of the sightings. A film crew for the local NBC affiliate filmed the lights and telacast the images live during their evening news report. I&#39;m surprised no more has been discussed about the sightings, I guess everyone associates them with the evening&#39;s earlier hoax, but I saw what I saw, so did a bunch of other people including camera crews from 3 different TV stations.<n>

On June 6th, 2002. We were really a good time around the Luxor Pyramid, delighted to go outside and walked around the street of pyramid in about 10:30 PM. We felt warmth and dry night better than hotter in daytime. We&#39;re holding together and walked as looking around the light from the top of Pyramid which were so powerful search light that beam upward very high in the sky as it was very impressive to look at the light beam. As we walked toward the Luxor suddenly she patted on my shoulder to look up the light beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we saw four UFO oval shaped (absolutely there were no birds around) danced into the light beam. They’re so luminous brighter and were so quietier and no sounds than airplane or helicoper. That&#39;s her first UFO sighting and I&#39;ve seen UFO several times before. Yes, they’re from another world not like as ours. We smiled and standing each other to keep observe for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Those UFOs were swinging &amp; dancing around into the light beam. One was zoom off from the beam of light at the incredible speed than the bird&#39;s speed and then came back into the light beam was incredible speed as they appear &amp; disappear of their curiously surrounding the sky. Other UFO ships acted like played up and down and swayed. I told my new wife that wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, satellite, balloon or other things what we have them on this earth. I knew those E.T. are from another home world. I am still believed everything the life from outer space. Why did our U.S. Government cover-up?? Damn it. I am interesting to fill out this report form of UFO sighting is for authorized friends to be the first whom that I trust. But that is no way to be trust with the officers of U.S. Government’s military. I am allowed to cover-up against them as fair what have they done. She said that is right. I was going to make report to have the information paper from Roswell UFO museum and making some copies for our authorized friend. We were standing to watch those UFO almost longer as a lifetime. I saw one lady walked down pass by us before she enter the Luxor hotel as she turn to look up those UFOs there but her eyes blinks flashed and nearly rush to the door of the Luxor hotel. I giggled myself quietly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next morning, we woke up from our bed to dress up. Set the tv on and checked the tv news, finally the news got report about the UFO at the same night time exactly many people saw. More people called to make reports on the news. How lucky we are and a lifetime memories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe me there&#39;s no birds playing around on this night of June 6th, 2002. We knew what birds acted like. Absolutely, we saw the UFOs at this very night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE:  Event Date:  06/06/2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report of apparently the same event.  We have looked at the graphics, provided by the witness, and our suspicion is that the two witnesses probably were looking at insectivore birds, perhaps nighthawks, pursuing insects, drawn to the bright lights.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

My son and I were on the passenger side, ( front and back)and I had just commented to him how pretty the stars were this far from the city. We noticed there were a lot of planes in the sky and how they were flying so close together. Then 2 huge lights appeared. They were about 3 inches apart from each other and bright white. They were bigger than any of the stars and right in the middle of all the planes. Suddenly the light on the left became very bright and as big as a baseball, just as it started to fade the light on the right did the same thing. They did this back and forth about 3 times, then they both lit up and disappeared. We made my husband pull over and sat there looking at the sky for about 15 minutes before he lost patients and wanted to leave. If it were up to me and my son we would have sat there all night. It was truley amazing and something we will never forget!<n>

There were two lights that seemed to stay on the same place for almost five minutes,the one on top was brighter with an orange color to it and the bottom one was white.She said it was the intense brightness of the top light that made it strange.After what she thought was an eternity, the top bright orange light came together with the bottom light.At that moment my wife stopped looking to knock on the window and get my attention.The neighbor said something came out from the bottom of one of the lights.When I got outside the lights were in a horizontal position slowly moving west.A tree blocked my view after awhile so I ran to find a better view but the lights were gone.<n>

I know the difference between what I&#39;m seeing out here, and a shooting star or meteor.  These lights are clearly objects that are very far away and moving more slowly then shooting stars and they are barely perceptable, where a shooting star is very bright.  the objects move quickly though for the distance that they appear up in space.An aircraft that is only a few miles up from earth travels fast across the sky but airplanes that are higher up would not move as fast as the unidentified objects I have observed.  There is a military base in Pensacola of course but airplanes have flashing lights and this light does not blink.

It was yellowish in color and looked to be quite large. It seemed to be spinning and changing form while travelling from left to right without pattern. At times it was obscured by Bush&#39;s head, only to return a few seconds later. It definitely did not look like an airplane. I urge anyone who has access to a video of this speech to take a look and decide for yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received several reports about the unidentified lights seen during the President&#39;s speech.

He gets up every night between 4:30 to 5:30 and goes on the computer in the kitchen. I told him to come back to bed it was about 05:10 AM. After calling him numerous times he finally came to bed in our bedroom which is in the rear of the house. As he laid down a bright flash of light came in the window. It was a bright light on the side of the house strobing then went out. We both looked out the window and did not see anything. We have a privacy fence that you cannot see through as well as a wall that is the side of the neighbor&#39;s house, we live in zero lot line houses, and our yard which is fenced in so no light from the streets can get in. I stayed awake for about 1/2 hour and watched out my window for anything strange. About 6:00 it flashed again. The light was not in the rear only on the side. We went outside to look and found nothing. We went in the front of the house and looked in the sky and saw nothing. I would like to note that about 2 weeks before in the evening about 4:00 am I saw small lights in the yard around the pool and palm trees. We have about 150 palm trees surrounding the pool. The foilage is dense around the fence and pool.I seen 2 lights about the size of a small flashlight in the trees about 3 feet from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another was in the top of the palm on the opposite side of the yard. I woke up my husband and said look at these lights in the yard. They flashed like they were flying like large bugs across the rear yard. The bugs would have to be about a foot long to produce a light of that size so I assumed it was not bugs. We watched them and one flew over by the window that we were looking out of and went straight up in the sky over the house. The other two were still in the bushes . He decided to go outside on the screen patio, our pool is not screened in, to see up close. He was 3 feet from the bushes outside the screen patio and wanted to go out. I advised him not to because maybe something would zap him up if he approched it. He called to the lights and they went around the back of the bushes and both went up into the air. We told a couple of people but not many because most peoople do nto believe you when you hear strange stories.  That is why when we seen the flashing light we said I guess it is the aliens again. We have not idea what this is but it sure likes our yard!!I scares us both.<n>

I am retired, after working 33 years as an electronics engineer for a popular aerospace company, and have taken part in designing some of the modern warplanes you see today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back on June 6, 2002, I was camping at a place called Tuttle Creek, near the town of Lone Pine, which is near Mount Whitney (the tallest mountain in the continental United States). I know it was the 6th of June, because that was my 68th birthday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with another retiree, a buddy of mine, ((name deleted)).  After a long day of fishing and BSing, we cooked and ate dinner, watched a VHS movie in my RV, then went to sleep. It was about 1 AM, and I woke up because, well, my buddy’s snoring was just too loud for me to sleep through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and sat on the picnic table to have myself a cigar. After about a minute or so, I started to have this stange feeling, like the little voice inside me was talking.  It was then that a light or reflection above me caught my eye. I looked up and, low and behold, there was this triangle craft moving above me, I would guess, about 5-10 mph. It was about 1000 feet up, and and it didn&#39;t make any sound.  It was about 50-60 feet long by 30-40 feet wide, and had a reddish-orange light on each point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear and you can see all the stars, except for the ones that this craft blocked out. I pounded on the RV to wake up ((name deleted)). He came out cussing at me, and I all I had to do was point upward to shut him up.  He was just as shocked as I was.  We watched this craft for almost 5 minutes, and then suddenly the craft started to move faster, and within a few seconds it was out of our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood up the rest of the night exchanging opinions about what we thought the craft was.  We came to the conclusion that it was either a new experimental secret government aircraft (we both worked on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, so we knew that it could have been a new secret aircraft), mass hallucination (that was ((name deleted))  2 cents), or an extraterrestrial craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not 100 percent sure what it was, but it was one hell of a birthday present.<n>

It was still drizzleing and lightning occationally from the round of Brutal thunderstorms we had experience earlier in the day, this included an unconfirmed tornado. The road I was on loops around and comes out on the same road but at a different point. I was heading I would have to guess west. Thats when I saw this grouping of three lights, each light was at the tip of this Triangle thing, The clouds behind it had enought light so I could make out a black triangle shape, the way it maneuveured remindend me of an airplane. But the thing was, it was really low and moving too slow to be able to stay up in the air if an airplane. My car window was slightly cracked and I could hear no sounds except for my car. The object was pretty low and it was inverted and on it&#39;s side. So that I could see all the lights on what I presumed to be the underside. I would have to estimate it&#39;s Heighth to be about 200&#39; above the ground, and I was looking at it from a shallow angle. I live in Luthers Forest too, we have a government run research site/ installation in Luthers Forest, I wonder if that has anything to do with this, because it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve seen a U.F.O near my home.

It did this three times, in perfect rythym before disappearing over the horizon. It was bright enough to be one of the jets that circles over from the Air National Guard in Martinsburg, however those jets don&#39;t go as fast as this object was going and it made absolutely no sound.

Normally I slow to get a larger view of the clouds, hills, trees, buildings and roads, and except for the variation of clouds all is usual. But on this particular evening I spotted a small dark object that seemed to be floating above the the city about 1.5 miles away. I had seen this object or one like it, near where I worked in Rio Rancho, NM two years earlier. It appeared to be the same dark sphere maybe 10-20 ft in diameter, and floating around 200 ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had the same characteristics as before of slowly drifting left, right, up and down, but on a horizontal and vertical plane, and not in an arc which would suggest it was tied to string or rope.

We would delightful to go outside and walk around the street out of pyramid  was about 10:30 PM would be nice night better than on daytime from the excessive hot day. We holding together our walk to looking around the light from the top of pyramid where there is so powerful search light that beam upward very high in the sky, it a ways up high, very impressive to look the light beam. Then we walks back and so she pat my shoulder to look up the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, we saw three UFOs dances into the light beam, that looks like as housefly dance at any theirs house. They’re so luminous brighter and it is oval shape. she ask me what do I think of those, maybe we know what are those. Yes, that they’re from another world not like as ours. We’re smile and stand stay to keep  observe for about 20 minutes.  Those UFOs were swing &amp; dancing around into the light beam, one was zoom taken off from the beam of light as its incredible speed, and then coming back into the light beam was incredible speed too that they looks like appear &amp; disappear as like as theirs poof in speed. They&#39;re acts like as crazy speeds that they’re back &amp; forth.  I told my new wife  that wasn’t airplane, helicopter, satellite, balloon or other things what we have them in this earth, but it wasn’t our or their at anything on this earth. I know those E.T. were from another home world.  I still believe everything the life in outer space, why did our U.S. Government cover-up, damn it.  I am interesting to fill out the report form of UFO sighting is for authorized friends to be the first who that I trust. But that is no way to be trust in officers of U.S. Government’s military. I am allowed to cover-up against them as fair what have they done. She said that is right and I was going to make report to have the information paper from Roswell UFO museum and making some copies for our authorized friend.  We were standing to watch those UFO almost longer and I saw one lady walked down pass by us before going to Luxor hotel, she turn to look up those UFOs there but her eyes blinks flashed and nearly rush at door into Luxor hotel. I got giggle myself in quietly. Next morning, we woke up from our bed and to dress up.  Set tv on and get me to see the tv news, final the news got report about the UFO at the same night time what many peoples saw. More people called to make reports on the news.  How lucky are we and happy as she saw the first time, but I have seen that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Written by<n>

I continued home and as I exited highway 880S at Tennyson I drove under the overpass onto a loop to get onto Tennyson East I saw the same light formation in the distance towards the Bay.  Neither noise nor motion.  The lights were bright but didn&#39;t seem to illuminate with a beam forward from the light.  I called the Hayward Airport which would have been near where the lights were and they said they didn&#39;t see anything.  I also called the newspaper to find out if anyone else had reported seeing the lights and was told no.  I even left a message with the air traffic control office, but never! heard back from them.  I researched where I could report this, but wasn&#39;t able to find a reputable agency.  I forgot about what I had seen until I just watched a UFO show on TV.  I honestly do not remember the date at all.  The time was about right because I wanted to stop and look at the lights, but I had work the next day and needed to get home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The street goes east-westwardly. I was standing facing the north. The bus was coming from the east end of the street, so I was looking towards that direction initially. then out of no particular reason I turn around and looked up and this strange looking object floating there: it was a longish object like a cigar of a tube, white in color, with red lights glowing around it by which I mean I can see clearly where the red lights ends. At this moment a passenger plane was climbing from my backward uper left hand and flew past that object. and I thought at that moment the people in the plane must also have seen the strange object. Meanwhile I made some comparisons between these two: I could see clearly the wings, tail, the marks and even the potholes on the plane; and i knew it was climbing because it was flying at an upward angle and there was airport nearby. But with the object, I couldn&#39;t see much of it except that it was about the same size with the plane because they were at about the same attitute from my position and it had no wings, no tails and no specific characteristics to tell me that this was something I have seen before. I didn&#39;t take it very seriously at first. I thought that if it was ufo or something, the people in the passenger plane must have seen it and perhaps many other people have seen it too, cause that day was a briliant cloudless day and besides that the people working in the nearby airport with radar and everything must have seen it too. So I thought there would be some reports on next day&#39;s newspaper, and I didn&#39;t find any next two days. So on 7th, I called New South Wales UFO Investigation Centre(POBox W42, West Pennant Hills, NSW2125; phone 02-94844680). One man received my call and said would try to find out what it was and got back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We hope that the New South Wales UFO Investigation Center will follow up on the report, and share any significant findings.

This comes during a period of high frequency of visible satellites, at least that is what I&#39;m assuming they were. Some of the &#34;satellites&#34; increase in brightness until they rival Venus or Jupiter, then decrease in brightness until they can no longer be seen. In the past few weeks I&#39;ve seen two very bright, colorful, slow moving meteors- or maybe something else. I have also seen two odd shaped (one triangle, one diamond) aircraft near my house. There have also been lots of helicopters lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports submitted by this student.  Please see other report for 16MR02 from Old Hickory.  PD))<n>

As I looked at the lights they were white in color but then I noticed blue colored lights that formed a ring around the center white light.  It sort of looked like a floating planet Saturn that was hovering to the west of Russellville.  I got home and showed my step son as well and we watched the light in our front yard for about 45 minutes.  Towards the end of that time the light began to bounce erratically in the sky.

The weather changed today from unseasonably hot to cool, so as the front moved in and storm clouds appeared, it became windy.  I noticed a black, circular shape in the sky that remained stationary for 20 or more seconds, so it caught my eye.  My first impression was that the object might be a rather large balloon within a half mile of my position, but oddly it remained stationary in the wind.  I put my caller on hold and looked more closely.  After remaining stationary for about 30 seconds, it began to move slighly, in almost a fluttering way or jagged way, suddenly dipping to the left and downward, and changing shape from circular to more flat.  Then it went up again and a little to the right, again becoming more circular, but also changing shape so that it was periodically circular and then more ovoid.  It headed back to the left and would remain somewhat stationary and then dip further down.  At this point, as it got lower, I could see that there was a lighter colour on top, almost like the reflection of a dome (there was very little sunlight &#34;behind&#34; my position, peeking through stormy clouds).  With that extra shading, the object looked more saucer-shaped.  There is a shopping mall next to my office and as I watched the object, it dipped down until it disappeared just on the other side of the mall.  If that were the case, the object must have been within a half-mile to a mile of me, and smaller than a helicopter, but much larger than a bird.  It definitely appeared to be under intelligent control under windy conditions, and the changing shape was also quite dramatic.<n>

I don&#39;t know the exact time becasue I stayed outside for a while after I saw it to see if it would come back again. When I&#39;m reading a book I take a break after each chapter to have a cigarette and to think about what I have just read. After completing the 1st chapter of the book &#34;The Stranger&#34; I stopped and had my break. While I was smoking my cigarette I was gazing into the sky as it was one of the clearest nights I have seen recently and saw something that I could not explain! I saw what was either a triangular shapped craft or three crafts flying in a triangular formation. I don&#39;t know whether it was just one or multiples because I was unable to make out any part of the structure only three red lights. I am not an aviation expert at all but I am fairly certain that it was not a airplain as the object(s) was alot closer than planes usually fly and it was one of the fastest moving objects I have ever seen in my life. I am extremly skeptical about these types of things and would appreciate if someone would be able to clear this up for me. I have been searching the net since I saw the object(s) and the closest picture I could find was this one http://www.totalufo.net/ufos/pics/belgufo.htm but there was no middle light and I was unable to make out and defined shape like the one in this picture which is why it could have been three seperate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Extra Information: It didn&#39;t occur to me until later but there was a problem with the TV changing inputs and turning on and of after I had come inside. Think this might be nothing but it had never happend bofore.<n>

At first sight I thought they were stars, but because it was 4:30 in the afternoon and they were moving across the sky, they couldn&#39;t be stars.  As I informed the other witness to come look at what I was seeing and pointing out the one object that remained in view, (I lost the other behind trees) a third object, much lower came streaking by. This was a blue ball of light with a halo around it and didn&#39;t make any sound. The objects didn&#39;t waiver, they just traveled straight, heading east, out to sea.  A couple of minutes later, a fourth object flew by, this one was the same as the third, but it was a yellow color with a halo and traveled the same low path as the third object.  The most important part of the whole experience is that for the next 45 minutes, I counted 7 high altitude jets (possibly military aircraft) travelling in the same direction as the 4 objects.<n>

I was siting with the sun just barely occluded by the beam at the edge of the roof. I was looking at the water vapor rising up into the atmosphere ovewr the park. It was a clear sunny day aside from a lot of glare and haze. I had some fairly dark shades on (sunglasses) as did Charles. I was looking at the spot where the suns corona was flaring out from behind the beam and saw a white spot fly at a very rapid speed from south to north in a straight line it appeared to be at a higher elevation than all the jetliners in view and moved many times faster in apparent speed. I was sort of stunned but wasnt sure if i really saw what i saw, then a moment later another object on a similar trajectory moved from the apparent position of the sun across the sky from south to north. At this point my friend asked what was going on and i told him to sit in the same position with the sun occluded and tell me what if anything he sees. sure enough over the next few minutes we saw another four objects like the first two one of which was on a curved trajectory angling from south to a north west direction. The apparent size visually was the size of a BB held at arms length with a well defined shape the color appeared white. i want to point out that if we took off out shades the glare in the sky was such that it would have been impossible to see anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify the time of day of the sighting.

What was so weird about these 2 objects was that as they approached this cloud, instead of going through the cloud they took a 45 degree turn, both side by side.  Then I saw one of the Unidentified things through the middle of the cloud for a second.(This would be the side of it.  It just stayed there for a second, then slowly went behind the cloud again.(Slow motion).  It came out of the other side of the cloud and once again they were side by side, in perfect order.  At one time I thought that they could be a set of planes flying perfectly together like the blue angels, because they flew close together, same height and same distance apart from each other and when they got near the cloud they both turned and I mean turned exactly to the right at such a sharp angle at the same time.  I  had to keep looking because I couldn&#39;t believe what I had just seen.  Even when I first saw these 2 white objects, their were alot of birds flying in front of them that I thought they were also birds. Then I noticed that the front of these things were really birds.  The birds started flying up and down, and you could see their wings go up and down, but the 2 behind the 15 or so birds never went up or down just straight towards this little cloud.(Or so the cloud looked to me from where I was at).  I kept trying to show my husband what I was seeing and he also saw these objects and the birds but he was driving the boat and since we were in the intracoastal canal he had to pay close attention to his driving.  I don&#39;t think he really knows what he or I saw except they were white and moving away from us.  After they came out the other side of the cloud they just continued going away from us until they were out of sight.  There was no sound and no smoke like jets or very fast planes would leave.  I did notice that when I saw them in the middle of the cloud, kind of peaking through the cloud, he seemed to have stopped for the moment.  I think all this took approximately 10 minutes or so and then they were gone. I remember seeing these 2 white disc like things so well, for I always wear polarized sunglasses when I go fishing or wade fishing and the sun was behind me, not to the right of me, and therefore was not in my eyes.  Who knows, but I do know that if I wasn&#39;t planes then what was it, too perfect flying order, just a little strange for me, especially the way they turned, the way they seemed to just stay in that spot for a little while, then just go one about there way.  Then Gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify the time of day of the sighting.  We will attempt to obtain that information.

Our room was on the 2nd floor and had a balcony.  My wife couldn&#39;t sleep and went out on the balcony at approximately 4AM.  She woke me up saying she was observing a UFO.  I went out and observed the object.  Circular, stationary in the sky, estimated altitude 1000 - 2000 feet, approximately 5 miles away.  There were alternating red and green blinking lights coming from the object.  There was no sound.  Every couple of minutes it appeared to emit a ring of white vapor.  My wife also woke my daughter,  The three of us watched the object until it could no longer be seen in the morning light.  The next morning I realized that from where I had seen the object, it would have been near a nuclear power plant located near Glen Rose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description provided, we believe that a twinkling star is the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

The duration was about five seconds and no sound was made.  The lights simply appeared then disappeared.  As a research scientist in the United States, I only make conclusions based on a sufficient amount of evidence, so I can make no definitive conclusion for what we saw.  However, due to the fact that all three of us witnessed the event, I am confident it was real.  We were also in a very isolated part of the country, where there were no cars and only a couple of small plane flights came to the area during the daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Just after leaving a development area near Banks, the man noticed two unusual lights straight ahead just left of the road and hanging low to the ground. The brightness of one of them really stuck out. As the highway curved slightly to the right the lights stayed to the left side of the road the whole time. After driving for over ten minutes having these two lights within sight, the witness reports feeling as if the objects may have been as much as a mile apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness writes...&#34; The light I could see looked huge for the distance I saw it from. The white light was facing me and appeared to be heading in the same direction I was driving. It did not blink. I didn&#39;t think it was a plane. After passing the Texaco on my left, I got to the Hwy. 47 turnoff to Vernonia, pulled onto the Hwy. 26/47 intersection and out of the car. I could still see these lights right next to a street light in front of me. The brighter light was brighter than the street lamp. To get an idea on the distance between these two lights, I put my arm all the way out and they were two fingers wide. I then got out my binoculars for a closer look and was amazed to see the brighter light was red toward the top. It also looked flat on it&#39;s right side, and was pointed on the left side. It looked like it was divided between a top middle and bottom section. I couldn&#39;t tell if the brighter light was connected at all to the one two fingers away to the left of it. I couldn&#39;t see the same details with the light on the left as I did with the brighter light on the right. I took several pictures with an HP215 Digital Camera (it has 1.3mega pixel resolution).&#34; This witness has agreed to share what pictures he has and we will post them with this sighting when we get them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler and Skip Schultz, of Oregon UFO Research, for following up on the case, and sharing the information with NUFORC.

In the northwestern sky, I would guess about 60-75 degrees above the horizon, I saw a deep red blur up in the sky through my kitchen window, probably about the size of a thumb when held at arms length.  Curious, I kept my eye on it for several moments to watch its slow southern to southwestern progress.  Finally I went out the back door to get a better look.  When I did, the center of the blur grew in intensity, as if it had been a light shining through clouds but the clouds had now broken apart. At this same moment several other points began to glow brightly within the haze.  Immediately these lights and the glow surrounding them took off in the same direction that the object had been slowly drifting.  It did not take off incredibly fast, but its movement was far more rapid than any plane would seem to have from that distance, and its acceleration from the slow drift was instantaneous.  Its movement was also level with the earth the entire time I witnessed it, causing me to beleive it was not a falling celestial body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never told anyone except my friends and family, or ever reported this sort of thing. But after doing some research and listening to other witnesses, I thought this encounter definitely merited some attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was noticing the speed the plane appeared to be traveling and the direction as well as the cloud the plane was approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From overhead, about the same altitude of the cloud was a ball of fire but no trails as it traveled, just a ball of fire about 4 times the size of the plane, traveling about 5-6 times the speed of the plane.  The ball appeared to be metallic and made no sound.  This ball entered into the cloud about 1 mile ahead of the plane and did not come out the other side.  The plane entered the same cloud and passed through as if nothing happened.  I was amazed at what I had seen because I’ve never seen anything like that but what was truly the greatest part of the experience was when I looked over my left shoulder someone else had been watching the same thing and was shocked also by what they had seen.  We talked about it for a few seconds and keep in touch one in a blue moon but together we had witnessed something on our own.  We know this was not a commet or meteor, it had no trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed in the sky a fast moving aircraft flying fairly low maybe 700-1000 metres up in a NE direction about a couple of kilometres away. At first I thought it to be a Lear jet but whilst looking at it intently realised it had no wings and was the shape of an egg, gleaming white in colour and no protuberances, of any sort with it&#39;s pointed end facing the rearward direction to which it was travelling. I remarked on it to two girls who were behind me to verify what my eyes were seeing and asked &#39;does that thing have any wings?&#39; they both couldn&#39;t see any wings and then I said &#39;what the hell is it then?&#39; upon which one of them remarked &#39;it;s probably just a blimp&#39; at which they continued with their teenage girly talk thinking nothing more of this odd craft travelling at what appeared to be a supersonic speed in the sky, there was no trail or exhaust emmisions. I lived for a long time near Wigram airport in Christchurch and had seen jet fighters on maneouvres travelling through the sky at supersonic velocities, domestic passenger jets, helicopters etc. It certainly to my mind was not a blimp for it contained no undercarriage and was travelling extremely fast, at a guess around Mach 1 or slightly more? I watched it for the next minute disappear into the distance travelling in a perfectly straight line towards and beyond Blenheim&#39;s Woodbourne airport, it did seem to accelerate a little. It was a perfectly clear day and I had good reference points of the hills south of the main road. It appeared to be about the size of a Cessna aeroplane in length or perhaps a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

When out of the southern sky, I observed 5 / 6 black objects flying directly overhead and then disappearing into the northern sky.  Two of the objects were flying erratically: moving side to side.  They had no lights and there was no sound.  They were flying in a formation of some sort.  Each object had what appeared be bent wings.  I wondered if it could be birds even though I could not see any wing movement, but I’ve never recalled a time when birds flock together at night and flew in formation.  They seem to be about 500 feet up.  The sighting time length was approximately 90 seconds as I watched them fly over my head.  Sorry, no pictures.

We went into her room, I sat on her bed &amp; watched for about 10 minutes. At the back of our property is woods that are not very thick, I saw a very bright white light. It looked to be about 4 inches around and was flashing. It went to the right &amp; up past our neighbors house into the sky. We went outside and sat on the picnic table. The light appeared again flashing and moving to the right again. It always appeared to the left of us and moved to the right.It seemed to get smaller and not as bright after we went outside. Sometimes it went into the air, other times just past the trees out of sight. If anyone knows what this may be PLEASE let me know. On Sunday night my daughter saw this again, but did not wake us up, this was around 10:00p.m. Our neighbors have seen this also, but have not tried to find out what it is. If this is an animal I would like very much to know what it is. Our elementary school is on the other side of the woods.<n>
6/1/02 02:00|Athens|TX|Unknown|1-2 hours  ?|I don't feel like I am in control of my life !!!!|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23720.html|344|ndxe200206| I don&#39;t feel like I am in control of my life !!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how to go about this. So I guess I will shoot from the hip and see where this goes. I feel that I have been repeatedly abducted throughout my life. It seems to have been getting more frequent the older I get. Before these abductions take place I get an uneasy feeling and feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach. It&#39;s almost as if there is a field around me deliberately causing me to have these feelings. I go to sleep and sleep rather deeply during these times of uneasyness and wake up with the worst headache and body aches I have ever felt. The memories of these events seem to come in a few vague,foggy memories at a time. I remember a room that is probably the size of an average size living room 30&#39;x 40&#39;,it&#39;s all metallic. There is a table in the middle of the room with an instrument of some kind above it. The walls of the room are a weird kind of composition because when it is touched it is like a weird soft gel like substance. I can&#39;t remember any experimants that are done to me (THANK GOD) but I do have pains in the back of my neck and  genital areas. I also seem to have a strange shape on my right hand in the shape of a triangle that is composed of three little dots and sometimes my hand will have a pain in the area where this shape is at. I don&#39;t know if anyone will believe me but I am telling the truth. I don&#39;t know how to stop this. I feel like I am not in control of my life here. CAn someone please give me some advice on this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/02 00:30|Bridgman|MI|Triangle|only a few seconds|The objest was Triagular, turned from red to orange to white, and shot what looked like giant sparks from it.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23105.html|346|ndxe200206| The objest was Triagular, turned from red to orange to white, and shot what looked like giant sparks from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and 4 other friends were in my backyard around the fire. They were all talking about stuff while I was leaning back in my chair looking for shooting stars. Out of the corner of my eye, in the South sky, I seen a slow moving light at first I thought it was a shooting star but realized it was a little bigger and changed from red to orange to white in a matter of seconds. It looked as though it was enflamed, it shot out something that from our distance looked like a spark at the same time one of my friend shouted out obscenities in disbelief. We seen it go under a cloud as it shot sparks two more times each about a half second apart. then it abruptly slowed down and sped up to where we it suddenly disappeared. The object left a small flaming tail but was too low in my opinion to be space junk. It was an almost perfect triangle with rounded edges. it was heading between south and southeast and only lasted a few seconds. I am reporting this because I honestly cant think of anything else it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the student who submitted this report for his having taken the time to share the information.
