Flight JK-297 had taken|5/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69767.html|2|ndxe197506| Famouse historical case TAE&#39;s (former airline) Supercaravelle was the first aircraft involved in the incident. Flight JK-297 had taken off from Salzburg (Austria) with 109 passengers on board, and had made a refuelling stop in Majorca before setting course towards Las Palmas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Halfway through the flight, at about 23:00h, Pilot Francisco Javier Lerdo de Tejada and his crew noticed a set of red lights that were fast approaching the aircraft. These lights appeared to be on a collision course with the aircraft, alarming the crew. The captain requested information about the inexplicable lights, but neither the military radar of Torrejón de Ardoz (Madrid) nor the flight control center in Barcelona could provide any explanation for this phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to avoid a possible collision, the captain changed altitude. However, the lights mirrored the new course and stayed about half a kilometer away from the plane. Since the object was violating all elementary safety rules and an evasive maneuver was deemed impossible by the crew, the captain decided on going off-course and made an emergency landing in Manises&#39; airport. This was the first time in history in which a commercial flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight crew reported the lights abandoning the pursuit just before the landing took place. However, three new UFO signals were detected by the radar, each one with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. The objects were seen by several witnesses. One of the UFOs passed very close to the airport runway, and emergency lights were lit by the land crew in case the object happened to be an unregistered flight experiencing difficulties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the lack of answer to all communication attempts, a Mirage F-1 took off from the nearby airbase of Los Llanos (Albacete) to identify the phenomenon. The pilot, Spanish Air Force captain Fernando Cámara, had to increase his speed to mach 1.4 just to be able to get visual contact with what he perceived to be a truncated cone shape displaying a changing bright color, but despite his initial efforts the object quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was informed of a new radar echo, which indicated that another object might be near Sagunto (Valencia).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the pilot was close enough, the object accelerated and disappeared again. This time, though, the UFO seemed to respond and the fighter had its avionics scrambled -its electronic flight systems were jammed, a highly hostile action. At last, and after a third contact attempt, the UFO finally disappeared, heading for Africa. After an hour and a half of pursuit, and due to fuel shortage, the pilot was forced to return to the base with no results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [edit] Possible Explanations The public impact of the incident was such that on September 1980 it reached the Spanish Parliament. The High Chamber representative Enrique Múgica publicly asked for an official explanation, but a UFO sighting was dismissed and the incident was attributed to a series of freak optical illusions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The full official report, declassified by the Spanish Airforce on August 1994, states that the Supercaravelle JK-297 pilot Javier Lerdo de Tejada, the land crew in Manises&#39; airport and the Air Force Captain Fernando Cámara might had been misled by &#34;flashes emitted from a distant chemical industry complex&#34; (about 100 miles away from Manises) &#34;and some stars and planets&#34;. Although this possibility has been much argued and repeatedly rejected by all people involved it stands as the only non-UFO-related explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The on-flight difficulties experienced by the fighter were not mentioned in the public release. The electronic system failure on board the Mirage F-1 could nevertheless be explained by the fact that the U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet was stationed in the area, and was making use of a powerful electronic warfare equipment while awaiting the outcome of the Iran hostage crisis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since in the late seventies all UFO phenomenons were promptly published by mass media and readily consumed by the public, it has been argued that the flight crew might have been influenced into believing that they were experiencing a UFO sighting instead of just witnessing an optical phenomenon, and had therefore been readier to consider, and finally undertake, such an extreme maneuver as an emergency landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [edit] Bibliography Benítez, Juan José (1980).

My brother was two years younger.  We were outside of our little country church with several other kids waiting for choir practice to end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone noticed an object hovering near us in the cow pasture very close to where we were standing.  No sound.  The object was disk-shaped with a glowing red dome on top, hovering a few feet from the ground.  We were approx 50 ft (or so) away from the object.  It slowly came closer.  Everyone stopped.   Could have heard a pin drop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then shot off to the right of us toward the trees and was gone in an instant.  Again, no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While with my family at Christmas a couple of years ago, I had my brother (now retired military) tell his version to my husband.  It was the same.

My husband has been after me to tell someone about this since he has known me.  It was such a long time ago that I felt it was not prudent now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Windsor,  North Carolina, is a small county town with a lot of farmland and open spaces. There have been multiple sightings.  My older cousin saw a disc-shaped object nestled in a field surrounded by woods on her way home just around dusk one evening.  (I believe it was not long after my sighting). It lifted up and over her car, hovered in an adjacent field then took off.  This was years ago and told to me by my mother.  This was when we lived a mile down a country dirt road, and she lived just past us with her husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that I witnessed was apparently seen by adults the following week at church.  I was not there, I did not see it again.  What I saw left a lasting impression on me.  I am a true believer.  I wish I could re-live the moment and remember everything.  I have always said that I would love to be hypnotized and return to that moment and see it again as an adult.  I would love to remember every detail of my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now live just outside Raleigh, NC, with my husband and children.  I have never seen a UFO again, but always look to the sky&#39;s in hopes of seeing one.  This experience is always with me, so many years later.  Never far from my mind.  Isn&#39;t that crazy?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will ask my brother, but he is retired military and works for the government in Virginia and may not feel comfortable doing this.  The others, I have lost contact with 20+ years ago and have no idea where they are now.  Three of them were the pastor&#39;s kids, and they moved many times since then: ((three names of observers deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.

I lived in small subdivision that was surrounded by farms, I was walking home trying to get home before dark from friends house.  It was a very clear summer night.  As I got to my driveway, all of a sudden I seen this object just about 40-50 feet in the air above me. At first I was amazed, I thought helicopter, then immediately realized that there was no noise. The object had a glow to it, but there was no source of light.  It appear to be just floating, moving very slow.  For some strange reason, I was not scared. It moved across the street in a northerly direction over the neighbors house. I ran across the street, then through the woods behind the neighbors house that backed up to the pasture. Normally, I would have never ran into the woods at night.    I watched this object slowly follow the couture of the land, and just disappear over the trees at the other end of the pasture.   I am very clear on what I saw. I did not tell anyone, including my parents. I am now 46 years old, intelligent, and not crazy.  I was watching a segment on TV about some air force personnel somewhere, I could not even watch the show, when they started to describe the object.   It was &#34;identical&#34; to what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/75 20:00|Miami|FL|Sphere|20-30 mins|Corroborating Witness|8/24/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38628.html|9|ndxe197506| Corroborating Witness<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similar report posted here which helped me to narrow down the time frame i remembered. I was in Jr. High at the time of the event since i lived in Miami from 1972-1976 starting in the 5th grade so the 1975 approx date of numerous craft supports what i recall. My father was Director of ((deleted)) for the ((deleted/entertainment)) Company Headquartered in Miami Fl. He had bought a Morgan 25ft sailboat which he kept stored moored at a marinia on Key Biscayne Island (the same one President Nixon had his retreat on) We were all on my dad&#39;s boat to spend the night &amp; then to sail the next morning early due to tidal conditions i believe. That night present were myself(13), my brother(18) his best friend(18) my cousin from PA. who was attending the UofM(20) her roommate(unknown age) my mother(50) and my father(53)the boat only slept 5 internally so all the older kids were going to sleep outside on deck near the stern. I remember we were all sitting aft talking and it was dark, it&#39;s always darker when you are on the water and the miami skyline always twinkled and had an orange glow due to the city crime lights they used on the street lamps. Now we were all used to seeing the planes that buzzed the beach towing the makers and the tourist helo&#39;s that took ppl for joy rides and even the Goodyear blimp, but what we saw that night was most definetly not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall who noticed it 1st, but we all got to watching a single light that seemed to move very slowly at 1st &amp; then stop, starting from the South Miami area and moved in the direction of North Miami/Hollywood, at 1st their was only 1, then 2 then 3, soon we had a hard time keeping count, these objects would start out white &amp; then change to orange and sometimes pulsing. At times their would be 7 in one area and another 3 in another spot further to the north. These objects would almost increase their radiating light intensity and then slowly almost fade  and in some cases just disappear only to reappear in a different location either north or south of their original position. We took turns looking at them thru binoculars, they were orange with a black hexogonal line pattern on them, but seemed not to have an outer edge due to the glow. I remember getting a frightening chill down my back while looking at them. As i recall, at the peak, there were upwards of 18 of these objects at one time, most centered in the area of the Miami International airport. The event lasted along time, i&#39;d say 20-30 mins at a minimum. During our experience, our flashlights would not work nor our radio, i also remember my dad pointing out how our magnetic compass was just wildly spinning. It was weird, all we could do was sit &amp; watch and i felt so small &amp; helpless. I also recall that the next day in the Miami Herald a story about them was printed because the airport had had to be shut down because these things interfeared with the landing of planes and that they had shown up on radar at the airport, i also remember my mother telling me that 2 fighter jets had been scrambled from Homestead Airforce base to intercept these objects (which i can only assume showed up on their radar) and that when the fighter jets got close, they all disappeared(which would explaine the end of our experience).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am ((in my forties)) now &amp; a father, i served in the U.S. Navy as an Operations Specialist ((technical field)) for almost 8 years and held a Secret clearance. I spent many months at sea looking at the night sky without man made interfearence and i have never seen anything like this remotely similar. These objects moved too fast for conventional means and were not man made objects, i&#39;ll take that to my grave. I to have also looked for similar accounts of this incident on the web, but have yet so far been unable to locate such info. I hope that my corroboration of seeing this event gives the other report on this the creedence it deserves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear on my family name and as a man that the above account is turthful &amp; honest to the best of my ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was 10 years old and lived in Stadium Heights apartments when  someone had noticed a strange, blue, oval shaped craft with glowing panels of different shades of blue through the center flying in odd  patterns and then hovering around the area . This was broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon, a crowd formed and the police were called. They responded and just stood and watched  like everyone else. The ship would hover, fly quickly  towards us and then  turn and fly off in another direction just to stop and hover once more in a different position than when it started. At one point, an officer grew alarmed and ducked down behind his squad car door with his weapon drawn because the craft had turned in our direction and came closer than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had lived at the opposite end of the complex from where the crowd was gathered and walked back to our apartment to get a drink of water.  As I was returning , the ship flew over the area where I was walking and I got a close look at it.  It stunned me when it came down lower because it was so big that it looked as though it might crash into the nearest building.  It hovered a minute and then went back to the general area that we saw it in originally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 40 minutes or so it turned and flew off as quickly as it appeared. We were told by the local police that it was a new advertising machine for the bank.  Can you imagine that?  It flew, there were no wings and it had no words on it.  That was a totally impossible scenario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It just hung there, just at a little above rooftop level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only see the bottom of it, as I remember the top of it was cloud or mist covered (although it was sitting not far off the ground).  There were lots of people already pulled over to the side of the road and out of their cars, gesturing and pointing towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I absolutely begged my then husband to please stop, stop, I wanted to look at it, but he wouldn&#39;t, just kept looking straight ahead with the pedal to the metal.

THEN THE COLORED LIGHTS WENT OUT AND FROM THE BOTTOM ONE BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT WAS SHINNING LIKE A SPOT LIGHT.

The object appeared above the screen of the Theater and set there like they were maybe just checking it out. It was round and smaller at the bottom with a red light on it. The center revolved and had a number of windows in it with light coming through the windows. like standing outside a house at night and looking in but seeing nothing but the light. As the center revolved on one side was several smaller windows and on the other side was longer windows, There was no noise coming from the thing. My daughter started crying wondering if it was the end of the world.It hovered for awhile and then just took off real fast. It was gone a few minutes then reappeared, it didn&#39;t stay long the second time, it hovered a few minutes then shot off in the very same diection that it had gone the first time. I asked the people in the car next to me if they were seeing what I was and the man said he didn&#39;t have any idea what we were all seein. We left the theater right after that along with most of the other cars. I went to my sisters and called the City Police dept. they said they had  numerous reports. The next day I called the police back to see if they had anymore info on it, and they told me they had not received any repoets the night before. I cannot tell you forsure the time or the year for sure I do know it was in the summer time and between the years between 1972 and 1977. Because I know where we were living in this paticular house between those years and we were living there when we saw it.My daughter has passeed away but she remembered it quit accurately untill that time. My son is now 42 years old and he and I still have the very same memory.We don&#39;t talk about it much because people think we are nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Personally it was so clear and no mistaken it Like the and object you see in you area that your sitting in and  all the structures you see . You no that for a fact!This is the same no question about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking in a hall way  up stairs bed room from my Grandmother place.  I just look thou the window facing the mountain and saw a  disk floating  without reacting! Clean night very easy to see if anyone with bad vision would have see it.Shocked I go screaming to my dad saying i saw a UFO on the mountain !!!He said it was a military test that he heard it on the news. At that time I was so young believe him with out question and forgot it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as the years past by it bother me alot I&#39;d keep see the U.F.O. in my mind and as if it could understand it it keep coming back too me what did you see it was a U.F.O. no military job.  therefore the answer was wrong.  So i asked my bother did he see the U.F.O. and said with no hesitation yes i did. and i knew that i wasn`t nut`s   The only reason I&#39;m reporting this now is  in cast someone was abducted or saw it and has a hard time with it .I&#39;m let him know it happen and I saw it . wow we know little of this word or other world`s but it`s fascination<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was living in San Jose and had a fantastic position with an international hi-tech firm doing project management in Palo Alto.  It was a great future in store for me, and I was very excited to be a part of it.  I am living north now in McKinleyville, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I can remember in the past:  5 years old:  I was climbing on the outer railing when I fell off the second floor and right before I landed on my back on the tiles, I felt my body being set down very slowly.  Being five I thought that was really neat and ran into the kitchen to tell my Grandmother who got angry and scolded me telling my &#34;You&#39;re full of &#34;cazzata&#34; which translates to &#34;Bull S****&#34; and scolded me to my room. I never forgot that moment even for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of 24: I was away at collage and living in an old c.1894 house with four other students.  For about two months at least 2 mornings per week I had a series of waking up and being completely unable to move anything except for my eyes for approx 30 minutes.  Another thing was the &#34;weight&#34; that heavily pressed my body into the mattress, it felt like someone was on top of me. That was a disturbing times but it ceased at two months.  Not ever was I into &#39;ghosts&#39; but that made me serious about wondering if they really exist.  I searched the old house at Humboldt State University&#39;s library and found that the 1894 house was built right over the ashes of a previous building.  The wondering about a ghost faded as I was in an intensive program that needed my focus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 years ago: I woke up in my bed and looked at my watch seeing that three days had passed with no recollection of anything. I was extremely upset about it and went to my Doctor who took a blood test and everything was normal.  I did not tell him about why I was so frazzled.  In addition I had multiple dreams where I was unable to move except for turning my head.  It was a very strange room with two other tables with people laying on them and again there was a being 8-9 feet tall wearing an outfit with a hood and shielding for the face working on the body to my right.  I can recall turning my head to the left where small rectangle windows looking down at Clam Beach from I guess around 7000 feet, just a guess.  During the two years I had multiple dreams like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last week:  The last night for the third time in the past week I dreamt of being in an underground &#39;lab?&#39; or some kind of very large underground facility &#39;people&#39; of two types.  One type was 8-9 feet tall and the other was &#39;human-like&#39; who can communicate using their minds.  (I feel like I&#39;m going crazy.)  They were very calm and &#39;loving.&#39;  There are dozens of windows in the rock where the &#39;humans&#39; would live, they would open into the rock.  I would wake up and fall right back into the same dream.  I have noticed new skin-marks and two new tiny scars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live alone, my family is in So. California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s my story and you may do what you like with it, but again, PLEASE DO NOT USE MY NAME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.xxxxxW 32.xxxxxN at the time, in fact, my parents still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a book by Robert Emenegger called &#34;UFOs, Past, Present and Future,&#34; and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer&#39;s Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I&#39;m entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. I have scanned the photo and stored it online at;  http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y20/ckirmser/UFOSighting.jpg<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I lived on a cul-de-sac, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them; this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I trained my telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn’t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it’s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can’t think of any aircraft that would take 8 minutes to travel a mile, give or take.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that’s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren’t bright at all, in fact, they weren’t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn’t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky; as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that’s about it. I’ve tried to put down all I could think of and could find on that sighting survey, and I hope it helps. Feel free to contact me about it at the email address below.

By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north. Now, to be honest, I would still swear that there were three of the things, but my notes from the time only indicate a single craft; not in so many words, but Question #10 of the sighting survey asks if there was more than one phenomenon, and I had left it blank. Other parts of the form are blank as well, but simply those things that I did not have data on at the time and never had a chance to fill in, so perhaps I had missed the question or some other event caused me to not enter more than one object. At any rate, I believe I saw three of them and will assume so in this report. I trained my ! telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north.

I was startled to find that someone had posted a sighting of the very object we saw and even stranger that the UFO was in the same town, on the same date, at the same time, and moving in the same direction - West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just oustide my new home in Arlington, TX, when the object caught our attention. We both looked up and saw a rather large black trianglular object moving very slowy and seemingly very low, directly above us. The object was pitch black, against the night sky, with several large circular, but very dim, lights underneath. No other deatails could be made out and it seemed to glide accross the sky, in complete silence, and then it just dissappeared, soon after it passed overhead. The whole incident lasting only a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report I found of this sighting in NUFORC.com was seen from a different angle than myself, and the other viewer was able to see some more detail than I remember, however, I was able to see the lights underneath in more detail than what the other report describes. There were at least 5 perfectly round lights that were evenly dim, I was able to see them, but they did not give off any rays of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no stranger feeling in this world than experiencing a UFO, especially when it comes so close. It is gratifying to know someone else saw the same object. But even stranger it would be over 30 years before I would find that out.<n>

It looked like a football stadium at night from a distance.  Only in the air. I continued on,looking at the lights all the way.  As I got closer the lights were larger and very close to the ground. I had one more hill to go up before I reached my turn, Just about 1/2 milefrome the town of Deer Park. I climbed the hill watching the lights all the way.  As I reached the crest of the hill I was directly in front of the object.  It covered the highway on one side, the center  of the object was off the road to the left directly over a small farm house the barn and sourounding property.  As I look back I would say it was roughly 3-4 hundred yards round 30-40 ft high. with large lights all the way around and a large strob like light in the center (no colored lights) which was in the center on the bottom.  The object was only obout 100ft off the ground.  I do not recall any noise. As I drove directly under the object I had to make my turn (right). So I drove under and looked up, I do not recall seeing anthing other than lights and the strob.  I made my turn and stoped.  I got straight out to get a better look and it was just gone.  The only thing in the clear sky was stars...  Not a sign of what I had been watching nothing what so ever... I had no missing time, or any reason to think anything wierd had occurd..  Just a lasting memory.<n>

Looking for anyone who was there 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting on rt 1 at the Portland twin drive in Scarborough, Maine, waiting to let the cars in, and I noted something to the SE  it was yellow orange on the bottom.  i didn&#39;t think to much about it but I kept looking that way and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so we drove in and parked.  about half hour later I saw it in the south.  Rite by the Scarborough downs sign about 50 to 75 feed off the ground about a mile away and moving are way.  i thought it  was strange so I kept looking over at it.  Now I&#39;m thinking what is that thing its going so slow.  it went rite over the front of a shopping center and people were looking up and running some were dropping there bags.  it was close enough for me to see it was white on top and side and square lights panels around its bottom side that flashed a yellow orange strobe not in any type of order it kept coming in at a straight line it had been about 30+mins form the s.d sign to the shopping center and still coming are way it take 10 mins and I could have hit it with a rock.  it was moving behind the movie screen by now other people are seeing it some were point  at it.  it went behind the screen  and must have made 90 degrees turn east and came rite over the top of the screen about 15 feet above and just hovered.  by this time people were going nuts women were screaming and cars tearing the speaks off it was just crazy.  then the west screen did the same thing it was about 20 to 25 foot in diameter it was just hovering there for at least 5 mins by then about.  10-15 cars stayed after it left some of us stayed and talked. now I am a big chicken but  I wasn&#39;t afraid.  I think I in shock.  It did not hit me until I get home.  to this day if I tell someone the whole story by the end I am shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Looking for anyone who was there 1975.|3/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117572.html|35|ndxe197506| It was the summer of 1975. I was 11 years old.  At the parental urging of my mother, she had insisted that I clean my room spotless that day, which I did, carefully organizing my clothes and closet, hanging my posters, sorting my books, etc.  I was proudly sitting on my newly made bed.It was very dark and still.  The windows to my right were wide open with creme eyelet light weight curtains.  I leaned against my headboard and was getting ready to turn on my light to read, I was not sleeping or under the blankets.  I had noticed how still it was, not even a cricket or frog noise.  We lived in a house on the lake and there was always noise. It was extremely quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard it first. A slight roaring sound, almost like a semi truck or helicopter whooshing sound. My curtains were suddenly standing straight out and the light was coming through, passing across my bed to fall on the opposite wall.  The wierd thing was that it was like it was passing through a grating or window blinds. long lines of light traveling up my wall, not down, as though something was ascending and turning its lights up into my window. The noise was almost deafening. The wind was messing up everything in my room I had just spent hours on, papers were flying, my posters were being blown/sucked from the wall, books flying, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know how this next part came to be, but suddenly they were in my room. At that point all I could see were 4 small creatures. Now in my adulthood, I would describe them as the typical &amp;quot;greys&amp;quot; only they seemed to be a little heavier in weight. I could see one was rifling through my closet, clothes were being pulled from hangers and tossed aside, just like they were curious to see what was in there. Another stood over by my closed door, watching, and looking down at the foot of my bed there were 2 more, their hands resting on the end of the bed, not much taller than the edge of the bed, and they were just watching me with round black eyes. I remember trying to move, to scream but was unable to, doing nothing but turn my head a bit from side to side, up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sensed something else next to me, above me. Turning my head up and to the left there was another creature. This one was different, more ant looking and taller, more brownish in color. I could see pupils in its eyes. It was standing over me menacingly, suddenly with a quick movement its face was right in mine, just inches from my face, its eyes looking at me as if to study what I was thinking. It brought a 3 fingered and 1 thumb hand up and lay it across my nose and partially my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know what happened after that. The next morning as I remembered what had happened, I found myself sitting on the side of my bed, still clothed from the nite before, bed unslept in. Looking around the room, it was a total mess, papers, books clothes, etc. everywhere. I ran out my bedroom door to find my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my mother, &amp;quot;Mom, did you see and hear that huge noise and lights last nite? I thought an airplane crashed or a semi was coming through the side of the house&amp;quot;. I didnt want to get detailed about what I thought may have just happened to me I didnt want her to think I was making it up or crazy. She had heard nor seen nothing out of the ordinary. I told her that the wind was so big it made my curtains stand straight out and blew my room all over the place. She felt this was just an excuse and said I was making it up because I hadnt cleaned my room as she had told me to. But I had. I had cleaned it spotless. I never told her what really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days before this incident, I was looking into the night sky and saw what I cn only describe as dancing stars, tiny points of light looping and dancing around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, approximately 1982. I had a 3rd experience. Something followed me part of the way home as I drove the back roads home. It kept beside me hovering above the big corn field along the side of the road appearing to be a glowing green oval shaped light about twice the size of the car. If I slowed it would go ahead a little bit and stop and wait for me to keep driving. As I neared the end of that road to turn onto another, it disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

What do I pass to relate from now on, really happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were, more or less, 11 hours from the night in middle part of 1974.  I was 15 year olds then.  Arrive at home in that calm and starry night... When I look at the high sky, I saw a big ball of an yellowish light  like a big brilliant ring dislocating slowly of northeast for southeast, followed by many other lights smallerer in size than it. The colors and tinges, that varied of the red alive one, to the blue greenish one. I don&#39;t remember for certain from the quantity of lights, but I am able to say that were more of ten. The lights were foggy, as in a sign of neon, and they passed to impression of somewhat strange, unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I begin to squeak for my mother, that seems to be sleeping in that moment.  The lights enlivened itself to the decrease altitude (I realized this because near there was a stone quarry of some 800 meters of height and the airport is relativamente nearby and we could observe the planes upon raise flight).  I imagined that the lights dislocated themselves to, at least, some 1500 meters of altitude, without a noise.  Only my frightened shouts  broke to monotony of that hot night of Vitória, capital city of the  Espírito Santo state.  The neighborhood where my mother lives today stayed in the island of Vitória, the place is called Joana D&#39; arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the following day, watching the important, National TV News, that covers all the cowntry, I remember of the announcer  placarding the event in short and laconic form.  He said in the note that the objects were observed dislocating themselves of the north from the Bahia state in direction to the Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro stateS... I remember well that in the newspaper of the following day -  Headlines alluded to the fact, and a note said that an inhabitant from the Mountain Range - a place called SERRA - a neighboring city, that stayed in a plateau, to have observed everything of binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some years latter, already adult, I was in the Vitória Public Files, looking for newspapers from the epoch to find the correct day of the fact, but I did not obtain recollect correct date.  After very it find, I gave up and did not more I try..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, past so many years, I continue with the remembrance of that night.  What did I observe not itself looked with that already had seen.  That experience went very outstanding and decisive in my life.  I read and I research everything that am able to do about these strange phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These are the my remembrances..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like that you did a research to verify to truthfulness of these facts.  I apologize by do not be able to say the correct date.  But, in fact, it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take advantage of this moment to thank you for the attention and I say good-bye putting myself to the his entire arrangement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considerately, &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; Prezados Srs., Eram, mais ou menos, 11 horas da noite em meados do ano de 1974. Eu tinha 15 anos então. Chegara em casa àquela noite calma e estrelada e...ao olhar para o céu, ví uma grande bola, de uma luz amarelada e brilhante que se deslocava lentamente de nordeste para sudeste, seguida de muitas outras luzes menores de todas as cores e matizes, que variavam do vermelho vivo, ao azul esverdeado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Não me lembro ao certo da quantidade de luzes, mas posso dizer que eram mais de dez pontos brilhantes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comecei a gritar por minha mãe, que já estava dormindo àquela hora, a nossa pequena casa estava toda às escuras. As luzes movimentavam-se à baixa altitude ( calculei isto porque próximo havia uma pedreira de uns 800 metros de altura e o aeroporto é relativamente perto e podíamos observar os aviões ao levantar vôo). Imaginei que as luzes deslocavam-se a, pelo menos, uns 1500 metros de altitude, sem nenhum ruído. Somente os meus gritos asustados quebravam a monotonia daquela noite quente de Vitória, capital do Espírito Santo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O bairro onde mora aindo hoje a minha mãe fica na ilha de Vitória, chama-se Joana D&#39;arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No dia seguinte, assistindo o Jornal Nacional, importante noticiário de TV, que cobre todo o Brazil, lembro-me do locutor  anunciando o evento de forma lacônica e breve. Dizia ele na nota que os objetos foram observados deslocando-se do norte da Bahia em direção ao Espírito Santo e Rio de Janeiro...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alguns anos mais tarde, já adulto, estive no arquivo público de Vitória, procurando jornais da época para certificar-me do dia correto em que o fato se dera, pois não conseguia recordar a data correta. Depois de muito  procurar, desistí e não mais tentei...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hoje, passados tantos anos, continuo com a lembrança viva daquela noite. O que observei não se parecia com nada que já tivesse visto.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aquela experiência foi muito marcante e decisiva em minha vida. Até hoje leio e pesquiso tudo que posso sobre estes estranhos fenômenos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lembro-me bem que no jornal do dia seguinte-- Manchetes aludiam ao fato e uma nota dizia que um morador da Serra, uma cidade vizinha, que fica num planalto,  havia observado tudo de binóculos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Estas são as minhas lembranças...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gostaria que fizessem uma pesquisa para comprovarem a veracidade destes fatos. Peço desculpas por não poder precisar a data correta. Mas, de fato aconteceu.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aproveito pra agradecer pela atenção e me despeço colocando-me à sua inteira disposição.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atenciosamente,<n>

While it was hovering, the lights flashed on and off.  I pulled my car over so I and the passenger could observe.  When it started moving slowly again, I rushed home to see if I could find another adult witness.  I wanted you to know that what is being observed now is by no means a new phenomenon<n>

My brother and I had decided to go out on his back lawn and look for shooting stars, as I had never observed one before.  We reclined in chaise lounge chairs and stared up at the sky for quite some time, then I saw a streak of blue/white light travel rapidly across the sky and then vanish.  My brother said “did you see that…that was one”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this, in the same area of the sky, I saw another. However this time the streaking light (which vanished) was followed by another pinpoint of white light coming from a higher angle of elevation (as perceived from my position on the ground)on an intersecting course with the trajectory of the first object. It was as if the second light had been chasing the first.  As rapidly as the second light converged on the first, it halted in place; hanging there for a second…then executed a 135 degree turn to port, and stopped dead again.  After approximately one second it executed another approx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 135 degree to port side and halted abruptly again, suspended in space. This final maneuver brought the object back to what appeared it’s original course…then vanished.  The light simply disappeared so rapidly that I could not follow it, or it was extinguished. I do wear corrective lenses, so I immediately scanned  the neighbors houses for any lights which could have reflected off my lenses; from opening screen -doors or flashlights, or perhaps a cars headlights.  I saw nothing which could have caused such reflections.   I know that these could not have been manned aircraft; as the G-Force of such abrupt turns, speeds and dead stops would probably have killed a human being.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My &#39;friend-boy&#39; (he was 22) was walking me back to my apartment where I lived with my family.  We stopped to talk and were standing in the Phyllis Wheatley elementary school field that separated the school from my apartment building by about an acre.  The street was about a half a block away to my right and his left, facing the apartment building.  Across from the apartment building was another apartment complex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about a half an hour before sunset on a very clear evening.  Around the perimeter of the field, there were a lot of tall trees.  We were engrossed in a very good conversation when I notice to my left, something coming through the tops of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t make a sound but it was as big as a very large house.  It was black and shaped like a very narrow triangle.  It has lights on each point and a big &#39;spotlight&#39; typed light in the middle.  It whoosed over the very tops of the trees, so close that we both ducked, thinking it was going to hit us.  I asked him if he saw what I had just seen and we both definately agreed that what we saw was shaped like nothing we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, here is where it gets very, VERY strange.  Not more that one minute later, as we were engrossed in conversation about the object we had just saw, I noticed movement, this time over my right shoulder.  Coming out of the bushes next to one of the apartment buildings across the street was a caveman!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped in mid sentence and my friend noticed and followed my eyes.  He then asked me if I saw what he was seeing.  I said that yes, I see a caveman!!  We both watched as the caveman parted the bushes holding what looked like a large tree branch in his left hand.  He was not very tall and had on what looked like brown fur around his mid-section.  The color of his skin was light beige.  He didn&#39;t make a sound but stared at us as we stared at him.  What broke the concentration was when I screamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The caveman then started coming towards us--but he moved like he was under water or mechanical.  I could NOT move from where I was standing because I could NOT stop staring at this very strange sight!  Finally my friend grabbed my hand and said to me to stop staring and start running!  I had on a pair of yellow Japanese shoes that I had to kick off because my friend was pulling me so fast.  I turned to look behind us and the caveman was so close that I could see that his bared mouth bore yellow teeth.  When he ran, it was in that mechanical, under water way--like he could not control his movements--but that didn&#39;t stop him from moving so fast!  He looked like he was caught in the beams of a strobe light.  As we reached the steps of my building, I looked back again but only saw his hand as it was ready to grab me just under my shoulder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank goodness the building&#39;s main entrance door was always unlocked!!  We got in the building and my apartment door was unlocked as well (because my siblings were home).  I locked the apartment door behind us and we both ran to the front window to see if we could see him anywhere but all we saw were my parents who were just pulling up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both looked at each other in puzzlement, then ran right back to the door--he snatched it open only to find an empty entryway.  The caveman was gone just that quick!  We both ran out to help my parents with the groceries--both talking a mile a minute about our experience.  When we got back inside, my mom asked us what the thing in the sky looked like.  We described it to her and my dad.  My mom suddenly had to sit down and they both just stared at each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Mom then told us that that was the same object they saw, along with about 50 others, just the week before.  They had been stopped at a light at a very busy intersection and she said everyone was jumping out of their cars pointing at it.  She said they all got an excellent look at it because it was moving slowly across the sky.  I remember her showing us the newspaper clipping about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The year was 1976 in Okinawa Japan.  Some friends and I were playing glow-in-the-dark football.    We heard a whirring sound and looked up and saw a 8  foot white disk object with &#34;US AIR FORCE&#34; written on the bottom of it and it was  flying about 100 feet in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over us and then hovered over some trees. The disk had a single red light on the bottom, directly in the center of the disk.  It flashed like any standard aircraft light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then ejected a small parachute.  We all ran over to see what it had ejected and it was merely a small weight attached to a small white parachute.  It then flew off into the night.  It was an unmanned object with no windows and appeared to be remotely controlled. The words, &#34;US AIR FORCE&#34; were clearly seen on the bottom of the craft.  The whirring sound was very quiet and no sign of external engines or propellers were seen.   The thickness of the craft was about 3 feet with a diameter of 8  feet.  The structure was seamless and was white in color.  There was no &#34;glow&#34; or &#34;strange light&#34; from the craft.   This was exactly as we all remember it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, either in 1975 or 1976.  PD))<n>

My dad was a teacher at that time.  Everyone in the gym left the side doors to either smoke a cigarette or chew tobacco, or whatever.  There were two exits, most went out the right side of the gym.  My dad confronted a roudy person that was causing trouble when just then there was a round white light floating around the people.  I would say it was about five feet across and down to the ground and floating around everyone.  My dad being a teacher in this isolated indian village in Alaska at the time said it was probably a university experiment.  I was 15 years old and did not know anything at that time, having never seen anything at that time.  Later, I did ask him, he did not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a drunk guy who thought it was the great spirit and started to pray to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was still light out, probably around 6-7pm.  I heard a strange buzzing/whirring sound that started softly and became louder and I said to my brother “do you hear that?” He said “hear what?”   As the sound diminished. A few seconds later the sound came back much louder this time and I said “you can’t hear that?” He replied “now I do” and we looked at each other puzzled.  I got off the couch and went and put my ear to the speaker on the TV set to hear if it was coming from there.  It wasn’t.  It became apparent it was coming from behind where we were sitting from outside the window. I walked over to the window and to my surprise a saucer shaped object about 35 feet in diameter was hovering at tree top height over a field between two houses a few hundred feet outside of our window.  We both watched in amazement as this saucer shaped craft hovered in front of us.  There seemed to be sec! tions of it that were rotating, some clockwise some counterclockwise and at different speeds. It was shiny grey metallic and had what appeared to be rows of colored lights.  I was eleven at the time and the feeling of overwhelming excitement was hard to contain.  I had no negative feelings about it. In fact I found it to be a very positive experience.  We were not scared.  It felt like the most magical experience of my life.  Very positive. I ran to get my camera and my brother went to get my sister.  When we got back to the window half a minute later it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked the local news paper when it came out the following Monday for other reports.  Many people reported it to the police as could be seen in the police blotter, and later in the week a story came out about all the families who had seen it from a nearby school field while playing baseball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnessing that at such an early age has had a huge impact on my ability to accept the concept that we are not at the apex of intelligence in the universe as many would like us to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Out of the clear blue sky a large pale blue spot appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of this pale blue spot the craft appeared and darted out ahead of us and hovered over the interstate.  People were stopped all along the highway looking at it.  State troopers were pulled off the road taking pictures and talking on the radio.  The craft was a shiny silver saucer-shaped object with green, white, and yellow lights on the bottom.  The lights turned and alternated.  It hovered a long while over the western edge of Baton Rouge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father would not stop for anything, even for a UFO.  All of us kids watched it intently.  We headed straight towards it for a long time.  My father was irritated at the slow moving traffic.  As we got near it, it shot out straight forward in a blast of speed with no sound nor contrails.  It then hovered over the eastern side of the city.  A we made the turn heading south, we watched it out of the back window of the car.  Eventually it shot clean out of sight in a second.  I&#39;ve spoken of it only in circles of trust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My entire family remembers that day vividly.  The date is approximate; could have been &#39;74 - &#39;76.

I&#39;ve never seen anything like it again, and would never claim to anything that I did not firmly believe I saw. I  am 45 years old, and saw this when I was approximately 10-11, so I&#39;d say it was in 1975. I havn&#39;t told anybody about it until a couple years ago as I thought nobody would believe me. I can see it as clearly in my head as I could when I saw it as a kid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear, bright sunny blue-sky day around high noon when I was walking home to my grandmothers&#39; from a cousin&#39;s house on one of the backroads of Noxen. No drugs, booze, glue-sniffing etc. I was a pretty clean and straight kid and had just spent the morning hanging out with my cousin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road runs along the back side of town at the bottom of a mountain known as Schooley&#39;s Peak. The peak of the mountain is clearly visible from the section of road I was walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught my eye and I looked up at the top of Schooley&#39;s Peak and there was this large bright metallic silver cigar shaped smooth object hovering at an angle of approximately 20 degrees directly over the top of the mountain peak at an altitude I would guess to be about 50-75 feet from the top of the peak, just well over the treetops. It was large, and the length of the craft was a longer  than the hover altitude so I&#39;d say it was somewhere around 75-100 feet in length. There were small dark horizontal slits dead center of the object running the entire length. If I were to guess I&#39;d say there were about 15-25 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, no lights, it was completely silent and just hanging over the mountain top. I observed it for about 10-15 seconds, I remember a feeling of fear setting in and I looked away for a moment, then looked up again and it was gone, just vanished silently and did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember anything else after that happened that day, I don&#39;t even remember the walk the rest of the way home, I&#39;m sure it was due to the overwhelming sight that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just found your website today and searched Noxen, PA. I was surprised to see there was another sighting there and decided to post my experience. It&#39;s a very small, backwoods town. The only thing unique about Noxen is that it is bordering a very large area of deep woods with practically no population at all, and no passable roads with the exception of some logging roads and rudimentary dirt roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll sketch a quick drawing of what I saw and include a google maps link to show the area I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Meanwhile the steerman took the binoculars and reported (very nervously) that the object passed close to the ship (less than a 100 mts)had no specific shape, only a black mass with some red and yellow lights. There was no sound at all (engines or water movement), but the object was moving fast, estimated 20-25 knots. After passing by the stern, it faded several minutes later.

It was in the local paper which was called either The Moe Advocate or The Latrobe Valley Express. A few days or a week later there was another write up accusing the boys of lying, and the whole thing being a hoax. I do not know the boys names nor the full story I only remember the headlines as I was not allowed to read it. I am thier witness which they would be unaware, as my parents did not report it. The night they saw the ufo was the night I was laying on the couch and staring out the small lounge window. It was dark and a huge bright disc shaped object came down on an angle rather slowly, no sound at all, from the south east and down past the house next door in the direction of the Edward Hunter reserve. I told my mother first thing in the morning and again when she was reading the article about it in the paper. My parents believed it was just my imagination and although my mother says she now believes me at the time she did not want to encourage such nonsense. Especially since the whole town was scoffing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you know of the report could you please let me know or if any of you boys are reading this please note you did have another witness that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> kindest regards ((initials of witnesses deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Some of my older friends had an out door party on a dam near a spillway. They left beer cans out which I came back later to clean up.  As I was leaving I looked up to see the beautiful stars - a stillness came over me.  In shock I saw a very large cigar shaped craft glide silently  over head in front of me.  The silence was thunderous if you know what I mean. I could not believe my eyes and my brain was having a hard time trying to process the 1-4 second experience.  The speed was probably 100 miles an hour plus and moving parellel to its length as a plane would. Without good triangulation the exact size and distance of the UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) can only be estimated.  Using my eyes depth of  field I estimate the object to be around the size of a mid to large jet airliner. The shape was an absolutely perfect cylinder with domed ends (cigar). It was  slightly illuminated in the darkness and ~ a third of a mile away (45 degrees angle up). The direction was north-east. I was walking on the dam&#39;s path going south. There was no wings or other indications to assume that it was a jet or airplane.  (I had made a hard choice to give up all cigerettes, alcohol or drugs  long before that night  so you can rule out intoxication.)  That is my experience to the best of my ability and I make no claim as to what this event is or what it is not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I beg the reader to take in but not judge either way several other experiences I have had that are more difficult to describe dealing with experiences at night  after I went to bed.  In the early 1970&#39;s (during puberty -and hormones) I do remember going to bed, starting to feel very heavy then the walls in my room would &#34;breath&#34; (not scary). Then I would find my self in a series of 3 absolutely hopeless hynogogic experiences.  In one I was tied across railroad tracks with a speeding train an inch from hitting me then I was balancing on a long needle that balanced on top of a radio antenna that was on top of the Empire State Building and the third experience I blocked from memory in the last few years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (I called the 3 situations &#34;the tourture&#34;.)  Then still in a groggy state I would walk (sometimes run) out of the house for real and go for 10 minutes.  Coming out of the groggy state I would be outside as far as a third of a mile away from my home in my underwear (much to my extreme embasasment). My mother would sometimes find me yelling-wide eyed as If I was trying to get away from someone.  I would go back inside but it would take an hour to shake off the strangness of the whole thing.  This happened in the exact pattern maybe 20 times, then after a trip to a psycholigist and 6 or so relaxer pills the experiences ended abruptly never to happen again.  Over the decades I have had  ET dreams : one human and one short elder &#34;gray&#34;. who communicated wordlessly using either an instructional 3d image projected over my minds eye with a force of emotion that shook me to my core.  My common sense tells me that all the experiences are related but I am the first to admit that the dreams and night walks could be due to my own illusions or projections (in essence nothing to do in anyway with the cigar craft my eyes saw.) I also have no negative feelings toward ET&#39;s etc. quite the opposite.  I realize that if they are real then there is a whole range of them just like there is a whole range of humans positive and negitive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I try to keep an open mind and my mouth shut but I continue to hear people I have become friends over the years describe their own Richmond UFO experiences.  They have no intention of reporting their own experiences and I can&#39;t blame them.  Their body language and tone displays honesty and openess.  On this issue I also have seen hypnotic eyed -very animated folks go off on cart-wheeling flights of pompas fancy. On another extreme I have seen stiff necked ultra myopic &#34;scientific&#34; skeptics roll their eyes in their own pious pomp.   I take both with a grain of salt.  Most people are neither extreme as they are open and are a pleasure to relate to.  I am thankful for this important web site. Thank you for taking time to read my experiences and thoughts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Our attention was immediately caught by a large, bright light in the North Eastern sky.  The light was very bright and about the size of a basketball held at arm&#39;s length.  At first, we thought it might be a helicopter search light. We noticed that there was no sound coming from the object. My friend and I dashed back into the house to get my Dad. When the three of us returned to the porch the light was gone.  I might have dismissed this sighting, but the next day in the Albany Times Union there was a report of a UFO matching the description of what we had seen over Albany.  The event had been viewed by dozens of witnesses.<n>
6/10/75 22:00|Albany|NY|Light|One Minute|Bright Light|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89881.html|61|ndxe197506| I cannot swear this was a UFO, but would like to compare our &#34;sighting&#34; with others to see what they think.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a long time ago. Mary Tyler Moore (NOT a re-run) was on TV at the time. It was just past dark, probably in early summer. I think the show &#34;Canon&#34; was coming on. These were my favorite TV shows at the time. I lived with my grandparents at the time, and was probably about 18 or 19 years old. I&#39;m 45 now. This would have been about 1975, I guess. My grandma, grandpa, and I were home. Grandpa has passed away now, and Grandma had a severe stroke, so I am the only one who can tell about this incident. We lived in the country, 7 miles from town, so the window curtains were up (we never closed them at night.) The weather was clear and warm. It should be noted that some very high voltage electric lines run across our farm. (We have experienced several strange phenomena besides what I describe here.) I also want to note that we frequently walked around outside the house at night, to feed animals, get things from the car, bring in clothes off the clothes line, and so forth. On really nice nights, we sometimes sat in chairs on the porch and watched the stars. So we were all familiar with the ordinary things you see at night, from our farm. For example, you can see the lights from houses of distant neighbors, and even lights that are probably part of a nearby town. But what we saw on this night was very different. I had my back to the window while watching TV. Grandpa sat across from me, facing me, and grandma was probably in the kitchen. Just then, a bright flash of light appeared outside. It was so bright that I saw it despite having my back to the window. My cousin later told us that she too had seen a bright flash of light outside from my Aunt&#39;s house, which is about a mile away. None of us ever thought this was lightening, and there was no thunder -- no sound at all. Grandpa got up and went outside. He thought something on our electrical pole had shorted out. We had been having problems with it for a few days. Grandpa came running back in, looking terrified. &#34;Strange lights, strange lights!&#34; He screamed. I had never before nor after seen Grandpa acting like this. He was one of the quietest and most calm people you&#39;ve ever known. Grandma and I ran outside. In the distance, maybe a quarter mile away, were the lights. There were several rows of red lights, stacked one on top of the other. These appeared to be in a field, about two farms distant from us. They were not in the sky; i.e., this was not a flying object but something on the ground. If I have to describe an overall shape, I would say a cigar, because the &#34;object,&#34; if it was one, was much longer than it was tall, from our point of view. If this was an object, it would have to be very large. I would say as much as 40 or 50 feet across. To me it looked as if all the many lights were distinctly separate from one another, in about 3 or 4 rows. A row across the bottom, then another row above, then another above, like well-spaced Christmas tree lights. They appeared to flicker, twinkle, or possibly rotate -- we were far enough away that I couldn&#39;t tell for sure. I know that if you stare long enough at a distant light on a dark night, it can appear to twinkle. We watched this thing for a long time, all expressing our views on what it was. Grandma thought a bunch of people had parked their cars, leaving the taillights on. Neither Grandpa nor I thought that was possible. After all, we were way out in the country and that would mean about 30 or 40 cars, all facing the same way, had somehow gained access to the neighbor&#39;s private property and left their lights on. We speculated that it might be something on fire, but the lights seemed too evenly spaced for that. In retrospect, it seems weird that none of us thought of calling the Sheriff or anything. I think it was just too bizarre and we were in too small a town and didn&#39;t want to be in the news or get laughed at. There had been a recent incident of a light following two girls home, and 16 people witnessed the light. This made the local newspaper. Also, there was a &#34;cattle mutilation&#34; in the next town, which also made the news. My grandparents really didn&#39;t want to be in the news, I think. But this does show a recent record of strange occurrances. Grandma and Granpa wanted to get in the truck, drive down the road in that direction, and see what this thing was. I myself had read a lot of UFO abduction stories in paperbacks of the time, and I was very frightened to get any closer. I really was a fraidy cat at the time, and I actually pulled them out of the truck and wouldn&#39;t let them go. I deeply regret that now, no matter what had happened. So we continued to watch this thing, and then suddenly it just disappeared. Like all the lights had turned off. Throughout this incident, we never heard a noise of any kind. We continued to look over there a while, then gave up and went into the house. ------- I want to add another, totally different incident here. We&#39;ve had a history of seeing &#34;strange lights&#34; on the farm, dating back to the turn of the century. My grandpa grew up there, and he and his brothers used to jump on mules to chase lights that appeared and disappeared in various places.  I heard these stories all my life, but had never witnessed this for myself. In 1984, I saw these lights for myself, along with my brother, sister-in-law, and mother. My brother, sister-in-law, and I were outside at night. Grandpa was having surgery and the family had all gathered. We were outside that night looking at the stars and talking. There were two australian shepherd dogs on the farm, and they suddently went racing off into the nearby pasture, which belongs to a neighbor. Thinking they were chasing the neighbor&#39;s cows, I walked over to call them back. I heard a noise like a crying baby. This is also the sound a rabbit makes when it dies. So I stood by the fence, thinking I was hearing a rabbit&#39;s death cry. (Let me note that those two dogs were NOT hunting dogs and I had never known them to hurt other animals, so this seemed strange to me.) Anyway, the dogs suddently came charging back towards me, through the fence, and got behind me. I no longer could hear the strange sound. I looked over the fence thinking maybe the neighbor&#39;s bull was chasing the dogs back toward me. What I saw was a red light, which rotated slowly. It illuminated everything in its path as it turned -- the trees, grass, etc. were all very clear. It seemed to hover a few feet above the ground, and I could not see anything supporting the light, holding the light, etc. This light was only about 50 feet or so from where I was standing, and though I could see everything the light illuminated, I saw nothing supporting the light itself. The other weird thing was that the dogs were not barking. These were very, extremely aggressive dogs when it came to strangers. One of these dogs had bit several people. The other dog had such a fierce bark that most people were afraid to get out of their cars until you called the dog off. But neither dog was barking or growling. I went to get my brother and sister-in-law and they came over to see this light. We were standing there talking about what it might be, when it went out. We started to walk back toward the house when the light re-appeared, only now it was farther away, down by the barn. At this point, my sister-in-law must have run to get my mother. I walked down towards the barn to get a closer look at this light, when it disappeared again. Very quickly, it re-appeared much further away, way out in the neighbor&#39;s field, this time at least 100 to 200 yards from the barn area where we had just seen it. I was so busy watching this light that I didn&#39;t realize my mother also saw it, until we discussed it later. Finally, the light disappeared and did not return. We never figured out what could have caused this light. Later, when Grandpa got out of the hospital, we told him about it. He just laughed, shook his head, and said, &#34;Oh. They&#39;re back.&#34;<n>

There was one big circle and several small circles around the big circle...it was a circle of rotating colorful lights.  There was no sound. We were afraid and hid behind our neighbors camper. The neighbors had a row of bushes and we looked over to the bushes and from behind the bushes..what I would describe as a laser light was coming over the bush and disappearing before it hit the ground.

How flawless in form, size, and color for a vehicle.  A big, rounded flying… car?

A new color followed it around (always counter-clockwise) very slowly as I heard my mother ask a new question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “What is it?” “I think it is a…”  Then I thought, ‘My mother is asking me what it is?  You mean she doesn’t know?  Was she testing me?  The color red began to ooze in behind the last color and then just as slowly came another.  Mesmerized, my mother and I watched this thing hover just above the trees and give us the lava lamp show of our lives.  Before long we were saying the colors in unison as they came into view and waited a few seconds for the next color to appear.  I remember wanting to be the first to guess the next color or say what it was as soon as I could see any hint at what the color would be as it slowly made it’s appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Blu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-e… gre-e-e-e-e-e-e-n…” “Hey Mom, can we go outside?&#34; After several minutes my panic-stricken mother moved me to the dining room where I watched it from a bay window and she made phone calls to police, the airport, my dad, and then gave up from frustration at being laughed at or hung up on.  I watched the flying saucer and for so long that I actually got bored of it and went back to the TV set only to return to the window during commercial breaks.  Alas, it was out of view.  What could have been the most remarkable encounter of the first kind, was over and done without even a single photo.  The heavily used camera was out of film.

We were so startled by the sudden burst of light that we dropped the radio on the sidewalk.We looked up to see a blinding yellow glow moving off into the distant sky. The sky reminded me of a black top road with a freshly painted yellow line down the middle as this light flew off into the night. Then the yellow hue we were standing in started to fade away as if someone were working a dimmer switch. This &#34;thing&#34; made no noise what so ever.

Neither did my mother, I am speaking on her behalf. She does&#39;t know much English.  What she saw one night in 1975 was what describes as a very ugly human like creature.  She said there was a full moon. she was sitting inside a little pick-up truck with a closed cab. There was three other people with her but they all were sleep.  When she tells me the story and remembers she seems as if she saw a ghost. She said she was setting on the drivers side looking at the moon and worring that shes was going to get in trouble for not being home. The place they were park at was very desolate then.  very country.  She recalls being able to see real good because of the moon light.  She said out of no where this pale creature jumped on the hood ofthe truck.  my mom said she was completely paralized.  panicking she could not move or scream.  then she says the thing moved over to her window, which was open. She said it look at her very curiously and paciently.  my mom thinks it was about 4&#39; in height.  She said he had a skinny neck with a large head and very large eyes, also long arms and fingers.  My mother grew up in a third world country with no tv until she was about 16. The incident happened when she was 14. So she could not have any ideas what an alien may have looked like then based on Hollywood. My mother said she finally snapped out of her panic and she then slapped the driver who was sleeping on the passenger side.  she was screaming and crying very nervous because she had never seen anything like that in her life.  No one believed her then. My mother is a very serious person.  she doesn&#39;t lie.  I believe her.  When she saw the movie &#34;Fire in the Sky&#34;  she said the creatures looked very much like the aliens portrait in the movie.  Also like the ones in &#34;Close Encounters of The Third type&#34;.  She drew a face illustration for me of what she saw and it looked just like them.  I believe her, do you?-@#$%^&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;*()*()_.<n>

We decided we would try to get a closer look at it by going down a side road; the next thing I remember is driving down Eastman Road at about 75mph and this thing passed us up; followed us all the way from the river to the deadend street where I now live. It5 went out into the sky hovering  over the field. I ran inside and got my mother to come out to see it and she said &#34;there is nothing there but a star&#34;. It had stopped spinning when she came out but all of a sudden took off at an angle at a rapid rate and shot across the sky. We ran inside to call the airport to see if anything strange showed up on radar; they did not believe us when we told them what we had seen; thought we had been drinking or something. There was no sound coming from the craft at all but had a haze about it; looked like somekind of sparks coming from the water with the craft hovering over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in the passenger seat.  My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;.  He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward.  When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft.  it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction.  While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it.  I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom.  I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth.  It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound.  As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour.  I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity.  We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car.  He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us.  I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone.  I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished.  We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi.  I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen.  He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw.  He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene.  I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included.  I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night.  I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

But I don&#39;t think it was in June because I was in junior high and we were still in school, which in New Mexico back then got out in May.  I think it was September or October 1975.  I remember the kids whose parents were stationed at Cannon Air Force Base came to school one day and they were saying that that night their dads went on scramble alert and they were chasing something around that was too fast for them to catch. Of course that night my buddy came over to spend the night We spent a few hours checking out stars and looking for anything wierd. I remember we had found about three different lights that seemed to pulsate red,white, &amp; blue but our science teacher had warned us in all the excitement that the atmosphere can make starlight pulsate.  The lights were far enough away to be indistinguishable from stars.  We tried to convince ourselves we were seeing UFOs but they weren&#39;t moving. So we were about to call it quits.  But while we were looking at the brightest of the pulsing lights, it glowed even brighter for a second, then streaked to its left, then up and to the right, completely out of sight.  I still to this day remember my amazement that we had actually seen something.  We stammered back and forth at each other then ran inside my house and dragged my dad outside.  He didn&#39;t see anything and smiled and went back inside.  It moved so fast, it was incredible.  I still get chills when I think about how it streaked out of sight right before my eyes.  We watched the other candidates for a while and kept searching the sky but we never saw anything else. Although I knew several people who were checking out the skies that second night nobody else saw anything. That&#39;s my story.  Not much but it really did happen.  I was so relieved to find out that someone else had already documented the incident and revealed some interesting facts.<n>

I watched as it streaked East-West extremely fast and and it finaly was between our car and huge buildings(downtown Richmond) and only several hundred feet away. It hovered for awile and then it was gone in a flash.It was not Fixed, Rotary, or any other known flying craft I know of!  22 years in Aviation Industry!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading back to my post with friends and family when visiting in PA and was retuning to Camp Lejuene NC as I was an active duty Marine.  We were heading southbound on Interstate very late in the evening.  The vehicle was a 1965 Chev. with a sloped back window. I was a passenger in the back with my wife and my friend and his wife and sleeping young son was in the front.  I leaned my head back, and saw what appeared to be a bright object moving swiftly across the sky and doing erratic right angle fast turning manuevers at 1st I thought it may be a reflection, so I rolled the window down to get a better look and saw that it was in fact something in the sky!  Well, it ws cold so I immediately got objections from all the other passengers!  But I continued tracking it and saw that it was getting much closer and following a similar path path as we were!  At it&#39;s closest point it was less than 300&#39; to my left and was totaly clearly visable as a saucer shaped craft!  Up to that point in my life I did not have any desciption or drawing of what I saw, since then I have seen T.V. programs, movies and Newspaper descriptions of what others saw since then that summed up what I saw.  I grew up just below the flight path for final approach for Philadelpia Intl Airport, and was always around military aircraft during my military career, I know beyond a shadow of any doubt, that what I witnessed was in fact not of this earth&#39;s technology! It was silver metalic with red bands and a white(bright) area and was very stable and deliberate in it&#39;s movements!  We definetely ar not alone, I will testify to any and all statements made here to anyone!  Also, while going through my basic training at Parris Is. SC in the time frame of Sept-Dec.&#39;73, we were put on the alert...for real!, to report any objects that were sighted as the public/military had sighted a few objects in nearby Charleston SC.  This was front page news.  I do not know if my sighting was ever documented and i don&#39;t even know where to begin to find out, but if somehow another report similar to mine ever comes across your research...I would love to know about it!  I want to that you immensly for you creating this forum...it is a great site, and I will send$ to support your efforts in this endeavor!<n>

I was heading west on a road near Meade Lake and eventually would turn left (south) on a side road which had me heading towards St. Rt. 140. While heading west I saw a very bright light to my left.  As I turned on the side road to head towards St. Rt. 140, the light was directly ahead of me, probably a bit less than a 1/4 mile.  It appeared to be over the road and not moving.  I noticed there was a car in front of me and behind me.  We all slowed down as we approached the light.  It appeared to be a circular cluster of lights (similar to a hosptial operating room light) that was as wide as the two-lane road.  All three of our cars slowed to almost a stop as we drove under the light.  I estimate that the light was probably 100&#39; from the ground perhaps.  I rolled my window down thinking that perhaps it was a helicopter but there was no sound except for the cars.  I continued under it and turned right on St. Rt. 140.  I became quite a bit frightened as I drove down 140 because I began to think that it wasn&#39;t something normal, that perhaps it was a UFO?  I then began to think that whatever it was, it had to have seen me drive under it.  To this day I wish I would have pulled over some distance away from it and watched what it did.  I told some friends but never formally reported it out of fear of ridicule.  Later I heard a lot of people out in that area had seen something strange in the sky that moving around.

It could have been any time between early 1974 through summer of 1976.  Though, I believe it was a summer evening in 1975 after dark, which would make it after 9:00 PM EDT.  I am estimating the time based the fact that some of the neighbors who were there moved to a different neighborhood in 1976, and I don&#39;t think I had started first grade yet, which I did in September 1975.  I put it in summer, because I don&#39;t think I would have been out riding bikes in the dark during school, but it could have been spring and maybe earlier in the evening, but it was definitely after dinner.

In the summer of 1975, I was 5 years old and my brother was 8. There were 5 or 6 of us all gathered at the end of the driveway of the kid across the street from my house.  We were in a subdivision off Roscoe Road, and during the event we were facing due north. Most of the land in that direction for about a quarter mile was undeveloped forest, but there were houses on the gravel back road and pasture beyond some of the woods.  Right next to my house was a clearing that at one time was going to be a short road, and the neighbor’s driveway was directly across the street from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught our eye was a huge, glowing, orangey-yellowy circle or sphere that flew in from the west and hovered near the center of that clearing, not too far over the tree line.  We all stood and watched it hover for a moment, then it split in half vertically and fire shot up out of the middle. I don’t remember an actual fireball being released, just an explosion of fire.  Then the two halves came back together and the sphere flew back off to the west and below the horizon.   I seem to remember it went up a little before it went west and down.  All the movements – appearing, disappearing, splitting, and rejoining – were calm, smooth and controlled, like gliding. From what I remember, it didn’t make any sound. I don&#39;t recall it illuminating anything. It seemed to be close, maybe ¼ to ½ mile away, but there is no way really tell how far away it was or how large. The width of the clearing was standard two-lane road length, about 20 feet, and the object appeared to take up about the same amount of space in width from our perspective. It may have been a little narrower or wider than the clearing, but not much.  The entire event was brief, probably under a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t seen those neighbors in a long time, but my brother and I still talk about it from time to time.  My sister had gone in for a minute and missed it, but she remembers us telling her about it. I have never seen any mention of it anywhere by anyone else and don&#39;t recall anything at the time.  I come to sites like this occasionally to search for a description of anything similar around the same time. Not knowing where the object really was means, of course, that anyone for many, many miles could have seen it.  I’ve found a few similar stories from around GA around that time, but the only one that mentions fire at all reported a fireball from a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of years ago, I met some folks in Athens, GA who knew two guys that I knew in high school in Newnan.  They told me that in the mid-to-late 1980s, two of them were in one of their backyards lying on a trampoline and saw some type of event which they described as a UFO that totally freaked them out.  I don&#39;t recall all the details of their experience, but I do know it was different from mine.  I think they saw a line or other formation of several lights.  At any rate, I got very excited when the people started to tell me about it, because I thought it may have been around the same time as my sighting.  After I found out it was a good 10-13 years later and different, I still remained quite excited about it, because that particular guy lived about 2 miles north of my house in the Macedonia Road area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have since purchased 19 Tremaine<n> <n><n> <n><n> A map of Kenmore NY. would be helpful here.  When I was a boy my, friend and I saw a UFO on Tremaine Ave. in Kenmore NY.  I have always told persons about my experience and one day surfing the web I decided to see if anyone else had seen any UFO’s in my home town.  I came across a report dated June 1, 1975.  When I read the report I now believe with a high degree of certainty that the craft that was seen by the man on Keller and his mother was the same craft that my friend and I saw.  Here is my reasoning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	Although I do not remember the exact date, I knew it was summer because I remember wearing shorts (big deal for Buffalo! :)). He listed June 1, 1975.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	Keller is only a few blocks away from Tremaine, in his report, he said he observed the object from a second story window on Keller in the direction of Kenmore Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	He says approximately 200 feet high, again the object I observed was low indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	8:30 PM also sounds correct because I had to be home by 9:00 PM in those days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	Kenmore Ave. is two blocks away from Tremaine and is consistent with the direction of the Keller observer.  If you were on Keller, One would be looking toward that general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.	Also the color, blue, and shape of the object basically round are consistent with the object I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my account of what I believe were one in the same craft on that night. My friend and I were walking to my house which was the house next door to his.  I was looking down and he was obviously looking up when he said, “Hey, ‘name’, what is THAT!” with strong emphasis on the “that”.  We were directly in the middle of the first block on Tremaine Ave nearest Delaware Ave, two blocks from Kenmore Ave.  The object was incredibly bright, yet it did not seem to give off any light in the conventional sense you would expect an object as bright as this to illuminate houses or something.  Trying to describe the color as blue is generally correct however the objects coloration was a series of other colors that flashed with white and reds and many hues in-between, although, mostly a deep blue.  The object was directly over a neighbors house about 30 feet.  I remember thinking that a kid with a good “arm” could have hit it with a baseball.  The object began as a more solid blue color and then intensified in colors of pulsating blues and other hue’s(flashing, query Lake Erie ufo&#39;s on UTube).  It moved in the direction of Kenmore Ave very slowly.  I would say the size of the object may have been about the size of a bus, however judging size was problematic since it was so bright only its general circular/oval shape was discernable. It was like looking at a bright blue flashing strobe through a toilet paper tube, essentially it looked like a pulsating blue hole in the sky on a blue grey background.  The object then moved slowly toward Delaware and Kenmore Ave intersection.  After it moved out of site, my friend and I rushed in my house and told my parents.  We then made some drawings of it.  I do not have the drawings anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, if you check out the Lake Erie UFO’s on UTube that would be essentially what I saw, but I saw it at point blank range.   Those objects pulse in exactly the same manner as the one that I saw.  As a side note, has anyone thought to do any simple patter matching algorithms on those pulsating objects?  Experts always analyze their colors but never the patterns it seems.  There are many character sets, or alphanumeric encodings that may show that the objects possess intelligence or are trying to communicate.  Such as maybe listing primes or the Fibonacci series?<n>

We were driving east on Pa.route 23, going from about a mile east of Marietta, Pa,.to Silver Spring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to our left up high,we saw a light in the sky that seemed to be traveling in the same basic direction we were. I decided to follow it if I could.   At a certain point it, the light seemed to turn in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I decided to follow. I turned right on the Ironville Pike to see if I could follow it again, which I was, at least for a minute or so, until we lost sight of it.  We continued on the Ironville Pike to a cross-road or intersection, where we saw it again.  But now it was not moving.  It was hovering over the intersection or real close to it.  Maybe a hundred feet or so up in the air. It was real hard to judge distance.  But it was pretty darn close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled up almost directly under it, rolled down our windows and put our heads out and looked straight up at it.  It was big, real big, circular in shape with different colored lights on it, not flashing. And it was humming.  A real deep reverberating hum you could feel in your chest.  We watched it for a minute or two when it started to move in a westerly direction, slow at first, then it shot off at a very high rate of speed and dissapeared out of sight..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found out, guite a few years later, through a book about Lancaster Co, that someone else saw something very similar, about the same time, in just about the same location.

It was my first trip to california from the East Coast and I enjoyed watching the evening sunsets. The coast had been foggy for a couple of nights so on this particular night i sat on the beach with field glasses enjoying the ocean and approaching sunset. As the sun began to set i noticed a bright starlike object hovering near the horizon close to where the sun was setting. I took a look through the field glasses and noticed that the object seemed to be flikering much like a star but the center was dark. The object hovered for a time than suddenly began to ascend very fast. In short time it was out of view. The atmosphere seemed electric. I looked around to see if any one was on the beach with but i was alone. To this day i have no idea what i observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1975 is approximate.  PD))<n>

The rough year was 1975/1976.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFS sighted over/around Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. You will probably just say that this is junk, sorry I do not think so. Flying objects sighted for many days anad then they stopped. what proof do I have. very little. But here goes the old story(real), Cannon AFB had just installed floodlight poles around the flightline, it greatly assisted maintenance on the F-111D&#39;s at night. It lit up the flilghtline nicely for us, the ones who had to work in the dark to fix these jets. About that time the sightings started. I did not get to personnaly see them, dumb me, I didn&#39;t put out the effort to go out and see them, because they sounded so common of an experience, at that time. This is the main meat of the story, short and to the (dull) point. Additional information to assist in verification of my statement. I haven&#39;t dug into my old papers to prove this date to within one week. But the base paper &#34;Mach Meter&#34;  if you get an old copy carried the news about the lights being installed. next (if I remember as correct as possible) that the local news paper from Clovis New Mexico (near the Texas border, near lobbuck texas) ran a story about the UFS&#39;s seen in the night time sky. The rough year 1975-1976. My guess is that the visitors were interested in this big bright spot that reciently appeared on this planet. This is my guess. The base and town newspaper could be researched to verify the exact dates. Now to add some info that may seem to push the boundry some. Susposidely (I got from talking with others (crew chief-OMS)) that Blue section had launched a few sorties after the fly day had finished. I don&#39;t remember the quanity, about 3 to 6 jets, were launched LATE in the day/evening, or night if you wish, that is strange, ok, but another item being that at that particular time frame, blue section was the only jets that were capeable/fully functional (FMC) of firing their gun. ?? that is strange also. Note that the gun was not being used very much, IF ANY on MOST of the F-111&#39;s. Please do not release or print this part. Please. I worked ((Paragraph of personal career data deleted))<n>

My friends and I were playing in the field that we always played football in, in back of our houses. When we first saw this thing we kind of just tried to figure out what it was. One of my friends&#39; older friends son was a pilot of some sort and had a type of cb setup or such in his basement that the old woman would let us kids see, so my friend said he would try and see if its locator could tell us what was in the area at the time. Everyone but me took off for dinner, and I just wanted to wait for my other friend to come back and tell me what it was. Everyone said our parents wouldnt believe us anyway, so whats the use? It was just hovering like over me and kept changing shapes, and one minute you could see it clearly and the next it would fade in and out. I thought they were all chicken-shits, and tomboy that I am I just studied it. My friend was taking too long, yet it was like it could tell I wasnt afraid of it and it didnt really want me to tell anyone. Then it backed up like a zoom and vanished. None of us ever said a word except me, it was like no one else remembered or something, and it was very strange. As it moved though, I remember that it did change not only its looks but shape and color of its windows also. I did not see any aliens or anything looking out, but when it was almost transparent, I still knew it was there and sometimes you could see an outline of sorts. There seemed to be a crystal kind of effect in there whan it was changing almost like it could radiate electricity of info that was bouncing on it or off it, like it could absorb info like that. And the windows sometimes went around the body in a certain shape fast then slow, slow then fast, and extremely fast at that. And those colors were like they werent really there either, like they were playing with them or making them up as they went until they got it right. Maybe they just liked the game we were playing and wanted to analize why we were. And maybe the lights were our score....or t! heir excitement, or that I was not afraid. I did not at any time feel afraid of them either, it was like I knew or should know who they were, or why they came to see me? I only know that just recently I have had the pleasure to see them up close checking me out in my sleep. And when I felt their presence I awoke to see a connect the dots kind of starman bending over me, and then a smaller one walking towards him, touching his arm telling him it was time to go now, and they did. I wish I knew if this was real. There is no history of anything weird in my family on both sides, and my friends will not talk about it further. When I mention it they sort of go blank and act like I never mentioned it. That is bizarre! Well, I hope that someday, when I go wherever it is we go &amp; if we do, that I find out instead of just dwindling into the vast universe with no answer either. That would suck. Thanks for looking at this, enjoy, and I hope others can be there with me if they do seem to be nice....C-Ya  Me   P.S. Till this day it is like I still dont believe it myself what I saw like I am deprogrammed or jumbled or something like that &amp; it feels weird to recall or try to but at the same time is still fresh in my memory- just plain wierd feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have estimated the date, but know it was about lunch time that day because my mother was making lunch for us.  (I don&#39;t know if you care much for childhood memories, but I remember it like it was yesterday.)  We lived on a small farm and our nearest neighbor was about 1/4 mile down the road. I am the oldest of 6 children.  On this summer day we were all outside playing kickball.  I went back to the fence to chase down the ball when a silver flying saucer hovering over my neighbors barn caught my eye.  As soon as I saw it, three legs came out of the underside of the saucer and it floated down to the ground behind our neighbors barn where I assume it landed.  I called all of my brothers and sisters to watch, figuring it would have to take back off again.  While waiting, I ran inside to get my mother, but she dismissed me as a child making up a story and did not care to come see for herself.  I ran back to the fence where my younger brothers were getting bored and had given up on waiting to see it.  Only myself and my two oldest siblings waited long enough (about 15 - 20 minutes) when we did indeed see the craft take off again.  It raised up above the barn, retracted its legs, and shot off over the tree horizon very fast.  The craft was silver with a dome on top and was shaped like a saucer.  It was witnessed in good light during the day and with good weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Like the Northbrook, Illinois incident I witnessed a vehicle hit an invisible object.  I was sitting at a stop light with one other car that was directly across from me, also waiting for the light to change.  I heard a crash and looked up to see a car that was traveling from right to left had come to a complete stop just short of the intersection.   Steam was spewing from the radiator and it had a large dent in the grill.  It was like the car hit a pole but there was no pole.  I saw nothing that could have caused this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I knew the light had changed and I proceeded through the intersection slowly.  It felt like a dream and I was just along for the ride.  I remember starring at that car and even looking over at the other car that was proceeding through the intersection across from me.  Very strange was the thought in my head that said &#34;keep going.&#34;  Not an audible sound but more like a thought.  What makes it so weird is that I was a Vietnam vet and knew how to react to all kinds of stressful incidents but found myself just as an observer and unable to react.  I never reported that accident to anyone and that was also strange because I was a Security Policeman in the Air Force and worked with the Arizona State Troopers and the California Highway Patrol with accidents involving military personnel.  I was no stranger to accidents and accident reports but never reported this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I’ve felt badly that I didn’t help that poor person explain the weird accident to the police but who’d believe such a thing?  I have told very few people about this but who would?   I saw a car hit an “invisible” object!!  Reading about the poor lady from Illinois brought back this memory and I truly sympathize with her.  I’m almost glad that I haven’t been the only person to experience such a weird event.<n>

It was mid-afternoon or so.  I noticed a silver disk directly over head where the Sun would be at noon time.  It was very high up.  If you saw a dime about 15 Feet from you, that would be the size it looked in the air. It may have actually been about the size of a small plane.  The Afternoon sun shined on it and it was clearly a silver disk, or baloon shaped object. It didn&#39;t move for as long as we (my family and I) looked at it. My mother dismissed it as a weather balloon. But this was a warm summer day, no clouds at all. Completely blue skies. Why send up a weather balloon? Also, balloons drift with the air currents. This object didn&#39;t drift at all. In fact, it stayed exactly in one spot. We looked at it for about 10 minutes, and then went back into the house. We didn&#39;t see it leave. Witnesses were my mother, a nursing proffessor at the University of Iowa, myself, and my brother who was about 13 at the time. It was too high to be a teathered balloon. Plus it was directly over the town, can&#39;t have a teather over a town with an airport. Not a blimp either. Too high and stationary. Not a plane, it didn&#39;t move at all. Not a weather aberation. It was a warm cloudless day. Blue skies only. It was definately there. silver object, shining in the bright sun against blue skies. No movement. Totally silent. Not as high as the commercial jets, but higher than small craft. Again, definately not a blimp, too high and too perfectly round. Stationary for over  10 minutes. Wish I knew what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I could not estimate the size or altitude of the object, but it was a light blue color and globular.  It seemed to glow and the intensity would fluctuate as it moved along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been in the USAF and around aircraft for many years, I saw that this was definitely not a conventional aircraft, neither fixed wing nor rotor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it reached a point over the Mule mountains to the southwest, over the Bisbee/Ft Huachuca area, it stopped and just hung there. A couple of minutes later it started to move sporadically back and forth over that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back inside the station and rang Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson on our interphone line requesting them to verify a target at that location.  Davis-Monthan confirmed a target over Ft Huachuca, and their height-finder radar indicated an altitude &#34;above 90,000 feet&#34;.  The size of the object as it appeared, and at that altitude, must have been huge.  Davis-Monthan scrambled 2 F4&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back outside and in minutes could see, approaching from the northwest, two aircraft moving towards the object and the glowing trails of their afterburners going full bore told me it was the F4s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the aircraft were approximately 10 or 20 miles from the object, it suddenly zoomed away at high speed towards the southwest and disappeared over the mountain horizon, leaving the F4s orbiting around the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only imagine what the pilots were saying to each other.  They then headed northwest towards Tucson.  Davis-Monthan had checked with the base at White Sands Proving Grounds to verify if a weather baloon had been launched recently.  They had not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When Davis-Monthan called back for more information, I told them jokingly...&#34;congratulations, you just confirmed a UFO&#34;.  They were not amused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have any other inquiries from either the Air Force people nor our FAA.  A couple of days later I learned of the new UFO Reporting Center in Seattle.  I called them and told them the story and never heard from them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were driving on a rough forest track from Newborough in Anglesey, to Llanddwyn beach. It was late Summer and it was about 6 pm in the early evening. There is a lot of airforce association with this part of the UK, and we were not far away from military No Go sites. Lots of the beachhead further along is used by the Airforce.Suddenly out of the blue, came a very large triangular shaped object, and I could see that it was very low over the trees and was obviously following us. It made no sound, and there were red lights flashing around its edge. It stayed with us until we reached the beach and then it shot off along the beach and disappeared. The next day I telephoned the R.A.F station and they said that they would come back to me once they had checked if there were any planes about at that time.They did come back to me, and there was not anything that they knew about in that area at that time. They confirmed that it was a UFO, and that other people had phoned in to say that there were sightings over Bangor city through that particular week. The 2nd time I saw a UFO was in 1975, and this was on a particlarly stormy evening. I was out with my small son and our dog, taking a walk on the mountain track that lay to the rear of our house. Suddenly I saw a cigar shaped object hovering over a large aerial that was on top of the mountain.Even though the wind was very bad and there were black storm clouds the object was static in the sky over this mast. I believe that the aerial or mast is used for radio and TV signals. The object then shot straight upwards at fantastic speed and disappeared out of my sight.<n>

There was a period of approximately one week in which lights appeared over the base for several evenings.  At one point the base was on alert and the flight line was shut down.  You have a report from another person in your files who has reported this sighting.  The lights were photographed from high buildings in Clovis and appeared on the front page of the Clovis news paper.  Being assigned to the flight line in support of F-111s several of my people reported near encounters with the lights (ufos and were visably shaken by the experience.  There was also the experience at Holloman AFB in 1967 when aircraft were launched to intercept lights over Alamogordo, NM.  The official report was that the lights were aircraft dropping flares.  This is a bunch of crap as Lincoln National Forest was on high fire danger at the time.  Having talked with at least one pilot who confirmed that they tried to chase the (UFOS) but never got close, I know that a lot of people in the USAF have had their experiences.  Some will talk and some won&#39;t.  These are but 2 of the numerous sightings I have witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
