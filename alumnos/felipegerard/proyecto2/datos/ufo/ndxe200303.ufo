The crash took place in the small town of Menstrie where the emergence services were present.  The whole event has been played down but several local sightings of strange lights in the night sky round about the time of the crash have already been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received no other corroborating reports of the alleged incident.  We presume the source implies an evening event; we have amended the indicated time above.  PD))<n>

I dont deny that I have an interest in UFO&#39;s (who shouldn&#39;t? / i have a mind that enjoys a puzzle) and have seen several strange things in my life.   UFO&#39;s to me, are fascinating, they do &#34;exactly what they say on the tin&#34; - THEY ARE OBJECTS THAT FLY (OR LAND) THAT CAN BE SEEN, AND ARE UNIDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN CRAFT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well thats-that out of my system, I am actually posting this due to my experience this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its currently 2.27am here in Loanhead (near Edinburgh Scotland)and is testiment to the fact that something DID appear in the sky near my home earlier tonight.  As it happened I was visiting my mum (Its was Mothers Day 30/03 here in the UK, my mum lives 5 mins from my house).  Me and my mum were chatting and she decided to show me a room in her house she had recently decorated, while upstairs we looked out of the rear window overlooking the Moorfoot Hills looking towards Gorebridge when we noticed what I thought was a firework fairly high in the not so distant sky.  We both looked at it, and I soon realised that the &#34;firework&#34;; was more like a flare, as the extremely bright pink glow did not fade at all; as it stayed stationary in the sky approx 1 mile away. Slowly, but still glowing bright pink, the object floated slowly to the ground and passed behind the dark horizon of our line of sight(there are fields and a valley, all of which were in complete darkness at that time of the evening).  I sat and spoke to my mum for a few minutes about it and then what appeared to be a very bright blue flashing light - like the type on a police car - roughly in the same direction. I must point out that to me the blue light did not seem all that unusual, it did really just seem like a blue &#34;earthly light&#34; flashing brighty in the distance.  But the previous Pink light was far from that, we originally thought it may have been a helicopter but we realised that it was completely silent.  All lasted around 20 secs, but was definately something we had never seen before.<n>

It just flew right past my apartment. I had seen it in the past along with everyone else and didn&#39;t know what it is until tonight. I got a really good look at it. It was about 40 feet from my balcony.  I&#39;m sorry guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC has received several reports about the objects in the vicinity of Burbank, and many claims as to what they are.  However, if they are, indeed, pyrotechnic devices, then the officials in the area should make an effort, we believe, to apprehend whoever it is who is launching the alleged &#34;hot air balloons.&#34;  There may have been many of them that have been launched since December 2002, and they pose a significant fire risk, we believe.  It is unclear to us that they are, in fact, pyrotechnic devices, and we note that no one has taken the time to photograph the objects.  PD))<n>

It was moving very slow with no noise. I was looking to see if it was going to appear from around my tree but it vanished in thin air.

I wiped off the window so my friend could see better in the dark and as I did so I noticed a very bright falling light.  My father having been an airforce man I know when it&#39;s a plane and when it&#39;s not.  I saw that the light was falling straight down at a very rapid speed and the light didn&#39;t flash at all.  The windows were rolled up so I couldn&#39;t tell if it had a sound or not.  Toward the last few seconds the object turned a bright red, fading into a yellowish orange, then to a bright green before disappearing over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We couldn&#39;t see the body at first because of the lights.  As it flew over us the lights were pointing forward and we got a better look at the body.  the front part of the body was almost triangualar shaped.

We went for a late evening walk in Point Pleasnt Park here in Halifax. The woods were dark and the air cold but calm. As we came about a corner of the walking trail we were on, over the horizon of the north west sky we noticed an odd light in the sky about a kilometer away from us and nearly the size of a large star. We stood nearby for about 5 minutes as it came closer to us and as it did, different colors came visible on the shell of the craft. Blue, Red and Green colors swirrled around the outside of this thing. Not much of a sound came out of it due to the sound of the Harbour and cars in the distant. Although the craft was a defined &#34;X&#34; shape it moved slowly across the sky up untill it hit the shore and shot off at a acceleration that we had never seen before. Blue light was seen in its speed across the sky, its trail. Though this is not the first UFO sighting I have seen, Its the most odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my location which is on University Drive facing west, this star looked to be somewhere over the everglades.  We both continued to watch this star change color and going from being bright to dim and then bright again, we watched for almost 10 full minutes before it just faded out.  I have only recently began to observe our sky more closely but i have never seen star do such things in all my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses may have observed, but we believe that a twinkling star, or the landing light on an approaching airliner, would be the first possibilities to be ruled out.

The sun is barely out and theres enough light where there are no stars. so I though it was a holicopter or plane but both have multi-lights that flash and this had non. I watched it and it looked as it was completely still. After watching for a couple of minutes I could see it was slowely moving up and to the left toward downtown Albuquerque. It looks as if its moved a couple hundred feet up in altitude. Its just a little white light. Like what you would see as a star but it moves. I am not sure if its a UFO because it has not moved erratic or fast. It maybe a hot air balloon, they fly them here but I dont know of they have lights on them or if they do if they are that brigth to see that high. Its 6:00 Am and I just lost eyesight of it because the sun is out more and blocking its light. The object was in the direction of Kirkland Air Force Base. Please let me know what you think or find out. Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in the possibilities of UFO&#39;s but I must rule out natural explanations first.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I kept on watching and it just disappeared like it turned off its lights.  About 1 minute later it the light came back in the same place and started to flash.  Then one more light right next to it showed up.  It once again disappeared, after a little bit it came back and this time there were 3 balls of lights and they are started flashing and it disappeared and I ran to go get my friend and when I got back it was gone and I stayed outside a while to look for it but I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were about ten minutes flight time away from St. Louis heading west, flying at about 30,000ft. I was gazing out the window on the plane when I noticed something like markings in the sky. It looked as if someone had taken a pencil and drawn a line in the sky. From my perspective the dark black line was about two centimeters in length, but there&#39;s no telling what distance it was from us. I woke up the passenger sitting next to me on the flight to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things. He saw it too, but shrugged it off saying, &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s pretty strange.&#34; I didn&#39;t know what to do so I simply watched it for a bit longer. A second one appear right above it around that same time. Within 10 minutes, they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder if the witness was observing the shadow cast by the contrail behind a jet aircraft.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

We crossed over a railroad crossing and I noticed a bright light that I had never seen before shining through the trees.  We came to a clearing and saw an aircraft gliding through the sky very quickly.  I stopped the car to watch.  The craft was at the height of a low flying helicopter and didn&#39;t make a sound.  At one point it was hovering almost directly ontop of us, as if it was watching us as we were watching it.  We continued to watch the craft for approximately 3-5 minutes.  A car was coming behind us so we decided to leave as the UFO began to glide out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued south on the same road for about 30 seconds when we saw another one.  It was so far away that it looked like a bright star but it gradually came closer to where it glided directly ontop of us again.  I parked the car one last time to watch.  We stayed for about two minutes because we were freaked out and because it seemed that the craft lowered in the trees behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped at a stop light about a half mile away from the incident.  At the same time my friend and I heard a noise that I can&#39;t describe in writing.  All I can say is that it sounded like sound a UFO made on the cartoon Scooby-Doo.  Trust me it wasn&#39;t the stop light either.  We heard the sound one more time about another half mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really dark out that night so it was hard to say what the exact shape of the craft was.  A disk or saucer shape is the closest comparision I can make.  There were white lights around the outside and about three blue lights in the center.  I would say that both crafts had the same description.  We had a better view with the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My wife was in our vehicle with me when we both saw an extremely shiny metallic-looking object flying northward about one mile ahead of us. The object was traveling at about 400-500 mph (based on my experience as a licensed airplane pilot) about 200 feet above the tree tops. It was difficult for me to determine a distinct shape, but my wife, who had more time to observe the object because I was driving, said it was cone-shaped or bullet-shaped. The object traveled in a straight line and at constant altitude until it was no longer visible over the tree-lined horizon after observing it for about 10 seconds. We heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It&#39;s a small window that you can&#39;t really see out of, but it had  screen in front of it so you could hear things outside.  It was totally quiet and then I heard some scuddling in the bushes like a small animal or something, so I erased it from my memory quickly.  Just a small animal... Then I heard a noise, and the only way I can describe it was that it sounded like the clicking made by the aliens in the movie &#34;Signs&#34;.  Now I know that it was just a movie, but no animal or human can make those noises like I heard.  It made these noises for about 5 seconds and then stopped.  I was kind of scared, so to make sure that it wasn&#39;t a small animal, I clapped my hands together hard two times expecting to hear something scuddle away, but there was nothing.  I was home alone, so I closed the window quick and called my grandmother to come and stay with me for a while.  Could this be something worth talking about?<n>

The craft looked like it was totally stainless steel, had no visible windows and when tilted I could see the whole tail edge was lit with a very bright light (like the lights of a night baseball game} there were no clouds in the sky and the craft just disappeared in one second though it was no more than a half mile away.  There was no sound from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *note about five years ago while driving at night in Carlsbad my wife and I saw a bright comet like fireball emitting splashes of bright light to its rear travelling about 50 mph in a southeasterly direction towards Rancho Sante Fe going cross country following the contours of the land.

Two of them, they were going so slow, it was easy to see the shape and the back thrusters.  As they came over the trees about 6 small objests just spilled out over the trees. They had lights, blinking they were very slow so that the jet seemed to stall over them.  They kept moving out, the jet just went over them.  Then another jet came by faster, there  was another light flashing, this object was larger and able to go faster.  The smaller objects came to a point in the sky stopped.  Then they just went up. I know this sounds scifi.  This has happened many times.  When they rise to a point in the sky they might look like a star.  Then they have red, white, green/blue lights that seem to pulse.  I CANNOT TYPE OUT WHAT ALL I HAVE SEEN.  I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH STRANGE STUFF.  I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND WHY NO ONE ELSE HAS  SEEN THIS.  THOSE JETS KNOW ABOUT IT.

The witness said the craft was seen just above the clouds after it broke into a clearing in the night sky. He described the object as being very large, black, triangular in shape with three points of light on each of the objects tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also noted about the object was that it moved very fast and was totally silent and went on to say he couldn&#39;t hear a thing. (no noise coming from the object) The craft was flying roughly east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if the witness might give me some kind of idea just how high the object was off the ground). Again he said it was just above the ceiling (cloud cover). He also went on to tell me that he had checked with the weather channel to see what the ceiling would have been and was told it was at approx: 11,000 feet. The object was seen just above the ceiling as it broke into the clear sky. (HBCC UFO Note: I wanted to get some kind of idea where the witness was located at the time, as I know the Coquitlam very well as this is where I grew up. He was located around the Coquitlam side, or shadow of Burnaby Mountain and said the object was seen somewhere close, or  flying over the 401 Freeway. He told me he was so shocked at what he was seeing, plus the size of it. The fellow said one could have placed or spread three jumbo jets into the object easily. The object was witnessed for approx: 3 to 4 seconds in total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gentleman&#39;s parting words to me was that it freaked him right out !!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

I saw a bright object appear out the corner of my eye, and it was not the moon, but it was about one half that size.  It looked like a cloud of smoke with white light shining from within it.  The lights and &#34;smoke&#34; moved around, constantly shifting its shape.  The object held its position high in the eastern sky for approximately 1-2 seconds.  It quickly moved to the south a short distance, stopped and changed course several times before flying west at a incredible speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 20-year-old server at a restaraunt and he is a  college educated 31-year-old construction worker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion, the object was watching us.  When the object noticed we were watching it,it spastically moved and flew away into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object/light was not a reflection of light on the cloud, like a beacon.  It was coming from within or behind the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident lasted approximately 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not talk about this until we returned from our trip three days later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were driving From Longview, WA to Sandpoint, ID on a snowboard trip and I was the passenger in the car.  I noticed a blurry blue/white object holding a position at high noon (high in the eastern sky).  I assume it had moved into that position rapidly, as I was startled into staring skyward suddenly.  I moved my head up and down and side to side rapidly to make sure that I was not seeing a reflection on the inside of the car&#39;s windshield.  I became startled and awed as the the object, a slightly pulsating butterfly/sphere held it&#39;s position for approximately 1.5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver, noticing my head movements, looked skyward at the object and said, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;  I resonded, &#34;Yes.&#34;  The objects size appeared to be massive.  It was about one-half the size of the moon.  It was behind a whispy cloud, and an electric blue light was visibly pulsating, much like the model atom I have seen with two electrons rapidly rotating around the nucleus.  The object appeared to be creating its own black cloud to shield the light I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was deeply awed and scared at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object spastically moved five degrees to the south, then northeast, then up to create a tight triangle type movement.  It then shaked spastically once again and flew away rapidly directly (west) over our heads.  I have never seen anything move like that.  I assume it should be impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt a keen sense that this object was observing me as I observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment I panicked and my heart jumped into my throat, was the same moment the object spastically moved and flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order for that object, which moved away rapidly later, to hold its position it is safe to assume it was observing our car.  It was the only thing visibly moving at 3:50 am on a country highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the driver and I have never witnessed anything like this object, ever.

I was sitting outside of my Kenny street home at approx: 2-3 in the morning having a smoke. When I looked up at the stars I noticed a large bright light. I didn&#39;t thing anything of it until it went underneath the clouds. That is when I freaked out and ran inside. Please e-mail me ASAP with or without info about this. Thanx.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: A little more information on the sighting below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you so much for e-mailing me back. When I was watching the light I did not notice any strange movements. It just went horizontally across the sky. I have no idea how high it was, like I said it went underneath the clouds. It was the same height the whole time. But I know that planes don&#39;t fly underneath the clouds, especially at 2-3 in the morning. I didn&#39;t watch it for long. When I saw it I got scared and ran inside. Sorry if this is not much help. If I can help in any other way please e-mail me at .

Because the sky was very clear in that evening and there were only a few lights around, it was perfect for watching the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:00pm, I happened to look into the sky, there was suddenly an ellipse-shaped dim object flying from Northwest to Southeast with very high speed along an almost straight line. I immediately told my friend ((name deleted)), so she saw the same thing flied to and disappeared in the further Southeast too. The total time for the object’s appearance was about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only two or three seconds later, when we were still looking at the sky and wondering what we had seen, another ellipse-shaped dim object was seen flying from West to East with about the same speed and same straight line, which made an angle of 25-30 degree across the line the first one made. Both of us saw both of the objects clearly and surely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although they looked gray, bright, outstanding in the dark sky, there were no flashes from these two objects, and they seemed much higher and flied much faster than normal planes. So they should not be planes or helicopters. We suspected that these objects were UFOs based on our analysis. If anyone happened to see the same thing on the same date, we are very interested in knowing the details in order to confirm our thoughts and make to report to pertinent Agency.<n>

(The parade had not started yet and there were at least 200 people in the parking lot preparing for the parade etc. which goes down route 5)  At the time it was overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the woods behind the shopping center there emerged three black orbs. At first I thought they were balloons.They were like liquid metallic quivering spheres and black as the night sky. They were floating or flying as if controlled.  They stayed together but weren&#39;t attached.  At one point they hovered together in one area for maybe 30 seconds then accelerated across the sky to the east so fast I&#39;d say faster then a jet.<n>

I am slow in reporting this, but after seeing the info concerning the objects(spheres of light)sighted in Mexico, I felt compelled to write about what I had witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night/early morning of my sighting was the night we invaded Iraq. I had been on the computer most of the night talking with friends and following links about what was happening world wide. I was upset about the war,and at about 1:30 I finally turned the computer off and walked out onto my back deck, which faces directly South. As I stood there breathing in the cool night air, I was looking up at the sky, just thinking about the war and such. Over to my right,Southwest, at about 50 degrees, I saw a trail(pieces)of fire shooting off to my right into the night sky. My first thought, someone is shooting off a flare of some sort? (I live in the country miles from town and city lights)...then directly in front of me 90 degrees, between two large leafless oak trees, Two side by side orbs or spheres of light came on...they just seemed to turn on....if you held two 24&#34; peices of circular paper at arms length, that was how large they appeared in the sky. They seemed very close, or were extremely large. I have seen planes with their landing lights come over before, but, these spheres of light were nothing like that. They were perfectly spaced(like headlights)...the light was a pale white/greenish yellow, a non color really...and there was no illumination coming from the light...I stood there just staring at them, wondering how long would they last,what were they...they were not moving, there was no sound coming from them...then just as quietly as they had turned on, they turned off. Fading to the blackness of the sky. I stood there for maybe 10 minutes or more to see if something else might happen. Nothing did. The next day I asked a friend who was in the military if he had ever heard of government flares of that sort, he told me no, he never had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for letting me post this.

We will contact him to inquire on that point.  He has forwarded a still photo to NUFORC, which indicates two parallel light-colored strips of light against the dark night sky, and the (apparent) length of which is approximately equal to the (apparent) diameter of a full Moon.  We do not know what the objects are, or what caused the light-colored strips of light.  PD))<n>
3/22/03 00:30|Iraq (southern)||Flash|several minutes|Unexplained lights over Marine armored column in southern Iraq|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37095.html|46|ndxe200303| Unexplained lights over Marine armored column in southern Iraq<n> <n><n> <n><n> During assault into Iraq, March 2003, I was a member of the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. After the initial attack into Az Zubayr (near Basra) my Regiment re-assembled for the movement to Nasariya, about 22 March (the war was very chaotic and I did not keep a journal as things were so hectic). We formed along the highway and started movement well after dark, 2100 or so. As an armored vehicle commander (AAV) my duties had me in the turret searching for threats/targets as we proceeded along the highway at about 20 mph. I had a pair of NVG&#39;s (night vision goggles) to aid my night vision and needless to say my crew and I were very alert and nervous/excited with the start of combat a few days earlier. I soon started to notice pulses of dull orange light in the night sky which could be seen with the naked eye. They would trace an arc and pulse in intensity like a flare but would give off very little light (unlike an illumination flare) and the really curious thing was that when observed through NVG&#39;s they still gave off very little light. NVG&#39;s amplify natural and infra red light very intensly and I could not understand what it might be. My crew saw these lights as well and we agreed none of us had ever seen anything like it in training (new weapon?... if so, whose?) I called it over the net (radio) to the command vehicle and they acknowledged they could see them as well and did not know what they were. These continued one after another all night and seemed to be close aboard. The obvious reaction was that they were some form of illumination being used by the Iraqi&#39;s but I should mention that the surrounding area was desolate arid desert with little place to hide and hardly any terrain features for miles. We encountered no resistance whatsoever during the movement, and so no enemy to explain the source. There was no sound that could be heard though the engine noise would have made that difficult. What I found to be really curious was that nobody seemed to care though it obviously! implied some sort of weapon or device was being used and it was not ours. The airspace over the Marine advance was tightly controlled to avoid friendly fire and we saw plenty of helicopters to know the difference. These were to be seen on later nights as well during our push on Baghdad and it got so that we stopped reporting it at all as we would any enemy contact. I never got an explanation though the Regimental Staff was part of my column and all the officers I asked could not explain it either. Again, these lights would move in  slow shallow arcs like small orange balls that would glow brighter then dull and then brighter again. These would pulse maybe 5 or 10 times then disappear and soon another would be seen in a different direction. These were noticed with the naked eye and did not look any different with night vision goggles (?). They were seen only up in the air and did not seem to fall to earth and seemed relativly close by. I should also mention that we were all obviously sober and awake and very alert. On that first night in particular they were seen during most of the movement, 8 to 10 hours along 150 miles of desert highway. The night sky seemed clear enough to make out the stars some of the time but not a lot of moonlight to aid night vision. There was no noticeable effect or purpose to these lights to explain them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Just before this  sign I just happen to look  on the left side of highway where there look like alot of trees and maybe homes too, I&#39;m not sure if this was a residential area or a  wooded  area. It happen so fast I just remember the trees because I saw a fire ball falling down between the trees (like a falling star) then as it falls it start to changed in color and shape.  It changed from a hot pink to a lime green color or visa versa and a almond shaped appeared as it seems to collide or land.  I screamed LOOK !  But no one else in the car saw it.  The next sign I saw was the Lake of the Ozarks so that I could remember where this happen at.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked like red/orange, blue and white.  I went and got 2 of my students to make sure I wasn&#39;t seeing things.  They saw the same thing I did.  I got my camera, mount it on the trypod and took a few shots.  I have not gotten them developed yet. I&#39;m not sure how clear they are.  I took several shots with different time lapses.  The craft only moved slightly everyonce in a while, but kept blinking the whole time.  I unfortunately had to go into bed.  I saw the object over Clermont,FL, I was on the 3rd story of the dorm and could see the night sky clearly.  (I will ge the images developed very soon) !!!!<n>

Then a girl at my bus stop came over and I said &#34;Look up in the sky!&#34; before she could even look up it zoomed so far i couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It was going at such an intense speed It is still un-comprehendable to me. The girl never saw it because it zoomed before she got a view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/19/03 21:25|Parma|OH|Triangle|10 minutes|Triangular craft, from the front you only saw white light, almost invisible in the sky, pyramid characteristics|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96784.html|52|ndxe200303| Triangular craft, from the front you only saw white light, almost invisible in the sky, pyramid characteristics<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 19th, 2003, I, like many other Americans, was watching the U.S. bombing of Baghdad on CNN.   At approximately 21:25 my 2 year old nephew (whom I was babysitting), came running in from the dining room yelling, &amp;quot;Amu! Amu!&amp;quot;, his word for airplane.   Being excited he drug me by my finger into the dining room to look at the plane out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I said, &amp;quot;Yeah, airplane.&amp;quot;  All I saw was a seemingly perfectly round ball of white light in the distance.  After a few moments of staring, waiting for the light to move, I realized that something didn&#39;t seem right, this did not seem like an airplane.  It didn&#39;t seem like it was moving at all.  I thought at first that I was letting my mind wander or that my eyes were playing tricks on me because it seemed as if the light was getting slightly larger by the minute but not moving.  I then felt (not really thought but felt [I know it sounds strange]) like the light was getting bigger because it was moving closer.  I was literally frozen in fear, staring at this light trying to figure out what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began looking around, taking mental notes of the surroundings.  This light was lower than the radio towers, but higher than the tree tops.  I cannot describe the feeling that overcame me staring at this light any other way than &amp;quot;primal fear&amp;quot;.  It was a gut-wrenching, nauseating feeling that told your brain to run but you can&#39;t go anywhere because you&#39;re in the house.  I called my father on the house phone and told him to look out of his back window towards my aunt&#39;s house (my parents lived approximately 3 miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him about the light, and I told him that if he looked to the south to the right of the radio tower he might be able to see it.  He couldn&#39;t see it.  I got up the nerve to go back to the window and when I looked out,  I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  My dad convinced me to go outside and look around to see if I could find it and tell him where it was.  I reluctantly picked up my nephew and carried him onto the back porch with me.  I looked in all four compass directions and didn&#39;t see the light.  Then I looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the house (I cannot begin to estimate height....I just know that it appeared that if it were any closer it would take off the roof of the house) I saw a huge triangular craft.  The white light that I had been seeing was on the very front tip of the craft.  There were two more lights on the back corners of the craft.  There were no visible windows or doors and there was absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, no sound.  The craft appeared to have perfect lines &amp;quot;dissecting&amp;quot; it, similar to a pyramid.  The color was as close to a perfect match to the color of the sky as possible, without being the sky itself.  I truly believe that the only reason I was able to see it was because of the street lights adding extra light to the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood on the back porch telling my dad what I was seeing, yelling at him when he said he couldn&#39;t see it, &amp;quot;How can you not see it?!  It couldn&#39;t be any bigger!&amp;quot;  This craft appeared (I keep saying appeared and seemed because it was in the sky, I can only guess by the visual markers I had on the ground) to reach from halfway over the house to halfway through the yard, and seemed to be moving extremely slowly.  I stood there looking up at it for approximately 1-2 minutes as it took that long for it too completely pass over the house.  As the tail end began crossing the roof I ran into the house, set my nephew down, and ran out onto the front porch so that I could keep track of where it was, hoping that my father would be able to see it now.  As I reached the front porch, I realized it was gone.  I ran into the yard and nothing.  It was absolutely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still wonder if it was really gone or if I just couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  While standing under it, like I said it was practically the color of the sky, it appeared to have something in it&#39;s coloring that allowed it to &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; color or reflect the surrounding light to allow it to camouflage itself completely into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and spoke the following day with a friend that was a longtime member of the Air Force.  He had posters of every known military air craft.  I asked him if he knew of any practice runs over the area that might not be public knowledge, etc. and he did not.  Together we went through every picture he had and could not find it.  The most astounding part to him was the fact that there was absolutely no sound emitted, not even a hum or a buzz.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (To note, there were no visible windows or doors on the craft.  Also the craft was moving south to north.  I will never forget what I saw that night, but have finally decided to report it.  I don&#39;t talk about it much and I had no idea until tonight that there was actually a place you could go to report your sightings.   There was another (different) incident approximately 5 years later at my parents&#39; house; however, that experience will not be disclosed in this report.

I told my friends and they looked up, 2 of them said it was a jet or aeroplane, but it didn&#39;t have any tail, no wings, or any trail. Plus after about 3 seconds it zoomed off with incredible speed. My friends said it was just a jet, but one of my friends and I don&#39;t think so.

When it caught his attention he watched the light heading in a northwesterly direction, from his location towards the south end of Williston Lake. His thoughts were that whatever it was, was a meteor as he said he sees a number of them while working in so many darkened hours. What the witness found strange about the sighting was before the light disappeared it changed direction slightly. After this change in it&#39;s flight path, he said it was gone. Just vanished. The sighting lasted approx: no more than 3 to 4 seconds. At arms length he said the light may have been the size of a pea. No sound was heard coming from the light, but this would be no surprise anyway due to him being in the cab of his truck, and they can be rather noisy. He wondered if I had any other reports of this type on the day. (HBCC UFO Note: I am not aware of any other reports from the area where this took place, but if anyone should have had a sighting on the day in question, and around the time provided above I would appreciate hearing from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

But it was not the reflection from the moon as it was suggested. When I viewed it, over, over and over again it looked to me as if there was another type of light source which caused &#34;it&#34; to show up on the film. Looks like I was right at least on this one.

What it shows is the Moon, in which they were filming in the first place. But then something else showed up on the film after they brought the cam, and tape back inside to view. They sat down to watch what they took and noticed an orange colored light around the Moon. As it was cloudy out, which can be seen clearly in the video clip, this light seems to bounce around on the film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sat and watched it for a while, and I am thinking that the &#34;light&#34; may be from some other light source, &#34;earthly&#34;. But  I am no expert at breaking down a clip from a tape. Why I am thinking this light may be of an earthly origin, is due to the movment of the cam at the time, and the light moving with the cam, or the Moon which was being filmed at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I having the video clip checked out and I am sure this should help in finding out what this light is.

I yelled &#34;UFO&#34; and got my partner to watch it as I ran for my camera.  The object was about 100-13-feet away.  It looked oval with an underneath part which revolved and had a pink/red flashing light.   It looked tatty, black, and the two ends of the oval almost flapped like the fins of a manta ray would move.  It was a clumsy looking object though and just seemed to float. I went out my front door with the camera but the object was a dot in the sky by then, I started clicking anyway. For that couple of minutes there was no traffic and the street seemed quiet.  I ran across to the neighbours house and watched it with two more people.   One of them said it was a kid&#39;s balloon because he could see the string.   He&#39;d only been watching it for a minute and had rushed outside for a look when he saw me running with my camera.   I didn&#39;t tell him it came out from the side of his house and that it was the size of a car when I first saw it.   It was not kid&#39;s balloon.<n>

This anomaly was sh|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98802.html|59|ndxe200303| The convoy commander relayed over the radio that we were ready to move.  I jumped in my truck, and welcomed aboard Private ((name deleted)), my co-driver also known as my battle buddy.  I remember it was a quiet and slow ride, but then I seen that this HUMMV drifted ahead with speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance between our vehicles was increasing.  It only took seconds to get to the point when I wasn&#39;t able to see them at all.  I remember feeling terrified, because all I seen around was just darkness and we were on this cliff rolling downwards towards the end of the bridge.  I had no idea how or where those roads led, so I slowly released my foot off the gas, held down on the clutch and allowed my vehicle to roll, attempting to keep the wheel at what I considered straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden my tractor jilted downwards fast as if my truck fell into a deep hole and my truck started to sway from left to right beyond my control, then it stopped.  My tanker full of fuel was creaking as if it was leaning.  I learned we were leaning in like a see-saw position as I glanced over to my frightened battle and seen she sat higher than me.  The unevenness in the cab of my tractor gave me a clue that we were leaning off the cliff!  This same cliff that had a significant drop!  We both sat solid in the truck beyond terrified because we knew we were about to die without a doubt. We both didn&#39;t even want to talk, we just stared.  The emotions of my battle filled me with sorrow and I was too stuck in fright to tell her that it will be ok.  The sad thing is I remember the only sentence she said was, &amp;quot;I love you battle, at least we won&#39;t have a long death, it&#39;ll be quick because we&#39;re going to hit rock bottom too fast.&amp;quot;  We laughed, but it seemed as though our tiny fake giggles made the movement of the truck worse.  I had no idea where the convoy was behind us because I couldn&#39;t hear anything.  We were definitely not about to make a move and turn around to see.  So we sat still wi! th no other choice but to ready ourselves for death.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we then witnessed was out of this world and would require you to actually be there to believe it.  As I stated earlier we were driving vehicles that were used in Desert Storm, and that my tractor trailer was a stick shift.  The only way for that raggedy truck to turn on was if I pushed both my tiny feet way down on the clutch, then turn the key and hold it until it turns on in that exact order.  This instance was different. My truck just turned on by itself without the use of the clutch and definitely not the use of the key.  I refused to move a muscle let alone turn the ignition to start.  My hard to handle steering wheel spun crazily round and round and without being in any gear, my truck jolted forward then to the right.  I thought the weight of the truck had given in on the cliff and we were falling.  My vehicle continuously rolled forward until my battle and I noticed we were at the other side of the bridge and safe on regular road.  We can see our heavy foot HUMMV parked! along with the rest of the convoy that was ahead of us.  Behind us was a gap followed by the vehicles that were behind us from the start. It was a good thing a tanker moved from the back of the convoy and became the leader to lead the rest of the convoy to the end of the bridge where my vehicle was approaching. I didn&#39;t remember traveling that distance. It had to have been a 3 to 3 1/2 mile roll that I nor my battle had any recollection of.  I&#39;m not insinuating that we were somehow time warped or anything of the sort, it&#39;s just that a 20 mph vehicle ride over a 3-mile stretch would be noticeable. It only took seconds for us to travel that distance.  At that time what mattered most was that we were alive. We were somehow saved from that cliff drop to death. My battle and I just stared at each other amazed by what we just witnessed and I remember my battle saying to me, &amp;quot;I will ride in this truck from now on.&amp;quot; 	Once we were completely caught up to the convoy, Amy and I got out the truck and threw our hands towards the sky with kisses, thanking God for another chance at life. My praises was interrupted when I suddenly saw this anomaly in the sky. To describe it at it&#39;s best it looked like our moon when it&#39;s at full moon. This anomaly was shining bright and as it coasted in the sky a white fire like trail followed it. I wasn&#39;t able to hear a sound from it. It was high in the sky, but low enough to see and know for a fact that this was not something that we would call an aircraft of ours on this planet. It shimmered a royal blue like color as it coasted silently and slowly in the sky. It looked as though it was following our convoy while in the sky as though it was watching us. It was an odd sight, but very beautiful! My battle buddy, a few dozens of the soldiers in the convoy and myself watched this anomaly as it seemed as though it was following the whole convoy. We couldn&#39;t take p! ictures because flashes fell under light discipline and no one had a camera. This was an experience that would pass down as a myth to our grand children, but I will always know that I was there at the origin of that myth.<n>

At first I thought it was blimp or something like that, but it seemed so big and was round, not the shape of a blimp.  I stopped my car and kept looking, it wasn&#39;t too far and it was moving slowly not too high above in the sky.  I was scared because I had never seen something like this so I headed home (I was approximately one minute away).  When I got home I told my boyfriend, he could tell that I was shocked because my eyes were watery but he didn&#39;t really seem to believe me.  He said &#34;let&#39;s go upstairs to see if you see it again&#34;.   I headed up before him and started looking towards the direction that I originally saw it (towards my left) and didn&#39;t see anything.  Then I looked towards my right and there it was.  My boyfriend saw it at that time and agreed with me that we&#39;ve never seen nothing like this.  It was huge.  We then went outside to see if we can still see it and we still saw it but we had a better view from upstairs so we headed upstairs again and kept looking until it disappeared into some tress in the area.  If anyone in Orlando,Fl, Orange County, has seen it, particularly on the same date as I (03/17/2003), report it also.<n>

I was doing some star gazing with my Celestron telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime after 8pm, I saw a horizontal row of lights hovering about the Las Vegas strip.  They were an amber color, almost iridescent.  I thought they were lights on one giant aircraft.  They were spread out like what appeared to be several city blocks.  Then they disappeared, all almost at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for several minutes in awe, trying to comprehend what I just saw.  Eventually I went back to my telescope; however I kept looking around the sky with my eyes.  A few minutes later, I saw three lights again, this time in a triangle formation.  It was at this point that I figured each light must be its own craft.  I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera as fast as I could.  I proceeded to record what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to keep turning my eyes away from the camera screen, as the camera did not do justice to what my eyes could see (although the video turned out pretty good).  The bottom light disappeared, and then two more lights flickered into view above the remaining two, and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.  Then the one on the right, to my perspective, disappeared about 20 seconds later. Finally, after about 30 more seconds the last one disappeared.  A few minutes later, one appeared again, and remained stationary for a few minutes before disappearing.  Before it disappeared, a regular plane appeared to fly by the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if I should report the next incident as a second occurrence or not, but I saw another &#34;UFO&#34; 10 days later.  I happened to watch a show about UFOs where a man described seeing almost exactly what I saw, and said he saw them again 10 days later.  So, on a whim, I took my camera outside about the same time, 10 days later.  I was shocked to see another one, and I filmed it.  This second occurrence was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved slowly higher and to the east.  Eventually, it turned from a large amber-like orb of light, to a small, strange, strobe-like light.  This was not like the strobe on an airplane though.  I have the whole incident on tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes, I saw two more strobe-like lights appear, near the same proximity.  It was almost as if the one was signaling the others, and they started to signal back. It was very strange to say the least. The strobes were very small, and eventually, I just couldn’t see them anymore.  The second incident lasted approximately 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain more information.  The video does, indeed, show the lights, precisely as the witness describes above, although we do not know what they are.  Ordinarily, we would allow for the possibility that they might have been landing lights on several airliners on long final approach, but they would not be visible for 30 minutes.  PD))<n>

Since that time I have been even more vigilant and today I think I saw something that may be worthy of a quick investigation. I was watching The National Geographic Channel, Expedition Journal: &#34;In the cold light of day&#34;. Towards the end of the program, (I was flipping through the channels and did not watch the whole thing) a photograper who was being profiled on the show was charged by a musk ox he was photographing near the seaside. In the next scene as the narrator speaks about photographing subjects under all conditions, 2 men are shown walking down a country road. Something is moving in the sky very discreetly. It happened very quickly and I didn&#39;t tape it, so for all I know it may be an airplane or bird or cloud. But my gut tells me it may be a good UFO shot. Please let me know if I can help in any other way. As for my previous sighting, I&#39;m not sure I want to type it all out yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed in the program.  We have encouraged him to submit his other sighting.  PD))<n>

This morning I had just got some tools from my shed, as I looked up there was alight in the sky, at first I thought it was just the sun shining off the side of a plane, but then it disappeared then reappeared, so  i began scanning the area where I last saw it and suddenly it appered again. so I ran inside and grabbed the camcorder, Once I found it in the sky again, after dismissed all other craft that it could be, I realized that what I was capturing on vidio was no plain. This is a very clear and sunny day I have it going and comming for over half an hour on tape. it looked more cylinder at times, then it seem to change. at one point in time you get avery clear shot of a plane going under it.  This was first seen from my back yard, then I moved to the front of the property. I would be very much interested to here if any one else reported this same object. I also think anyone on that plane may have had a better sight at it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request still copies of what the witness apparently captured on film.  PD))<n>

I am still confused as to what I saw.  I travel for my job; leave home travel to airport and return biweekly.  Same airport, same route.  I have been doing so for a long time now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - Yesterday, traveling from Toledo Ohio to DTW (Detroit Metro Airport) the weather was foggy.  I was driving cautiously, taking my time to arrive safely.  I was going from street lamp to street lamp just trying to stay awake.  Fog to light, fog to light.  All of a sudden the fog seemed visible, it was still there I just could see clearly.  I was in the center lane of a three lane road.  I looked for the source of the light, it was a shock to me, going from dark and fog to what seemed to be afternoon sun and fog.  On my right, hovering was a bright light.  I saw one light in the center and several in a circle around the center light.  It was so weird, I began thinking what did I see, what is that.  Then I was out of sight of it.  I saw tail lights in the fog braking ahead of me before I came to that area.  I did not brake, but I began driving faster.  I am not a believer of these things.  I have read and been told that these objects are sighted before and during wars and near nuclear power plants.  Both are true when and where I was at that time.  I was also thinking that street lamp was out of place, not the same time driving from one light to another.  I am an Electrical Engineer (Controls Engineer, PLC&#39;s), so thinking logically comes naturally to me.  I had my cruise control &#34;on&#34;.  I do so in fog because I know that when a person drives in fog they want to continouslly accel.  I prefer to drive safe.  Anyways, I saw something that did not belong there.  I am submitting this because I hope any other persons driving that day, on I-75, that saw the same thing I did also submit something.  I need closure.  I have sketched what I saw, it should not be there.  I have not returned home yet, but I have asked my father to drive that stretch and he did not see anything resembling what I described.  I have not been able to get the thing out of my mind...  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and sincere in describing his sighting.  He emphasized how bizarre the event was, and described how other vehicles apparently were responding to the presence of the object, which was very bright in the morning fog.  Witness occupies a position of considerable responsibility.  PD))<n>

I have further heard back from the people at Paine Field Airport in regards to their findings on the radar tapes.  No radar returns for that given area (5-DME on the 180 radial from their VOR) during atleast a one hour time frame.  In fact, they thought it very strange that there were NO radar returns for anything south of the airport including the standard southerly or westerly approach patterns for the main runway 34L/16R.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am a pilot and was wondering why they were flying so low.  They were about 1 mile away at an altitude of 200-300&#39; AGL (just above tree level) traveling in a Northwesterly direction.  I watched for about 20 seconds when I noticed that there was actually three bright lights and that they were on the bottom corners of a black triangle (about 100-150&#39; to each side).  I was standing in the middle of a park (large open space), with the craft heading straight for me.  At that moment, I decided that I would not want to become an abductie statistic and said out loud &#34;I&#39;m not ready for this!&#34;, so I quickly made my way to the closest trees for some cover (a 10 second dash).  I looked back and it was gone.  The craft should have been there.  It was as close as 200-300 yards and traveling at about 20 MPH with no sound.  This happened about 5 miles south of Paine Field - my home airport, with-in their Class D airspace.  Upon returning home, I opened your web site to see if there were any other sightings like mine.  To my amazement, I found on your home page exactly what I saw.  It was the incident on January 24, 2003 near Kingston, Ontario, Canada only she had more guts than I did.  I have contacted Paine Field Airport Management and they are researching their radar tapes and talking to the tower personnel for that time period.  I will keep you advised.<n>

All cigar shape objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi,  I am just finally reporting this. My ex-boyfriend (who is an Aussie) and I were outside Bellarat, in the state of Vicotria (an hour or so from Melbourne-just had toured an old gold mine that day) and we saw one UFO that looked like a cigar shaped object in the sky kind of hovering in an unreal way. I filmed about 4 mins. of footage before it got out of view-and it still hovered at this strange angle, then we got in the car and drove on the highway for awhile where we saw three traveling (so fast!) on the horizon (We both shot these on our video cameras)  So I got some great footage and wanted to know if anyone wanted to see it, I am apprehensive as to putting it up on the web due to how long it lasts. It&#39;s good footage.  Please email me with questions.<n>

These objects were seen in the area of the Limerick/Pottstown airport, but did not look like conventional aircraft, balloons, etc.  There was a round object, with small round formations attached to the bottom of it.  Surrounding the bottom area of this object were smaller, round black &#34;dots&#34; (like bees around a hive). All seemed to be moving slowly, and in unison, across the sky. By the time I ran over to my daughter(age 13) to get her attention, the group of objects seemed to disappear, leaving only one craft.  It was primarily black, but with a yellow corona around the bottom.  My daughter saw only one object, which she said looked silver to her, with a yellow glow.  The one object slowly continued across the sky, than hovered for a brief time (roughly 20 seconds).  It then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this point, I noticed another object flying around.   At first I thought it was a plane that was far off in the distance but then it dipped below the ridge in the distance and I realized that it was not that far away.   I was a clear delta or Chevron shape that was a deep black in color.   It was extremely small in size, perhaps no larger than a small car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object buzz across the valley and then make a turn back around and head back over the valley.   It circled again and then took off at a tremendous rate of speed, much faster than any other object that I have ever witnessed.   At this point, I realized that I had seen something that is quite unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part of me believes that this object could be some sort of drone that is used for the security of our VP Dick Chaney who has a house in the area.   The only thing that would make me waver from this conclusion is the rate of speed of the object.   It literally went from one end of the valley to the other in less than a second, much much faster than any other planes that I watched earlier in the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Through my windshield I noticed a bright orange/yellow light that at first glance I thought it was a star. Then I recognized that it was too big (about 3 times the size of (Venus or Jupiter) and too bright to be a star and that now looking through the drivers side window, it was moving west to east from the first position I saw it.  After viewing the motion it appeared to be about 1000-2000 ft above treetop level and approximately due south 1/4 mile from my position. I then thought that it was the landing lights of a small airplane.  It was very dark at the time and there is a small airport about 7 miles to the east of my home.  As I turned right onto another road headed north I looked back through the right side of the car about (about 10 seconds from when I first saw it), and even though it had gone approximately 1 mile or so headed due east, the light had not gotten an dimmer. I then realized these were not landing lights, it did not change color or intensity, and otherwise the lights would have dimmed as they passed in the direction it was going. As best I could tell, I saw no red or green lights required for an aircraft, and that it was neither a small plane nor a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading the Characteristic of Object section below, non really fit. It was a steady glowing yellow/orange color that was very bright.<n>

I asked neighbor had he ever seen lights in sky like that... never. Neither had I. Lights too bright to make out detail but was the brightest light in sky several hours. Seemed to rotate with stars but continously flashed a full spectrum of colors.<n>
3/15/03 19:30|Siem Reap (Cambodia)||Disk|1 minute|Very close observation of a disc shaped craft.|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85009.html|76|ndxe200303| Very close observation of a disc shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the last 10 years, my wife and I have had what I would consider to be several really good UFO sightings, but none quite as spectacular as this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took place in the spring of 2003, we were on a ‘bus’ if you could call it that, traveling  from the border town of Aranypathet-Poipet heading to Siem Reap in Cambodia.  We had been promised a nice comfortable air conditioned bus like the one in the picture, what we got was a microwave oven on wheels. It was 100 degrees, very little ventilation, no suspension, and a washboard of a road that was washed out in several places, such that we had to drive down the steep embankments and into the fields to find detours.  Needless to say, it was the day and journey from hell.  We were told it would be 3-4 hours, it was closer to 9 in total.  I share these details because I think it is important in setting the stage for understanding the frame of mind we were in when we had the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last hour and half of this torturous journey was somewhat tempered by the fact that the sun had gone down, which brought cooler temperatures and the road and smoothed out a little bit, but by this time we were all uncomfortably cramped and desperately anxious to just get off the bus. Outside it was black, no moon, no signs of civilization, no streetlights, nothing but the occasional dimly lit shack out in the fields, one or two flickered from the glow of a TV, most certainly running on a generator. On the bus, the moans and complaints of the other passengers had quieted, the only noise was the hum of the bus. I think at some point we had all realised that our only reprieve was to go within ourselves, to meditate, breathe deep and think of it as a yoga experience. Those of us who had windows looked out, those who did not, looked down. Off in the distance the occasional lightning strike lit up the sky. There was nothing around, no towers, no buildings, no hills, nothing bu! t rice fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour before we reached Siem Reap is when we saw it. It just appeared above the field outside my window, like a light turning on. It was a classic disc shaped craft, it appeared to have two distinct levels or floors, windows or viewing ports, the underside had a bluish glow to it, the top was more red if I recall correctly.  I’ve been in construction for more then 25 years, I know measurements very well, and that is why I can say with confidence that this object was not more then 100 feet off the road, and about 100 to 125 feet up off the ground. It was close enough to see detail. I estimate it’s size to be about 75 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly nudged my wife (then girlfriend) to have a look, but did not say anything vocally, she leaned over and saw it as clearly as I had. There was no power of suggestion, merely observation. There was no sound, and it did not move. Because of it’s proximity, it wasn’t long before it was behind us. I don’t know if anyone else on the bus saw it, I suspect not. There were only 5 windows on my side of the bus, and as previously mentioned, we were all kind of ‘zoned’.  I can tell you with certainty that it wasn’t a helicopter or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further confirmation came when we departed Siem Reap 4 days later during daylight hours. We knew that the sighting had occurred approximately 45 min. to an hour out of town, so both my wife and I visually scoured the landscape for a good 2+ hours after departing.  There was nothing that could have been mistaken for a craft, no radio towers, no hills, there was absolutely nothing but low lying fields for hours and hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect I think it’s possible that it was our meditative, Zen state of mind that perhaps allowed us to see what we saw.   What I do know, is that it was not my imagination, what we saw out there in the middle of nowhere Cambodia, was a saucer shaped craft, closer then most people ever see a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just for my own speculation, I have no doubt that we ( U.S. or Russian secret military) are now flying antigravity craft, not unlike what we saw, and perhaps if this sighting had taken place out in the deserts of Arizona, one might conclude that it was a secret black-ops test or something like that, but because our sighting took place where it did, I am of the opinion that it was an extraterrestrial craft.  Maybe someone else traveling that same road also witnessed what we saw.<n>

I didn&#39;t have the shape of the jet I saw, but appeared to be oblong and slowly spinning around. I could tell this by the way the sun was reflecting off of it. It also had a halo around itsort of like the moon has at night. I watched it as it travelled across the sky and then stop. The lightof the object seem to get smaller so I assumed that it was moving away from the earth. I watched it for a couple of minutes and went into to get my video camera and when I went back out on my deck 15 seconds later, it was gone.

This was no ordinary flash of light, mind you. In one split (micro?) second, I was awake, fully conscious, had an indescribable feeling, and saw the brightest light I have ever seen. It encompassed my entire field of vision. I later learned that a friend of mine, one block over, and another friend, while at a party in Maine, saw/felt this same thing. I posted on an internet forum afterwards (maybe the day after) about it, and others on the East Coast had seen it as well. Chilling!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It looked like it was a few hundred yards to the north of the highway we were driving on.  The shapes were a light yellow in color and didn&#39;t seem to move much, except that every time we lost sight of them whenever they reappeared, it seemed like they had moved with the car.

My girlfriend and I were traveling south on Bray road. We were heading home from a late dinner. We crossed Birch Run Road and as we traveled south I noticed a solid bright light in the distant south east sky (possibly 4-6 miles away). The dome shaped light looked to be in the general direction of a cell phone tower which is located on Lewis road just south of Vienna road. At first, because the light was stationary, I thought maybe new lights were added to the tower for some reason (I had never seen the light before). However, the dome shaped light seemed to be something I can only describe as &#34;the typical UFO photo or video&#34;, so I told my girlfriend to slow down. As we moved into a tree line which partially blocked our view I realized the intensity of the light because of the way it broke through the trees. As the tree line thickened it became difficult to see the light. The tree line got very thick and we could no longer see the light ,I told my girlfriend to speed up. The light was gone when we could see the sky again. We decided to retrace the route immediately to see if the light was still in the sky. We drove the same route again, we did not see the same light, it disappeared from where we had seen it.<n>

I HAVE NEVER SEEN A UFO.  ALWAYS SAID &#34;I HAVE TO SEE ONE TO BELIEVE IT&#34;.  THERE IT WAS OVAL SHAPED WITH BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT ROTATING LIGHTS OF PURPLE, RED, YELLOW, ORANGE, GREEN AND BLUE.  i COULDN&#39;T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING.  I GOT SO EXCITED I HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK. I COULDN&#39;T  STAY OUTSIDE.  MY BROTHER STATED, IT BROKE OFF INTO 3 SMALL ORBS BUT THE ORGINIAL REMAINING.  THEY HOVERED AROUND AND BECAME ONE AGAIN.  THE COLOR OF THE SMALL ONES WERE ORANGE.  MY BROTHER SHINED A HIGH POWERED LIGHT AT IT.  HE FLASHED 5 FLASHES 3 TIMES, THE FORTH TIME HE FLASHED 6 TIME AND THE LIGHTS OF THE UFO FLASHED OFF AND ON.  ALMOST AS THOUGH SIGNALING BACK.  AND THEN IT ZOOMED AWAY.  AND THEN 4 PLANES WERE FLYING IN THE AREA.

I asked them why they were looking at the sky (as I was laughing at them), just then a light the size of a U.S. quarter if you were holding it out as far as your arm could reach started to glow. The light was very bright and condensed,with a white and orange color. As the light went on, 3 seconds later another light(equal)came on not to far from it. As the lights glowed for about 10 seconds together, a little light the size of a airplane light dropped from both of the larger lights. The little lights flew around the larger lights until the larger lights disappered. Then the little lights flew at speeds and angles that no plane(that I know of)could possible fly toward the north and downward. The light were coming from the east when the all started. As the three of us watched the sky I asked the three people how long this was going on for and they said about 5 mins. but the little lights happened at the end when I got there. Just then another car pulled up. A lady and her daughter asked if we saw the lights and we told her that we did, because as they were driving the daughter saw them but the mother did not.<n>

While stopped at a stop light at the levee heading north towards on SR 43, my husband noticed 3 small lights pretty far up in the sky.  One light came on, then another a second or two later, then the third light.  Then the first one went off and the other two followed in succession.  At first we thought - fireworks.  But that didn&#39;t make any sense because we didn&#39;t see the trail going up into the air and the lights didn&#39;t appear to &#34;fall&#34; like fireworks typically do.  We kind of blew it off.  Then about 5 minutes later - we saw the same thing again.  The lights were east of us, across the Wabash river some distance away but we didn&#39;t appear to be moving away from them.  About another 5 minutes later, we saw them again.  Then again a 4th time before they stopped which was right before we went under the overpass at I65 and SR43.  The 4th time we saw them, they appeared to be almost directly above us.  We couldn&#39;t be sure which way they were moving, but it appeared to us that they were moving north northwest.  In each occurrance, the lights were yellow/orange in color.  They would light up, then disappear in succession.  Sometimes they had smaller lights around them, sometimes, they didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I raced to the window to get a closer look and it stopped. I sat back down to continue watching the tv, again out of the corner of my eye the same strobing light released an orange sphere of light which resembled the so called &#34;flare&#34; of the massive ufo sighting that occured in Phoenix&#39;s past, which disappeared behind the initial blue strobing light i was seeing after about 5 seconds, Followed by more white streaking spark-like in the sky, about a 1000 foot tail id imagine. After doing various maneuvers, &#34;S&#34; shapes, and dive&#39;s,  which were highlighted by the white spark streak, the ufo which i was seeing dropped several &#34;midair-bombs&#34; which resembled a high altitude fireworks mortar explosion, the colors of the sparks comming off the explosions, 2 different colors, one was solid purple, and one was solid green. The purest of these two colors i have ever seen. I was in complete awe, when i then raced to get the attention of my brothers girlfriends mom. She was also fascinated by the encounter. The site was so spectacular, and visible, there had to have been atleast 1000 people witness on the road driving west at the time, that had to have seen this. It was in the Northwestern sky , please if there is anyone out there who also witnessed this even please post a report. There is an airforce base close around phoenix, during this day, I also witnessed a jet training. 4 Jets flying in a cross pattern formation giving off an exhaust they had control over, releasing it when they went straight up, or straght down doing maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sounds during the ufo encounter, but i definatley heard the roar of the fighter jets during the day, thats how I differentiated the phenmomena i saw, from the training exercises, although the training could have been for a different unknown craft that I witnessed.

Just two flashes of amber light at a very high altitude. The thing that makes this strange--to me and my father anyway--is that we live within 1 mile of an airport, and commonly see planes fly right over our house, and have grown used to it, but these happened one at a time. The only way I can explain is to draw a diagram: o o                          (FIRST ^ LIGHT) (SECOND ^ LIGHT) All within a couple of seconds. Nothing on this airport can go that fast or has that color of light. Like I said almost amber. Plus my dad can fly and work on planes. In fact just a couple of hours before I had saw a plane that had just taken off from the airport, and I happened to mention to my dad that it had two tails with a bar connecting them and he went into a speech about what this plane was (P-38) and how it was used in W.W.II. I called my best friend Nathan and he said that he thought that it was ball lightning, I don&#39;t agree. I have never believed in UFO&#39;s. Nor do I plan to. However I have always had an intrest in the supernatural and extraterrestrial. But I guess a skeptic can always turn to be a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness implies an evening sighting, and we have amended the time above.

Upon further review, I noticed more dropping out of the the sky until there were several. They had mostly red and white lights, flashing, had no visible wings, and did not make a sound, although some had blue and aqua lights. Some were triangular, some cigar-shaped, and some like a small box with four perpindicular lights. I brought several people out of the the building, and we all watched this penomenom. Please tell me I&#39;m not crazy. Also, during the time I was watching, a bona-fide helicopter with multi-colored lights flied over.A few, buty not all of these objects left a con-trail. I have spent seven years in the air force, and I knoe whta aircraft  look and sound like. These were not conventional aircraft. I called 911, and a Winfield police officer responded and watched them with me replying that he could not shoot them down, and that this was beyong local jurisdiction. The lighted objects also spat out balls every once in a while that also flew.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.

It was a nice clear morning above but off the coast to the east there was a giant thunder cloud looming.  There was a spectacular lightning show going on inside the clouds.  We watched for a few moments when I noticed a small black dot that seemed to hover just outside of the storm.  There were no visible lights coming from the craft.  I expected to see flashers if it was a plane or helicopter but there was nothing.  Just a black dot and it was far away, too far to tell what shape it was.  The black dot was slowly moving north to south with the dark grey cloud as a backdrop.  The black dot did not seem to be going away or coming toward us for it stayed constant.  Venus was very bright and just to the right of the clouds in the clear sky and served as a good refernce point for the objects direction of flight.  The object moved north to south until it appeared directly below venus then the object slowly changed direction and went straight up toward venus and then changed direction again moving from south to north in a perfect line with venus and hovering above the clouds, like it was observing the storm.  The object moved very slowly, so slow you really had to concentrate on the spot in the sky as it moved.  We watched for 15-20 minutes as the black dot moved from the backdrop of the cloud to the backdrop of the sunny sky.  If it was a plane it would have disappeared out of sight or flown over our heads, and I couldn&#39;t imagine a helicopter being much different except for its hovering ability.  this object did not get smaller or larger, but it was definately a long way away.  A tiny hole in the sky that moves!  I am really curious to know what this might have been or if anyone saw something similar.<n>

I am risking everything writing this and have nothing to gain since I do not need the attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aliens do exist and I have seen them, matter of fact I have been 2 feet from them. The recent controversy over whether night terrors cause people to continue dreaming  after awakening from a night terror needs to be restudied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 14, 2003 I began to have what is known as a night terror (These started after a head injury in 1994). I have never been able to fully awake during a night terror except for 03-14-03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the early morning I started having a night terror as I partial awoke I saw two small black figures enter my bedroom at that point I started to freak out and was yelling at myself to wake up, wake up, wake up and then I awoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two small black objects were two small grey aliens, once awoke I no longer was freaking out. I looked directly at these two aliens they observed me for about three seconds and then went running down my hallway at what appeared to be around 50 or 60 mph, their was an amber light being emitted down my hallway and the aliens ran into the light and disappeared.  I jumped out of bed ran down the hallway unlocked the door that was 4 feet from the end of the hallway and ran outside, there was nothing but dead calm.  There was an highly unusual calmness in the air and physiologically.  I was the calmest and most relaxed that I have ever experienced in my life (No pain killer or muscle relaxent has ever put me in this state).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I look at this experience as the coolest dream that I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t feel crazy because i know the truth and we are not alone and this was not like the other night terrors that I have had where I wake up with a racing heart rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to sleep after this occured which is highly unusual. I have an idea of what is going on and they are the creators of life, they put life on this planet to evolve and us stupid humans have poisoned the entire food chain which has inadvertantly poisoned us and now they are trying to save whats left as well as to protect us from possible other alien colonies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three seemingly serious reports from the same source.

I was at the beach looking at the stars and a few boats in the distance.  To my left I was looking at a boat and out of the corner of my eye I saw what appeared to be a flash of light.  I quickly looked and realized it was the shape of a boomerang or sideways V. It was fire orange with no distinctness about it.  I thought it was quite strange but I figured it was a flash from a boat.  It stayed there  for a few seconds and slowly went away. Shortly after another one appeared all in slow motion, it went away and then another showed up. I had no idea what this was. I looked around hopeing someone else saw the same thing.  No one else was around.  All day jets had been flying by and I thought maybe that was what it was, but it was silent and it was bright orange (jets arent orange).  I have no idea what I saw.  After reading a few siteing I read one from the fall of 2001 from Panama City and it sound quite familiar.  Beats me what was but it was a sight i will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/13/03 09:00|Pietermaritzburg (closest city) (South Africa)||Disk|30 minutes|Stationary light hovering at great altitude during daylight hours and then accelerating to great speed in a westerly direction.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28118.html|105|ndxe200303| Stationary light hovering at great altitude during daylight hours and then accelerating to great speed in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Highmoor Dam is situated at Longditude 29°34&#39;and South Latitude 29­°25&#39;. While watching two eagles soaring overhead my wife noticed a silver object shining in the sky directly overhead. She pointed it out to me and asked what I thought it was. At first I thought it was sunlight reflecting off a geostationery satelite, although I had never seen this type of phenomena before. The altitude of the shining disc was estimated to be that of a satelite which is normaly seen in the night sky. We both viewed the stationery object for a few minutes before sighting it through a pair of binoculars. There was very little to add to the above explanation except that what I considered to be reflected light was seen to be closer due to the magnification. After about 15 minutes with absolutly no movement of the object I decided to capture it on video. I fitted a telephoto lens to the camera but battled to sight the object through the viewfinder. I had been out camping in the area for two weeks taking footage of the trip. It was at this moment when I needed the camera that the battery went flat, hence no video. It would not have been of much use anyway as all it would have shown was a dab of silver light against a blue background. We both continued to rick our necks looking directly above us at this object. Having seen all these spy movies on TV I then thought it was big brother looking in, so I pulled a couple of zap signs at it. My wife went into the tent for a few moments and when she came back out, asked if I could still see it. I was using the binoculars and could see it clearly. The next instant it started moving in a westerly direction picking up speed as it went. My wife asked me where to look. I did not take my eyes off the accelerating light, but said just follow the binoculars. The object moved through a 90° arc in approximatly 15 seconds where I lost sight of it behind some bushes at the back of our tent. I estimated its speed to be at least ten times faster than the satelites I have seen in the night sky. I d! on&#39;t kno w if we have anything on our planet than can hover at great altitude for the 30 minutes that I observed it and then accelerate to a guesstamate speed of some 270 000 km/p/h. I have always thought there might be ET&#39;s out there and if you cannot give some form of sane explanation to this one then I am convinced I saw a UFO.<n>

I noticed one in particular that had a bright white light like headlights with what appeared to be red and green beams coming out of it.  They looked like spotlights.  It was also a little cloudy that day but had cleared up.  The object moved erratically and hovered.  I could see what I thought were sparks coming out of it as it moved or jutted around.  It moved slowly like a helicopter but was too high in the sky to be a plane or helicopter.  My husband also saw it and thought it was a star until he could see the colors of red and green.  It did not twinkle like a star.  It moved very slow and all of a sudden would jutt left or right.  I had been home most of the evening and my husband had come home a little later from work.  I thought about getting my video camera but it was late and my daughter was asleep.  Did not want to wake her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the witness was looking to the south, she may have been looking at the star, &#34;Sirius,&#34; which is very bright, and quite colorful.

I was driving by the horse farm and I stopped my car. I was looking at it dead on and the thing disapeared right in front of me. It wasn&#39;t a cloud, just gone.

I just got done doing my taxes and was heading down the road to the gym.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out to my car and went to the trunk. While closing the trunk and facing the east, with a very clear ski and the sun more closely to my back, I caught a glimps of a reflection to the east over the house.  At first, what I didn&#39;t think anything was unusal but at the same time it was out of position.  The meaning here is my home is in the landing and takeout path for Tulsa Int. Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In forty years, I have seen nearly every kind of airplane there is.  Plus my dad work on all kinds of airplanes for 30 years included the Boeing 747.  What caught my eye at first was the thing in the sky was a half mile east of the line up point for the runway. It was also way to high. I would say, 5,000 feet maybe more. My first thougth was, this plane was going to have to take a crash dive to the left in order to land.  Also what seem odd was it was going slightly slower than normal landing speeds.  There were also no landing lights of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized something was wrong...  This thing didn&#39;t have a set of wings, tail, rudders, engines. If it was going to land, the landing gears would have been down by then. There were none of them either...   Then I just stared in amazement... This thing did not have any identifing marks that a normal airplane had. With no tail, no brand name.  It had no windows. The very front was black as well as the very end of it.  There was a black type of band in the middle. The remainder was polished type aluminum.  It was a cylinder in shape. For size, it was, I would say, longer than a 747 fusalog... maybe 30 feet or more. In other words, it was long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I started to think for a second... the wind, very slight, was coming from the south maybe 2 to 3mph.  Not a big deal but planes that would be taking off would be going from north to south.  With this monster a half mile to the east at 5,000 feet, it would have been right in the path of any planes taking off and heading east.  This thing continued on a stright north direction.  Did not turn or change speeds.  I could definitly see after a 10 second look that it had no wings or familiar airplane features.  I didn&#39;t hear a sound. Even a 747 at a half mile distance is something I would have heard and I have a hearing problem. After staring at it so long, it was almost memorizing to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I lost track of it because of the distance it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you contact me do so by email is best.<n>

It was a row of three white/gold lights, two below it, then one below the two sorta like a triangle.  The &#34;*&#34; is a blinking white light on top. It was much larger than the house it was hovering by, probably about 100+ feet tall.  I stared at it for a few moments and asked:  &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; A friend, who lives in the area, replied &#34;That&#39;s a farm tower or somethin&#39;.&#34; Another friend, who ALSO lives in the area, replied:  &#34;Dude, no, what the hell IS that!?&#34;  We continued on, going again into some trees and then coming out with a tall-grassy field with trees along the outer edge.  It was then we decided to do our firework.  I glanced over and saw a small white light slowly moving behind-through the trees, hovering back and forth.  We lit it off and got the heck out of dodge, passing by the field where the object was originally sighted.  Nothing.  Darkness.  Coming out of the forest I glanced back and saw that white light above the trees, moving quickly to the right and holding it&#39;s position there, rising as we moved further away.  The weekend after that my &#34;No, dude, what the hell IS that&#34; friend held a party, so another friend who was with us and I went down that road at dusk to see if anything truly WAS there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing.  Just the house.  The only &#34;tower&#34; in the area was a cellular monopole much further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was letting the dog out the back door when i noticed  what looked like a single star or maybe the light of a plane. I watched for about 5 minutes and the light did not move, so i went and woke up my daughter and told her to come and look at it. I also got the telescope out onto the back porch and got it in my sites. It appeared to be a perfectly round sphere. orange/yellow in color. it did not appear to pulsate. I was facing east and as the sum came up i was not able to see it any longer but i think it was still there. This morning i got up and thinking it was probably a star would be in the same place. nothing. when sighting the sphere though the telescope I used the crosshairs on the little quick align scope and put the crosshairs right on the sphere an hour later they were still right on the sphere. which shows there was no movement of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have a small telescope and it does not bring the stars very close but when looking at this object it filled the view finder. I am around 8 miles from a nuclear plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> next time i will have a camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have been looking at Venus, which currently is in the eastern sky during the morning hours.

It was bright Green like the color of a traffic light.  It looked like a big green fireball falling from the sky but it did not seem to disapate as it neared the surface. It did not seem to slow down but it looked as if it landed in the Hollywood Hills.  Things in the skys these days are very strange.<n>

I own a 2002 Ford pick up truck. I saw some lights following me, like an airplane or helicopter. I was only traveling about 35 mph because of the deer on the rural roads in the area.  The lights followed me for about a mile. Then they got closer. I slowed down. It slowed down. I rolled down the window and looked and could see triangular shaped object closely following me. When I slowed almost to a stop it was right overhead...about 100 feet overhead. Silent. Greenish white lights at the corners of an equilateral triangle. Maybe 100 feet each leg of the triangle. I stopped my truck. It stopped directly overhead. I grabbed my .223 Ruger Ranch rifle from behind the seats and slammed in a magazine and started shooting. After I had shot maybe the first 2-3 rounds the lights went out on the triangle and it just disappeared. I shot 7 rounds more. They were all aimed at where the triangle was or had been. I shot for maybe 10 seconds. Then I took off at about 60 mph for home. When I arrived home I looked up &#34;UFO&#34; via the Google search engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a girlfriend who thought she was abducted by aliens while driving alone in rural Nebraska in the late 50&#39;s when she was about 21. She was always afraid of driving alone in the country. I carry the Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes near my farm and I raise chickens. I shot at the triangle becasuse I did not want to become an alien &#34;science project.&#34; At Noon on March 12th I returned to the place where I fired at the triangle and found 10 empty cartriges. No evidence I had hit anything. Just trees and fields. Nearest home is about 2/3 mile away. No electrical problems with my truck since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following up...I drove to the spot where I shot at the triangle during daylight and there was no indication that I had hit it. The spent .223 cartridges were scattered on both shoulders of the road. No homes in the area, just fields and woods. I carry a Ruger Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes in the area and I have chickens on my small farm. I was about 4 miles from my home when I saw the triangle at 10 PM. A former girlfriend thought she was abducted by a UFO and she was scared to death of being alone in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Although we recognize that any UFO can be potentially dangerous to a human being, we strongly advise restraint with regard to shooting at them with a firearm.

It was right about this time I thought, &#34;This is the same thing I saw last summer!&#34; [My report is on here, 05/29/02] Just then I saw the a light appear in the western sky quite far from the original location.  When I told my family about these strange lights last summer, they just brushed it off like it was no big deal, so not beign far from home, I decided to call my mom and pick her up so she could see them.  Hurrying home I saw the lights a few more times.. I was paying more atteniton to the road though.  I got my mom and drove to 26.  We got out and waited.  In no less that 5 minutes we saw 2 lights appear in the northern sky about 40 degrees above the horizon.  We decided to drive up 26 a little farther and pull onto a country road.  There were 3 lights now, they felt very very close.  As we watched I was stunned to see them dissappear for a minute only to all reappear eventually as a triangle.  Another minute or so pass and my mom says, &#34;Look!&#34;  and they were in a perfectly straight horizontal line. [this summer I saw a vertical line]  This is about the time we decided we saw enough and left.  My mom felt &#34;obligated&#34; to call the cops when she got home, they ofcourse, had no idea what it was.  I do remember seeing &amp; hearing a lot of other planes afterwards.. *especially* last night.<n>

Me myself i have witnessed a craft which was on the west side of the city of Thunderbay just above the airport.It seemed rather strange that i could see this object just above the airport.It did not seem to move it simply stayed in one area.It was v shaped,red in colour,and it seemed to cloak itself,yet i could still see the outline,it seem to blend in with the clouds but yet i could still make out the v shape.This went on for half an hour untill it seemed to cloak for the last time and i could not make it out anymore.That was in 2001.In 2002 i was on my way back from a gig,Im in a band,it was 3:00 am i was with my guitar player.We were heading north on what we call our expressway going home.Directly in front of us was a huge orange ball.The best way i can describe this incedent is,to put your thumb up in the air behind the wheel of my car would be the size of the moon.This craft would be the size of my fist.I stopped at the 7-11 to buy something to eat,and asked the worker to come outside and look at this thing to make sure i was,nt seeing things.And yes he as well as my guitar player ((name deleted)) saw this thing it was huge i couldn&#39;t beleive it.Nobody has ever reported this untill now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time may be approximate, althought the witness does not incate that fact.

We saw an unnaturally bright light about 300 meters from our cabin. The light came from a dense forest where there are no other cabins or roads of any kind. We couldn&#39;t know what it was because the forest was so dense that we couldn&#39;t use our old binoculars. We were too frightened to go and see for ourselves. It was there for about ten minutes. We wen&#39;t inside to get our brand new binoculars but by the time we got back to the yard, the light phenomenon was gone. The next day we wen&#39;t to the site and we came to a conclusion that there could not have been anything reasonable because the forest was so dense and there were no roads there! We were also the only residents by that time for about 4 kilometer radius! All the other residents were elderly folk who wouldn&#39;t wander out on such a late hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/10/03 23:00|Doddridge|AR|Other|2 hours|Strange lights, and footprints|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29631.html|124|ndxe200303| Strange lights, and footprints<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around the first or second week of March I walked out onto my back porch to see the stars. I noticed bright lights in the sky North of my house. Our house is on one of the highest hills in the area and we are at least 20 miles from the nearest city, and have no close nieghbors. To our North is nothing but low lakes and swamp lands that is almost totaly deserted because of rouch geography. In the middle of that rough impassable land is also 16000 acres of wild public lands that are seldom used except for a few duck hunters and some fisherman, but never that late at night, and never in the sky. The object was a group of about 6 lights in a perfect line that appeared to be at least 200 yards long. While watching these lights just sitting in the sky another light came straight down from what appeared to be outer space, and disapeared into the other lights. At this time I called for my family to come out and see. My smaller kids after seeing the lights ran back into the house and hid under the bed, they had just watched Signs. After about 30 minutes the object began to move very slowly to the North, and looked like it was settling over the Lake as it was looking for somthing. We then climbed to the top of our house as the object was sinking lower in the sky and getting harder to see due to the trees. We started filming the object then and and have some footage of it. This was not the first time we have seen somthing odd in the sky here. About a month after moving to this house I walked outside about 2AM in the morning. When I walked out I saw an object at tree top level with red lights around it, and a red strobe light shooting into the trees below. This object was moving about 20 mph over the trees and disapeared over the hill to out east. 2 Nights latter at 3am we saw what looked like a rip in the sky to our south. This by far was the strangest thing I have seen. The rip looked as though it was an opening to another place. Out of this opening flew what looked like hundreds of small objects ! like streemers. We ran in the house for a camera but by the time we came back out it was gone. Another time around December of 2002 my parents who live 25 miles to our north called and told us to run outside. They said they saw a series of lights flying in circular paterns and moving south toward our location. We did not see them at that time but about 30 minutes latter they appeared in the sky to our north. These were round cylinder shaped objects flying in round circular formations around the sky. I have a police and fire department scanner at my house. While watching these lights I heard the dispatcher ask where one of the Sheriff deputys location was, he replied &#34;just sitting here watching the UFO&#39;s&#34;, so many in our area had to see these things. We have also found strange human looking footprints in the mud at the lake to our north. They appeared to be human except for the fact that these prints come out of and lead into thick brush with lots of throrns and stickers. These prints are also way out in the woods, miles from a pathed road or houses. My feet would be nothing but bloody nubs if I did what this person is doing, even the Native Americans wore mocosins on their feet in this area. No one in the are can explane these prints that are found by arrowhead hunter after a rain. They also appear in the same area the lights are seen. I wonder if they are related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The street/area I live in has very few street lights and its easy to see the night sky.  I was not looking up but had a strange feeling and looked up to see something that I am not sure if i was hallucinating , but it was a large dark triangle shaped object ,at least 80 feet long and about 50feet wide at it widest point, with a large blueish light on the bottom of each tip of the triangle. I heard I think a faint humm and thought I could actually see that the bottom of this thing was not smooth but had form and small dips and valleys in it ,something machine/manmade i guess you can say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in shock at what I was seeing cause it appeared to be only about 200 feet up in the air , but it was hard to look at , almost like there was a blurry haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked down to clear my eyes and looked back up and it had either gotten smaller or quickly went to a higher altitude . I looked down again to clear my eyes from the light and looked back up and it was gone.  I dont drink, dont smoke, dont do drugs. I was tired , but I still dont know what I saw and not completely sure if I saw it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like a dream, but I dont think I was dreaming. It was an unusual experience indeed and to be honest I am not 100% sure that I saw what I saw, or maybe I just dont want to , it gave me such an strange scary feeling when I saw the object. I felt impending doom.<n>

I tried to determine how high it was and figure it must have been maybe 80 - 100 feet up when I saw it.  I have seen strange things in the past but not like this.

The object would disappear then re-appear in a different place in the sky. I don&#39;t know if one was just disappearing then another one would appear or if it was just one object. We watched it for around 5-7 minutes, then it disappeared. There wa a lot of airplanes and helicopters in the air, because it happened right near an air field.<n>

Triangle was longer on two sides (not equilateral). I saw it from a distance, and it looked like the top of a radio tower or something.  It was late afternoon, and we were driving down a long, straight back road next to a field, so visibility was far and the sun had not set yet.  I was in the back seat, looking out the left window, and the object was in the air a few thousand feet up at about 10 o&#39;clock high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer to it, the other kids noticed it, and we pulled over the car and started piling out.  By the time all 6 of us had piled out of the sedan, it was moving.  It accelerated in a straight line away in the direction that we had been driving, and was gone in the distance in maybe 5 seconds.  I never heard a sound.  One of the other kids claimed to have heard a low hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting thing about how it had initially hovered is that it was not moving at all.  Not bobbing, not leaning from the wind.  It was steady enough to cause me to think it was the top of a tower initially. Then, when it accelerated away, it was in a perfect, straight line.  Ohio is notoriously windy, and that day was no exception - yet the object was floating very, very steadily, without any deviation whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When you zoom in on it, it looks more like a metallic sphere.  It looks too far away to be an insect, but you’re the experts.

Suddenly, there appeared this strange craft, (I swear it had the appearance of  NCG-1701 &#39;Star Trek&#39;). I say suddenly because &#39;poof&#39; - there it was where there had just been empty night sky. The ship&#39;s forward area (the round construction) was glowing a fuzzy lime green, while the rest of the ship seemed dark - that is, no lights were noticed on the periphery. I would estimate that the size of this thing was very large, in that if  I held my hand at arm&#39;s length, the object would almost have filled in the space of 4 fingers (thumb tucked). Unfortunately, the sighting lasted for less than 5 seconds because it just as suddenly disappeared -- &#39;poof&#39;-- again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew in a northerly direction (direction San Francisco) extremely fast, faster than a normal jet on approach to SFO. I would estimate that this craft was approximately 6-8 miles away, and flying between 3,000 to 5,000 feet over the baylands or Bay. I have a good feel for this as we live on the flight path into SFO, on what the controllers call the &#34;Peninsula&#34; approach. That is, jets are vectored over the Peninsula from the SW, flying over Palo Alto at between 3K-5K feet. However, after 11:00 pm, jets usually vector out over the Bay, staying away from the Peninsula area.  (See http://www.uproar.org/cached/SFChron.8.6.98.html for the whole article.) I thought later that the green I saw on the craft might have been regular starboard/port side lights, but that made no sense as the side that was facing me was the left of the craft (I assume) and therefore the light should have been red. But in any case, the fuzzy greenish light enveloped the whole front section of the craft&#39;s construction - the round part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Career wise, I am a professional secretary and hobby wise, a percussionist. I am trained to observe and memorize details. I hope that other people on the Peninsula saw this brief passing of the strange greenish glowing craft and will report it as well. No need to contact me. Thank you.<n>

It was travelling slowly across the sky, stopped and then seemed to dive to the earth changing shape to a cylindrical form. It could have been about 30 feet long and about 15 feet wide approx. The light seemed to quiver but kept its shape and dissapeared when it reached the ground. The light was a very rich red set against the dark night and was clearly visible on that clear night. As we travelled further along the road about another 2 miles my friend saw a rod shaped light of white/electric blue fly across the field to our left and hover on the road about 18 inches above the ground and was about 20 inched long. It appeared to be extremely vibrant and clearly seen. It was motionless in the road when I (the driver) saw it and we seemed to drive straight through it. My friend saw the inside of the car momentarily light up as we did so. This sparked off a great deal of thought and discussion between us. The rest of the journey of a few miles saw no further event and we were none the worse for our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Fakenham, Norfolk, is located just east of The Wash, and northwest of Norwich.

Beltway, March 8, 2003<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange Sightings Within The Washington, D.C. Beltway, March 8, 2003   I would have reported this earlier, but when, on the night of the observations reported below, I phoned _______ of the Fund For UFO Research, he told me that I should not report it on UFO UpDates, when I mentioned the possibility. I didn&#39;t ask ((name deleted)) why he said that, but since it has been so long and I&#39;ve seen no reports of this, I can&#39;t imagine how this late-reporting could create a serious &#39;reporting noise&#39; problem (if that&#39;s what ((name deleted)) was concerned about), so here goes. My apology for reporting late.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:15 (20:15 hours) on Saturday evening, March 8, my wife and I were preparing to leave our home near Greenbelt, Maryland, when a strange wing-like (No aircraft body visible and we had ground light off overcast clouds that should have clearly revealed any body.) Thing - herein-after &#39;AAO&#39;, meaning anomalous aerial object - was seen to emerge into view travelling on a twenty-degrees-east of a true north course passing almost overhead, from having been eclipsed by our front porch roof. The &#39;Wing&#39; spanned a _full_ two degrees (120 ARC minutes) as contrasted with the half-degree (about 30 arc minute) crescent moon, off to my left during the observation for immediate and good comparison of angular size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;AAO&#39; was perceived by binocular disparity (visual parallax due to eye separation) as being 600 to a maximum of 1,200 feet overhead, and at the time its actual maximum possible distance was constrained by a thin layer of clouds overhead. Officially, that cloud layer had been broken at 24,000 feet at 19:51, was OVERCAST at 23,000 feet at 20:51, scattered by 21:51 same altitude, and clear by 22:51. (Thanks to __________ for the cloud data.)  Most disturbing was the _total_ silence of the nearby object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright, continuously white &#39;sphere&#39;-looking thing was visible on the tip of each &#39;wing&#39; (Color illustration available to anyone who requests it.). Each white &#39;sphere&#39; had a very sharp edge quite different from the lights on ordinary aircraft, and of a much purer white color. A much smaller (than the white &#39;spheres&#39;) pure red light looked possibly more &#39;point-source&#39; and was located in the &#39;middle&#39; (vertex of the &#39;wing&#39;).  It was brightening and dimming, but at times it seemed more of a flicker, and at other times more of a pulse, if memory serves me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;wing&#39;, per se, was quite strange. Although it was visible by the cloud back-lighting, it was rather vague because subtle light around it seemed to vibrate or flicker at maybe ten hertz! - all along and across the &#39;wing&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was _no_ sign of any aircraft type body! Since the sight was quite &#39;spooky&#39;, maybe one could call them &#39;disembodied wings&#39;. :)  We live a few blocks north of the little College Park Airport which is presently closed down to non-government air traffic due to security concerns, but this &#39;AAO&#39; seemed so very low that my &#39;gut&#39; reaction was that it had taken off from there, despite the fact that the thing seemed to be on a very flat course (neither climbing nor descending). Subsequent inquiry to the airport revealed that there had been no take-off around the 20:15 time of the first observation, and the airport had closed at 22:30, fifteen minutes before the second identical observation to be described below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Roughly fifty (50) minutes after the first observation, an airliner type aircraft came over, possibly having taken off from Andrews AFB just east of D.C. It was on a slightly more westward bearing and considerably higher up. We could see the aircraft&#39;s body, wings, and tail structure very clearly and hear it very distinctly. By contrast, the &#39;AAO&#39; had NO BODY VISIBLE, but only that weird wing-like structure that remained vague, SEEMING TO SHIMMER or something - It&#39;s really hard to describe. That&#39;s why I have illustrated it in the way that I did in the image anyone may ask me to send.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet, the most striking thing of all was the absolute silence! There was a bizarre silence, &#39;stillness&#39;,and &#39;smoothness&#39; that is hard to explain or even put into adequately descriptive words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object had disappeared beyond our north-northeastern horizon (taking roughly 30 seconds time to go from near zenith across the northern horizon), I ran up to the third floor where my Extreme Low-Frequency (ELF) magnetometer is located and noted a low-level, continuous magnetic pulse in roughly the 2-hertz range, accompanied by a few very strong &#39;spike&#39; type pulses, one of which may have &#39;pegged&#39; the needle. These were not normal background magnetics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming upon 22:45 hours (10:46 PM), I was again upstairs with the magnetometer checking for any anomalous activity, when similar magnetic phenomena began to again be seen by the action of the needle display and heard on the analog, frequency modulated audio output (just as before). Watching and listening to that, I SUDDENLY heard a roar (seemingly directly overhead) that vaguely resembled a loud jet but was distinctly different, somehow. Then after a maybe 4 to 5 second duration, that roar SUDDENLY subsided - taking about 0.5 second to go from loud to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the odd magnetic activity and the surprising sound, at cessation of the sound I rushed downstairs and onto the front porch, from which I was surprised to see an exactly identical &#39;AAO&#39; (as compared to the 20:15 observation) on _exactly_ the _same_ course!  As with the earlier &#39;AAO&#39;, I watched the object from almost directly overhead as it moved in spookily total silence to across the exact spot on the north-northeastern horizon into which the first object had headed and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the first observation, the sky above the thing was overcast, but in the second sighting it was totally clear, with all stars and planets visible. Still, I could see no &#39;body&#39; on the object, but only the &#39;wing&#39;. This time, too, the &#39;wing&#39; seemed to shimmer in a light-distorting way that made it much less clear than had the very clear wings, body, and tail section of the jet aircraft when it was watched at about 22:05 for comparison to the 20:15 &#39;AAO&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both observations of the identical &#39;AAO&#39;, when overhead the angular distance from white globe of light to white globe of light (&#39;wingtip&#39;-to-&#39;wingtip&#39;) was about 120 minutes or arc (2 degrees), and I had a ready comparison because the crescent moon (about 28 to 30 arc minutes) was still in the north-west (although nearer its horizon) during that second and identical observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clouds above an aircraft seem to amplify aircraft sounds to a ground observer, but although it was overcast during the 20:15 observation, even then not a sound of any kind could be heard! I found that really a bit spooky because both things (or two events with the same single thing) were clearly under power, moving steadily and unwaveringly along precisely the same course in both observations. It was as if both had traveled upon the very same invisible track in the sky!  Let me be clear in saying that I suspect this twice-seen object of being some type of stealthy black-project aircraft (manned or unmanned) that is somehow propelled silently, but wonder at the wisdom of operating such a vehicle over this highly populated area within the Washington, D.C. Beltway. Oddly, _everything_ seemed so still and quiet during the two passages of the object(s) that I am reminded of reports of a similar phenomenon (&#34;the OZ factor&#34;) reported by certain observers of &#39;UFOs&#39; at close range, but would be cautious in saying it was the UFO-related &#34;OZ&#34; phenomenon because I must consider the possibility that I had &#39;perceptually isolated&#39; myself in listening for a non-existent sound from each &#39;AAO&#39; to the exclusion of not noticing other ambient sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Angular velocity of both &#39;AAO?&#39;s is roughly averaged at three degrees per second, if the observation time in each case was 30 seconds. If 45 seconds, then it might have been two degrees per second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there are any questions about the observations, do not hesitate to ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Ray Stanford, noted UFO investigator and author, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

One looked up and noticed an orange compact disc shaped object moving very quickly through the air.  It had a slight zig zag to it&#39;s movement.  Also, there was no exhaust trail.  There were no blinking lights to indicate an air plane, plus it moved in a way too erratic for any airplane or helicopter to move.  The center was not as lit as the outside edges were.  All of us saw the shape.  At one point, we moved because it was starting to go behind some trees.  Three of us went one way, two of us went another.  From about a hundred feet apart, all of us saw it until it disappeared into the horizon.<n>

I was flying a kite at the local park.  I saw a large metallic glow very very far in the sky.  I initially thought it was a satellite.  30 minutes later while I was realing in my kite I noticed the object again in the same spot.  Except this time, there were 3 smaller silver metallic objects very close to the larger one.  I was totally stunned and I knew something very strange was going on.  I dropped my kite and I stared at it.  A few minutes later I noticed the smaller ships were moving.  One of them totally disappeard.  The other 2 began to fly off away from the bigger ship together.  They were flying together off.  A cloud finally flew over and I waited for the cloud to move away.  5 minutes later after the cloud floated away, I could no longer see any of the objects.  This was very frightening because I have seen sattelites before in the sky.  This object was extremely high.  If they remained still one could almost say there were stars, but they began moving around and the smaller ones quickly flew away from the larger object.  I&#39;m being 100% totally serious here.  I cannot think of any military weapon that this might be.  It was obviously some kind of dock or &#34;mother ship&#34; and three smaller craft flew out of or away from the larger one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The craft seemed to be cloaked except for the lights, I know that sounds strange but thats how it appeared.  When we first saw the lights they were at an angle like it was tilted, then it straightened out to become level, and then quickly took off in a horizonal fashion, not appearing to go up, but traveling at the same height off the groung.  We were about 200 yards away, and the craft appeared to be approxiately 75 yards wide.  It took off very very quickly and no noise or sound was noted.<n>

At this point we were probably no more than 7 or 8 miles away from it.  The object did not appear to move the entire distance we were watching it. As we got closer to the object it appeared to have several white lights and not just one anymore, which were extremely bright.  When we came right up beside it or what would be parallel to it, the object seemed to be hovering over a field and had what looked like a faint light protruding off one side of the object that resembled a spot light.  As we passed the object we turned to view it from our back window a bright red light flashed on the top of the object and one on the bottom, then after a minute or so the lights began to flash all around the bottom of the craft, which made it appear to be spinning.  We continued to watch when all the sudden the craft quickly crossed the highway to what would be the passengers side of the vehicle, and caught up with us instantly.  After a couple minutes the craft disappeared behind the trees no longer in our sight, after doing so there was a glow of light beyond the area it disappeared.Thats what we saw!<n>

My piano teacher commented on how clear the sky was and started talking about the constellations. He asked which one was the Plough (Ursa Major), and I replied that I couldn&#39;t see it but that was the Orion and another constellation was the Pleiades. He did see where I was pointing but as I was doing so, an object, very high up in the atmosphere, (I could tell this because it was not luminous but had light dimly reflected off it, but it was 20:00 so it was dark in Colchester) moved at great speed across the sky. I exclaimed, &#34;Shooting star!&#34; but as the object reached the end of its travel, it swerved in a S shaped path, still moving at the same speed.The object appeared to be falling but that was a trick of perspective and in fact the object was travelling across the sky and into the distance. I have seen shooting stars on many occasions and I have also seen satelites in orbit as they pass overhead at dusk. This was moving extremely quickly and I know that in order for it alter its course it must be acted upon by a force. I am not saying it was aliens or anything but it was certainly something that was very strange and that I cannot attribute to aircraft, satelites or shooting stars. I was very excited and I was disappointed that my piano teacher did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I asked my partner if he was watching it and he said yes.  The lights were all of a greater relative magnitude than Sirius -- perhaps equalling or greater than Venus in brightness.  After about 5 to 10 seconds, the lights began to move eastward, accelerating rapidly and fading from view simultaneously (may have been receding?).  No aircraft in my experience has ever accelerated so quickly.  We believe it was one object -- though no details could be made out between the lights -- else the three separate objects would have had to have been maintaining a precise formation during acceleration.  Each of the observers have been flying aircraft for over 15 years, and neither of us had ever seen anything like this.<n>

The lights of the city, that usually blink as trees and such obscure their lights, at this time appear to be almost in sync with the pulsating of the lights on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights are a off whiteish color and they dim and brighten as the pulsating occurs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After telling my relative about the last sighting, I decided to get them to come and witness.  They saw the lights and had no idea was is causeing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contemplated that it may be stadium lights, but, the lights I am seeing do not occur for example, on any regular schedule as with games that would be held on weekends. The hieght of the lights is also to high from this distance to be stadium lights. The size of the lights is too big from this distance to be stadium lights. During the daytime, a telescope sighting of the area where I have seen the lights, shows no type of stadium light stands or any structure. So I have to rule this possibility out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not make out any shape of the object holding the lights, no outline or shape of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to take three pictures of the sighting with a polariod (only camera I have). The first two came out black except for a single small fuzzy white spot that is hard to see. The third picture, I attempted with the light setting on lightest, and this picture came out totally black.<n>

Spinning at about the speed of 15 miles an hour and the diameter was about 59 feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I do a lot of UFO searching I&#39;ve only come a cross about 3 in the month. The UFO&#39;s I&#39;ve spotted have the exact same detail as the last. The three I saw all had 5 lights.(about the size of a volkswagon beetle). All three also hover of the same spot the just fly straight into the air. The only thing I heard was a low humming of the engine. If there was traffic in the vescinity you wouldn&#39;t be able to hear it. I do most of my searching in the fields by an elementary school called Northridge Elementary but now they are putting up an apartment complex which makes me mad because that is where I get all of my sittings. The UFO had no bolts or seams. It looked like one piece of metal just shapped perfectly round. It didn&#39;t land but hovered about 30 to 40 feet of the ground. I have reason to believe this is the same UFO. I don&#39;t know what to do if I see it again. Should I take a picture or tape it or not even go near it. If you could send me the answers please e-mail me via internet at ((e-address deleted)). Thank you for reading this letter and I hope it is of much of help in your investigation. PS: No one believes me. This is not a hoax so please believe me or I wont know what to do<n>
3/6/03 02:00|Virginia Beach|VA|Triangle|three minutes|A jet-black triangle with white lights at it's corners and one flashing in the center which emmitted a haunting sound.|10/7/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32097.html|165|ndxe200303| A jet-black triangle with white lights at it&#39;s corners and one flashing in the center which emmitted a haunting sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming home in a friend&#39;s car from the 7-11 just up the street from my house late in the night when I first noticed the object.  From a distance it appeared stationary over my neighborhood with one extremely bright white light on each side of an equally bright flashing white light.  This was a head-on view of the object.  We continued down the street heading straight for it, still hearing no discernable noise from the object.  As we came up on it, the object was blocked out by a pine tree just a little further up on my side of the car, so we decided to stop right there in the middle of the sreet.  When the craft emerged from behind the tree in line with the car we were stunned at how low and silent it was traveling, it seemed to be just above the top of the tree making no engine noise at all.  This was when I got a full view of the craft, which appeared to be a jet-black triangle against the black sky with three brilliant solid white lights at the points and one flashing white light at the center.  As my friend and I watched the thing creep by, we tried fumbling with a disposable camera but it wasn&#39;t working.  The object seemed to have been going in a slow straight line for the entire time we had observed it.  When it passed directly in front of me I tried to get out and have a better look, but as soon as I popped the door and had a foot out, the object immediately veered to it&#39;s left and emitted a sound like nothing I&#39;ve ever heard.  The only way I can describe the noise is that it was like a chilling high-pitched scream, not like a jet engine which I&#39;m very familiar with living near military installations for my entire life, but a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  After turning, the object picked up speed and passed over the top of a house in a small court on my right and was gone.  We tried catching up with the object out on the main road and back through our neighborhood, but it was as if the thing saw us looking at it and then disappeared.  I estima! te the triangle was at least fifty feet wide on it&#39;s sides, I can&#39;t really judge the thickness of the craft having seen just mostly the underside, and I&#39;d say that it was at an altitude of no more than 100-150 feet, traveling parallel with the ground.  The object was in my plain view for about thirty seconds and observed altogether for about three minutes.  I have never seen or heard anything like it before or since.  A few weeks ago though I came accross some UFO footage and photos of the Belgium and France triangle flaps which exactly matched the head-on view and underside view and the lighting of the craft I saw.  Viewing the footage really helped put to rest the last remaining doubts I had about what I witnessed.  I credit this sighting with sparking my interest into the reality of UFO&#39;s, which I now feel can no longer be denied.<n>

It was at least as big as a school bus. It didn&#39;t seem to be made of anything solid, sort of like a black and gray cloud that moved like an octopus.  It came around to the side of our car and passed over the hood and windshield no more than 10 feet off the ground.  It made no sound at all. It followed us for about half a mile.  We couldn&#39;t see it anymore but we were spotlighted in a bright, white light.  It must have been above us.  Then it was gone.<n>

About a quarter mile away from my home when we suddenly saw 3 bright blue lights. My friend and I kept walking due to the fact we thought it was just a couple of airplanes. They are very common in New Hamshire. About two minutes after seeing the lights they suddenly zoomed across the sky in an unearthly speed.Then we knew they were not any normal planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/4/03 21:30|Clifton Park|NY|Unknown|2 minutes|Red lights in the sky over Clifton Park|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28000.html|168|ndxe200303| Red lights in the sky over Clifton Park<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have always been open to the possibility of extraterrestial life - I have never seen anything that I thought might be evidence of it.  My wife (the other witness) on the other hand is a staunch, hardcore disbeliever in anything of the sort.  This event has shaken her belief system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were lying in bed when she noticed strange red lights outside our bedroom. There were 12-15 red lights.  She describes them as being in a straight line - I saw them as slightly staggered.  The lights moved across our field of vision (south to north) at what seemed like a very slow pace.  The lights seems to be fixed relative to one another - although I thought I might have noticed them moving up and down slightly (could have been my eyes playing tricks on me).  The lights were VERY low on the horizon - so low that they were hidden from view when they moved behind the house across the street.  There was no sound accompanying the lights.  It took ~ 2 minutes for the lights to disappear from view.  They seemed to move at a more or less constant speed throughout the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds of &#34;what the hell is that&#34; conversation - I ran to get my video camera and went on the front porch to see if I could capture anything on film.  I pointed the camera at the lights and filmed the last 15 seconds - but unfortunatly I can see anything on the film when I view it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local new stations to see if they knew anything.  The woman in the newsroom at WNYT informed me that she had had other reports of strange lights near the Albany airport (~5 miles south of where I saw them).  Called back again in the morning and was told that they had made a few calls (meterologists, police, airport etc.) but could not provide an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only explanation I can think of for this event is that we saw navigation lights from a formation of planes way off on the horizon.  Some problems that I see w/ this explanation: -  That&#39;s just not what it looked like.  My wife and I discussed and dismissed this possibility as we were viewing the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -  Why didn&#39;t the folks at WNYT validate this explanation when they investigated? -  There was no sound.<n>

I saw one craft moving slowly, I estimate at the speed a dirigible ballon (eg Goodyear ballon) would travel or a helicopter. I estimate it was 2 miles from me ( I was at home, I live 22 floors up and have a good estimate of relevant distances to surroundings).  It was cigar shaped, 1 flashing white light on top centre, a red light at each &#34;point&#34; of cigar and a red light at bottom below the white light. What made the craft strange was that every few seconds there would be a blaze of extremely bright intense white/blue light that would stay lit for a few seconds. It covered a very large area of the craft, at least 50% I would say. When it switched off you could see some darker &#34;yellowish&#34; lights as if interior lights. I lost sight of it as it passed beyond my apartment building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to inquire at a local airport whether there might have been one, or more, blimps in the area on the date indicated.

It was clear at the moment and as I looked at the stars directly overhead I saw a &#34;V&#34; shaped formation of approximatly 12 to 15 lights traveling northwest. They were traveling very quickly, and silently, and in a few seconds were out of sight.  The individual lights though staying in formation seemed to flit around.  It made me think of a group of clear spheres flying in formation with a single firefly darting around in each one; if you can imagine that.<n>

It was impossible to be a projected light from the ground and too large to be from normal air traffic.  It pursated for about 90 seconds before I ran in to the office to inform a co-worker.  We went back to the spot I first witnessed the light, and it seemed to be gone. After several minutes of discusssing what I say, I caught it out of the corner of my eye.  It was the same light but it was sustained for at least 7-8 seconds, then dimmed down to nothing. It repeated agian several minutes later.  That was the last time it pursated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The light could not have been either Jupiter or Sirius, since both of them would have been to the east, or southeast, at the time of the sighting.  The only other possibility to be addressed would be the landing light on an approaching airliner.  PD))<n>

Both had altitude between 5-10,000 feet -no clouds in the background-rich blue sky.As I continued to watch these objects in fascination for about 15 minutes.One of the objects moved off at the same altitude,heading southeast,towards Lake Ontario.There was no sound,and they had size way up there ! I then returned my eyes to the spot where the other still stayed almost stationary.I was in just a awe like state,wondering in my mind to identify this thing.Then after 5-8 mins.The second one started to move off.It headed off like the first one. In the sam! e direction-southeast.I continued to watch it move towards the east.What was most interesting in observation was I noticed no lights when it was closer to me.I would describe the objects to be the most brilliant white in colour your eyes have ever seen-no lights.There was low cloud cover towards the southeast. After about 5 minutes,the second object was about 2-3 miles away from my position.I could clearly see with the naked eye, as it was moving underneath the clouds.It looked like a white  &#34; light &#34; moving eastward.I then lost visual contact due to further distance.I could not believe in witnessing this daylight sighting.Though, I will NEVER forget ,what it was I had witnessed on March 3rd 2003[333].Due to this unusual daylight sighting and being totally dumbstruck.I did not run to get any witnesses to view this dramatic sighting.I must report to you that this was the first sighting witnessed, since August 3rd,2002.This was the beginning of a incredible year 2003-Mars and! Earth&#39;s closeness in 60,000 yrs August 27th,2003.Not to menti! on 15 mo re sightings later witnessed [18 witnesses] in 2003 that defied logic/and associated paranormal activity on the ground.Added by a three foot flying snake like creature at camp.Also in deep shock to confirm on August 13th 2003 of being taken as a child 1963-1965.<n>

I called to my girlfriend to come and see, as she came to the door we both saw a large circular structure or sphere with bright white lights on the left and right sides, red at the bottom and a sort of blue or green at the top.

He called me all excited to turn on the news and see if there was anything about a UFO being reported in the south Florida area. He pointed it out to several workers and no one could say what it was. I asked him for the shape but he could not give me an answer, he said you could see it was a silver metallic color and every now and then there was red. He was ABSOLUTELY sure it was not a jet, also there was no comtrail. I had him hold his thumb up at arms length and it did cover it. It was moving very slow from the west to the east.

3/3/03 07:55|Houston (Canada)|BC|Other|approx: 1 1/2 mins|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large object parallels Truck on Highway #16 at approx: 300 - 400 feet away.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28024.html|178|ndxe200303| Large object parallels Truck on Highway #16 at approx: 300 - 400 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight on Friday, March 7, 2003 at approx: 8:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from two local Houston, B.C. residents who wanted to report something very strange they had saw on March 3, 2003 at approx: 7:55 a.m. The two witnesses were at the same location here in town when they made the call to me here at HBCC UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason why the witnesses decided to tell their story was due to the newspaper articles which ran on the UFO Survey, and myself in out local newspaper this past Wednesday. They also told me they both spent sometime trying to make up their minds if they should actually call me over what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing one of the fellows said to me was, &#34;my buddy and I saw something very weird the other day, and are still questioning ourselves over what we saw&#34;. He went on to say there was himself and his friend in his truck travelling along highway #16 just east from Houston, B.C. Since it is getting lighter earlier these days, the fellows witnesses this object in the daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before they got to Perow, there is a large farmers field which runs for a long way, and also runs along side the highway with a buffer of trees between the field and the highway. His friend was the passenger in the truck and first noticed a large object paralleling them along the highway. The driver looked at the speed they were travelling and said he was doing approx: 50 kilometers an hour. The distance between the witnesses and the object would have been approx: 300 to 400 feet. So they both had a very close up look at it. (keep in mind there were the trees in between the truck and object which did hinder the view at times). Also the field drops down somewhat below the highway, so the forestry workers did not get a good look at the bottom of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both described the object as looking like an &#34;Air Stream Trailer&#34;, and the size was close to the a Greyhound Bus. It was metallic in color, and no other features could be seen on it. No lights, windows, nothing !! The object stayed straight across from their truck as they drove along, as I mentioned above. It paced their veicle !! The passenger had rolled down the window to see if he was able to hear any sound coming from this object, but none was heard, it was silent. After approx: 3/4 quarters of a kilometer the craft turned slowly away from the highway, wobbled slightly, sped up, wobbled once again and then shot off out of sight very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: Since the object was so low, and on the other side of the standing trees, I asked if they had observed any moment in the trees. Such as any disturbance which would have moved the tress in anyway. None was noticed. Something else I should add. When the witnesses mentioned that is wobbled, one of the fellows said it was like looking through a heat wave, which gave it a look as if it was slightly wobbling. Also both of the man made comments to one another, saying it was so strange and not a normal aircraft as it had no wings on it&#39;s body. He also mentioned due to the type of work he is involved with he had made many trips on different aircraft, and what he and his friend saw was &#34;no&#34; aircraft they know of.  I am also going out tomorrow to grab some pictures of the area where the sighting took place. I hope to have some drawings and more information after I sit down and chat with the two witnesses over the weekend.

We were silent and watching the sky looking for falling stars, when my roommate noticed a big light high in the shy north of us. First we thought: a comet or something. But suddenly that one bright light became to less bright lights, and they were fast moving troughout the sky, they made a cirle-kind shape. suddenly they stopped and the light vanished. we could see them clearly now. It were two very smooth airlined silver aircrafts, and i mean silver,shiny metal. you could see the light of town ond the bellow of the ships. and then as suddenly as they appeared, they disappeared with a bright trail, probably the engines. The first few moments we didn&#39;t believe what we just saw, i am (was) not realy a believer, but this thing we have seen was definatly something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The time would be approximately 14:00 hrs.The weather was fine and dry, bright sunshine and a slight breeze. I was enjoying the view out to sea when I noticed an &#39;object&#39; traversing from my left hand side, the &#39;object&#39; had the following characteristics: SHAPE= CYLINDRICAL::LENGTH OF OBJECT=40 FEET:: DIAMETER OF OBJECT=4 FEET::DISTANCE TO OBJECT=1000 YARDS:: HEIGHT ABOVE SEA LEVEL=300FEET::COLOUR=DARK GREY/BLACK,NO REFLECTIONS OFF SURFACE, I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH ANY OTHER FEATURES FROM MY DISTANCE.The object reminded me of the long advertising banners which can be dragged along behind a light aircraft, however there was no aircraft pulling the object, I heard no noise and saw no signs of propulsion. The cylinder took about twenty seconds to move across my field of vision, It travelled at a steady speed, which I would estimate at about 50 mph.It stayed at the same height, I lost sight of it because of distance. I am certain that the object was not a plane, boat, kite, weather balloon,flock of birds. I have no idea what the object could have been. I have heard no reports of any other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 44 years of age, Electrical engineer, I have never seen an object like this before. I have an open mind regarding &#39;UFO&#39;s&#39;, but do not feel comfortable as describing this object as a UFO- I cannot explain what I saw, but I am afraid that until I personally shake a little green hand, I shall enjoy a healthy scepticism<n>

I saw this unknown object as I was faceing the south behind two homes while I was on patrol of a gated community in the heart of dallas. I had just hit a electonic key post when I happened to look up and noticed a solid black triangle apparently floating across my field of view. the object seemed totally silent and appeared to be approximatly about eleven or twelve hundred feet high. I watched disappear behind one of the homes and did not see it further.

But i believe that i have seen some of them in the sky in the middle of the night. My sister has a flat  in Istanbul Besiktas. We can see a beautiful panaroma of Istanbul from wide windows. -nearly half of the Bossphorus we may see - Last nigt while i was sittingn at the balkony for smoking i saw a half ligtning disk shaped object fastly moving from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One can see 30 or 35  miles of the  Istanbul  city Panorama from my sister&#39;s flat. It moved across the istanbul to the north  in three second  period of time . Its speed was about 6 0r 8 miles in a second.  It was the most beautiful thing and fascinating speed a human could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 40 minutes later i have seen two lithning balls fastly fallowing each other across the Bosphorus. One was turning around another one . They were shining like diamonds and They were looking  like a ball.  They were magnificent. I believe nothing can be so surprising and beautiful  on the earth. And  no man can imagine somthing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness may imply a date of either March 2nd, or February 3rd, depending on whether he uses the European style of indicating the date.

What attracted my attention was the intensity of the light and the flashes, not twinkling like a star as seen through the atmoshpere. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and did not move and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at the object through my binoculars, red and blue or blue/green flashes could be clearly seen. At about 2330, the object seemed to move away as it got smaller in size and the intensity deminished until it could not be seen. This process happened slowly over a period of about 5 minutes and as it moved away, it only dropped in elevation by 1 or 2 degrees. The night was clear and cold with stars readily visible and just a hint of fog above the water of Hood Canal. At 2345, the object again became visible but was further south and west of its prior position at about 25 degrees above the horizon. The object very slowly moved west as if the Earth was rotating under it, but the change in position was faster than the Earths rotation. The flashing lights were still clearly visible. I referenced other stars visible from my location but none had the flashing lights. At 2353 and at about 20 degrees above the horizon, the object again slowly started moving away until about 0012 at about 15 degrees above the horizon it finally faded from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the report above to protect the anonymity of the witness, who was located at, or near, the Bangor Submarine Base, located approximately 25 miles west of Seattle.  We suspect the witness may have been observing the star, Sirius, but that is a guess.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hi Peter:<n> <n><n> I met you once when you came to Bremerton years ago for lunch. I was the person that gave you the article about Bob Dribble ((sic--Gribble, founder of NUFORC)).  As for the object I saw, it was back the next night at about the same time but not as intense.  It was also further to the East and at about 35 to 40 degrees in elevation. I don&#39;t know if I was looking at a star or not.  All I can say is that I don&#39;t think stars fade out and then return, I.E., appears to move lower in the sky, fades out, moves west and higher in the sky and fades back in.  I do know the sky around here are crowded. In 1984 when the wife and I first moved into out newly erected mobile home, we were out on what was to become out lawn, sitting in lawn chairs just looking up at the beautiful starlit sky when 2 of the stars moved off to the NW (I don&#39;t know if it was one ship of 2 moving together) followed about 5 minutes later by 2 more to the NW which was followed about 10 minutes later by 2 more exiting to the SW.<n> <n><n> Take care my friend and keep up the good work, hopefully some monetary gain will eventually come of your efforts.

I was in my back yard there was a bright yellowish light flying in a stright line almost directly overhead across the sky from the North traveling South at very high speed, there was no sound. I did not see any structure to the object which suggests that it was pretty high up, it was just a bright yellow light. After that object passed by and disappeared in the horizon about 2 minuets later another one that looked exactly the same passed by following the same exact path as the first one and traveling at the same high speed. Again there was no sound which suggests that these were not just airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/1/03 21:00|Burley|ID|Triangle|45 min|We saw a very large, slow moving craft.|9/24/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31624.html|187|ndxe200303| We saw a very large, slow moving craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and my wife were driving back from Pocatello. We were about to the raft river area on Interstate 84. I saw what I thought at first was perimeter lights to a house or a compound. The lights were on the right hand side of the road and seemed to be on top of a hill in the distance. However, after seveveral minutes, the lights stayed at their relative distance and hight. I then pointed the lights out to my wife. She thought, as I did at first, that the lights were perimeter lights or possibly lights from night skiing. Pomerel mountain was too far distant for this to be the case. We then both noticed that we were gaining on these lights. As we got closer, we could make out about 15 to 20 lights. Our speed was 75 mph at that time. When we got to the top of the incline we were traveling on, we at first lost sight of the lights. We then noticed the lights on the left side of the highway. It had crossed the highway. We could see it in a valley across from us, and we slowed to its speed, about 67-68 mph. It was about 500 to 1000 feet off the ground. At one point I could see under it and it had the outline roughly of a triangle with the courners rounded. It lit the sky above it, and it was dark grey beneath. It was at that point about less than a mile from us. I guessed it size to be about 200 to 300 feet across the back of it and about 150 to 200 feet from front to back. It was about 30 to 50 feet thick. The lights on top were all of the same color, about that of a mecury vapor lamp. We also noticed ,after the fact, that there are many farm houses and dairies in this area that this object was over during the time it was on the left of the highway. None of those lights were on as it passed over that area. It finally passed behind a mountain range. As it did, it lit up the profile of one of the montains. It was traveling south towards Nevada. My wife saw the same object, in the same place, at the same time, 2 weeks laiter to the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound or trail coming from it. It would have to have been taking off from the local airport; but the airport is a small one located far from where we saw the object. It had what appeared to be very small wings at midpoint on the fuselage colored red and black. The rest of the craft was silver. It was huge and noiseless. As we watched it move up towards a cloud I told my friend that it would not come out the other side of the cloud because too many people would see it at the slow rate it was moving. It did not come out of the cloud which is impossible for any aircraft we are aware of.<n>

We were going North on 395.  We approached exit 88, and I looked to my right (East) toward the apple orchard - that is when I saw it!!!!!  It above the apple orchard building (NOT the field) on RT 14.  It was square and triangular in shape - like a square that had 2 of the 4 points pulled away (place forefingers together and thumbs together - this is the shape) - like this &lt;&gt; - but all lines were connected together.  There were lights at each &#34;point&#34; in the square and a band of light blue lights that connected the 4.  The 4 lights were bright white, and the blue lights were moving around the craft.  I believe it to be the underside that I saw.  The sky was full of stars - in the center of the craft was blackness.  I yelleded at my husband to stop and go back so we could look at it.  We argued for a few minutes.  He was telling me that he couldn&#39;t because we would be late for work - he later admitted to being affraid.  He did not see it at all, but knew by my reactions that I did see something that he didn&#39;t want to see.  It was not moving at all - just hovering above RT14.  I heard no sound at all.  Looking at it from a distance of about 300 feet it looked to be 50 feet along all 4 sides (total feet 200 around the craft) this was NOT small at all!!!!!  I would have to guess a few foot ball fields large in size.<n>

That is the lights where not moving side by side as you would see on an aeroplane. No other lights flashed during the whole time. I saw these lights mabee close to 50°-60° up from where I was standing no noise was heard but the flashes where so strong that I had to blink my eyes every time they flashed.<n>
