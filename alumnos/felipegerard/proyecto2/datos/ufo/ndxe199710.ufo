Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly|6/2/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02813.html|1|ndxe199710| Summary : Saw an orange, round object in the northern sky under clear conditions. Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly through the air. It appeared something was falling from the bottom of the craft towards the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the UFO was witnessed by three other people and myself. We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said &#34;what the hell is that?&#34; The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. &#34;what the hell is that.&#34; My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times. I then assumed it might be a flare but it was traveling in a straight line. the object stayed visible for about 2 or 3 minutes before it slowly faded from sight. I am an office employee that works in Santa Ana. My friends work a right down the street from me.. This is where the sighting took place at. After debating what we had seen for two hours, none of us could come up with any rational explanation of what we saw. Thank you.<n>

They changed into two huge white kite like objects which then turned into two blimp-like objects  which then began to fly southeasterly at the same height and rate as commercial jets, but were much bigger. As I began to lose sight of them, I called my husband on the west side of town (20miles away). He  saw what appeared as a shiny orb traveling southeasterly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing in my backyard, around 10 in the morning, I saw what appeared to be a jet in the northeastern sky. It was climbing very high  and very rapidly. Suddenly,in the northeastern sky I saw what appeared to be papers caught way up in the atmosphere . They appeared to be swirling downward. These &#34;papers&#34; took the shape of two huge white kite shaped objects  moving together. These then seemed to turn into  two huge white blimp shaped objects that were moving southeasterly one following the other at about the same rate and height as passenger planes. The sun was now striking them making them appear shiny. I called my husband who was on the west side of towm ( about 20 miles away). He saw  a shiny orb that seemed to zig-zag. From his angle he may hane been looking at the two objects  one flying lower than the other. This happened at ten in the morning on a bright sunny cloudless day  and it seems to have gone unnoticed.<n>

I call it a ball because it appeared to be a small round object way up in the sky.  It was very dark on this Halloween night, and the sky appeared to be clear as all of the stars were shining.  This small round object glowed very dimly; I could barely see it.  It moved from the north to the south, from horizon to horizon in about 12 seconds, approximately.  I lost sight of the object behind the roof line of my home as it continued south.  This is the first unusual  thing that I have ever seen.  I am 45 years old and I have a BA and a MS degree from TCU in Fort Worth Texas.<n>

We left our plant downtown pittsburgh heading north east across the duquesne bridge on route 8/28 buypass for the 32nd street bridge. I was in the passenger seat and from the duquesne bridge we both saw and object at a distance further up the road. It was flat on the bottom and sloped to a near point on top. Driving closer we could see it was brown  about 100 feet up hovering above the rail tracks between the roadway and the HJ Heinz food plant. We drove almost beneath it. I could see more of it than he out my window. The bottom was a lighter brown seamless with three evenly placed half round protrusions. The rim had a lip which covered the protrusions from a distance.It was about 30-50 feet in diameter. The sky was clear. There was alot of morning rush hour traffic it would have been hard to stop and we never thought of it because by the time we realized what we just saw it was too late. When we turned right on the 32nd street bridge I looked out my window, it was gone. That evening I listened for some report on TV, there was none.<n>

(N.E.).  I was approx. 70 nautical miles S.W. of the Hobart VOR. on the 240 radial.  At around 1900 CST, I observed what I thought at first was a meteorite, and wondered why it didn&#39;t burn up like they usually do.  I remember saying to myself, &#34;Gosh, I could of made a wish on this one!&#34;  Then I thought it was going to make it all the way to the ground.  When it got to my altitude, it suddenly leveled off, veered slightly to the north, then turned and came directly at me, still at what I, out of lack of a better term, will call &#34;meteorite speed&#34;.  I was in awe, and remember thinking, &#34;nothing travels that fast!!!&#34; After a few seconds in awe, I was terror stricken, as I realized the object was on a direct collision course. My reflex reaction made me bank the plane 90 degrees, and pull back hard to avoid collision. (As if my 120 mph airplane could possibly avoid something that fast!?)  When there was no impact, or wake, or anything else, I turned around to see what it was, but it was gone.  I immediately went for my charts to find the frequency to call ATC on, to see if they had painted a target, but was so upset, and shaking, I couldn&#39;t look at my chart and fly the plane at the same time.  As for the size, and relative speed of the object, I can only make an analogy.  I have already compared it to a meteorite.  Assuming a meteorite appears about the size of a kernel of corn, held at arms length, then this object went from that size, when I first observed it, to about the size of a beach ball, held at arms length, when I maneuvered abruptly to &#34;avoid it&#34;. I am a commercial pilot with ten years, and several thousand flight hours of experience, and am certainly used to seeing lights in the sky, and judging their speed and altitude, for collision avoidance. I live near an Air Force base, and am used to seeing, and sharing the airspace with military aircraft.   I can say with certainty, nothing the military has, goes that fast.      If anyone wants to check the radar tapes, my transponder was on all the way, so there should be a good plot of my course.   I departed Roswell, N. M., at approx. 16:00 mountain time.   The tower at ROW will have a log with the exact time.   My aircraft call sign is N((Numbers))A.<n>
10/29/97 19:00|Childress (North of)|TX|Sphere|10 seconds|I submitted this report last week, but haven't seen it posted, so I thought it may have been lost in the shuffle.  Incidentally, as a c|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02838.html|6|ndxe199710| I submitted this report last week, but haven&#39;t seen it posted, so I thought it may have been lost in the shuffle.  Incidentally, as a commercial pilot, I have flown this route from Oklahoma City to Roswell, NM about 50 times.   Nothing like this has ever happened before. On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1997, I flew my three teenagers from Shawnee, Ok. to Roswell, N.M., to attend their Grandmothers funeral. (My ex-wife&#39;s mother)  I dropped them off at the airport, had my aircraft refueled, and departed Roswell at approx. 1600 Mountain daylight time.   (ROW tower should have the exact departure time in their logs.  My aircraft registration number is N9229A) I climbed to a cruising altitude of 9,500 feet, and settled in for the three and a half  hour, non-stop flight back to Shawnee, Ok.  The sun set about an hour later, and left me with a beautiful, star lit night, tail winds, and no turbulence.  Two hours into the flight, at approx. 1900 CDT, and about 10-20 miles north of Childress, Tx.,  (I was at 70 DME southwest of the Hobart VOR, on the 240 radial) I saw what at first I thought to be a &#34;falling star&#34;.   I was amazed that it didn&#39;t burn up in the first second or two after becoming visible, while traveling from an extremely high altitude, nearly vertical towards the ground.  I remember thinking to myself that I could have made a wish on this one!   The object descended vertically until reaching my altitude, when it suddenly leveled off, and while traveling from east to west, still at what I would have to call &#39;meteorite speed&#39;, veered slightly to the north, before arcing back to the south, on a direct collision course with my! aircraft.  I remember at this point, saying to myself in awe two or three times, that nothing goes this fast!!!    As the object approached my airplane at very high speed, it appeared to grow from &#39;shooting star size&#39;,  until it was about the size of a beach ball held at arms length, when I in a panic, banked hard to the right, (taking the object out of my field of view) to avoid a &#34;collision&#34;.   I never saw the object again after that.   I wanted to call Fort Worth Center (ATC) to see if they had &#34;painted any targets&#34; in my area, but was so shaken up by the event, that when I tried to find the frequency on my charts, it was simply too overwhelming to look at the charts, and control the airplane at the same time.  I was about 60 miles west of Altus AFB, so it is possible the control tower saw this same object.  I&#39;m certain it at least streaked from east to west that far.<n>

We would very much like to receive reports from other witnesses, if indeed they witnessed the event described below.  There must be hundreds, or thousands, of other witnesses to this seemingly dramatic event; we find it unusual that we have received only one report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dawn arrives ahead of schedule [from the West] over a remote Pacific Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 27 October 1997, 9:42pm A black night, low cloud, light drizzle. From the west, below the horizon a light lifts steadily and quickly, like dawn, but much faster. Lights up the entire sky but no object discernable because of the cloud. Lagoon waters turn blue, like day. Birds fly startled from the trees.  Roosters crow. The light passes overhead then up and away (rather than bending over the opposite horizon}. At least 200 witnesses, including the Director of ((deleted)) ever read of, never mind seen, anything similar. Like dawn breaking at high speed in the middle of the night. Some say they saw a blue light. A group of football players, resting after a practise match, say they felt a strong rush of wind as it flew past. One guy saw it while out in the ocean fishing and jumped for cover under his boat. Seasoned merchant navy sailors, home on vacation, had never witnessed or heard of anything like it before. To this day no one has a clue as to what it could have been. Footage on tv of metorites entering the atmosphere, while spectacular, were nothing at all like this. Here the entire sky lit up, not just a portion of it. As the source of the light passed overhead there was a reddening low on the Western horizon, like explosions, things dropping into the ocean, burning, then blackness. Funafuti is a coral atoll, extremely flat, making visibility of all horizons very clear. The event took maybe 15 seconds it total. There was no noise. Tuvalu is 700 km north of Fiji, remote, and on no airline flightpath. Nothing like this had been seen [in Tuvalu] before, or since, at least not in living memory. If photographed, which it wasn&#39;t, it would probably look something like an artists impression of the &#39;second coming&#39;, Watchtower style, but without the figures and trumpets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information from the source of this excellent report.  We will contact local authorities, in attempt to obtain more information.

It has been a few years since the event and no doubt some witnesses have moved on. Good guess, but no I am not the Director ((deleted)), although ((that person)) was sitting not twenty feet from where I was and witnessed everything I did. I will try get ((that person&#39;s)) email address and pass it onto you.<n> <n><n> Tuvalu is a really small place and in 1997 there were no newspapers, so no written reports to the best of my knowledge. As you can imagine it was the talk of the town for a few days then back to normal routine. If you are really interested I will put you in touch with a few people whom I know personally witnessed it and you can take it from there. A couple of days<n> <n><n> after the event I spoke to a few people who lived on one of the outer islands [Niutao] - about 100 miles North of Funafuti - and they said they had seen strange lights in the direction of Funafuti - so I gather from this that the event was local to Funafuti - even though it appeared [from Funafuti] to cover the entire sky.  Some have suggested a Nuclear explosion in French Polynesia - but that is 2000 miles away - and none were reported.<n> <n><n> Another theory is re-entry of the spaceshuttle but I doubt that would brighten the lagoon and startle birds. A very large meteorite skipping off the upper atmosphere perhaps, but how could bend over the western horizon and brighten the sky as it did. Its a pity about the cloud cover, but in some ways it added to the spectacle, - the source of light silhouetted the banded cloud (herringbone?) - and as it rose it looked like a curtain rising.  As people were watching the light I cast my eyes back to the West and that&#39;s when I saw what looked like a uniform explosion low on the rim of the western horizon.   In the days following the event a friend (another witness) tried to get in contact with the international press to tell the story but in those days Tuvalu had not yet been hooked up to the internet.  His name is ((deleted)) and currently lives in ((deleted)). I am sure he will not mind recounting his story to you. His address is ((deleted)), but he is not the fastest correspondent in the world. Meantime I shall try get you some other addresses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> regards<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((SECOND FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no problem in you featuring the article - that would be great - provided anonymity is<n> <n><n> assured. Once you have finalized the story I will alert some people in Tuvalu and point them to your webpage.  That may encourage and jog the memory of others. I would like, in particular, for you to get the &#34;((name deleted))&#34; story as he was on the open sea further to the East when it happened. His name is ((name deleted)) - I will find you his email. The ((deleted)) team story is also interesting as they were all resting, backs flat to an old ((deleted)), facing the sky. ((name deleted)) and I (and the ((name deleted--public employee) were sitting at Tuvalu&#39;s one and only hotel (the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel - which literally means the Lovely Sky Hotel) facing the lagoon and the western horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was about 10:00p.m. when I decided to put in a cd rather than listen to the radio. I was fooling with the stereo when two triangular crafts just above the treetops caught my attention. You must understand that the view I received didn&#39;t allow for more than a glimpse. The crafts had amber colored lights on every angle of them. And you could barely make out the shape of them because they blended in with the rest of the night sky. Their size was about 100 feet across. Speed must have been about 35 m.p.h. No noise was heard. It&#39;s funny cause when I spotted them I said, &#34;What&#39;s that?!&#34; &#34;Do you see that?!&#34; and my friend said they were just helicopters. They floated right above the treetops very slow and all I caught was a glimpse.<n>

This object started moving in a straight path overhead, but then made three radical changes in a north-northwest direction while moving at the same incredible speed.  To my knowledge, no jet can make those manuevers and satellites must travel a fixed path in orbit.  The entire event lasted around 5 seconds.  No weird lights, just what looked like a brighter (larger?) than normal satellite making a crazy pattern in the sky unlike anything should be able to do physically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a fund-raising consultant who works to help non-profits and churchs raise money for capital campaigns.

It was traveling very fast towards the ground in a straight line.  It was only visible for approximately two secods then it disappeared above the ground.  It was&#39;t a plane or anything else known to us.  We are a retired married couple in our fifties.  My husband used to be a truck owner-operator and I was a secretary before we retired .  We have never reported anything like this before.<n>

Witnessed by several people in daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, 10/24/97 at approx. 6:00pm (Mountain Time).  Continental Airlines flight #1807 from Houston to Phoenix.  Shortly after takeoff witnessed a black, semi-matte, metallic craft fly right past the airplane through the window.  It was traveling east - opposite direction of the plane - and was visible as it flew past for about 6 seconds.  Size and distance from plane couldn&#39;t accurately be determined, but it was incredibly close to the plane. It had a triangular upper half, but the lower half was rounded and dome-shaped.  This occured at 28,000 feet (the pilot had announced the plane&#39;s altitude only minutes before.)  3 to 4 other people also witnessed the object as it flew by.  It was daylight and it was clear enough to see the object had definate edges and form (i.e. it wasn&#39;t just a dark shape seen out of the corner of the eye.) The observer has had past training in local law enforcement as well as some FBI training, and would not be described as a typical believer in such things as UFOs.<n>
10/24/97 15:00|Musquodoboit Harbour (Canada)|NS|Other|45 secs +/-|H shaped craft seen in daylilght hours 9 years ago in Musquodobit Harbour area of Nova Scotia.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48610.html|19|ndxe199710| H shaped craft seen in daylilght hours 9 years ago in Musquodobit Harbour area of Nova Scotia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During a fall afternoon, when I had my son who was only four at the time, to a small park where there were swings, teeter totters, slides etc, and we left to take a short drive up along the Musquodoboit River, which is in Central-Easten Shore of Nova Scotia, near the Atlantic Coastline, approximately 45 degrees latitude.  It was about 3:00 pm in late afternoon when I was going to drive up to a favourite fresh water spring that is about 6 miles NorthWest from the small coastal community of Musquodoboit Harbour which is situate about 35 miles east of Halifax, Nova Scotia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too far away is a major International Airport, known as Halifax International Airport and it would be approximately 12 to 15 miles from where I saw this craft, and it is important to note that I did see other aircraft in the air on this afternoon, which were visible as they broke through the clouds on either landing or takeoff from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date was on or about October 24, 1997 and as I was about 5 miles northwest of the community of Musquodoboit Harbour, something caught my attention on the North Side of the Highway low in altitude and I would estimate it to be about 200 to 300 ft in the air, although, it very well could have been higher as it is hard to reference size without having two known points to triangulate.  What astonished me is the shape of this craft, it was like two long partly clyndrical, partly square like cylinders with a large round midsection joining the two cylynders, almost like the letter H.  It was metallic with dark colours (possibly shadows away from the sunlight, and the clouds were scattered in otherwise a partly sunny-partly cloudy day.  This craft was very slow moving and moving in a easterly direction and slowly dissappeared beyond the trees that I could see.  There seemed to be some kind of ribbon like things hanging down from this craft, for approximately 30ft +/- near the midsection of this craft.  The actual length again is hard to judge based on what distance the ship was from me.  I would estimate this craft to be about 200 ft in length and the mid section joining the two fuselages to be approximately 50 ft or about one quarter the length of the cylydrical-partially square shapped fuselage.  There was NO SOUND being emitted from this craft and it was just drifting slowly.  I do not know if others may have seen this or not, but I do know there were a rash of reports of people seeing strange objects in the sky along the entire eastern shore that particular month, but what differs in what I saw, it was daytime. I have a background in Land Surveying and often used takl trees, towers, etc, as reference points to triangulate approximate distances or directions, but on that day, I had no theodilite and no way to measure, so my dimensions at best are pure estimation.  This craft was flying in the opposite direction of what an airplane would be flying on approach to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told immediate family members, but no-one else at the time, as I feared being made fun of and have nothing to collaborate my story, except my very vivid memory of this incident that lasted for approximately 45 seconds +/-.  I tried to make sense of what this was, perhaps a large airplane flying low with some type of mirage or reflection off a low cloud, but it was flying far too slow to even keep an aircraft airborne.  I cannot recall if this craft actually flew out of sight at the treeline, or just vanished as quick as it appeared, but it was moving in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attempted to draw what it looks like, and have superimposed it on a tree with clouds in the background to give others perspective of what I have seen.  Is it from another world?  Is it a manmade aircraft being experimented with?  I don&#39;t have the answers, but do know, that I saw something, and it will forever be etched on my memory for as long as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was waiting for the traffic from the parking lot to subside, when I happened to look up, towards the southwestern sky. Up, almost directly overhead, was a cluster of lights, in a &#34;rounded rectangle, almost oval&#34; form. They were an odd color, kind of a frosted raspberry. Though I believe that it was one object, it may have been one object for each light. It looked motionless, then moved very slowly in a northerly direction. It was rather far up, and I could detect no sound. Suddenly, it was gone. Though it seemed as though the lights simply blinked out, somehow I could tell that whatever they were attached to had moved away. There was a very slight trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did I mention that this object seemed to be quite large? When I got home, I called the local airports and blimp station, and was told that there had been no blimp or other advertising-based air activity that evening.<n>

I have worked on many types of Aircraft, military and civilian. So I know my aircraft by sight and sound.  I have never seen anything like this before and I got a very good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a shiny silver, like polished aluminum, completely round along the horizontal plane and yet about 1/3 that size in the vertical. To me it seemed about 50 feet in diameter. What really shocked me was it&#39;s flight characteristics. I flew manuevers I have never seen any plane accomplish and it was completely silent. It I was not looking directly at it... I would have never noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came over the mountain tops over the edge of the ridge, so it could be seen clearly from the valley where I was standing. It then abruptly turned a 180 and headed directly back over the ridge. But what was really amazing was during the 180 turn it also completely flipped over on it axis! So it was basically heading back over the ridge on its bottom...or upside down. If there is a top and bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, this short sighting was very profound to me. Since I know planes and this was nothing I have ever seen and the propellants produced no noise....whatever it used. That too was shocking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there it is...I know what I saw and it was very clear, though very brief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really shocked me later, because I live in a small community we tend to know all our neighbors. Where I live they are mainly cattle ranchers. They run them on open range up there on the mountain tops. We had two cattle mutilations reported up there over the years... I really was blown away when I learned this...because it seems just like other reports. I found that to be very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me impress upon you.... I am a very honest person... I strive to be all my life...this was no hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can easily verify my story about the mutilations...the local law went up there and documented the cases. It was later in our local papers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have been a UFO fanatic since i was very young, and still am.  The sun was on the horizon, giving the sky an orange-yellowish color.  The three objects were moving in various angles, shapes, and speeds.  at some points, they would move halfway across the sky in almost no time at all.  I observed them with my normal vision before i got my binoculars.  when i looked at them more closely, their shapes did not change, making me almost certain that they were circular or spherical in shape.  As i watched further, i noticed that they were almost playing around.  One would stay motionless in the center, while the other two would move in almost perfect circles and/or ovals.  Almost sparatically, one of the UFO&#39;s instantly disappeared from sight.  Mind you, these objects were way above the treeline, so it must have escaped at a tremendous speed.  the other two UFO&#39;s continued their flying routine, and sometimes would have one of them revolve almost perfectly around the other, motionless one.  At some points, they would disappear and then reappear at a different area in the sky.  what was strange was that they were both orange, which im guessing was because of the sky&#39;s color.  But what didn&#39;t make sense was the fact that the shape and color of the ships were so easy to distinguish in the sky.  they should have been hard to be spotted, but they were visually clear even by the naked eye.  I could only stand and watch in awe, and i knew that i was too young to have my parents let me use a camera of any kind in the house.  Then, the most amazing thing happened.  In the middle of the revolving dance, the center object began to grow larger, and it&#39;s glow became much greater.  the other object then flew right into the other ship and disappeared.  the remaining UFO then began to move in violent yet beautiful circles.  And then, just like that, it disappeared.  to this day i haven&#39;t forgotten a single detail of what i saw that day, and i h! ave been waiting to tell this story for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I first learned of what was going on from a radio DJ on KROX stating a strange object is being seen in that area. From my location in North Austin, I noticed several military jets flying at very high speed at low altitude towards the object. I drove towards the location of the Walmart shopping center and saw a blue/green diamond object in the sky with the military jets circling it. I know hundreds of people in North Austin and Round Rock saw this take place. After an hour or so, the object disappeared and so did the military jets in the sky. In the summer of 1999, I saw news story on one of the local Austin TV stations, of a farmer in Williamson County, finding a military jet top canopy, in his drained cow pond, and he was clueless how this part of a military jet ended up there. That story was never seen on TV again, it could be that one of the military jets flying around the UFO crashed that night,and the pilot ejected, but the canopy of the jet was not found because it was submerged in the cow pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The night was clear, and in the sky in front of us a light appeared, followed by four more lights, all the same distance apart, all in a row.  They stayed stationary for about 3 min.  then they all went out, at the same time.  My husband and I were trying to figure out what we had seen, when the lights appeared again on the far left of where they had been before.  They appeared in the same manner, they came on one after the other.  Same distance apart and in a line.  Off again, and almost instantly, they were to the far right of us, in the same line, same distance apart.  The lights were a golden color, not like a regular color of light. While they were in the sky they were stationary.  I would have told someone about this earlier, but it was just to strange.  And I didn&#39;t think it was inportant, until I saw a show on TV last night about Aliens.  I thought even though it happened over a year ago, I felt like telling someone. Thank you for your time.

First when I was in elementary school, maybe 7 or 8 years of age. The first incident took place when I was on my way to school in the morning. I was the only kid at the back of the bus. It was a sunny day in my hometown. Through the emergency window, the large window-like door at the rear of the bus, I was watching the sky, when something of an anomaly caught my eye; a bright object was flying in the sky, seemingly controlled by something as it moved. I can&#39;t exactly remember if it was following us, or if it was just moving around in one region in the sky. The only way I can describe it is that it was a large bright orb, almost like I was watching a miniature sun that was moving, and I could look at it without it burning my eyes or anything which, as a kid, or an adult for that matter, was and is quite impressive. It suddenly vanished (the whole event only took maybe 30 seconds to a minute) then came back, almo! st like a light turning off then turning back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another few seconds of watching it as we drove away, it vanished again, and I never saw it after that. Because I was the only one at the back of the bus and because everyone else was looking out the side windows in their own seat in the middle and front of the bus, I suspect I was the only one who saw it. I never told any of the other kids as I was quite shy in my childhood; I&#39;m sure you can imagine how hard it would be for a young and shy child to bring up UFOs.  At the time I didn&#39;t even know what UFOs were, to other kids.<n>

It was doing a little moving and had one light on and all of a sudden the light just shut off and it took off faster than I had seen anything in my life.  My parents said it was probably a airplane, but airplanes don&#39;t move that slow in the air, otherwise they would crash.  I think it was a UFO, but knowing the government, it could have been a top secret type of aircraft.

On October 17 of 1997 two friends and I were driving west on a county road (318) just outside Ignacio, Co. This road is heavily traveled and is on the Ute reservation with a mountain range parallel on the southern boundary...the road then descends into a pronounced canyon before meeting the major HWY 550 Corridor from Aztec to Durango.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this evening at about 8:17 p.m.we had just gone four miles west and looked up in the sky towards the southwest and above the mountains....and pulled to the side of the road to listen and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only one other car passed us going east at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very ,very large triangular shaped &#34; ship&#34; with extremely long &#34; pole/legs&#34; was moving to the southwest....and within these pole/legs were a pink and very red swirling energy of light and motion...as if the poles were &#34;sucking up the matter/plants/dirt of the hills and mesas near the mountains. There was absolutely no sound and the size and scale of these legs and &#34;ship&#34; are still beyond my memory&#39;s ability to compute. My friends and I just kept asking what it was...and kept watching and not believing the size of the objects in our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove three more miles west to get another perspective and to see if the ship was moving...we then saw two smaller (relatively speaking) triangles a little higher in the sky and definitely moving southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger ship was perceptibly moving and I used a fist measurement I learned from someone to gauge height in the sky...I counted seven fists high the one pole/leg nearest us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove two more miles west to look back...again no sounds, no airplanes overhead, no animal sounds....and we could look back and see all three pole/legs from that view....the legs were so long/large that it appeared that two tornado shapes on top of each other were swirling and picking up matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove into Bondad canyon and slowed to look back and could not see the objects any longer....and when we reached Hwy 550 and looked east toward the mountains and the canyon...there was nothing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then drove south to our river home and looked back from the driveway....and saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother in Albuquerque (167 miles away) just to see if anything was on the news....and we tuned into local radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the airport in Farmington, NM and the college observatory the next day...and nothing had been reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends have really never referenced this event again...and for twelve years I have carried a sense of forever being changed by what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent years on the web looking for any other experience similar...especially the pole/legs whirling pink/and red tornado like motions....with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope I can speak at length to someone about this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aztec has a UFO site northeast of the city on Hart Mountain....when I look at the trajectory of the &#34;ships&#34; of October 1997....they were definitely running parallel to Hart Mountain.<n>

As I followed it with my eyes, I noticed an airplane a few hundred yards ahead.  My first thought was it was going to hit the plane (the light was much larger than the plane) then it vanished.  I looked around at the other moterist and they too were looking to the sky.   It was 8:00a.m. so it was bright outside.  The light almost seemed like a head light of a car but 100 times the size and light that it produced.  A minuture sun. The color was yellowish white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mother of two.

The sphere was hovering a few feet above my lower legs. Suddenly, the sphere, which appeared to be seemless, opened to reveal a camera lens about 2&#34; in diameter. I automatically moved my arms slightly away from my torso,as well as moving my legs slightly apart, so that none of my body parts were overlaying or touching any other part. I laid very still with my eyes open, while the sphere scanned my entire body.I cooperated automatically, and I did not feel frightened at all. It moved from my feet upwards to my head, slowly photographing/imaging every inch of me. It then settled back above my lower legs, closed it&#39;s lens, which left the sphere seemless, once again. It departed through the window,which was open,but there was a screen there. I immediately got up to brush my teeth due to a severe metallic-sulpher taste in my mouth. I called out to my father, who is a painter, and always works late into the night. When I went to find out why he did not answer me, I noticed that he was sleeping on the couch! Yet, at the time of the scanning I could hear him taping his paint brushes against the water can, he uses to rinse his brushes. I awakened him, only to find that he was not sleeping, but almost in a paralyzed state. After several minutes, he sat up and I told him what had just happened to me. He reported to me that he was painting when he suddenly experienced the most excrutiating headache he had ever had, and had to lay down on the couch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the father submit a report, as well.

We were standing on a hill and I looked up towards the trees, and saw a very bright light. We looked closer, and it was 3 very bright lights in triangular form (triangular craft) It didnt look too far away, and was close to the ground, and did not appear to be moving. After a few minutes it started to slowly hover towards us. We got very scared and ran behind some trees and watched it get closer. We watched it for a few minutes, and the VERY NEXT MOMENT we were not where we were the very moment before, we were standing together on top of the hill where we were before ducking behind the trees, looking straight up in the sky, watching a jet at NORMAL elevation flying overhead. Did not have a watch, but missing time associated with abduction was probably accountable for the experience.<n>

I was at a friends house and we were playing video games. We were in the middle of the game when the electricity went off briefly, flashed back on, and went out again and stayed off for the duration. Several seconds after losing power, a very bright bluish light came in his front windows. My first thought was that a power transformer had exploded outside and the light s were fling sparks. It continued for about 30 seconds to a minutes slowling flashing on and off. It was actually bright enough to cast beams on the floor as the moon would. At the same time that the light was going on, a low &#39;humming&#39; sound was heard. It actually felt as though it was vibrating my body slightly. At the same time the &#39;sound&#39; cycled in time with the lights. Fading and picking up. When the incident stopped, the power returned. The game we were playing was actually &#39;saved&#39; and was not deleted when turned off. It  was not saved. The incident was quick enough that we observed it inside, but afterwards we went outside to seeif there was anything left. His neighbors were all outside as well, and nobody knew what happened. There was no exploded transformer, and nothing on the power poles that could have produced the light. All that I actually witnessed was power loss, light, and &#39;noise&#39;. Several days later, I talked with my brother who lives in Festus MO. Without telling him what happened, he went on to tell me that the same night, he saw something strange while in Arnold MO. (about 15 miles south of the city limits, 20-22 from where I was) He said something to the effevt that he saw whar looked like &#39;colored lighning&#39; in the sky to the north of where he was. Like I said, I did not see much, but the entire incident was very unusually and left a mark on my mind. The friend I was with and I continue to refer to it as the&#39;unexplained phenomenon&#39; when we speak of it. I wonder if anyone else reported anything that night. Like i said, other people on the street were outside afterword, and we all wondered what had happened. I never heard anything in the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a clarification on the date, since the witness indicates that 15OC97 is an approximate date. The events seem reminiscent of the dramatic sighting that occurred over western Illinois and St. Louis, MO, on 04JL97.))<n>
10/15/97 22:00|Alvarado|TX|Chevron|30 secs|"V" Shaped craft over Night Sky in Alvarado TX. Oct. 1997|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32474.html|45|ndxe199710| &#34;V&#34; Shaped craft over Night Sky in Alvarado TX. Oct. 1997<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10pm my wife and I were returning from Ft. Worth, TX. I was pulling into the driveway which faces west. The sky was clear and dark except for the stars which shone brightly against the black sky. We live in a mobil home which runs north and south. We have a security lamp on the electric pole which illuminates our driveway near the house. Even before I completly stopped the car, I could not help but notice something EXTREMELY LARGE passing slowly over our house. We both got out of the car and uttered virtually the same words. &#34;What the Hell is that?&#34; Moving from South-West to North-East about 10 miles an hour was some huge flying craft. It was difficult to estimate size because it&#39;s only illumination was about seven glowing white lights along the wings in the front of the craft. In other words one light was centered at the nose and four down each wing. The craft was &#34;V&#34; Shaped like the front of a stealth fighter. It was enormous. I have since held my thumb up to the sky as a passing Commercial airliner flew over which easily covered the Jet. I believe the Jet was in the neighborhood of 3 thousand feet. It would have required both hands in front of my face to cover this craft that we saw. It passed so slowly that I knew it was no jet. The stall speed of even a propeller type craft was not even being met. It made absolutely No noise whatsoever. It was not a helicopter. As matter of fact it was too large to be even close to size of any Balloon, Plane , Helicopter or anything else that I have seen Man Made and in fLight. FT. Hood at Kileen, TX. is in the Direction from which it came. It blanked the stars out of the sky as it passed over which is how that I could tell that it was &#34;V&#34; Shaped. It had no flashing beacon nor the standard Red and Green Port and Starboard lights nor the flashing beacon all of which you expect to see on PLANES and Helicopters. Of couse I take into account that these would not be present if the Military was flying a secret &#34;STEALTH&#34; craft over. I believe that th! is Craft was flying no more than 1 thousand feet up. With that guestimation, I would say that the width was at least 3000 feet across and 1000 feet long. It blanked out a considerable portion of the sky noticing the disappearance of stars and their reappearnace. We observed the craft some 30 seconds until I could no longer make out the shape. The white lights along the wings did not seem to cast light in front of the craft They were however, visible even after it had passed over us. I never heard anything about it on the news. I have since heard of simular sightings within months of our sighting. I was prompted to leave this account by Mr. Davenport&#39;s Radio visit to COAST to COAST listening on  KVIL AM 570 Dallas WT. Worth and subsequently on WKOI AM 1200 San Antonio as we recently drove to Shreveport LA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

It was just above my trees in the back of the yard. I turned to look at it and pointed it out to my friends. They saw it too. After the object blinked, it would move to a different place and blink again. We just stared in awe. We had never seen anything else like this before. This happened for about 15 seconds. Then it disappeared. We walked around the yard to see if it went anyplace else. We found no trace of it again that night. About a year later (not sure what month), I was at a friend&#39;s house (a different friend from the other ones). She lives just out of town by a lake. I was staying the night at her house that night. She was in her room for a little bit while I was laying on the couch in the living room. It was about 12:30 AM. I looked out the window to the other side of the road that&#39;s by her house. I saw the same blinking light that I had seen about a year before. It was right in front of the trees across the street. I would say it was about eight or so feet above the ground. It kept flashing its light while appearing in different places. It disappeared after about ten seconds. I was so scared I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds. Then I finally had enough courage to open my eyes again. I looked back across the street and the same thing happened over again! It then disappeared again a short time later, and that was the last time I saw it. I was the only witness to see this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness seems to be an approximate date.  Report is from anonymous source.  PD))<n>

I am a Federal Police officer and I worked downtown in Washington, D.C. I decided to take off early that Friday night due to boredom when I arrived home at around 2115 hours.  All the lights were off in my house but my husband and eleven year old daughter were in the family room watching TV.  My husband (now ex-husband) went to take a shower while my daughter and I remained in the family room watching the TV. I decided to make hot chocolate for her and coffee for me in our kitchen which was dimly illuminated by the under range top light, when I heard my daughter tell me in a very startled voice, &#34;Mommy, come look at the lights!&#34;  I told her to hold on a minute while I finished making our drinks, but her voice became even more desperate almost pleading with me to come look at the lights, and finally she started crying and almost in a state of panic, &#34;look at the lights!&#34;  I thought she had turned the lights on in the family room because my kitchen lit up as if every light were on.  I turned around and couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I realized how brightly lit our family room was.  It was a very warm October night, about 68 degrees outside, so we had a few of our windows open, including my sliding glass door in the kitchen which leads to the backyard where my dog Cleo was.  Cleo is a black lab, doberman, dalmation mix, who weighs about 95 lbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her to wait inside while I went outside to see who or what was in my driveway.  As I walked outside, I noticed three circular lights at about tree level across the street at my neighbors house.  The tree was about 35 feet in height and the neighbors house was only about 20 feet high.  In relationship to my house and my driveway, the circular lights were approximately 75 feet from me and were intensely bright.  The circles of light were lined up horizontally and about 35 feet off of the ground.  The circle in the middle was large and appeared to be five feet or so wide, the smaller lights on each side appeared to be two to three feet wide and all three ligths were a combination of amber, cream and white.  A color that I have never seen before or since.  The lights gave off or emitted heat and there was a humming noise in the air.  When I walked out further to try and see what these lights were and where they were coming from, they moved quickly from horizontal to vertical, with the largest light still in the middle.  The larger light seemed to be gyrating or oscillating and the lights appeared to be moving closer to me in which the lights became even more intensely bright, almost blinding me and there was heat being emitted.  I didn&#39;t realize that my little girl had ran outside the door after me, so when I realized the lights were coming closer, and now I placed them at about 30 feet away from me the lights appeared to be like a &#34;beacon&#34; almost with a circular shape and almost to where you couldn&#39;t tell where one circle was from the other -- like they fused together.  I turned around and ran inside, not realizing my child was outside crying, I ran back out to get her and I got her inside when my dog and other neighborhood dogs started growling and howling and acting almost as if she were spooked or rabid, she busted through the screen door and began barking and snarling at the front door.  At that point I ran into the bathroom and pullled my husband from the shower with my hysterics about what my daughter and I were seeing outside.  By the time my husband got the soap out of his eyes and a towel on him, we ran out to the front yard where the object still was brightly illuminated in our driveway, when the lights separated into three discs and sped off at at a rate of speed that most conventional airplanes could do and at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle.  You could see a vapor trail of where they left because it was partly cloudy with the moon behind my house which is located in a southwesterly direction.  When the police arrived, some of my neighbors came out to ask me if I had seen or heard anything because their dogs were going nuts and my daughter and I explained what we had seen.  But my daughter saw it first so I have no idea of where they came from or how they descended to tree level.  I think the sheriff&#39;s deputy thought my child and I were crazy, but my ex-husband who really didn&#39;t get a good look at anything too much agreed that my child and I definitely saw something, particularly convincing was the fact that our dog busted through our screen door and didn&#39;t calm down until ten minutes after the lights disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Pulsing, single craft at EXTREME SPEEDS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a Fall night in 1997 I witnessed a pulsating object in the western sky. It was an extremely calm night. No wind. The object started out as a red light hovering very high in the sky. It stayed in that position for sometime. At this point it did not look suspicious. As we topped a hill, I called this object to the attention of all the members in our car. We stopped at the top and all 7 of us noticed a pulsing red light. It would also show some white pulsing. After about 10 minutes the object jumped across the sky due north. It appeared to travel at an extreme rate of speed. It burned a red light then shot across the sky. It also traveled up, way up to what seemed 40,000 feet or higher, higher than any aircraft we have spotted. It shot back at the same extreme rate of speed. The children were extremely frightened. This action did not seem reasonable for an airplane or any other known aircraft. We watched as it shot straight up and due north, then disappeared. I went outside later that night, the air was crisp and I noticed the lack of wind. I have spotted similar objects in the night sky, without the movement, always on calm nights without clouds or wind. I swear this sighting to be the truth. I am a teacher and would not have believed this had I not seen it with my own eyes. The exact date of the month I cannot recall, it was a week or so before Halloween. It started before sundown and continued for 10 to 15 minutes. Did anyone else see this? I was in central Texas and felt sure that any state west of us could have also experienced this. It was a single craft, with pulsing lights, red off and on. Very unusual.

What I saw caused a heart-racing thrill: Totally silent, a large, dark craft in the shape of a grid-like array (grid reminded me of iron pipework) was floating slowly toward the north over our house. It was low in the sky, about 800 feet up in the air, silent as I said, and in motion, as if it was carried on a breeze. It had no lights. I only estimated its shape by the pattern it took in blocking out starlight above it. I watched it for about thirty seconds, then got scared and went in the house.  Later that night, the regional news from Lexington reported a UFO sighting. But that one was video-captured; a dotted light in the sky.

I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn’t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn’t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that’s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn’t any missing time. Once it was gone from my sight I got in my truck and drove off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in highschool at the time, now in the military.  I am totally guessing on the year.  It had to be between 1997 and 1998.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was in the fall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 2 minutes later we lost it, but when we reached where we were going, we could see it again. My mom, &#34;one of the other people&#34;, said that it seemed like it followed us. When we left, about 30 minutes later, we could not see it anywhere.<n>

I sensed a weird feeling and looked up to the sky.  Above the tree tops, I couldn&#39;t make out what I was seeing, other than a fast blinking light steadily moving north to south.  No outline, noise or any other feature could be seen.  Almost felt like something was coming into our dimension via this burst of lights.  Just my thoughts at the time I remember.  I then looked back to were I started to see these blinking lights, and was startled to see higher up in the sky, and coming what looked like straight down, a V shape, only because  the lights were placed in this V formation--It then went from a downward flight pattern towards the tree tops to then bank and take a path of again North to South over the trees--Again I watched in amazement as it moved with not a single sound that I could hear.  And I couldn&#39;t really make out anything other than the lighting.  I was in awe, and just watched it until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My Friend called me outside to his front porch We saw a saucer shaped craft with 3 reddish orange lights in a triangle formation moving slowly southwards over the foothills near Boulder, CO.  The craft moved very slowly and made no sound.  It couldn&#39;t have been more than 1 mile away and must have been about 2000 feet altitude above us.  I&#39;ve grown up with Airplanes my whole life and I feel I&#39;m pretty good judge of these things.  We watched for a few minutes some of us watched thru a spotting scope.  It slowly moved into a cloud.  The Cloud was a fairly light wispy cloud and we could see it move in and out of the cloud. Then suddenly it vanished. I stayed out watching the cloud for nearly 45 minutes until the entire cloud dissapeared. The Cloud was not so large that I couldn&#39;t see it in it&#39;s entirity.  After 45 min or so nothing emerged from the cloud and the cloud had completely dissapated. At that time I quit looking.<n>

Newspaper is in Bristol, VA - TN (two states city).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am only going to give a general entry. The newspaper said sighting was seen south of Kingsport, south of Bristol in the direction of South Holton Lake, I live near I-81 exit 22 and it was southwest of my home.  My son and I saw a vertical silver object (bright as if the sun was refecting off it) with a tail like a jet but more dense and one and three-fouths the lenght of the object. It did not change location during the time we would look at it.  I would not have even thought anything of it but for the fact that WXBQ-AM morning talk show was talking about it the next morning and right at the end of the program someone said they had seen it around 7:00 pm.  The newspaper had not printed a time but if others who phoned the local police and airport saw it about the same time, the sun was going down and it was far from being dark. The paper said one caller with binoculars saw what appeared to be an illuminated crystal shape similar to a snowflake with a dark center and number of red spots darting around it.  A BVPD Sgt. ((Name deleted)) used same binoculars and saw &#34;It looked like a bery intensely bright star with fainter looking objects around it or something red emitting from it...but I didn&#39;t see it moving, it appeared stationary&#34;. I do not now if the other two area papers ran a story about this but they would be the Johnson City or Kingsport (TN) papers.  We also have three TV stations WJHL, WKPT and WCYB. I am 42, female, my son is 15.<n>

When I turned to see what was causing it, I saw a roughly rectangular object moving very fast in a ENE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object reached the south end and east side of a local hill, it abruptly changed direction, now heading NNW. After about 3 miles it stopped, without slowing, for about 2 to 3 seconds. Then it seperated into 3 smaller objects which headed ENE for about 8 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 objects then abruptly turned NNE before becoming too small to see. The 3 objects were evenly spaced as they moved, and the objects were about 400 to 500 ft in altitude. All were a dark charcoal in color with no visible lights. The 3 seperated objects seemed to leave a very brief streak in the lower atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more to this report that does not fit into the criteria set forth for the report.

It may have been a hallucination.  This is more factual than a dream of aliens in the woods or the moon shining through the trees and waking up in the leaves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe this occurred when I was in Junior High.  When I living in Simsbury, I was going to a family friends swim meet (I believe in New Britain or Bristol) maybe in October,  we were driving and it was getting dark in the sky.  I should have been sitting next to a rear window because when I looked out the window I could see a rectangular sized football field sized ship in the sky moving very slowly yet probably really high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it having very dark red lights or some sort of light source - I could view this clear enough within site.  It appeared to be the bottom carrier of some sort of massive ship.  I thought I was imagining this.  I checked with my friends family and they saw it too - we were all from the Simsbury area.  I believe they might have been &#34;playing-along&#34; with my hallucination and or imagination because it may have sounded quiet crazy to them - a media culture crazed dream separate from reality that some how seems to have manifested itself in my own personal delusions.  These fantasies of my own may have jumped out from my mind into the social consciousness of the car ride for reasons probably best forgotten if it was indeed a dream that I would not accept as merely fancy and nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other passengers agreed that they had indeed seen it as well, though to this day I still believe they were simply playing along to not embarrass the situation.  I still can see it in my mind till this day - slowly moving high up in the evening sky, practically dark except for this dark red glowing &#34;mother-ship&#34;.  I only saw it for about 5 minutes I think until it was out of view.  Maybe the invisibility shield which would make such a craft hard to see and or undetectable was being reset for mechanics or energy consumption.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never really thought anything more of it.  It was just too breathless to contemplate  whatever it was.  It felt like floating time.  I don&#39;t even now if this could have been photographed.  These instances seem to happen at odd intervals on some sort of schedule. I remember we were travelling in a van.  On the return trip after the swim meet it did not happen again.  This was so long ago.  I remember playing Super Mario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/97 15:00|New York City (Staten Island)|NY|Cylinder|2 minutes?|Metallic Cylinder Moving thru New York Harbor|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60316.html|59|ndxe199710| Metallic Cylinder Moving thru New York Harbor<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been bothering me for a long time. If someone can tell me what it is I&#39;d be grateful. In the 70&#39;s I had lived in a house in the St George section of Staten Island. It was a lovely old place, on a bluff overlooking New York Harbor. I moved from there in 1975 and the house, along with the rest of the block, was torn down in the late &#39;70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my birthday in 1997 I went by myself on a sort of pilgrimage to the site. The block had been turned into a parking lot and by 1997 the lot was not even being used. It was mid afternoon, sunny, I was sitting on a log on the site just looking out over the harbor. I saw a commercial jet coming up the harbor to my right and to my left I caught sight of a flock of seagulls. AND right behind the seagulls was a metallic cylinder, I&#39;d say about 10 feet long and maybe a foot round? ( I&#39;m not sure how to describe the measurements). If I had to guess it was moving at about 100 MPH. The sun was gleaming off the metallic surface. It was moving in a straight line at a steady speed going from Bayonne towards Brooklyn. I just watched it, fascinated. It flew UNDER the commercial jet so it could not have been too high up. Commercial Jets going up the Hudson are in their final descent to LaGuardia, so the jet couldn&#39;t have been more than 3000 feet up? And this cylinder thing flew under it. I watched the cylinder continue a on a steady path until it disappeared in the distance as it was heading toward Coney Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw what I think was a UFO 30 years earlier and hadn&#39;t seen anything else before this happened, or since for that matter. The thing looked so everyday, so matter of fact that at first I didn&#39;t realize it was anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve told a few people about it over the years, but I&#39;ve always wondered what did I see?...If anyone has seen this thing or knows what it is I&#39;d love to find out...<n> <n><n> <n><n> For whatever it&#39;s worth I just noticed the boxes the boxes about being contacted by an investigator. I have no problem with that, however I don&#39;t think I can add anything more than what I&#39;ve just written. Thanks<n>

As I was staring at the stars, something caught my eye.  I saw what looked like a far away star, but was moving around in fast motion.  Ive seen shooting stars, this wasn&#39;t one.  It would move around the stars like as if going through some sort of maze.  I told my friend about it and we stopped the car, and stayed starring at it.  When it got to the point where we couldnt see it we drove ahead to see if we could keep watching.  We were both amazed at the fact that we knew this was something out of the ordinary.  It had to be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star looking object was of color white mixed with yellow. Two people observed this.  The object would manuever around the stars in a fast motion.

It was moving so quickly that I wasn&#39;t sure I had seen anything at all (maybe my imagination ?) until another one flew in front of my truck. This one I saw as kind of a still picture for an instant: they were about the size of a softball and had an orange glow. They were flying parallel to the ground at about three feet because I remember thinking how glad I was that they didn&#39;t hit the little Isuzu truck because they were going so fast that they would have went clean through both doors and me. I always thought they were meteors and maybe they were, but wouldn&#39;t they be falling towards the ground instead of moving parallel ? Of course, I only saw them for a split second so maybe they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sometime in the early morning hours, I had awakened and looked out the window and saw this blue-gray light that had the apperance of drifting. (No unusual noise at all.) The diamater of this light looked to be the same as a pencil. I could not see a beam of anykind, but when  I started to get up to investigate, the light turned towards me (Clockwise looking down.) and shined in my right eye. The light was not like any I have seen before. It wasn&#39;t like a doctor&#39;s pen light, the light did not cause me to squint. The light didn&#39;t have to search for my eye, it went right to in a fraction of a second. Looking into the light, I could not see around the edges and in some way it reminded of chalk. The best I can remember, I only looked at the light about 1 second. Next thing I remembered, I didn&#39;t want to get up and go to the window anymore to investigate what was out there. That isn&#39;t like me, I am the type that would be the first one there, but after the light, I kept on  thinking to myself &#34;I can get up and look, but I don&#39;t want to.&#34; I didn&#39;t at that time felt that I was held back in any way. BTW, I didn&#39;t see any kind of craft.<n>

I was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly woke from my sleep from a strange presence in my room. I was positioned in such a way, that I could see my clock. The time read 2:15 A.M. 	I was laying on my back and for some reason, an odd feeling swept through my body. This ( feeling ), forced me to close my eyelids. The next thing I knew, was that I was laying on my stomach, looking up at the clock which now read 5:15 A.M. The strange presence was still in the room with me and once again I was forced to close my eyelids. At this time, I was asleep, only to be awakened by my alarm clock at 6:15 A.M. 	When I first woke up, I did not even remember the odd events of the night before. However, the images soon came. As I woke up, I started to remember some of the events. The strange presence at 2:15 A.M. , and something else. The image was so vivid, it could have not been a dream. 	Just after I had been forced to close my eyes, I could remember standing naked in an oval shaped room. The walls were metal, with small windows in the top right hand corner. ( They looked like the ones in grocery stores. The place were they can watch every alley from above with the two way mirror glass. ) Directly behind me was a large door where the two oval walls meet. In the middle of the room, was an odd looking operating table with two needle devices on robotic arms sticking out of the side. This was the only object in the room. 	I turned in fear and started banging on the large door, demanding that I be let out. I could hear voices in the background of my head, yet there was no noise except for a low humm in the walls. I was then told by an angry male voice in my head to either lay down on the table and do as I was told or someone I loved would be hurt. Fearing this would actually happen, I did as I was told. I was asked to lay in such a manner that my left hand lower back was exposed to the two needle like objects. One of the objects had a clear window on it and I could see the contents. what ever was inside of it was clear.  At the base of the needle was a triangle shaped piece of metal and two rectangle designs on both sides of the objects. I was told by a more friendly female voice that I would feel no pain but I would feel my legs go numb and would feel that I could not move even though I could if I wished. 	As I laid there, the robotic arm moved closer to my back and suddenly plunged into my lower left hand side of my back. I could feel the clear liquid being pushed into my body. Then suddenly, I felt numb and paralyzed. I tried to move my arm and I discovered that I could still move. By this time, the needle had been inside of me for over a minute. Then the needle started to suck instead of inject. Then it moved out and away from my back. At this time, the second needle moved toward the same spot on my back and plunged in. 	It was at this time I work up laying on my stomach looking up at the clock that read 5:15 A.M. As I brushed my teeth that morning, I noticed that I had a small pain in my back near my kidneys. I lifted my shirt to discover physical evidence of my abduction. There on my lower back was a triangle with two rectangle shaped imprints on my back. They were the same size as the needle on the table. In the middle of the triangle was a small spot of clotted blood. I removed the spot of blood only to discover that there was no entry hole, just dried blood and the three imprints. My back was slightly swollen and did hurt a little bit. I took of my shirt to look and see if blood was also on it. There was none, it was only on my back.<n>

Around dusk on a monday night in Oct.(1997)I noticed a bright light bounced off of my bathroom door,I turned and looked out my window and saw the eastern part of the sky was lit up with sparkles just like thoses sparkles you buy for the 4th of july.My first reaction was it&#34;s a metor,my second reaction was,holy shit their&#34;s such a big part of the sky lit up should I be scared for my life ?Then all the sparkles went away(they lasted about 3-4-5 seconds).I turned to see if I could see any lights on in my neighbors house,couldn&#34;t see any lights on,looked back out the window and was amazed to see a sphere that was a neon or luminesence green,it was traveling east to west.I could see the horizon line above it,I&#39;m thinking it was a metor it&#39;s going to make a hell of a splash.I tried calling my neighbor while I still had my eye on it,nobody home so I hung up.While still watching it I grabbed my binaculars off the shelf by my picture window and walk out to the lanai set the binaculars on the railing so I could get a steady look.(It had traveled about a mile across the water and was still flying parallel to the horizon).When I looked through the binaculars I remember seeing what looked like a perfect sphere,I couldn&#39;t see any air currents,it looked like a natural object that had what looked like a chip in the whole upper right quadrant.I look through the binaculars for approx.1-1.5 minutes.It looked perfectly natural. The only thing is it never went down.I can see about 10miles in the direction it was traveling and it never went down,I watched it until it disappeared in the distance.It should have gone down and it was traveling parallel to the horizon,it just dosen&#39;t make sense .<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

10/14/97 16:00|Syracuse (North)|NY|Unknown|30 sec. max|4 Military planes fly past flying rod,  and information blackout still ocurring.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18294.html|69|ndxe199710| 4 Military planes fly past flying rod,  and information blackout still ocurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting is noteworthy because it occurred on the same day that the military  F-117A stealth plane flew by the Syracuse airport, then went to Maryland then crashed. I had the luck of photograhing the F-117 as it flew by the Syracuse airport. The object I am writing about was seen &amp; photographed in North Syracuse, on 9.14.1997, the day of the air show here, &amp; very close to the airport, within 2 miles of the airport. I was about 50&#39; North of a car dealership sign, the object in the sky was southwest of my position, in the sky. I was off of South Bay Rd. in the above mentioned town when the unknown object was seen. My car was parked near the dealership, &amp; the sign when the unknown was seen &amp; later photographed. The object was somewhat boomerang shaped, the middle was more flattened out however, one source has labeled it a flying rod. A hair on a camera lens comes to mind, as does a tree twig, but the object was seen before it was photographed. The object appeared dark in color, the sun was out but there were numerous big white clouds in the sky. The day might be considered a day of filtered sunshine. (?) Beside myself as a witness, I was able to photograph 4 military aircraft flying by. The military planes were flying in a westward direction, as the object was moving past me in the sky in an eastward directn. The object maintained its shape from the time I saw it until I actually photographed it. After I photographed the object, I lost track of it. Note also that I have sent the photographs to Langley, AFB &amp; had received a thank-you letter from the commander at that time, now retired, but no explanation from the military as to what I had photographed. I don&#39;t think the object was any cause of the F-117 later crashing, believing the occurence to be something of a coincidence. This unknown was very obvious, but possibly very short lived in terms of duration: I believe nothing has been mentioned in the media about it. However it is almost 4 years later, &amp; I still do not know what the object is. I have a possible suspicion about a 2nd unknown object in the 4 military plane/car dealarship photo. The military, NY MUFON, &amp; NASA have been sent the above mentioned photos. The object I am writing about made no sound. Your organization may email me. Until I know what I have photographed, I would prefer not to give my name out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has consented to share the photo with NUFORC.  We will attempt to post the illustration here.  PD))<n>

It is hard to describe because it was inside a cloud. It had an outer ring of triangular lights that were bluish white. They fashed one at a time around in a circle, sometimes faster sometimes slower. It had an inner ring of lights that moved as if it were opening and closing sort of like jellyfish do when propelling themselves forward. It did not move it just hovered there for hours, Gradually getting higher in they sky as the sun rose. I stood under it and so did my kids and neighbor. It didn&#39;t make any sound. It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seenit but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something. Many witnessed it moving from Ogden area to the Layton area , to my area.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this and could explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, it has been reported to NUFORC that there is a laboratory, run by either a university or a company, that frequently uses a high-energy blue-green laser in the night sky.  We do not know its location.  This may have been the cause of the 3-hour sighting.  PD))<n>

Its was fading in and out much like Hale-Bop and it was at a roughly 45 degree angle, in for 10 seconds out for 10 seconds... Its was stationary for abut 45-1:30 minutes before the sun came up, then I losted tracked. I understand this wasn&#39;t a UFO but a weird comet like object in the sky and I undertstand that you may not be the correct people to speak too but I called my local FBI and they didn&#39;t seem to be too interested. I understand this is halloween and they probably get a lot of crack pots but I didn&#39;t know were else to turn. The FBI wanted to patch me through to the Air Force and I knew this wasn&#39;t a UFO, just a strange comet that I knew wasn&#39;t suppost to be in the star cluster of Orion, as I use Orion as my personal guide to find the rest of the night sky everynight. I also understand that tonight we could of been having Ice crystals forming in the sky, but the rest of the stars looked crystal clear, it was just this one tear drop shaped object.

I don&#39;t recall the date) my friend was driving &amp; we  were going along on a highway parallel &amp; east of I 93 going north.  (I am not from NH and do not recall the highway).  If my memory serves me well,  we were close to Franklin NH. It was late in the evening perhaps around 2300 or so all i remember is it was very dark outside.  We both were talking and looked ahead when a large green or turquoise ball dropped diagonally in the sky, almost as if someone had dropped a softball from high in the sky.  My friend quickly sped up as if to go after it, when we realized that if that ball had hit the earth, or if it was a meteror it would have exploded.  I very ofton think of that night in autumn 1997 wondering what it was we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I&#39;ve been wanting to tell someone who might care about what young  old daughter &amp; I saw in approximately 1975 or 1977. (I dont remember the month.)  Again I cant remember the exact year (she was born in 1969 &amp; was either in 1st or 2nd grade at the time. She started 3rd grade in Minneapolis, I think.  I&#39;d need to ask my daughter for sure what grade she might have been in.  Just the other day I asked her if she remembers seeing the object and she does.  We were in St Paul Minnesota and  after crossing the Smith Avenue bridge going towards West St. Paul, we turned right onto a street ( just a block or 2 on other side of bridge close to Cherokee Park).  I drove maybe a half block (it was nighttime- we were going to a friends house on Stevens Avenue), when we saw an object hovering above the tree tops.  I looked out my drivers side window up to my right at the object, which I thought at first might be a helocopter,but it made NO noise.  It had lights on it, and if I remember correctly the lights were different colors:  I believe red and blue stand out most in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really amazed at what I saw, it was just over the trees but I only saw part of its side, which i believe was round because what we saw was curved Most of the object was over the the trees where I could not see it. I was amazed &amp; in awe.  I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes.  I cant remember if it was rotating.  I remember the lights and how close the object was to the top of the trees.  The area is a residential area just above the Mississippi River. After watching it for about 5 minutes,  I turned around &amp; headed to our apartment on Stryker &amp; King St, where I called the St Paul Airport (military airport)  I think it was called.  I thought it might be a military object.  They said none were there over by Cherokee park. I also think of that night often over the years wondering what it was I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, tell me any if one else have seen the two objects I have seen and tried to describe to the best of my ability.  I would really appreciate it.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were moving house and I had loads of things to do.  About half way through the morning - about 10.30am I decided to telephone the selling agent.  My phone was on the window ledge at the front of the house, as all the furniture had been moved out - I rang the agent and when I finished the call I put the phone down .. I don&#39;t know why (but why not) I stood looking out of the window for a while and noticed a plane in the sky about, I don&#39;t know, maybe half a mile away, as I watched it it changed direction and came towards me.  I stood there watching because the way it did the turn was weird it kind of hooked round, like you&#39;d expect a helicopter to do, planes can&#39;t do that, but it didn&#39;t look anything like a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came towards me (in England most of us live in roads where the houses are in rows, pretty much as in the US but the roads are nowhere near as wide - usually about 60&#39;) and glided across the row of houses directly opposite me about 4 feet above them.  Straight along the row - it was the weirdest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me, I knew when I was watching it that I&#39;d never convince anyone I saw this. It wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter, I watched it with my mouth open and tried to memorise it so I could draw it later - it was roughly 20 feet long (about the size of a semi-detached house) when it got to the bottom of the road it went behind some trees and just seemed to disappear.  It wasn&#39;t until it had gone I realised that it didn&#39;t make any sound at all - if it was a plane, or a helicopter - anything that could fly really it would have made a sound (bar a hang glider, but I know what that looks like and it wasn&#39;t one).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think about that thing every day but the only thing I can remember about it is that it was like a really high tech plane with a round &#39;saucer&#39; part hanging out of the bottom of it - I even got the impression that it was scanning the row of houses. When it glided past I looked to see if it had a cockpit .. it didn&#39;t. It was really shiny like silver aluminium.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anybody else seen anything like this? I&#39;ve tried to draw the thing I saw but I&#39;m useless at drawing and it was so long ago now all I really remember is it being in two parts attached by a kind of arm at a right angle. From a distance it rather looked like a microlight airplane with something hanging underneath it.<n>

I will relate the incident as told me in the first person, although I helped compose the report.  We have tried to be as accurate as possible.  I visited the location of this sighting with the witness and indeed she was very close to the object.  This sighting location is 6 to 7 miles SW from the runway at Robins Air Force Base.  A bit south of Hwy. 96 and west of Moody Road, the exact location not being specified for this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The year was 1997, and I’m not absolutely sure, but I think it was in the fall.  It was early evening and my boyfriend and I were sitting on the trunk of his car in the driveway to his house, by the side of the road.  It is a two-lane paved road through a residential area, and on the side opposite us there was a thin stand of trees, maybe 30 ft tall and behind them was an open field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How the object arrived is still a bit fuzzy to me and I can’t be sure if it just appeared or came up quickly while we were looking the other way.  I just remember it was “there” hovering just above the tree tops on the other side of the road.  It was triangular in shape, but the sides were curved outward instead of being straight.  It was a deep black in color, and although it was dark, there was a full or nearly full moon, and we could easily see it.  About half of it was over the trees and the rest was in our view while it was hovering.  It actually protruded out over the road.  It was maybe 30 feet across at the widest point.  Surprisingly I was not scared at all, but rather very fascinated.  I surely didn’t know what to think as nothing of this sort had ever happened to me before.  I even waved my arms and tried to talk to “it”, but there was no indication from the object that it ever noticed us.  The top was dome shaped, there were no lights, it made absolutely no sound of any kind, no humming, no whirring, nothing!  We were within 50-75 feet of the object the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hovering for several minutes, it moved slowly across the road and over us and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the WNW and was out of sight in less that two seconds, maybe even one.  The entire sighting lasted less than 5 minutes to the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up into the northeast sky and noticed a small/medium craft hovering.  It looked to have 4 thruster looking devices on the underside of it.  If I could compare the underside of it to something, it looked like an one of those simon says electronic games.  Each of the 4 thrusters had a flap dangling from the outside rim of the undercarriage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft would ascend, the flaps would uncover the thruster simultaneously.  If it would descend, the flaps would cover them up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The top side of the craft (not very visible to me) looked to be a half sphere.

But I was still looking at the object. the side of the object was weird, i can&#39;t really describe it.

When it returned to its original location it then shot straight up and vanished. The object had some type of visual field around it. It was changing colors between red, orange, and blue.<n>

When I got home, my yard faced the direction of the light and I told my mother to come outside and look at this light that I&#39;ve been watching for five to seven minutes. We came outside, and about five minutes later, the light began to get larger as it was moving toward us. My mother and I constantly asked each other &#34;What is that&#34; and we felt all giddy inside. I&#39;ve grown up near an Air Force base and have seen plenty of flying objects butntohing like this!  As it came closer, it made no noise.  It passed directly overhead very slowly, and had five lights arranged in a V shape on its underside. It never made a sound.

WE TURNED ONTO THE END OF OUR STREET AND WERE PROCEEDING TO OUR HOME.  AS I WAS DRIVING, MY WIFE SAID TO ME &#34;LOOK AT THOSE LIGHTS, I DIDN&#39;T KNOW THEY HAD PUT UP TRANSMISSION TOWERS NEAR HERE&#34;.  I LOOKED UP AND SAW WHAT SHE WAS REFERRING TO, BUT IT WASN&#39;T RIGHT.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND GOT OUT TO LOOK AND SHE SEEMED TO GET VERY UPSET AND ASKED ME TO GET BACK IN RIGHT AWAY.  MY WIFE AND I WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO SEE THIS, THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR BEHIND US ABOUT 50 YARDS, AND THEY TOO STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF THEIR VEHICLE. WHEN I LOOKED UP AFTER MY WIFE HAD MADE HER COMMENT I SAW TWO RED LIGHTS BLINKING.  THE TWO LIGHTS WERE BLINKING EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME, AS IF THEY WERE BOTH HOOKED UP TO THE SAME CIRCUIT.  THAT IN ITSELF I THOUGHT WAS STRANGE.  AND I ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTLY NO WAY THAT ANY TOWERS COULD HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT US KNOWING ABOUT IT.  THESE LIGHTS WERE NOT THAT FAR AWAY.  THEY WERE DIRECTLY OVER HEAD AT ABOUT 200&#39;.  THE FIRST ONE WAS PROBABLY 200&#39; HIGH AND 300&#39; IN FRONT OF ME.  IT WAS DARK OUT AND I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OBJECT WITH TWO LIGHTS ON IT.  THE SECOND LIGHT WAS ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT = 200&#39; HIGH AND PROBABLY 500&#39; OR 600&#39; AWAY.  ALL I COULD THINK WAS HOW INCREDIBLY LARGE THIS THING WAS.  I STILL THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ONE OBJECT.  THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LIGHTS WERE BLINKING, EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME.  AS I WAS STANDING THERE, THE FARTEST LIGHT ZOOMED UP, RIGHT NEXT TO THE OTHER ONE.  THEY MADE NO NOISE, AND THEY BOTH HAD SAT STILL FOR A WHILE.  THEN THEY WENT OVERHEAD AND TO MY RIGHT.  THEY GAINED SPEED AND ALTITUDE AND WERE GONE.  NO NOISE, NOTHING.  WHILE THEY WERE OVERHEAD, I SAW THAT THEY WERE TWO OBJECTS, NOT ONE.  AND I ALSO SAW THAT THEY WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE.  I&#39;M STILL NOT SURE EXACTLY OF THE SIZE.  I&#39;M STILL WONDERING WHAT I SAW.  MY WIFE ALSO SAW ALL OF THIS TOO.  AT THE TIME I KNEW A MAN THAT WORKED IN THE CONTROL TOWER AT THE AIRPORT HERE.  I CALLED! HIM UP AND TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING ON HIS RADAR.  HE SAID THAT HE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT I DID INDEED SEE SOMETHING VERY OUT OF THE ORDINARY.  I AM JUST GLAD THAT MY WIFE WAS WITH ME AND SAW THE SAME THING I DID OR I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY. MY WIFE FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE STRANGNESS OF THIS THAT SHE CALLED THE LOCAL AIR BASE.  THEY &#34;KNEW NOTHING&#34; ABOUT IT.  HAD I KNOWN SOONER, I WOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS INCIDENT, BUT I DIDN&#39;T KNOW OF YOUR ORGANIZATION.

I stared at it for several seconds, trying to make out if it was an airplane.  It was completely silent and not moving at all.  I then glanced down to shift gears, then looked back up. It was gone.  This glancing down could not have taken more than  2 secs and when I looked up, it was gone.  I frantically searched the sky for it, thinking if it was an airplane it could have moved.

Tree covered hill. 1860&#39; MSL. I awoke to see a bright white light approx 1,500&#39; so east of my camper. The circular object resembled a satellite dish antenna. It was illuminated and, illuminating. It was rising very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above description was seen through 10x50 binoculars. The object was rising slowly and, shortly after focusing on it, began to descend. It began to rise again, then descended below the tree tops. The object never rose more than what I believed to be more than half way above the trees. I was able to see three full panels and,one  partial panel on either side of the three full ones. The trees obscured the lower half. On the second descent into the trees, the light disappeared. In the morning light, I went to where I believed the source of the light was located. There was no road or, trail suitable for positioning that object in the trees by using ground equipment, in my opinion The panels I speak of were white and, appeared to be illuminating.They also appeared to be illuminated.Try to imagine a TV satellite dish approx. 15 to 20 ft in dia. projecting half way above tall tree tops bathed in white light. My interest is in knowing if anyone has seen anything similar.<n>

I notice this red rectangular shape next to one of those long skinny pole with the little red light that blinks and fades, blinks and fades etc.(I think it&#39;s one of those type of communicator) Anyway&#39;s at the time I had no idea what it was, so I kept watching it wondering what it was. It would blink every two seconds. It was right next to the blinking red light that fades. Then all of a sudden the next time it blinked it blinked at a 45 degree angle. I could not see it move because it was really dark. Then when it blinked it went twice the distance at the same angle. Then when it blinked again it was 5 to 10 times the distance. It accelerated really fast. I was swerving on the road watching in awe. I told other people but they did not believe me. I still remember like it just happened yesterday. I was so excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The craft was absolutely silent, and by judging distance, appeared to be moving at a good rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was what started out as a red dot in the sky.  As it moved closer from the north, I began to see what appeared to be red and orange revolving lights.  The object appeared to be no more than 1000 ft. from the ground hovering absolutely silent.  Though I cannot give an exact shape of the object, it did not appear to be saucer shaped.  It seemed to be more boxy or triangular shaped.  I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until, well frankly, I became scared shitless.  I ran into the house to wake my mother so she could see the object, but by the time we got outside it had gone.  I said nothing about this to anyone outside of my family until Thursday night at work.  When I did talk about it at work, expecting to get laughed at, I found an older man who claims to have seen an object similar in description.  He saw it on his way home from work on the same night between 11:00 and 11:30 pm.  His sighting was about 10 miles WSW of mine, though he watched for about ! 20 minutes.<n>

We were just outside city limits of Bemidji Minnesota traveling north on Hwy 89. We noticed a weird set of lights over a field, but since we only make it up that way about twice a year, we figured it may be a new radio tower or some form of tower that had been errected since we last passed through. As we got closer to where the &#34;tower&#34; should have been our conversation changed from &#34;hunting&#34; to what that could be in the sky. we came to a point where we were directly across from it. It was a clear night and there was no structure reaching to the sky, just 3 lights hovering above the ground. The lights were in the form of a triangle, and were all white. The reminded me of club lights, because they were tumbling. They never left the shape of a triangle, but they were tumbling, as if spinning from top to bottom. Like if you were to take a popcan and make it tumble top to bottom, from end to end. What was really cool about that is that when the lights would tumble they were as if there was a... that&#39;s it, a better description would be a light house. There would be a beam of light that would shine out and then it would be more soft, then beam of light. It&#39;s been a while I can&#39;t recall if they all tumbled in unisyn, or if they tumbled independent of each other. The craft itself you could not see, but you could see that there were 3 distinct points on it. It was like a triangle, or a flying pryamid. We had pulled over to the side of the road, and watched this thing for about 10 minutes. Two cars passed us by and we waved to them and pointed to the sky in the direction of the object. The cars hit their break lights as they passed, but continued on their way. After 10 minutes the object slowly started to move to the south, then in a blink of an eye it was like a distant star. It just took off. It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
