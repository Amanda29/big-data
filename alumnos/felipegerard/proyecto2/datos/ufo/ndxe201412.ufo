There were two waves.  The first we&#39;ve had five red orange balls.  The second wave had five more. I could not hear them but then again there were lots of firecrackers going off.  I could not tell what it was but it didn&#39;t move at a steady pace until it turned south east and disappeared.<n>

Each point of the triangle had a red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first my boyfriend thought they were flares but then we noticed they weren&#39;t moving AT ALL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At midnight, the fireworks went off and we lost sight.  When I found them again during a break, the point of the triangle was on top instead of bottom, but the whole formation was in the same vicinity as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging by distance, I would guess the object was about 100 ft on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tried to catch a photo, but being on the water in waves, I could not get a clear shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Flew directly over Dobbins Air Reserve base towards my residence, (which is perpendicular to their runway).  Solid flare - no colored side lamps, no blinking lights, much brighter than other planes nearby, easily a -6 brightness.  Absolutely silent, left no contrail.  Moved faster than a plane but slower than a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was clearly disc shaped as it passed overhead/perhaps more like a donut (darkened center underneath).  As soon as it passed another appeared on same trajectory, then another and another evenly spaced - counted 8 of them in 15 minutes, with one slightly off to our west but still heading due south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is highly unusual for regular air traffic because the standard holding pattern from Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta is to cycle planes to our west heading due north instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could not be lanterns - wind was blowing NNW and these were much larger than anything else in the sky.  Five witnesses.<n>

My friend said it was a UFO that he has seen a few times before.  It slowly started moving west and after about thirty seconds of moving west, it flickered.  It flickered 5 times before taking off full speed out of our sight.  All of us were in shock and couldn&#39;t believe what we had just saw.<n>

I came out of my shop that sits on a hill above Bear Lake, turned out the lights and locked the door, and turned around towards the lake, and seen something hovering over the water and it seems like it was maybe a couple hundred yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was out of place, it was below the east shore mountain line.  I didn’t think to take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hurried to my truck and got in started it, all the while watching the whitish amber colored object, then it changed shape and headed off to the east really fast.<n>

I went outside in the back yard to walk next door.  My son was over at the neighbor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night and as I stepped out in the back yard, I looked up in the southeast sky and saw one orange orb like light that hardly moved.  I could only tell it was moving because of one bright star off to the left of the orange light.  It was not blinking there was no noise of a plane or other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 30 seconds the light disappeared.  Immediately after the first one disappeared another orange like orb formed slightly to the left and down from where I saw the first light.  This one moved in the same manner as the first but after about 40 seconds it too disappeared.  Then two more orange orbs appeared.  I was trying to get the attention of my neighbor and his girlfriend and my two boys.  Then the girlfriend came out and saw the two orbs and asked said, “What the heck is that?”  Then my two boys and neighbor all came out and we watched this go on orbs appearing and disappearing for about 2 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 3 orbs appeared into a tangier shape, and moved from east to west. Then one orb went out leaving two which seemed to move faster than the others but not by much.  Then the other two disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before all three disappeared, I had got my other neighbor to see what we were seeing and he was really not sure what to think.  Then another one showed up but more off to the right from the others.  This one seemed to be the same size but appeared to change colors like red, green and blue and kind of was spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then that went away and one last smaller orb showed up to the left of the colorful one and then went away. Then there was no more light or orbs.<n>
12/31/14 22:00|Taos|NM|Light|Several minutes|Large ball of orange/yellow light in Taos, NM.|1/7/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116484.html|11|ndxe201412| Large ball of orange/yellow light in Taos, NM<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were driving in the southwestern part of the city when she pointed out a light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the passenger and ducked my head and looked to the upper left area and noticed a large orange light that appeared to be traveling west at a relatively slow pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light changed colors slowly from orange to yellow to white.  It had the look of a ball of plasma or electricity, sort of undulating and almost pulsing but with very erratic edges rather than a defined circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her to pull over and as she did so I got out of the car intending to take cell phone video of the object.  There was a very thin cloud cover you could see the stars thru. I would estimate the clouds at around 5,000 feet.  As I walked up a rocky driveway to get a higher perspective and prepared my phone to capture some video, the object suddenly changed direction from west to east, rose above the thin cloud cover and shot out of sight.  The object was so bright it would have been easily seen through the thin, see-through clouds, but once it changed direction and elevated it was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the elevation and how large it appeared from our perspective I believe this was a rather large object.  Far larger than any modern aircraft would appear at that distance.  My best guess is that it was several times larger than a hot air balloon and made no sound at all.<n>

This would have been close to the football field but I noticed it kept its distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this same craft three times all at night over the period of a year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know planes and military aircraft and this is not a plane or helecopter and I know the direction the planes fly over town and this has never followed any of those paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date may be approximate, but indicates a sighting on New Year&#39;s Eve.

Some seemed allot closer then others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of three I noticed were very large in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere and disappeared without any speed or movement.  There was no noise, smell, contrail, or erratic movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They usually appeared in groups of three and spread out over the horizon in a triangle formation, although they did not keep a tight triangle formation.  They didn&#39;t flicker, and the colors were fairly constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed that they were lanterns, but they seem too bright and too round.  But their movement and disappearance would be consistent with lanterns.  It was also new years eve which makes me think they are lanterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appeared and disappeared for around 20 minutes to a half and hour.  On viewing the video #1750, I noticed a second light or lights above the &#34;lantern.&#34;  This light can be viewed on at the 8 to 10 second part.  It is directly above the &#34;lantern&#34; and appears and disappears and changes color from red to blue to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Being in  communication technologies I thought it was a radio tower but realized there were no towers by the house in this direction.  They were in a triangle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that was flaming was the top left (east) of triangle.  The other two, one was to the right (west) horizontal to the flaimng one.  The third was below the other 2 and in a center position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As  I turned left there were several couples with children walking , they were all looking and pointing at the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I ended the street I lost sight of the 3 objects due to trees and houses. I took a right turn an! d saw the flaming object still in the same place.  The other 2 objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People walking on Blanding blvd were also looking and pointing at the object too.  I was not the only one who saw this.  The flaming one stayed stationary till I reached the next light.  The object was still flaming, then it moved toward the east at a fast pace and was gone.  It did not go away in a flash.

I got three out of four on film with my Samsung Galaxy s5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:30pm in my back yard, I saw a red/pinkish color circle in the sky, that looked like a fireball orb.  It was coming from the West heading south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had no sound and was visable for about one minute, and then lit up to where I could see an outline of a very large circular craft object just before it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab my Samsung Galaxy s5 to film.  When I got back outside, I looked up for approximately 1 minute, and then saw another fireball orb coming from the same location I spotted the first one, and it flew the exact path and then vanished the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more followed, one at a time, in the same flight pattern as the first fireball orb I spotted, and then vanished in the same fashion.  I have three on film all together.  I live near the airport in Hayden.

I think whatever was in the sky was interested or attracted to the airport.  Silent, large, circular, pinkish orbs that vanished made the hair on my neck raise.  What an incredible sight.  I wanted to call law enforcement but then though they would just think I was crazy, so I Googled it and found this site so I decided to rapport it.  I hope others also got to witness this amazing event.<n>

Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seem many meteorites or &#34;shooting stars&#34;, but never saw one emerge from another ball of light that lit up and blinked out stationary as a smaller one seemed to come from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear and plenty of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were brilliant white just as a normal looking &#34;shooting star&#34; but one just &#34;turned off&#34; and the other seemed to burn out as it streaked across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on our way to the store when we saw it in our driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back home it was cloudy and overcast w no stars in sight.

This evenings sighting was much different than the last and much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband began loading his car with laundry baskets, when I hear him call my name and come see &#34;them&#34; again.  I am sure it is highly unlikely to see UFO&#39;s more than once but it seems to be a re-occurring theme here in Clarksville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside and saw a slow moving fireball type aircraft in the sky with the occasional firework going up.  It seemed as if though during this time we saw this light everyone paused their fireworks.  After a minute or two the fireball type aircraft completely vanished in the night sky.  We thought that must be it this time but then another appeared from the western treeline moving towards Oak Grove, KY, (we are fairly close to Oak Grove, KY, and our house is situated northerly).  This second fireball type aircraft made no noise whatsoever as did the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw a! plane flying towards into the direction of the UFO.  The plane made noises as a plane would but the UFO was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO rose into the sky in a eastern direction.  Then a third came from the exact spot as this one had and at this moment the second UFO vanished without a trace.  The third UFO did as the second had and followed the same flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And just as the second had vanished when the third appeared so did this third when a fourth fireball aircraft appeared from the same exact spot.  The fourth UFO followed the same flight path as the previous three had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was during this time a plane had circled around into the direction of these UFO&#39;s.  All during this time you can clearly hear the sounds from the plane and still no sound from the UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, while the fourth had followed the same flight path as the previous, a helicopter coming from the eastern sky began flying towards the direction of where the UFO&#39;s were appearing in the western sky.  Unlike the plane, the helicopter did not reach in time before the fourth vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited for a fifth UFO but that was it.  No more appeared.  It seemed so for our neighbors as well because after this &#34;show&#34; of UFO&#39;s ended, the neighbors began lighting their fireworks more so than during the appearance of the UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is becoming more unsettling, here in Clarksville.  We do live near a military post, and everyday you can see small planes and helicopters flying over head.  We are used to it, of course.  We have lived here for 10 years but these occurrences are much different than seeing planes and helicopters flying over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there are others here in town seeing these same objects, please don&#39;t be embarrassed to post because you are not alone in these experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then, the third and fourth bright red lights went quickly up into the sky quickly becoming smaller lights, the same size in appearance as the stars in the sky, then they were gone.

It was dark.  On the way to the car I saw an object looking like a quarter moon with the bottom left corner filled in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved over a hillside, just over the top of the hill.  It finally went behind the trees but I could still see the light from it.  It was almost as large as the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in a jerky fashion, almost like I was looking at a series of photographs projected in the sky, in first a westward direction, and later north, behind the trees on top of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about 30 seconds from the driveway, and then when it disappeared behind the trees I walked out in the yard where I could still see the light it made for a few more seconds.  It was not the moon, which was in the western sky.<n>

There were scattered houses in the area, each on 5-15 acres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes of playing/pictures, I was looking at the nearest house, that was about 1/4 mile away, when I noticed a rectangular blue sheet rise out of a small grove of fruit trees near the house.  The sheet appeared to be about 6&#39; x 12&#39; and was semi-transparent and oscillating...it looked like a thin sheet of blue fire (it moved much like fire would).  Before it cleared the tree-line, a very bright whitish flash emanated from the top and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife happened to be looking in the same general direction, she saw the bright flash (but did not witness the blue sheet).

It was 3:00AM on the dot and I was in the bathroom, getting ready for bed.  I opened the window to let the warm ocean breeze in and was very surprised to see what I at first thought was a very beautiful moon in the clear, dark sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood at the window, watching the object-- it was a very large circle that was emitting bright orange light.  I realized quickly that it couldn&#39;t be the moon for several reasons: it was much bigger (about twice the size of a full moon), it was a full circle (the moon was a waxing gibbous at the time), and it made no sense for the moon to be positioned there at this time (my bedroom faces in the direction in which the moon rises-- at 3AM, the moon would not be so close to that part of the horizon.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It began moving downwards at a steady pace (faster than I&#39;ve ever seen the moon move) so I reached for my phone to take a picture before it was hidden behind the mountains.  I did take a photo and it is visible there, although it&#39;s terrible quality because I took it with an iPhone 5 at nighttime.  I wanted to see if I could get a better picture, so I went to grab my mom&#39;s professional camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped away for maybe 3 minutes tops, and when I came back, the object was completely gone. I didn&#39;t think too much of it past a curious, &#34;I wonder what that was!&#34; and didn&#39;t talk about I again until I mentioned it casually to a friend 2 days later and they informed me that that&#39;s not an uncommon description for UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly can&#39;t think of any other logical explanation-- I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before!

As I stood along the fenceline of the yard, which runs parallel with I-84, I noticed a massive and extremely bright-lit reflection in my neighbors 2cd.  Story window.  It was so bright, that it illuminated the area around the window pane as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I looked up in an easterly direction to figure out what could create such a glow and that is when I saw a very bright and very large white in color fireball with a pink-ish white in color tail like shape appear to be fixed in the sky however, within seconds of noticing it hovering, it shot across the sky with such a high rate of speed it blew my mind.  It literally appeared as though it hovered for a second and then completely darted into oblivion, it literally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now my first thought was a shooting star or meteor however, it didnt fly away or in a downward motion like when stars die out. It lit! erally disappeared, like it shut its lights out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired firefighter with respectful credibility who is a &#34;show me the evidence&#34; kind of guy, so I chalked it up to some weird shooting star.  Yes that&#39;s what I did, of course, that was until I went outside again for my break (I work 3rd. Shift) and what I saw blew my mind!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 1:02 AM (now on 12/30/14) and I was standing up against my employer&#39;s building, which ironically is about 1 mile down the street from my home (north), when I witnessed 2 of the same shaped fireballs that I saw earlier in the night appear out of nowhere in the sky above my employer.  They were literally identical to the first sightings object, but this time they appeared different in color (again, the 1st. object was white/pink-ish in color).  They were a very bright red-ish orange in color (and again, this time there were 2).  They appeared completely out of nowhere as if someone turned on a light.  They were side-by-side and then within a few seconds of appearing (in which they were all so simply hovering), they completely darted again across the sky so fast that if I blinked I would have not seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER been a believer in UFO&#39;s nor the paranormal, but one thing is clear, certain and for sure, what I witnessed both times was NOT a shooting star, they were not regular aircrafts and nothing about them was &#34;normal&#34; by any means.  This time I called my wife, whom was in bed sleeping, to tell her because I simply could NOT wrap my mind around what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I am not an expert, I am not an astronomer nor anything else in the related field, but this my friends was NOTHING from earth nor was it the standard meteor-type incident. This was certainly paranomal!<n>

We were on Hwy 126 about 10 miles east of Ventura when I saw a white fireball streak across the sky in front of the car slightly to our left.  That would have put it to the South of us toward Oxnard, likely out over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling left to right, meaning it was heading pretty much due South.  It seemed to turn slightly green and left a long trail behind it.  It was low in the sky, I&#39;d estimate 10 degrees, was obscured by some trees, then reappeared on the other side of them, then we lost sight of it.  I&#39;d estimate we saw it for 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since in the report below they were looking south I think this was the same object.

The days following I was in a haze, knowing something was off but thinking better of questioning if I brushed it off.  A few days after Christmas I left my parents house and Pickens and drove to my apartment in Simpsonville.  As I was driving I began to spot one or two of the same orbs.  Panic set in and I did not know why.  When I got to my apartment I noticed one of them was maybe a mile away from me.  Panicked, I ran into my apartment I locked myself in.  As I sat on my couch trying to convince myself that I needed to calm down but I couldn&#39;t shake it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Minutes later, through closed blinds a very bright orb flashed at me and was immediately followed by another.  Again I remember watching them for at least two hours, wishing I could go to sleep but never allowing myself to even try fearing I would be harmed in someway.  At some pointI remember losing The clarity in my hearing and hearing a low drum buzzing noise.  But this point my phone died and I was too afraid to go get my charger from my car.  And that was it. I woke up sometime later on the floor again in a sweat and totally confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is about 9 AM I got up took my dead phone and drove to a friend of mine&#39;s place.  Upon arrival, she criticize me for standing her up the day before.  That was even more confusing because I knew that she wasn&#39;t going to be home until the next day.  As it turns out I had missed the day.  It was a day later and I had no recollection of the events, if any, that occurred the day before.  24 hours was just completely missing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The buzzing kept coming back randomly for a week or so..  My fear got the best of me and I uprooted myself and moved up to New York very shortly after.<n>

They moved east very fast, but still within my sight line, then back west very fast and stopped in the air, I actually rubbed my eyes and looked back, screamed for the dog to come back, then went up to get my wife, she saw the same thing, this time we watched from our second floor balcony.  And they were making strange movements, nothing like an aircraft I have ever seen or known about.  Very odd experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We recorded it on my wife&#39;s cell phone.<n>

As we drove through the state of Maryland, at approximately 3:55 AM, according to the dash board clock, I noticed a large bright light glide over interstate 95, almost directly over our car, just enough to get my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving about 70 mph and pressed my face against the front windshield to get a better look at it, and to my amazement, I saw a triangle craft with two oval lights on the back corners of the craft and a large red light in the center.  I could also make out a very dark point on the craft which I thought to be the front of it, or the tip of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped and hovered over a group of trees as I drove down the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly screamed to my sleeping mother in the passenger’s seat to look out her window.  She woke up and immediately saw what I was yelling about.  She was mesmerized.  I was trying to look at the craft and the road at the same time and that was when I noticed that the edges of the craft were more rounded, almost like a popsicle stick.  It had two layers, on the bottom was the color of the cloudy night sky, and the top was a very brilliant black color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fumbled for my phone that had a camera attached to it and my mom watched as it hovered over a group of trees.  It hovered only about five to ten feet over the tree tops.  She got a better view of the craft and said that the red light in the center of the “V” was very “unusual” and very large and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I took out the camera to take the picture, I aimed the camera towards it, but it went from a stationary position above the tree line, to completely disappearing out of view and I couldn’t get the picture taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me that when I took out the camera and aimed it, it was almost as if “the UFO knew I was about to take a picture and took off”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both became very excited from what we just saw and then I took notice! of the time and it read, 3:55 AM.

Residential neighborhood, houses on both sides, 30 miles/hour speed limit.  Light traffic (estimated about 5-7 cars driving behind my vehicle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Event Observation:  While driving back home through the residential neighborhood, there was an intense white light bursting into scene.  It happened by my vehicle’s immediate right, located near the lane divider, about spherical, diameter about 20 feet, height about 15 feet from the ground.  It lasted about 2-3 sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My vehicle drove right through it.  There was no sound, no smoke, no smell, no other phenomenon except the intense white light itself.  It appeared as a camera flash light, but magnified about 1 million times in size and intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The street lights about 1 mile in radius went off (because the street lights have auto-light sensor and come on-off by themselves).  Then after about 2-3 minutes, they came back normal again.  The traffic light which was about 50 feet away from the spot was not affected.  The street lights came back none damaged.  None of the cars or other objects was damaged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal Experience:  I came back after a long meditation session and a bad day with family conflict.  My mind was very negative and dark, full of recursive heavy thoughts.  It was bitterly complaining about the meditation center and rumbling about it.  The exact thought while I was witnessing this event was, “These 2 spiritual experiences can be dangerous, people need to be careful about joining spiritual centers, they will brain wash you” (the 2 meant my previous Buddhist meditation center and the present one). I have been practicing meditation for a while and keenly aware of my inner state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light came on, completely shocking to the minimal.  My 1st reaction was it felt like the street light above the vehicle (which is the modern yellow glowing high voltage powered one) or the high-voltage power line exploded.  It happened so fast that my car drove right through the light.  I had the aftermath wondering that how come my car did not get melted by it and I was still alive (I nearly felt my car would be exploded with it too).  The car behind me also drove right through, along with several other vehicles.  This made me feel safe that I was not hallucinating or hurt by anything, and my mind became very clear and calm. All the negative thoughts suddenly stopped and vanished.  I felt like being changed to my normal state again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, all street lights completed shut down.  Driving further 50 feet, I stopped by the traffic light which was red at that moment, and appeared to be very lonely in the complete darkness (a very interesting ethereal feeling).  I turned right as the way of going home, noticing the entire street lights on this road were also shut off.  After driving a further 50 feet on this road, the lights started to come back again.  I was very puzzled exactly what happened, and thought maybe something malfunctioned with the power line or street lights. I thought I need to call the city and it would be unsafe for people driving through the dark roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a U-turn through my house and drove back to the event location – this was about 5 minutes after.  Everything went back to normal, as if nothing had ever happened. There was no trace left whatsoever, except my mind was wondering about exactly what this was about.  Afterwards, a very close friend came unexpected and immediately when I got home, keeping me engaged busily for 2 hours before I went to bed.  The next morning when I recollected about this experience, it felt even more strange.  So I decided to file this report to see if other people have reported it or other similar events.<n>

Within one minute, I took roughly seven photos and two of the photos captured the same, unknown image.  None of the three people present saw anything with the naked eye and we did not notice the images until the following day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first photo taken at 16:55 &amp; 38 seconds captured a very bright green glowing object that appeared to be illuminating from the trees, as if it were on the ground.  The bright green glow also appears to be surrounding a physical object which reveals a shadow below it.  The shape is truly unknown but appears to be a diamond or a T shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second image taken at 16:56 &amp; 5 seconds captured the image closer to the camera and appears to be in front of the tree line closest to us in the air.  Oddly enough, this image does not reflect any solid shape or object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Including in report but might not be crucial to the event:  One of the people present was testing a new HAM Radio while on top of the tower.  He made a connection and was chatting with another licensed radio user while I took the photos.  During this time, there was about 20 seconds of radio disturbance and then went back to clear.<n>

Driving down the country road to get to my house, 55 miles per hour listening to the music.  This kite shaped thing flies right in front of my SUV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so fast I slammed on my brakes.  Put my car in neutral and called my mother in law.

It wasn&#39;t very far off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped like a kite and had these very bright iridescent white blue lighting on the bottom and side.  In a panic i drive off fast as i can!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother in law insisted i call police.  I refused cause i figured they&#39;d think i was crazy.  The next road to the right was my road to take home, driving very fast ans still on the phone with her i look over to the field on my right to see if it&#39;s still there and it&#39;s up in the air flying past me over the trees and out of sight in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began panicking!  I hung up and tried to record but it was gone.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, was definitely indescribable, very scary to experience, left my hair standing on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never in my life had i seen a ufo.  Nor do i ever want to again!!  My husband and i intend to go to the field where i seen it after it flew in front of my car today whem daylight comes. I&#39;m extremely shook up about this.

It is difficult to see the outlines but you can tell that there is a substance there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft moved silently, and quickly with no sound and was probably only able to be picked up due to the fact that there was a bright quarter moon out also.  It originally reminded me of a batman movie when there was the bat signal in the sky.

However, it was too low to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to drive and our view was interrupted for approximately 2 minutes by buildings.  We drove on to Moonstone Drive, which is a beachfront drive with clear view of ocean.  We, again, saw this light hanging in same position as before.  Our view was much better and clearer.  We could see that the light was unique with hints of color and almost as if it had movement within it-much like a plasma effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, it began to drop down, towards ocean and as it went below horizon line, there was a faint glow that lit the sky.

I was on my way to cash my check at the regular check cashing spot I usually go to.  On my way there I stop at the crossing light and saw to my left across the street what I thought at first was a jet taking off, as I&#39;m near several airports and a few military bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept an eye on this object that resembled a jet or missile going into the sky at a 90° angle.  As it kept going up, it disappeared and then after 5 seconds or so it reappeared, but the funny thing is that it slowed down to a total stop and was now much bigger.  It resembled a pill or a cylinder shape.  It stayed there for about 6 to 8 minutes.  At this time I was getting ready to cross the street and looked away for one second and when I looked back up it was gone.  Except I saw the tail of smoke it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now two minutes later a helicopter appeared going in the direction in which the object was just at. I watched this helicopter circle around for at least five or ten minutes and then it left.  I couldn&#39;t believe this was happening. I wish my camera/video recorder was working but it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other funny thing is that I seem to be the only person interested in looking at this object.

I was preparing to drive home after spending Christmas with family, when I first noticed what I thought was a meteoroid.  It caught my attention in the Southern sky at about 35 degrees and was on a Southerly heading straight down toward the horizon.  As a former member of the North West Jersey Amateur Astronomer club, I found it unique in that it clearly changed color from blue to purple, but the flight path was straight and the speed was commensurate with a typical fast moving meteoroid, so I continued to prepare for my drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within one to two minutes, I noticed that the object had climbed back out of the horizon and was making a series of turns that resembled the maneuvers of an aerobatic aircraft, with loops and turns that seemed to slow lightly at apex.  The object changed colors about 2-4 times per second and seemed distant in the Southern sky, climbing no higher than about 45 degrees.  What was especially odd was the relative speed of climbs and dives, which were closer to the speed of a a meteorite but clearly with maneuvering.  Based on my experience as a certified PPL, I would describe the maneuvers as governed by aerodynamics, with no sharp angled turns, but the speed of climbs and the acceleration in directional changes exceeds what I have seen out of even military aircraft at close range during airshows.  At an apparent distance, no conventionally powered turbine aircraft could display such speed and even if my judgment of distance was off, the climbs would still be out of the realm of possibility for any rotorcraft such as a drone.  The climbing speed was dramatic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In order to verify what I was seeing, I went back to the house and pounded on the window to get my sister&#39;s attention.  I motioned for her to come outside and when she did, the object was still maneuvering aerobatically and changing colors.  After another minute or so the object dove back down into the Southern horizon and did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective, the object had bounded its maneuvers within and below the constellations of Canis Major and Orion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared distant and was only seen as a bright point of light, approximately equal in magnitude to Sirius.<n>

It was around 6:30 at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister was on the sand sitting with her son playing. We were ten feet away with standing, with our infant son sitting on my head.  My husband was holding the babies legs and standing closely face to face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly saw a neon glowing ball zip around my sister/s head and around us.  My husband immediately jumped back and asked if I heard that (he was yelling).  I told him I saw it and he caught it out of the corner of his eye as well.  I asked if it was a laser light…but he explained he would not have heard a laser light….as someTHING had flown by his head so quickly that one ear heard it and then the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then questioned if it could be a drone, but knew in my mind that no one could fly one that fast with SUCH INCREDIBLE precision to get so close around our heads and not hit us.  The way this object flew with accuracy around my sister and her child…and our child that was on my shoulders was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband--who is a teacher, made us leave the beach because he was freaked out.  I kept questioning if I had really just seen what I remember I had seen.  My sister was speechless as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a believer……now including the rarely seen, and unexplained.<n>

Since it was late, and my parents had turn my old room into my niece&#39;s play room, I took my spot in the living room on the couch which is about 8 foot from the door that leads to the backyard.  (Backyard is surrounded by woods, except for our cow pasture).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ready to go to sleep, I remove my glasses and sank into to the couch.  Immediately, an intense orange glow caught my attention through the close blinds on the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my glasses back on to get a better look and observed what I thought to be an orange lamp post that I&#39;d never seen in my 24 years between the woods and the cow pasture.  As I watched I could swear I saw moving up-and-down and a little side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the first 15 minutes I just sat there stunned at what I was observing and then I noticed that it looks like this orange or was touching down in the pasture and sending off some sort of electricity all around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after I noticed a smaller white blue orb hovering higher in the sky but keeping to the right.  I started to believe I was crazy so I pulled out my iPhone to see if I could confirm what I was seeing with my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I not only got pictures but videos, but as I lay on the couch trying to record these orbs I realized suddenly that it was aware I was watching them and every time I focused on one of them it would start to shape shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now frozen in fear nearly an hour later I begin to feel that I needed to hide.  The red orb began to come as close as 20 foot from the back door.  The fear that I felt was more real than anything else I can remember.  So much that I was too terrified to even get up and wake up my parents or my brothers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thing I know, it is 6 AM, and I wake up in a cold sweat and find myself in the same spot. I am totally forgotten what I&#39;d seen and videoed.  Shortly after my family woke up and I showed them my videos.  They were shocked and had no explanation.  I remember telling my dad that I watched it for three hours or more, and that I eventually discovered that it met me no harm and went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t for several days that I came out of the fog I was in to realize that I actually have no such memory of thinking that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have no explanation.  I feel like something is definitely happening all around us and because not enough eyewitnesses of come forward, the general public is waving off this phenomena.<n>

Some were closer to one another than others and a couple of them were in a triangle-like formation.  The whole event lasted about two minutes and when they got about halfway across the sky, one by one they faded and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always believed in UFOs but seeing one in person made my jaw drop.

It was an extremely bright light (orange in the center, and light orange and white on the very edge).  There was no sound, and although it wasn&#39;t actually pulsating, the brightness of the object was very intense, so if it actually was a &#34;craft&#34; I couldn&#39;t ascertain that.  It was moving relatively slowly and then made a slow/smooth move to the south.  I lost sight of it when my view was blocked by some trees.<n>

I only saw the lights and could net see any shape to whatever the lights were attached.  The lights were somewhat dim due to the cloud layer.  It was completely silent and flew northwest and then made a sharp turn to the northeast.  It flew faster than the commercial airliners the regularly fly over my house.  No one was present with me.  This is the third time I have seen such a craft.  Twice, my ex-wife and I saw one fly over the family student housing complex for the University of California, Berkeley, when I was in attending school there (the housing complex is in Albany, CA, and I reported these sightings to this website too).  I think these were in May 2002 and May 2003.  In those cases, I could see the craft.<n>

I have been married to my second husband for 8 years.  He was in the other room at the time.  The exact time is not clear, but I believe it was between 6-7 pm.  I saw the UFO from my bedroom window in the northern sky. At first, I noticed a flashing light, which at first glance, I thought to be an airplane as we live right next to Mather AFB.  Then I noticed the triangle shaped object.  It was pointed like an arrow with a space between the two sides.  The color is what really caught my attention;  it was a bright florescent green color.  I knew this was no ordinary plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, the flashing light stopped and it shot into space leaving a bright green trail behind.  It was so fast, it could not have been an airplane.  It was blinking, then sped away.  Amazing.<n>

Some made triangle formations<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:30pm on 12/23/14, my fiance and I were heading back from our daughter&#39;s appointment.  We were at the intersection of Hwy 100 and Oklahoma heading East when we noticed 2 orange/amber looking lights in the sky directly in front of us.  One was higher than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over to the side of the road a few blocks up since they seemed to be right over us at this spot.  The lights were coming from the SW and were heading NE.  They came by the pairs with one usually slightly higher than the other and they all (the pairs) seemed to be equidistant from each other  When directly over us they were a really intense orange/amber color and extraordinarily bright and they all had an aura of color over them that was either white, red or very light baby blue.  At random, some lights would flicker out and then sometimes went back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved at a steady pace and some even stopped and hovered fora short time before continuing on.  We observed some of them get into a triangle formation, and then moved together at the same speed so as to retain the triangle it had made.  I briefly captured the formation on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe these objects were capable of great speeds due to the fact we were able to see these intense orange fiery orbs go from a massive light to just a point in the sky like a star.  Then as the second the last pair flew over us, one of the lights blacked out (my fiance observed this).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance said he still saw the object moving despite the fact it went out.  After a few moments I saw it too.  It was easy to see it because it had been raining so there was a lot of overcast.  What I saw was a solid black circle silhouetted against the sky.  We watched it until it eventually it disappeared behind the trees in front of us.  The lights either faded away or they either blinked and went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought these were helicopter but there wasn&#39;t any headlights or anything which was odd since it was dark and overcast out.  I don&#39;t think they were flares or anything because they were sometimes stationary, and we were able to observe the shape of the object.  There was no sound except for the cars behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were able to obtain footage on our phones<n>

We live in the same house.  This past Monday night.  I stepped out of the house to smoke a cigarette.  I noticed some plane or something with a bright orange light slowly coming towards us and steady climbing.  Then I realized that this didn&#39;t look or act like a plane.  In awe of this glowing orange globe it seemed to start climbing a little more rapidly.  Then I saw a second, then third one all following the first one it seemed  and at a substantial equal distances and in a perfect straight line.  I ran to get my brother and told him to hurry and come look at this and with the tone of my voice he turned and ran for the door to follow me.  I ran to the backyard which is the south side of the house and they were still in sight approximately 4-5 miles to the south.  All of a sudden the lead one who was climbing in altitude almost strait up but at a slight angle seemed to level out turning in a southerly directi! on then just vanished.  The second two were on the same path behind the lead one and 20-30 seconds later they also disappeared.  My mom ran and looked through the back window when she heard the commotion.  They made me not be a skeptic anymore.  You know I&#39;ve always wished that I could see a UFO just once.  And now that I&#39;ve seen one, I&#39;m not so sure now.  It&#39;s kinda cool but also really scary!!!<n>

They weren&#39;t in a perfect linear straight line ,they started from the front  which my guess would  of looked like it was pointed south  and the straight line angled downward about 9 or 10 degrees then straight again.  I first started watching the lights over the Superstition Mtns when i was leaving work off of Baseline and Country Club in west mesa.  The lights hovered and stayed still all the way till I got to Meridian and apache trail in AJ.  That&#39;s 20 minutes of driving on the Rte 60 heading east.  They were high above the mountain and stayed there till i got 2 other guys to look.  They just said, &#34;THEY&#39;RE EVERYWHERE now!!&#34;<n>

I watched it fly south, toward my direction, in a non-linear fashion until it was practically right overhead, still slightly to the North.  The single light dimmed temporarily before flaring up and breaking up into 3-5 different pieces that all went separate directions at different speeds.  When the original light broke up, it brightened immensely and seemed to fall apart, with the separate pieces having tails similar to a small fireball.  Some stayed illuminated, some dimmed to faint red dots barely discernable from the night stars.  After about 15-20 seconds, all of the lights had dimmed to blinking red dots flying in separate directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes after this event occurred, another amber-colored light appeared on the Northern horizon, in the same exact area and followed the same general path in the sky. The flickering amber light flew to the same general area that I had seen the previous one in, and broke apart in the same manner as the first, dispersing fireball-like lights in separate directions that all eventually turned into blinking red lights.  The lights changed direction and speed, but never fast enough to seem like a shooting star or something falling into our atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was compelled enough to call the local Non-Emergency line to report this incident, and they actually dispatched two units to my house fairly quickly, within 10 minutes of my call.  I was surprised to say the least.  By the time they had shown up, the lights were gone and I was left defending my sobriety and right state of mind.  After a few minutes describing what I had seen, the police jovially dismissed me by stating, &#34;Sadly enough, I don&#39;t have the Magic School Bus, and I can&#39;t fly up there and investigate what you saw.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually appreciated his humor and thanked him for his time.<n>

About 8 minutes later, as I turned away from the lake heading towards my house, I saw the same lights over a housing development.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then witnessed the lights stopping over a house and saw that they were in a triangular formation.  One light was green on light was red and one light was clear.  The triangular shape was about the same size of the house and low enough that I could make out the edges of the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my car in park by the house across the street from the house that the triangle was over intending to take a picture or video when it started moving away.  I then proceeded to follow it around until it stopped over enough development closer to the lake.  The same pattern of following the shape and stopping under or near it continued for approximately 20 minutes.  It hovered over the high school softball field, various neighborhoods, and road intersections.   Whenever it would move the green and red lights went out while the clear light remained blinking.  I was able to take a short video of the clear blinking light moving.  I was on the phone with my brother from half of the event and then I stopped following the triangular shape to pick him up to show him what I was describing to him.  We went in the direction that I last saw it heading, but was unable to find it again after 20 minutes of searching.<n>

Approximately 3 minutes away from Belleville, Indiana, I was driving my car on U.S. Highway 40.  I looked up to see a bright star in the right of my windshield, and to the right, I saw a red/green light.  At first glance it looked like a radio tower, so I thought nothing of it.  As I tried to focus in on the object (while also trying to maintain position on the road), I realized that there was no radio tower in that area, nor would a radio tower reach a couple hundred feet above the treeline.  I began to slow down my car so I could focus in on the object more.  Considering I was the only one on the road for a little ways, I slowed down to around 20 mph.  When I looked into my upper left hand side, I saw what seemed to be a blackened cigar shaped craft, with pulsing chevron red &amp; green lights.  It looked like the lights were on a conveyor belt, basically rotating around the cra! ft.  As I began to speed back up, the craft disappeared.  I tried to rule out, though I am not denying the fact that it is a possibility that this craft was in fact a helicopter, plane, or other perfectly normal object.  However, there were no &#34;blinking&#34; lights like a plan, nor would a plane hover in the same spot for a few minutes.  A helicopter could hover, however I would have assumed I would have heard some bit of noise.  Not here, it was silent.<n>

It was completely odd and caught my attention right away.  It actually looked like 2 lights side-by-side, horizontal to the ground,  very close together or possibly even attached.  Brighter than a star.. well, brighter than Sirius (which appears in the Eastern sky this time of year)  I started watching it, completely perplexed by the color.  My first thought was that it might be someone playing with a drone, but it wasn&#39;t like any drone I&#39;ve ever seen (I&#39;ve seen a few in my life.. my neighbor even has a large one).  The light was steady and brilliant, not flashing.  It didn&#39;t have the typical red/green, flashing lights that you would expect from an R/C toy or airplane.  It wasn&#39;t a satellite either.  I&#39;m former military (Navy Electronic Warfare) and I can assure you that I&#39;ve never seen anything in the sky with the same color light.  In fact, the sky was totally overcast that night, but below the clouds it was very clear and there was good visibility.  No stars were visible, nor could I see any of the usual air traffic heading into the Bay Area because of the cloud layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I spotted the object, it looked like it was maybe 200-300 yards to the East at less than 500 ft in altitude... essentially over my neighborhood.  At first it looked stationary, like it was hovering.  Then it started to slowly move East (away from me).  I noticed that I couldn&#39;t hear any &#39;drone&#39; sounds.. nor any other sounds from planes, etc.  As I watched, it seemed to speed up a little, the all of the sudden took a 90-degree left turn (at speed) and moved a short distance before abruptly stopping.  I would estimate it moved maybe 200 yds in less than one second.  I literally said  “#@!*%$&amp;!*” out loud to myself!!   That&#39;s when I realized I had my phone in my left hand... duh!!  I immediately launched the camera and started to record some video.  It&#39;s not great video...  the object looks really tiny, almost invisible on my Samsung s5, but you can certainly see it when playing back on a laptop, or something with a bigger screen.  It looks like a white star moving away fr! om me and unfortunately, you can&#39;t see the purple-ish color, it just looks like a white dot.  By the time I got the video going it had started to move Eastward again, slowly almost wavering a bit before moving behind the trees across the street from my house and out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later I was still outside trying to play back the video and one of the typical airliners that I usually see flew overhead.. I couldn&#39;t actually see it because of the cloud cover, but I could definitely hear it.  So, whatever I saw and recorded that night was flying below the clouds and not making any noise.  It wasn&#39;t a plane or any other celestial object, not a drone, missile, meteor, etc.... I&#39;m somewhat of a trained observer...  I have a military background and also have a couple pilots in my immediate family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, the video is only a few seconds long.  At one point I tried to zoom, but it went out of view, then I un-zoomed and found it again.    I&#39;d be happy to share a link to my Google drive if your interested in seeing it.  Otherwise, I don&#39;t really want to post it online anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious if anyone else has report something similar?  The color was amazing hard to describe.. neon fuchsia, pinkish-purple... really really odd, but pretty.<n>

The craft looked like a hexagon (6 corners), though due to the distance, it was a bit hard to know if that was its exact shape.  It was black in color.  At times, it would turn sideways, and it was clear that it was flat as a board.  It did not have an exhaust but during the sighting, there appeared to be a whitish, halo effect around it but only during part of the sighting.  It went slowly over westwards towards the ocean and then turned in southerly direction and then slowly continued in a somewhat easterly direction thereafter.  During the time that I saw it, it basically made a large &#34;c&#34; type of a travel pattern.  Most interestingly, it seemed at the end to simply rise up through the clouds (though it did not increase it elevation for the first 8-9 minutes of the sighting).  There were two other people who were also doing the same hike, and came and started to talk with me about the thing that we were looking at in the sky.  They were as confounded as me.  We all witnessed this sighing, and I have a video of about 3 minutes long that I took on my smart phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was the same as stated in that report:  A very large object; in the shape that migrating geese fly and the so called bottom of it had many equally spaced lights on it.  For the little time I was able to get a fairly decent view, the lights appeared to be all white, but pretty large.  Just as I was about to pull over to get a better view it appeared to ascend slowly into the clouds with an eerie type glow in the surrounding clouds.

I googled UFO Punta Gorda/Cape Coral to see if there was a news report of a UFO that night, and came across this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday night, my wife and I were in bed, and I got up to close our bedroom window for the night.  We are used to seeing planes in the area since there is more than one airport in close proximity.  What we saw that night occurred above the Yucca Pens Unit Wildlife Management Area from our best guess.  When I went to close the window, I noticed a red/blue/yellow light, and I at first assumed it was an extremely slow moving plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds I mentioned to my wife that there was plane or something with more lights then I have seen before.  She took a look and didn’t mention the lights but said, “It’s not moving,” so I am there staring at it to see if it moves, then I don’t know to explain it but it moved abruptly then stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it had our full attention.  I asked my wife if she saw what I just witnessed and she confirmed that she had.  It then stayed stationary long enough for my wife to lay back down.  I could not stop watching since I was curious to what I seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing is literally like something out of a movie.  The thing shot upwards (vertically), then it disappeared in the horizon.

Near thanksgiving time (canada). Ever since, we have kept our eyes out for sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not to long ago, I was on the phone with my father while he was driving home from work.  He was about an hour ways from where I am.  He tells me he sees an orange line in the sky, he tells me to go outside and look so I do so.  I look around for a couple seconds and I notice it.  The thin, distinct orange line was located slightly above the sun&#39;s horizon (the sun was setting at the time).  The line started moving to the right for around a minute, then just stayed in place.  At this point I realize that what I&#39;m looking at is not a jet, the line stayed the same size and remained very thin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after the line sitting in place for around 10 seconds, another line from the same line started moving to the left.  So, you have the same line remaining in the same spot, and then another line moving to the left away from that line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the two lines were apart.  At a bit of a faster speed then they were separating, the two lines start getting closer and closer together and now they are combined into one line again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I run inside to get my mother and we get outside and its still there in the sky, in the same spot.  A couple seconds later, it slowly fades away.  The line/lines are gone now.  When they faded away, I also saw sort of like a magnetic force shot up through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading my report.<n>

Upon further observance, I realized it was a flying craft of some sort.  I observed for a moment or two and then noticed a second one behind it.  I continued to my car and put down my things and dug out my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cylindrical craft were pretty far off and hard to see through the cell phone camera.  I could see with the naked eye that there was what appeared to be a separation or indentation in the center of the craft.  I am not sure I’m seeing its side or underneath, but I think I was seeing the side of the craft.  I can see there are no wings or propellers.  They are just bright moving cylinders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving westward.  I was unable to determine if there was any sound associated with the craft as there was a chainsaw noise a few doors down.   Not long after I lost sight of the UFOs a jetliner passed over and it was obvious it was a jetliner.  I could see the wings, the side and underside as well.  The 2 craft I had been observing were not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect some sort of government operation, but I cannot be certain.  I have never seen craft such as these before.  I did a youtube search and found someone in Ireland who saw the identical scene.  They also saw 2 bright daytime craft very much like what I observed.  Also, there were a lot of large black birds flying at the same time I was videoing the craft.<n>

It was approximately 11:00pm (23:00)  On December 17, 2014.  At first it appeared not to move, we observed this for a minute ,the location and color was peculiar so I pulled over to the side of the road . It was a cloudy night , the clouds were  high , no stars could be seen in the sky.  The light was located high in the sky at 45 degree angle in front  us ,above route 12 .  Then it shot across the sky very fast to our left from in front of us to a ten o’clock position .  It stopped made a few short up and down , right and left movements and real small tight circles then shot across the sky to our right to a two o’clock position, it stopped then disappeared . The light did change from the bright blue to and amber color a few times while moving &amp;gt; I attempted to take picture with a digital camera but it could not focus in and take pictures But  I did get 47 seconds of video on my Ipod .  I estimate we observed this for 3 to 4 minutes .  The light was high in the sky above an open field when it when out .<n>

This I believe was not man made, it was approximately a mile and half from my window, height in the sky unknown but if I looked above the treeline half a mile away it would be at almost a 35 degree angle from my line of sight.

It wasn&#39;t as high an elevation as jets use but was that of possibly a low flying smaller aircraft.  I stood thinking it was a helicopter coming from Atlanta to LaGrange but was not sure so I decided to stop and watch it fly over.  I waited but with the sensation that it was approaching I soon realized it was either moving very slow or not moving at all.  I was just about to tell my husband to come out side when the light or power was turned off on the aircraft and the sky was black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds two horizontal stacked rows of 5-9 red lights appeared in a straight line at the location where I had originally seen the bright light in the sky.  The red lights went ! off and within a few seconds of nothing but black, the lights reappeared in the same formation but appeared to be blue in color.  These went black also within seconds and the red lights reappeared.  These lights continued alternating colors going off and on multiple times and I went to the door and called my daughter and husband to come out and look.  My daughter took a picture and a video of the object and the row of red lights.  The video nor the camera took a picture of the object as my daughter was certain she had done so.  The I phone would not work but always has in the past.  But she did see the row of red lights.  As my husband came out the row of lights had disappeared and the object had reached within a mile of my house and at this time only had a couple of red and white lights underneath it as a plane would have.  It was much larger than a Cessna plane but the night was so black I could not distinguish the shape.  A smaller plane was flying west to east behind us and the ! aircraft we were watching made in less than a 1/4 of a mile width a U -turn before reaching us and proceeded back north at a somewhat faster pace than it had approached us towards the Newnan, Ga, area.<n>

After  our shift we were headed back to our homes, we car pool together, all 11 of us in company van.  About 5 minutes before entering LaBelle, FL. (the city we live in) while driving North on State Road 29, I was looking at the sky and almost as if out of nowhere a White Triangular craft manifested itself through the clouds in the East.  I yelled to my co- workers &#34;Ovni! OVNI!!!!!&#34; ( Which is Spanish for UFO). Everyone immediately looked up and it almost seemed as if time, inside the van, slowed down immensely.  I felt as if the van was just smoothly floating down the road. A few seconds went by, (5-10 by my estimation) and after moving a few miles to the West, the craft disappeared into nothing.  As if it just collapsed into itself and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always heard of black triangular shaped crafts, but never a white one, which just added to the strangeness.  This one had many of the same characteristics as its black counter parts.  It was totally silent, it showed no exhaust system, and it seemed to defy the laws of aerodynamics gliding  flawlessly through the air at a slow speed. It&#39;s hard for me to be sure of it&#39;s exact size, since I have no reference points to do the trigonometry, but if I had to estimate it&#39;s size, I would say it is somewhere in between 35-40 ft in length, from the front tip to the back of the craft and 25-35 ft in maximum width from one of the back corners to the other. I realize this is much smaller than the black triangles that have been reported, which is also a bit strange.  I don&#39;t know if the two have anything in common besides the obvious, I just hope more people see it.<n>

At first glance I thought it was a group of birds flying together, but as it came closer, I noticed it was a cigar shaped oval.  It was black, or appeared black because it looked as though it was behind the clouds. It was weaving back and forth at an alarmingly fast rate.  It almost looked like it was turning, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was turning away from me, side to side, or all the way around. There was a big light on the under side of it.

I had my sun roof open going NW bound on W Meeting Street which is in the area of Lancaster Mill, SC 29720.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While heading down the hill, I turning on my cruise control to the speed limit.  I then leaned back in my seat to glance up at the sunset&#39;s effect on the clouds.  That&#39;s when I noticed a white glowing spherical object in the sky.  After a brief check of the road in front of me, I looked back up once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I could see from my angle was a bright white hot glowing spherical light, but as it traveled it started to morph from the glowing all white light in to what looked like the shape of a metal or aluminum box that only had three sides.  The left side was a mix of bright white hot orangey colors as if it were fire or maybe reflecting the sunset.  The bottom side was mix of the same colors, bright but warmish.  The top was a mix of light blue to silvery to grey colors that changed as it traveled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I briefly checked the road again and then looked back up and took a few seconds to get a good clear focus on the shape again when I got the feeling it was tracking my speed which was about 45 mph.  As I stayed focused on the sphere I tapped the brake with my foot to shut off the cruise control and it led me for a second or so as I declined in speed but then I noticed I caught up to it again and thats when I saw what looked like antenna protruding out of the 3 sides of the now squarish shaped sphere then it started to slowly increase its speed as I got closer to going under the overpass to go onto the on ramp to go towards Chester county.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got on the overpass, it was out of my site.  I guesstimate it was about 2,000. to 2,500. feet up I say this only because of its size.

The craft was traveling south to south west at what looked at maybe 500-800 feet high.  When it crossed over the hwy I noticed there was no red blinking light, and once it was to my right, I can see the outline if the craft.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle (all sides same length).  With a light at each corner.  So a triangle craft with 3 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw craft for approximately 20-30 seconds.<n>

On my way to school today, at 6:41 central standard time I witnessed a strange sighting in the eastern sky.  I saw an object which appeared to be 2/3 of a triangle (or the leading edge of a chevron or an arrow falling from the sky.  It was either white or faint blue in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What got my attention is that it changed direction in flight.  It went from falling downward at a slightly southern angle to falling straight down.  The total sighting lasted no longer than 2 seconds.  On thinking about it later, I wonder if I saw the sonic wave or buffer and did not see an object but instead saw its sonic wave.  Whatever it was the change in direction got me.<n>

One of my roommates was also outside with me, but looking in a different direction when the event occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing east when I noticed a bright white orb of light on the horizon.  It was moving from south to north with extreme velocity. In the course of about 3 seconds the orb-like object continued on it’s path in the West-Northwest direction with speed near that of a shooting star until it spontaneously disappeared from sight ( no visual obstructions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best estimation, based off of observation, is that the object was between 10,000 and 15,000 ft elevation and moving at least 20x-30x faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the orb I exclaimed for my roommate to look, and by the time he was facing in the right direction it had just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was my first UFO sighting, I figured I should report it especially since I am very curious if anyone else in this area saw it.<n>

So i continued to my car(walking slowly the entire time to keep my eyes on the lights) but in the short time it took to look down to step off the curb the one on the left disappeared. then as i walked and refused to look away again i bumped into another co-worker and pointed them out to her, but she continued inside seemingly uninterested also. So as i look on the one on the right and the center one were climbing &#34;straight&#34; up ,from my view,and the one on the right disappeared and finally the one in the center climbed the highest and disappeared.they didn&#39;t flicker or anything,they were very well defined constant lights.i looked on the way in and after work but didnt see them again sadly.<n>

Just then, I asked her to look and what we observed was astonishing:  In the darkness amid security and moon lights, we could make out that the light was quite high above compared to tree level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we forgot what we were talking about and continued to watch this light very slowly descend over a particular house.  It would glow slowly and then dim, dim, dim as it continued to descend.  My friend thought it must have been an airplane but fortunately a few degrees to our left were planes flying to JKIA, so it was very easy to compare and tell if this was a plane or not.  Definitely not a chopper because we were close enough to here any sound that could have been emanating from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally got cold and tired and parted ways, but on getting to my apartment, remembered that I had forgotten to buy groceries, so without thinking, picked up some coins and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I was climbing my stairs when I decided to check again.  This was almost an hour later when I noticed that the big glow was now so dimmed but i could still make out its position between two trees due to security lights and the moonlight.  But now there seemed to be another smaller light that was busy hovering around the same house as though trying to look for an opening to get in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for another few minutes, shook my head, and walked towards my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I must mention that the following day, my girlfriend complained that she had, had nightmares like something was tampering with her body at night.  She complained of being tired and disturbed overnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a blue I&#39;d never seen before.  Much like a blue Christmas light. but orbital, gigantic and bright, and a bit more cyan than a Christmas light.  It seemed to take a downward arc from a high altitude, and it went as far down as I could see behind the trees along the horizon about a mile away from me, near Nobscot mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to measure scale, but I&#39;d estimate it was about the size of a full-size pickup truck, length-wise. It was not a flare, airplane, helicopter, or meteor, which I&#39;ve seen many of at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior, speed, trajectory, size and color were enough to add up to an anomalous object in the night sky.  It never faded, didn&#39;t have a trail of any sort, and had a slight flare around it, due to the brightness of the object.<n>

He gave me the approximate location so I went outside with my phone and binoculars and saw the larger orb.  I could see the flashing lights with my naked eye - green, red, white, blue. When I used my binoculars, they were very bright and clear, like an LED light, not blurry, and flashing in a rotating pattern around a glowing orb. I live near a flight line and witnessed several planes pass by.  This was not a plane.  It hovered in the same spot for about fifteen minutes and then began to slowly drift south.  Not fast.  I could barely tell it was moving. At one point it disappeared then reappeared within a few seconds.  As it drifted south, the flashing lights lessened in intensity.  I could only see them with binoculars at that point as the light seemed to be getting a bit smaller and looked more like a bright star to the naked eye. I brought my husband outside to w! itness the phenomena.  He is ex military and said it was not a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound. I took a video with my phone.  Granted, it&#39;s not the greatest and the orb looks small but you can still see the flashing lights.  I&#39;m not sure what it was.  I&#39;ve tried to debunk but honestly, I can&#39;t come up with an answer.  At one point on the video, I describe it as resembling a flashing Christmas tree full of multi-colored lights. What impressed me most was the brilliance of the lights.  It may not be anything but I wanted to report it since it was so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.  PD))<n>

He asked if he could break out his telescope and look at the stars since the moon’s not out.  We said sure and went into the back yard to do a little stargazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been outside for about 20 minutes and had seen a few shooting stars and a few planes.  We all kind of fixated on this one light though that my wife thought was a plane because you could see it blinking, but I thought was something else (honestly, I thought it was a star) because I was able to lock in on it through the telescope.  I said that if it were a plane, then I wouldn’t be able to hold it in the telescope long enough that we could all take a look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started watching it at about 2012 as it started to do some pretty weird things.  First it would blink like crazy (white, red, and blue), then it would just sort of twinkle a little.  Then it started swinging left and right, just sort of rocking back and forth.  It also started bouncing up and down in the sky and doing loops (moving in a circle) in front of us.  I saw three planes in the sky around this odd light that were able to move along like I had seen most planes do, but this thing was still in more or less the same place it had been at when we first saw it after almost half an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2040, we decided that we needed to go in since it was cold and the kids have school in the morning.  We ran into my neighbor, who we showed the light in the sky to, and he said, “That’s cool.” And then went to get his wife to show her too.  That’s when I came inside and started talking about maybe calling the local police or something.  My wife was outside still, but when she came in she asked if I was serious, told me that she had seen the light go out and come back on again, and then looked up a way to report a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  &#34;Twinkling&#34; star, possibly Sirius.

Not to mention it sounds alot like it is coming from the air above the distant northern area. If it is just a road, I never noticed the noise.  This peaked my interest and curiosity, and I started walking my dog south in the direction of the neighborhood&#39;s dumpster to throw away a trash bag, away from the noise with my back to it, occasionally looking backwards into the sky.  A little over halfway to the dumpster I look behind me once more, and I see an orb of white or gray light shooting across the sky about 3 or 5 times faster than a nearby plane would. It was at no point stationary, and I saw it moving from right to left at about a 35 or 40 degree angle downwards, and I lost sight of it when it went behind the horizon formed by nearby trees and houses.  If you were looking straight dow! n the horizon and moved your eyes about 10 degrees upward, that is where the object was in terms of height/distance.  No sound from the object, and I am unsure if the whooshing is related. I can still hear it now however, about an hour or less later.  Everything appears noisier than usual tonight, and there seems to an increase in air traffic, however I do often see many aircraft due to living somewhat not far from an airport.  From my terrace I have a large view of the sky because of the empty space caused by the lake.<n>

While he was on his cell phone, he noticed two red round and erratically pulsating objects off to the northwest.  One of the objects dipped down into the treeline near a local park called Green Mountain Lake (which is off the Appalachian Trail and located near a ridge that connects to West Mountain.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object hovered visibly in the forest on the mountain-side for a few minutes.  Then, it quickly turned white and shot off at in at a diagonal, moving southwest at great speed.  The speed at which this object moved confirmed it was not a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being close to the door, our guest yelled back to us, &#34;Do you guys want to see a UFO?&#34; With that, 3 other family members including myself went outside and where we also briefly witnessed the second red glowing object repeat the same pattern: dipping into the treeline, hoveri! ng, turning white and shooting off at great speed.  Our neighbor, who was walking his dog, also saw the incident and asked us, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  In addition, as we live in a high traffic flight zone, there was one airplane flying at a higher alititude moving in westward direction possibly toward Stewart Airport at the time.<n>

(PST)  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> At 19:21 - according to my phone&#39;s call log - I received a call from my best friend, (who lives just over ten miles away in Norco, CA.), telling me that she was startled and amazed to be looking at &#39;something really weird&#39; in the night skies over her home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed out my own door (to see if I could spot anything), I realized that it was unlikely I&#39;d be able to even see the sky at all - due to massive rains all day and low, thick, stormy clouds not to mention our distance from one another. However, as I stepped out from between the houses and into the open, I found it to be largely clearing above and to the west. As I scanned the dark, patchy skies, I immediately spotted several aircraft tracking and blinking as on any normal, Friday evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she continued trying to relate to me in excited bewilderment what she was seeing, I was just beginning to scan the night sky above my own house when she suddenly cursed that it had vanished; it had abruptly just &#39;winked out&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she started-in bitterly about its sudden absence, off to my west (toward Norco) - something odd suddenly DID catch my eye and I had to stop her. It was something odd and it was tracking southward. Whatever it was, it was clearly and definitely NOT an airplane. I was confused by its appearance. I initially considered a meteor, but no ...then a comet... but also no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a small, solid, red light, shaped rather oblong lengthwise - like a thick grain of rice - with a comparatively huge, translucent &#39;bloom&#39; behind it; kind of like the ones that envelop the rear halves of fighter jets as they pierce the sound barrier. But that&#39;s not what this was. It was utterly soundless and appeared to be moving more at the pace of a Cessna or helicopter, rather than any sort of jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gobsmacked, I focused and strained and squinted to get as good of a look as possible as I mumbled into my cellphone what I was seeing as she excitedly confirmed that it was exactly what she had just been observing. I was able to clearly see it for a good six seconds, as it moseyed slowly along, due south - directly (and maddeningly) toward one of the many low, pink, angry clouds around the area. It then moved behind the cloud from whence I never saw it emerge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the &#39;color-change&#39; box because although to me the object shone in an unblinking, unchanging &#39;stoplight red&#39;, my friend swears that it appeared as a bright white, to her. But what we both DID clearly see was the huge &#39;plume&#39; at the trailing end. It was in fact this odd feature that first drew the eye. It looked like the top of an open, translucent &#39;umbrella&#39; curved back and emanating directly from the rear of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, there were typical, nighttime aviation activities ongoing in the skies above me - flickering jetliners and local flights headed this way and that at their various flight levels. I spotted about five or six flashing lights immediately and easily identifiable as normal, evening air traffic - but they all seemed oblivious to the object, which - in fairness - was more or less in a patch of sky sort of off to itself - and fairly equidistant from any other traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly, I&#39;ve been unable to find any local (nor anywhere) mention of this phenomenon on the internet. SURELY she and I COULDN&#39;T have been the only ones in Southern California to have seen this amazing object.<n>

He noticed the object in question first and said &#34;Look!&#34; I turned and we observed what appeared to be a comet or craft with a large trail behind it which was orange in color heading from east to west.  After about 20 seconds, the trail abruptly stopped and we could only see the light of the presumed craft.  It continued travel in the same direction.  After about another 20 seconds, a large semi circle that was translucent and glowy, hues of green and yellow if I had to use a color to describe it, but it wasn&#39;t one distinct color.  The craft was at the front, and it was as if there was a circle behind it, but only half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I&#39;d say about another 30 seconds, the circle disappeared, and then a couple seconds later the light of the craft was gone as well.  It was truly bizarre.  My mother said she saw the same thing in Long beach, roughly 40 miles to the south east.

I will add more math details to attempt to calculate speed and size of this object according to the first memory of it.   It appeared with alacrity.   I was not looking directly at the spot where it appeared but because it just appeared so fast that my eyes registered the bright silver light in the east  that I witnessed it move so quickly.  It did not slide into view.   It “turned on” as one would a switch.   I surmise that either I seen it enter into view and zoom off into the mountain range.  Or that it entered into visible sight and kept its momentum.   The actual sighting lasted one second or less and the time from the moment I registered a event happening by sight to when I recognized this elliptical silver bight light move very quickly.  Aren’t comets always like yellowish because when they are burning in the entry of the atmosphere they get superhot and burn?  This one was like a low power purple florescent light.  Had I been able to see it wink out in the sky like normal I wouldn’t be writing this but it was far enough that a building across the street hid the rest of its final moments in the visible sky.<n>

As I approached the Ahwatukee area entering onto Pecos Rd it became clear these 4 lights were far off in the distance near the southern tip of the Estrella Mountain Range.  I have witness these UFO&#39;s before back in the late 90&#39;s with father, very similar in fashion to the famous &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34;  I see planes come and go every night, and I know what their landing lights look like.  These were much brighter and far larger in their radiant glow.  It appeared to me that they were even gaining altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost sight of them as I went under the I-10 interchange.  When I came out the other side past Pecos Park I caught a glimpse of them right as they blinked out of existence separately, but rapidly in succession.

But I am not a licensed pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, who did not witness these, but the previous ones in the 90&#39;s, said he had seen nothing like it.  He is an aerospace tech who works on jet engines and was a former aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force.  Commonly our local Luke Air Force base claims these lights are flares from the fighters performing bombing runs at the Barry Goldwater Range.  While this is a large range its no where near the location of these lights.<n>

It was low enough that I could clearly make out flames coming out of it in a downward direction.  The best I could describe it, is a small, slow moving sun, about the size of a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thought was a hot air balloon on fire, but soon realized that was not what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a full view of it for about 5 minutes.

We stepped outside and I looked to the sky and thought to myself how brilliant the stars looked.  Immediately, I noticed two long cylinder-shaped objects in the sky.  I pointed them out to my fiance and he gasped.  We watched the objects for about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were parallel to each other and moving in a NE direction.  They were brightly lit and white almost silverish in color and identical.  Moving at high speeds, they suddenly began to criss-cross with each other.  Kind of zig zagging and began to lower altitude until they vanished behind some pollution clouds from the nearby factory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was unlike anything I ever witnessed in my entire life.  My fiance saw it as well and we were both amazed.  There is no possible way they could have been known human crafts. Not a shooting star, meteor or comet.  Not weather balloons, or commonly human made objects.  I am positive that they were intelligently maneuvered.  There is no doubt in my mind that I saw something truly magnificent tonight.<n>

In a pattern, 4 total.  If a star looks like the size of a nail head these looked more like a small plate that is used under a coffee cup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not real white, but more amber in color.  I waited a little and the same thing happened but they seemed a little farther away.  These lights kept going on and off for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they stopped I continued on my way home.  I turned the corner and kept my eyes on my rear view mirror.   I looked out to the west of the car and the lights were back.  I stopped the car and watched as they did the same thing, but this time one of them turned on and there were about 4 other lights in the same area.  The lights did this for at least 5 minutes.<n>

They were solid orange and very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued southbound on Gilbert Rd to Ocotillo Rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:35 I arrived at my home near the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Ocotillo.  The neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor Christmas decorations.  I pointed the lights out, and they saw them too.  The objects had moved southwest from the original sighting, but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  We watched them for a few minutes and I began getting things from my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors said, “The lights are gone,” and a few minutes later, they said, “There they are again.”  I stepped out of the garage to look, and snapped a photo with my phone.  This time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  A few minutes later, after getting my son ready for bed, I looked out the 2nd story window.  I saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line, parallel to the ground but were further west than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  They lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:55 the lights reappeared and I went to get binoculars.  The binoculars didn’t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  I went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  Then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than they before, so I went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  I took a few more pictures with my phone.  This time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  At 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so I went back out to the balcony.  The light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but I still could not tell what it was.  While I was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other! four. There was a total of seven lights in a straight line. There were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. They were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  They lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but I managed to take some more photos with my phone.  They all disappeared at 9:31 and I went inside. At 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. I continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be near the Gila River Indian community and south of the Chandler Municipal Airport.  Being a former Air force Security Police K-9 handler and living near the municipal airport I know what planes and helicopters look like.   These objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not Chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that I am aware of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing a bit of online research I found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. I called the Chandler Municipal airport and the Chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. I will keep an eye on the sky and maybe I will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.<n>

Same brightness but some distance from each other over the Eastern side of Maricopa as we drove down John Wayne Parkway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a third orange light appeared in between the other two.  It slowly faded from nothing into a bright light just like the other two were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, the light on the far left faded out and disappeared.  As we got into town, the two that remained got closer together and seemed so close they may be touching.  Then they faded into darkness as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted about 20-25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing to note, there was a spotlight display happening at the same time from in front of the grocery store in the middle of town, we could see it from a few miles out of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t get pictures because we were driving, and didn&#39;t think about it until it was too late.<n>
12/11/14 16:40|Birmingham|AL|Fireball|20 minutes|UFOs moving fast like fireballs or individual rockets.|12/12/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115924.html|387|ndxe201412| Multiple lights in the sky in Litchfield Park Arizona<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a 45 year old college graduate.  My job is a server admin at a local utility.  I&#39;m also familiar with many types of aircraft and the flight paths around my area.  I considered myself to be educated and use good logic.  In the past I&#39;ve seen things in the sky that at first I could not explain, however on further thought I am able to determine what I had seen in logical terms.  This is the first time I could not come to a logical reason for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just finished up being an aide in my son’s Religious Education class at Church and was walking to my automobile.  Out of my left eye, I caught an orange light in the sky to the North.  I then turned to look at it and noticed several more objects in trail, not flying in any sort of formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked to the Northwest in the direction of Luke Air Force Base and saw several others appearing from that direction.  After viewing in Church parking lots for several minutes and taking two pictures, my son and I drove about a half mile north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were almost directly over us at this point, and appeared to be a round flat light. I took another picture.  As I was viewing them the lights appeared to go straight up and disappear into a thin cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drive about 1,100 feet east from the point to get a better view.  One last object appeared from same direction as others; however this one appeared to be larger than others.  This last object disappeared straight up before I could u! nlock my phone to take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not in any flight pattern I’ve seen in the 12 years living in this area.  And I could look behind and above me to see the normal pattern of planes flying in/out of Sky Harbor and through its air space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they might have been military helicopters.  However I’ve seen flights of helicopters out of the Arizona National Guard base before and they tend to fly in formation and lower.  Also each object had only one light with no visible tail rotor light.  Further I ruled out hot air balloons because the lights were two small for that (the entire balloon usually lights up at night).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next thought was that I was seeing afterburners on jets out of Luke AFB.  But this did not fit either.  Flights out of the AFB are usually around four to six jets, and flying in some sort of formation.  Also with 30 plus fighter jets in afterburners, the noise would have been horrendous.  These objects made no observable sounds.  Also if these were jets, they would have been moving much quicker in horizontal flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My final thought was they could be Chinese lanterns.  However since they flew nearly level for quite some time and then went vertical, this would rule them out.  Balloons with some sort of light attached to them.  Further given the proximity to Luke AFB and Glendale Airport, I find it hard to believe that a group would get permission for such a launch.<n>

This then repeated 4 separate  times in different locations in the sky before stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds accompanied the lights and no sounds followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance very similar to military aircraft defence flares to begin with but vastly different in behavior after initial flash.<n>

It was a perfect triangle covered with lights across the whole bottom.  It was hovering and so close to the ground that I felt as though I could shake hands with the pilot.

Military jets, helis, and a b2 followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night, in the early evening, right after dark, I was leaving the local Ruidoso grocery store.  As I pulled onto the road from the grocery store, my wife and I experienced a mystifying event that carried on for maybe 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we exited the parking lot of the grocery store I noticed a large and extremely bright orange orb directly above us.  I started yelling with excitement for my wife to look, and at that moment, the orb was now right in front of us and suddenly split into 3 orbs all large and amber/orange in color maybe 1500 feet above ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs began traveling at a high rate of speed to the north.  I then rolled down my window to look at the sky and see if could hear anything.  No Sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I notice 2 fighter jets traveling in the same direction, at a high rate of speed, and these planes I could hear.  The jets were left in the dust.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of disparity to maybe get a glimpse of this phenomenon again we proceeded to a look out point a couple miles up the road.  We pulled over and began scanning the sky.  My wife saw the orbs first and drew my attention to where they were.  This time there were 2 orbs above the Tularosa, NM, region.  They were hovering in the horizon for a couple minutes then went dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited a couple minutes longer and two more jets came from the east heading in the direction of the orbs at a high rate of speed.  As the jets approached, the orbs made themselves visible again, and went straight up several thousand feet, then dropped back down instantly to where they were right above the horizon, as if they were trying to get the attention of the jets, maybe to taunt them.  The orbs then collided into one another and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets made several circles in the area of where we saw the orbs.  After a few minutes the jets turned and made their way back towards Holloman Air Force Base.  Two large helicopters then appeared and circled the same area for a few minutes, and then also made their way back to Holloman as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then proceeded home.  Maybe 30-45 minutes after being home, I heard a large turbine engine.  I thought it was another helicopter.  To be sure, I ran out to my back deck, where it was open, and to my surprise a B2 bomber came directly over me, very low, maybe 2000 feet AGL at approximately 500 knots heading towards Roswell, NM.  Its force shook my house and alarmed many people in my neighborhood.  It was definitely a B2 it was enormous.  I am also a pilot and know the difference between these aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day before this sighting a friend explained his father was in Alamogordo, NM, (White Sands Missle Range) and experienced a shock wave of energy as he was walking into the Home Depot.  It alarmed others.  The phones, internet, land lines and credit card machines all went dead the day of this event for most of the day.  There were jets flying all day long.

Daytime sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1:03 pm, Arizona time, witness strange shaped object consisting of three outer cylinders attached to a shorter center cylinder, approximately the size of a Hot Air Balloon, hovering over farm fields in Eloy, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bright yellow in appearance and I could see no form of propulsion (i.e. engines, propellers, etc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered for about 4 minutes, and then I noticed a jet and a couple airplanes coming from the direction of Pinal Air Park (Air National Guard base) and the object then left, going away from me, fairly quickly.  By the time the jet and planes arrived, it was long gone.<n>

Continued watching it, and it started accelerating pretty fast, then did several circular passes and changed to a nearby location to do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its speed seems to slow down when it flies in a circle, but speed up when it changes location.  It was hard to tell if it was a drone, it appeared to be very high up in or above the thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still out there when I came inside to report this.<n>

Not solid-- did not block stars behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 5 am this morning (12/10/14) while walking my dog in my apartment complex, I noticed a bright light passing across the sky.  Thinking it was an aircraft, I was curious that there were no red/green lights visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that I was looking at a helicopter.  However, there was no noise. I then noticed two smaller lights following in formation behind the bright light. Again, no red/green lights or noise.  Drones?  Possibly but the lights were in a tight unmoving  triangular formation.  Even though whatever it was appeared to be three separate lights, I got the impression that I was looking at ONE object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While staring up at the sky, a car pulled around the corner and I started over to ask them to take a look, but didn’t want to lose sight of whatever it was above me.  It was flying high, but not as high as an airplane.  More like the height a helicopter would fly at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, clouds rolled in and over the moon and lights.  When the clouds passed over, and the sky was clear again, the object was gone.  There were no stars in the sky that resembled what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not frightened; yet neither did I experience emotions of any kind, which is unusual for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog did not respond to anything, so just not sure what it was I saw.  Very weird.  Very weird.<n>

She said the whole yard was lit up and could not figure out why.  She got her gun and went outside.  She said she saw a large object in the sky with lights going around it vertically.  She said she watched it disappear in the sky. My mother is 79 and although my brother and others make fun of her, I believe she was telling the truth. I have never known my mother to lie and I know that sounds untrue, the woman is a saint! My question is what was it looking for and will it return?  In this area she lives in, my cell phone dies or lose a signal easily I have notices.  This is out in a rural area which would make sense as to why a ufo would want to go there and be undetected.<n>

I am able to see planes fly by quite frequently, so I am very familiar with what planes appear to be in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, what I saw can be described as the following:  A vibrant, bright blue-ish purple fireball with a very clear blue aura, almost 4 or 5 times the size of what the planes usually appear as in the night sky, which made me feel it was extremely near by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, the colors and abnormal appearance of this object is what caught my attention and got me off of my bed to take a closer look, but the thing that made me rush for my phone to take a video was when it had stopped in the sky and started to move backwards, or in the opposite direction it was originally moving in I should say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to stop and hover, then move up and down in such smooth, swift, and effortless transitions.  It was clear that this object was capable of moving at speeds much faster than any aircraft known to this planet just by the range it covered every second it was in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3 minutes, I lost view of it after it passed behind a tree so I rushed downstairs and out the front door to see if it were still there to get a closer look but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i noticed the usual planes in the sky which gave me even more reassurance that this flying object was, without any hesitation, my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a 2 min 42 second video of my sighting.<n>

Tonight I notice a line of very bright lights along what is a roadway on the east side of Maury.  I thought they were unusually bright so I grabbed my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at them I couldn&#39;t figure out how they could have become so much brighter than ever before.  I then noticed above them in the sky hovering what might have been only a couple hundred feet was a configuration of 6 dimly lit orbs in a diamond configuration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my binoculars started to fog up and in the time that I took them away to wipe them clean and looked back everything was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The familiar dimly lit roadway lights were again visible and the diamond shape configuration of 6 orbs was gone too.<n>

My next assumption was that it was meteor falling from the sky.  However when it didn&#39;t dissipate, as most meteorites do, I realized I must be looking at something very special.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked closer I noticed that it was an almost semi-opaque but well defined circle... or orb as you people call them.  As I looked, the object very clearly changed color to a pinkish color for a few seconds and then changed back to orange.  It did this a few times as it flew north but because it was moving at such a high rate of speed, I only saw it change color 4 or 5 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling south to north, paralleling I-25 on its west side, appearing to head to Wyoming.  I watched it almost disappear into the northern horizon, to the point where you could barely see it.  It looked like a faint star very low on the horizon, maybe 5 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was having a hard time seeing it at this point, so I pulled over and on the frontage road and watched it on the horizon.  It didn&#39;t move for a long time and just looked like a faint orange star.  It stayed there for maybe 8 or 9 minutes, at which point it went straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this and have never believed in this sort of thing until now.<n> <n><n> I have been unable to sleep tonight because of it and decided I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and given how low it was initially and how fast it was going I would have assumed you would have heard a sonic boom or something.  I have never seen anything move that fast!<n>

The lights were red and white.  The white light was stationary where the red light was blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting closer to the object, we could all instantly tell it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was hovering, closer to the ground than a plane would be, not moving just appeared to be floating in the air.  Not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still dark so we were unable to tell the color but could make out its triangular shape as we were passing it. We continued to watch it hover until we were no longer able to see it. We were perplexed and and haven&#39;t a clue of what it was that could be at its size and hovering the way it was.  If it wasn&#39;t for the hovering we would have never thought anything of it. It was to large to be a drone.The exact size I can&#39;t say,but was larger than a single engine plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, my phone is out of mins it is a prepaid phone.

It was around 230 am EST, I walked to and opened my sliding glass doors on the bottom floor of our house, facing the South West direction.  This is where I smoke, since my wife is pregnant, and I don’t want a smoke filled house.  It is also very common for me to wake and smoke throughout the night.  I proceeded to light my cigarette and was on my smart phone, when I looked up and saw it.  I have a short backyard, about 15 ft, and then it slopes upward at a 45 degree angle for approximately 40 ft, to a road with a newly built vacant house on the other side of the road.  This house always has the outside light on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the top of the hill (in front of the road and vacant house), there was a black box looking mass approximately 8ft long and 6ft tall.  Next to this there was the being, which looked like a classic grey, 4-5ft tall, but long skinny arms.  The being had one arm on the mass as if to be leaning or bracing itself on it.  The being was clear to see due to the light of the vacant house shining behind it (Directly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for only 2-3 seconds, as my mind processed what I was looking at, and then my animalistic fear rushed over me like I have never felt before.  I had the immediate feeling the being wanted me to see it, since it was standing directly in front of the vacant house light for me to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when fear and panic shot through my body it quickly darted either into, or behind the black mass (as if it could sense my fear of it).  It moved quit strangely, almost like a sliding mechanical way, smooth, quick, graceful and without a sound.  I have never seen anything living move like this before, which elevated my fear more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there looking for approximately for another 8-10 seconds and then yelled, “You’re freaking me out”.  I closed and locked the door, turned off the TV and lights, and ran upstairs, jumping into bed with my wife, where I laid awake waiting for sunrise so I could go check out the premises of the sighting.<n>

Happen to notice a amber gold light that was heading south towards Lakewood.  The light was right over my house here in town, and flew overhead above me.  This was not a commercial type plane or such.  As I watched the light/object continue on a southern heading, it began to take on another color.  It changed into a solid &#34;Red Ball!&#34;, about the size of  dime in distance!  The light now was a round ball of solid red light.  Not only did it change color, it was moving slower and began pulsating on and off!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember back in 2000 when my parents and I went down to visit the then first of it&#39;s kind here CO, The UFO Watchtower in the Valley!  That was the first time my father and I had seen such light of this nature!  It was just like the one we had seen down in Hooper in 2000.This &#34;Red Ball&#34; of light is always haunting to see! I always see this type of UFO here in CO.  Whatever it is,it is not ours.  And it is intelligent.  Tonight was not the first time I have seen the &#34;Red Ball&#34; of light.  During the earlier part of this year in Feb,I had witnessed several &#34;Red Balls&#34; of light.  In Feb., the lights were in a Triangle formation here in Arvada.  Heading West toward Golden.  I had made my report and contacted this site about it.I am just amazed how I can be in the right place at the right time to catch a good view of these lights.  Lucky I am.  I also have been reading Messages by Stan Romanek!  And he too, has seen lights just like the ones I see.  I guess this makes me wonder, what the heck are these lights doing?  And why here in CO period!!  Not sure!  But can say this,whatever they are,they move like nothing we have!  And disappear just as they appear as fast as they do!  I know I will keep looking up and keep on reporting to better help all other investigators in getting to the bottom of what these lights are.<n>

In a line formation like this . . . they were white with a red tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us were in a gun truck.  One guy up on the gun, one passenger and I was in the drivers seat.  I tried getting a picture but it just wouldn&#39;t take very good.  Unlike my two buddy&#39;s used NVG&#39;s (night vision goggles) just a regular picture did no justice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got out to get a better view for a picture and no more than 20 seconds they all vanished.  They never moved not once.  Aircraft flew right through our line of sight and they were just there.  East of our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While west of us a artillery company was training as well and shot up multiple flares, we used to compare like most military explanations!  &#34;These were not flares&#34;!  And the best part is south of our guard station is our CP where our CO &amp; 1st sgt witnessed them as well.  From a slightly different angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Word got out and my CO asked for me to come by asking me what I saw, so I told him and that&#39;s when he said they say the same lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where we were, there is a lot of missile testing.  I believe our presence and the artillery going off drew these ufos attention.<n>

Oh well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I saw this Sunday night, I decided to go out the following night Monday, Dec. 8, 2014.  I propped up the tripod, opened the lens cover, then unfolded the view screen on the video recorder &amp; already had the settings at the extra zoom.  The second I finished this, I looked straight up &amp; there was a bright, white round object headed in the direction of Mission Viejo. (it could have turned after it was out of my view though)  As soon as I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane or helicopter, I immediately started capturing the object.  It was tough keeping the recorder still. Probably because it was moving so quickly.  For a moment as it passed by a star, I stopped to view that star (duh) then corrected by returning to the UFO &amp; before it was out of view I held my breath &amp; zoomed in to the maximum level &amp; captured some amazing detail.  I&#39;m guessing this could be the very first video capture of these bright round objects, showing the propulsion it uses, I haven&#39;t seen one photo or video on all of the internet of this same detail.  Also, I have several daytime captures showing what I believe is a match to what this thing looked like up close.  If anyone else saw this please post up a video!  When I zoomed out a little, it looked a bit purple-ish &amp; brilliant white when I zoomed a bit closer.  The interesting part isn&#39;t even the bright round object itself since there are a gazillion all over the internet on video, but rather what I captured in the zoom.  It was flying low enough to see it was NOT a plane or helicopter.  The close zoom also confirms it&#39;s not a plane or heli. either.  It&#39;s  pretty amazing.  Seems we&#39;re getting a wave of these objects all over California right now.  I just got really lucky where I had my finger right next to the record button the second I saw it.  I could kick myself for not starting the capture right away but I only lost a few seconds.  I&#39;d sure have loved to get that super-zoom when it was right over my head.  Sure would have been nice if it was moving slower to pose for my video (lol)   It&#39;s possible when they are moving slowly, they aren&#39;t transparent or can decide when they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was dark and we had just started walking into my neighborhood from the desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed an odd sound coming from a long wall that encloses houses, separating them from the desert.  At first I thought there was something in the bushes.  It was an electrical sound, kind of like bees buzzing; or water running, or, a rattle-snake sound.  It was a distinct, loud buzzing vibration that I couldn&#39;t figure out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I commented on it to my boyfriend walking behind me.  He pointed out a craft with red and white lights in a southwest position in the sky, but I kept focusing on the sound below.  The more I followed the sound vibrating in the bushes along the wall, it seemed to keep moving with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I realized it was coming from the space craft above us, and the sound from it was vibrating below. I had originally figured this aircraft was an airplane of some kind but upon closer observation, I realized that it was unusual how it w! as hovering in the same spot for several minutes and not moving.  It was an oval shape, and the lights and sound were the most distinctive features.  I kept watching it for a long time and then it suddenly turned off its lights and headed in a bee-line toward the mountains, which was in a western direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to hear the unusual vibration while it became softer, and observed a dim light and shaped of the craft as it disappeared over the San Gabriel Mountains.  It moved rather fast too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later speculated that it was definitely a UFO and neither one of us had ever seen anything like it before, and we are elderly.  It also seemed to me that it may have been using some kind of ultra-sound to take pictures of the terrain below, or was looking for something.  It even occurred to me that it was possibly a craft using vibration or super ultra-sound to levitate.  I had heard of experiments in this area a while back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were both amazed by this experience.  I felt unthreatened by it, at the time of the experience, and my dogs did not seem disturbed by it, but they did seem to notice the sound that we heard and were curious about it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later at home, I started feeling a little uneasy at the possibility of what it could have been.  I looked up some images of UFO sightings and there was one that correlated with what we saw; an oval-shaped craft with red and white lights.  The entire experience lasted for about 10 minutes.<n>

My daughter was also standing on the porch with me, and we had watched several planes in the few minutes we were outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called her attention to the light being a single clear light with none of the normal aircraft lights.  The light then turned from its seeming northward trajectory and began moving quickly away to the east.  It only remained visible for another 3-4 seconds however before being gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other planes clearly visible in the same area including one that came from the exact easterly direction immediately after the light had gone, however that plane suddenly turned back and went back to the east again, a highly unusual thing for aircraft that we normally witness in the skies above NE Tn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to just know if you have any information from that night of the military chasing an object in this area please, as I have been perplexed since that night.

A few minutes later (I am now at a different location since I was walking the dog) I looked back to see the object in the air again.  Same green lights flashing and a steady red light.  I took a quick (read bad) video of it with my cell phone.

The sky was very dark and clear, and the stars were easily visible.  I was debating what route I wanted to take through Morrisville, when a moving object in the sky caught my eye.  I was on the phone as I was observing this object and informed the person I was speaking with that I was looking at something moving in the sky that was either a plane falling or a very large, abnormally slow moving meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw this object for approximately 3 seconds, as it was moving at a consistent pace and lost sight of it as it moved behind the tree line.  I attempted to find it again by continuing on the road that I hoped would give me a clear view of the object, but it was nowhere to be seen, in the sky or on the ground.  It was close enough to me that if it had been a plane crash, I would have felt the reverberations from its impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport in Morrisville; however I observed this object a few miles to the east of the airport.  Also, had this been a plane on its way to the airport, it would have flown over my vehicle.  I did not hear any sounds that would have been associated with the object.  The lights on the object were yellow/orange-ish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way in which the lights were traveling together and the number of observable lights are what caused me to initially think that it was a plane.  However, the lights on the object were all the same color which is why I also considered the possibility of it being a large, slow moving meteor instead of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My main issue with this explanation is that the object as a whole was not illuminated, distinct smaller lights could be seen along the object.  I am unable to accurately identify this object based on what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I do not believe that my hypotheses of either a plane or a meteor, the only two possible explanations I could come up with, provide a sufficient description to provide a satisfactory explanation for the event that occurred.<n>

Looking out towards the East (Towards Ottawa), I noticed a bright orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn&#39;t think much of it, because a plane was also flying very close by this light as well.  As we continued our drive along the highway, I kept watching this object, and soon relized it wasn&#39;t moving. It stayed perfectly still in that same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes had passed, it suddenly changed colour to an extremely bright white light, which seemed to grow even more intense as the seconds past.  Then, as if it had never even been there, it was gone.  Didn&#39;t move in any direction, just vanished.  It&#39;s hard to say exactly how far out towards the East it was, but my best guess would be over the country farm areas between Carleton Place &amp; Ottawa.  So perhaps roughly 10 minutes or so outside of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should also be noted, that roughly this far outside of town, in the South-East direction, is a military base that &#34;no one is suppose to know about&#34;, but everyone does.  Could it have been something from there?  Possibly.  Do I think that&#39;s what it was?  Absolutely not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years, I have seen many bright objects such as this, over roughly the same area. But it has always been late at night, on my way home from Ottawa.  And they almost always, disappear as if they weren&#39;t there.<n>

It was about an hour ago and obviously 20:07 hasn&#39;t happened yet :).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with little clouds at the time of sighting.  We were playing in backyard, watching humming birds when we saw this object.  First I thought it was a helium balloon because it was about the same size, but its speed, height and direction didn&#39;t gel with any free flying balloon.  It was flying towards Thousand Oaks which is west of Simi Valley and I am sure others might have seen it if someone was driving in the car or outside looking towards sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was first to notice, then my mom, and then me.  My mother said, she observed something like fans on either side of round object, but when I looked up it was a bit far and didn&#39;t notice anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps.

Anyway to the north there are mountains and hills, and on the hills are relay stations for t.v. etc..  One of the stations has a large antenna with a red pulsing light on its tip. while looking at the antenna light, i noticed another reddish light, out the corner of my eye to the right of where the antenna is,  It more or less dropped straight down from the sky, then in a long arcing line was heading in my direction, with a large orange slow pulsing light and a red hue around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well i knew right then that this was very strange, dropped my cig and ran in the trailer to grab my new ipad for a picture.  Came outside and now this object was getting very close, so I starting firing off pictures.  Now this thing is almost over head and begins to slow way down and slowly turn to the west or left, and also at the point it slowed down the light stopped pulsing and staye! d on constantly.  Not being familiar with how the ipad camera works, i was fumbling about with it, and at the same time trying to keep my eyes on the object, that was more or less right above me now.  As it was in its turn the light, (without any other explanation for it) looked like an eye rolling back in its head and was gone!<n>

Object had no change in appearance, had no trail, no flashing, blinking, or strobe-like effects associated with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object moved in straight path for 5-8 seconds in a N bound direction, then began to curve slowly and smoothly to the west, to the east, and began heading west again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were several blinking aircraft visible to show reference to what a jet/plane behavior would look like, but it held no similarities in shape, color, speed or movement.  As the object moved closer to 80 degrees above me, it banked more towards the west and seemed to increase in luminosity and size slightly.  As the object moved into the western portion of the sky, again about 65-70 degrees above me now, a recognizable aircraft (jet/plane) came into view directly above me moving in a WWN direction.  It seemed as if the red flashing plane was nearly on an intercept course as they moved closer and closer together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane/jet did have a slightly visible chem-trail, and as the object seemed right about to intersect with the plane/jet, the jet turned almost directly W, avoiding the entities intersecting.  The object then curved slowly and steadily toward a NNW path, and suddenly vanished about 8-10 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a most likely unrelated note, the very instant the object vanished, coyotes all round me began to howl for about 30 seconds.  This is common in my region at night, and was probably attributable to the sudden visibility of the moon (red on the horizon) peeking over the edge of the lights of Hooker.<n>

Now, where I live there is light pollution so you can&#39;t see shooting stars and anything like that.  All of a sudden this bolt of i don&#39;t even know, what looked liked a shooting star hit the craft.  We pull into a church parking lot, the craft is literally so low, we could see it, it was still just like we were, had a greenish almost blue glow.  We start driving again, the craft does this weird turn but ever so smoothly and heads the direction we are in.  My friend screams out the car windown nothing happened, we turn down this dirt road and all of a sudden boom it&#39;s gone..  But the most scariest interesting part of this whole entire thing, earlier that night at my friends house this sound I could not explained occurred, and lights flickered, and all of a sudden her basement door was open.  Them animals in the house became terrified.  I felt this weird feeling in my body, I wasn&#39;t afraid I was expecting them, but something was in her house.  We called the police thinking maybe were crazy and someone waist had broken in, the police found no evidence, all if the cabinets were open, all of her art supplies were open in the cabinets, the bar downstairs fridge open.  Then the sound stopped right when the police came.  Twenty minutes after they left we got in the car, drove around..  And saw what we had seen…<n>

I had never been to this area before, so I was really paying attention to my surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed down a street the mountain was directly in front of me, and there was nothing but open sky on either side.  I saw just above the mountain a really really bright white light with a blue tinge to it.  It looked like a row of marquis shaped lights like 5-6 in a row.  The object seemed circular almost like a ring, that is what it reminded me of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought maybe it&#39;s a helicopter or possibly a plane, but as I thought about it I knew it couldn&#39;t  be.  It wasn&#39;t moving at all, not to the sides or away from me or even towards me. It was too low to be a plane.  There were no blinking lights or any other colored lights at all.  It was so bright, it light up everything, it reminded me a lot of the moon and how it lights up the whole night.  The object had the same effect.   I didn&#39;t hear any noise but I was driving (without the raido on) so there could have been, but I didn&#39;t hear anything at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away for a moment as I was trying to find the street I needed. I looked back up and it was still there.  I drove further down and slowed to look at the next street.

Driving up into Diamond Valley, AZ, facing hills in background.  Bluish/white, bright, round ball of light appeared x 2 seconds and slight arch as it fell toward the earth; then below it/projected from it, appeared an arrow shaped bluish-white light (like ball) which pointed toward/fell straight toward Earth (an elongated outline of exit sign is the closest to arrow I can describe in shape); then arrow gone in a second too (the ball disappeared after arrow appeared below it, then arrow disappeared).  It is very cloud covered (happened about an hour ago) so it is possible I did not see the fall of this light all the way from high in the sky; it seemed to appear suddenly not far above the hills just above the clouds, fall out of the clouds, produce the arrow, then ball/arrow disappeared before they contacted earth (I think).  Also, when I got out of car to look more at sky (did not see anymore lights); cloud covering over sky formed a huge perfectly round circle around the moon/the moon&#39;s light (the clouds were absent in this area...a natural event, but wanted to be thorough in everything I reported).  I have lived in AZ a long time, have seen lots of lights, all have had reasonable explanations.  However, I have NEVER seen anything like this.  I have considered that the &#34;arrow&#34; could have been some kind of reflection off the clouds from the original ball of light (I am a skeptic in all things and must have evidence), but the ball of light and arrow emerged from the clouds.  The entire thing lasted 3-4 seconds max.  Very odd.<n>

We were headed north on 71st street when we came to the red light on Greenfield Avenue.  I was looking straight ahead when I saw a teal-ish point of light zoom out from above the roof and tree tops heading west towards the lake.  I jokingly said, &#34;UFO!&#34;  It was moving really freely and fast, like a fast-paced teal satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way it moved stood out to me, but I still thought nothing strange of it.  Suddenly, it made a really sharp, tight U-turn without changing speed or anything and without any effort and went back the way it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my fiancée, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  He saw it too.  He said that maybe it was a remote controlled airplane?  We wanted to follow it but we were still stopped at the light.  Since the light we were at was a long one and no traffic was coming, we contemplated going through the light to see where this teal light went but didn&#39;t since there was a cop parked down the block.  A few seconds before the light changed green, the teal light came back.  I was only to keep track of it for a few seconds more until it got lost behind the houses and tress moving past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, but I&#39;ve never seen any aircraft with that color light before nor have I ever seen anything make such dramatic turns with no effort at all.<n>

I have always considered you to be an authentic, credible UFO investigator.  In addition to the cases presented in your reports, I have studied several hundred similar cases and I am, therefore, more than a little familiar with the UFO phenomenon.  However, only beginning this week can I say that I know with 100% certainty that highly advanced beings, piloting incredible and terrifying UFOs, are conducting some kind of research in Vermont.  Based on everything I have learned from you, I am also convinced that these beings number in the thousands or tens of thousands globally and that their research is being conducted all over the world on a massive scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now about myself.  I am in my mid-thirties and live with my wife in Franklin County, Vermont, on a hill overlooking a small valley of trees and cow pastures, which rests between the towns of Milton, Saint Albans, and Cambridge.  I am a well educated, rational ((deleted--scientific)) laboratory technician.  My mother, who lives in a neighboring county, is a PhD research scientist, whom I would consider to be extremely rational and never prone to hysteria or exaggeration.  My wife is also well educated, and very practical - even stubbornly skeptical - about strange phenomenon and other events which have no bearing on her life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years ago, my mother was walking with a friend, who is a radar operator for the Air National Guard.  The path they were walking is very near the downtown area in our largest city, about 25 miles south from my house.  She tells me the sky that evening was dark, except for the many stars which were at that moment unobscured by clouds.  She felt something odd and was compelled to look directly overhead.  She and her friend then saw a very large, black, triangular craft with faint orangish lights, one at each corner of the craft.  She said that the craft was so dark and so quiet as to seem as if it was absorbing light and sound.  They watched as the craft moved slowly from north to south and finally disappeared from view after a few minutes.  Apparently, my mother&#39;s friend was at least somewhat familiar with similar objects, but provided no information.  My mother told me about this experience immediately after it happened because our close relationship and mutual respect permit this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This week, I had my own amazing experience, and my wife shared it with me.  On the evening December 4th, 2014, at approximately 9 p.m., I was exercising in our basement and noticed a very bright light which I could see through our basement window.  I ran up our first flight of stairs, opened the front door and stood on the porch.  Before noticing any detail I felt an intense sense of dread.  I looked up toward the sky at a 45 degree angle, directly away from our house, toward Vermont&#39;s highest mountain peak.  In the near distance, perhaps a half mile from where I was standing, I saw an extremely bright object, pulsating red and blue lights, bouncing around slightly.  I stood for perhaps 30 seconds or a minute watching this object, feeling transfixed but also very fearful.  I recalled in that moment some of the stories of abductees who were paralyzed prior to their close encounters, and screamed at myself mentally to turn around and go back inside.  I walked quickly inside, locked the door, and ran up the next flight of stairs to our living room, where my wife was sitting and watching television.  I turned off all the lights and then the TV and told her, &#34;you need to see this.&#34;  I brought her to our picture window, oriented precisely eastward in the direction of the object, and asked, &#34;WHAT IS THAT?&#34;  She leaned toward the window, squinted her eyes and her mouth dropped open.  At the same moment I noticed another similar bright object to the north, but this object became a secondary consideration to us because it was partially obscured by tree branches near our window and appeared to be farther away and at a higher altitude.  I asked her to stand there and continue to watch the object for unusual flight patterns if it began to change position.  As she did this, I ran to my office to retrieve my Celestron Model #21035 travel telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned, I noticed a light on the ground directly below the UFO, in a location that I know to be a patch of cow pasture void of any structures.  I quickly found the UFO in my telescope lens.  What I saw shocked me down to my core.  The object was disc-shaped, bright, colorful, pulsating and bouncing.  The pulsating red and blue lights appeared to come from within the craft, passing out through its walls.  I then found the light on the ground below the craft and saw that it was cylindrical, orangish-yellow and was illuminating a white angular object which sat closer to my house on the grass.  After two or three minutes, I decided that I would not see enough detail in the light and turned the telescope back toward the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my wife again examined the craft, she asked, &#34;What is that other thing...in the air, closer to us, in the bottom right corner of the view?&#34;  I looked and saw the corner of another, mostly black and camouflaged object, perhaps two or three hundred yards closer to us.  I watched this object for ten minutes or longer and noticed that it was slowly rocking around and up and down.  On several occasions, I could clearly see that the bright, pulsating disc was casting enough light on the angular craft to illuminate two corners of what appeared to be a triangular black craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife paced around the house, communicating irritation with me for looking at these objects with such interest at first, but eventually, after at least a full hour, parked herself on a chair near me saying, &#34;I feel weird...I&#39;m scared...I don&#39;t like this.&#34;  At some point, I noticed that the light on the ground had vanished.  Then, I noticed that the pulsating disc was calmer - more stationary and less bright.  The red light, especially, was mostly or entirely gone and the craft appeared to settle into a lower-energy state.  The triangular craft remained in the same position for another thirty minutes.  Immediately prior to going to bed, I saw that the disc and triangle had both changed positions.  The disc was now higher, perhaps directly above the triangle, which was now oriented with a single corner pointing downward.  Suddenly, I saw the full form of the triangle, which was hovering with its underside pointing directly at my window.  I saw one faint, circular orange light at each of three corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I bumped into a resident who lives on the road directly opposite my house from the previous evening&#39;s activity.  This individual informed me that she had seen an object that matched my description of the bright object at 9 p.m. on December 3rd and 4th.  I knew this meant that the object might return soon, and watched from my window throughout the night of December 5th.  Two bright, pulsating objects appeared shortly before midnight, at least one half mile farther from my house than they had been the previous night.  I watched for over an hour as they appeared to follow a grid pattern slightly above the tree tops near a river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quick scan of the internet reveals that Vermont is currently a hotspot for these phenomena.  Many people have reported similar objects in my area; MANY more have likely seen them and remained silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached a sketch of the two objects from the night of December 4th.  I would be willing to speak with you by phone, but I must be careful not to allow my name to be associated with my report as it is presented to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for all of your amazing work Peter!<n>

We were walking around the park and heard something that sounded like a mixture between a jet engine and a helicopter.  We all looked up and saw a fairly large, slow moving craft flying pretty low.  We can only describe the craft as a black object with the shape of a sine curve, or something like a pringle chip with upward arches as the wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the craft blended in with the sky, we could clearly see its shape due to a smooth, bright green, neon light tracing the edges in that exact shape.  The final detail was a large, orange, slow blinking light on the back of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were near my house and I was headed home a few minutes after the sighting and I told my mom about it because it had been heading in the direction of our neighbourhood.  She said that a few minutes before I had arrived she heard the exact same sound and that the noise had shaken the whole house.  She described the sound as a plane about to land right above our roof.

It seemed to be less than 1 or 2 miles away and fairly low to the ground considering it shook our house.  Again I believe the craft was black because it blended in to the background but the green and orange lights were what we could see perfectly.  Not sure if it is some sort of military aircraft or anything but I couldn&#39;t find any sort of craft with that shape.<n> <n><n> Thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> #3<n> <n><n> Great!

It had lights that were blinking, like plane lights and it could not be a plane, even though I live near an airport.  If it was, I would have been able to hear a loud thundering noise flying over my house.  It was at least 2 yards high above the roof of a house.  It flew past 2 houses near mine and then swerved to front part of my house.  I went to see it from my foyer window.  It was small from a far distance.  It flew across the window view and headed for the woods clearing nearby.  After that, I couldn&#39;t see where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin who was driving in the neighborhood on the way to my house and hour and a half earlier said that she saw it come from the neighborhood across the street and come to my neighborhood.

Three different times over about 20-30 miles and 10 minutes as we drove<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling on US 50, between Rocky Ford, Colorado, and La Junta, Colorado.  A low flying light began to appear and get brighter and brighter, then another light about a hand length apart from the first light appeared in the same manner, and another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light then went out and another appeared.  There were a total of 4-5 lights that were not all on at the same time.  They lit up one after the other.  They were yellowish white and smaller than a full moon, but at max intensity were brighter than a train light.  They appeared for about 6-8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No pattern, and low, because I could see them through the windshield of the car.  My wife had seen the same lights about 5 minutes prior close to Rocky Ford.  She said that they had came on and disappeared so quickly that she had not mentioned them because she thought she was seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized that they were traveling east and I asked my wife and daughter to continue to look as we drove east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, we turned to go to North La Junta and I had them continue to look east.  About 5 minutes had passed and we arrived at our destination.  We were in a prairie area with a huge view of the sky.  I told them that if there are mysterious lights we will see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we began to walk into our destination they appeared again low in the east, smaller and farther away.  One light came on at a time and 5-7 lights came on and disappeared closer together than before.  (They probably appeared closer together because they were farther away.)  They seemed to be traveling about the speed of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the family that if they were helicopters they were communicating with each other and to turn on lights one after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, they were traveling away from us, yet the lights seemed to be facing us and could get very bright.  We did not hear any sound at any time.<n>

I saw a strange grouping of three soft white lights moving at a VERY high speed flying east straight overhead over the campus.  The strangest thing was that I hadn&#39;t heard any roar of engines or a sonic boom from the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called an associate, who I knew was out walking nearby, to ask if he&#39;d heard or seen anything, and he denied that he had.  It didn&#39;t look like any of our planes, and I called the flight supervisor ~21:06 to ask about any planes on the radar, and he said they hadn&#39;t tracked anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The grouping of the lights suggested either a chevron shape, or a formation that was very precisely close at such a high speed.  I will assume it was rather close to the ground, as I only saw it for a few seconds before it was gone over the dorms, and the lights were roughly the size of a child&#39;s size fast food drink lid held at arm&#39;s length, to my perception. (That&#39;s all I have nearby to compare it to, don&#39;t judge.)  I couldn&#39;t see any outline past the lights, only the haze of the low clouds fuzzing out the lights a good deal.  They moved uniformly for as long as I saw them, giving me the impression it was a single craft.  As this is an aeronautical school, there were at least several student pilots within a few miles, but the flight supervisor said no-one else had reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a healthy 22-year old male, with no alcohol in my system. and no history of seeing UFOs nor hallucinating.<n>
