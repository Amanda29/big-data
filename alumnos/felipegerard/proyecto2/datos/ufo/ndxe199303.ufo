3/31/93 00:00|Norfolk (UK/England)||Triangle|minutes|3-31-1993 at approximately midnight:  Large, silent , motionless black triangle just above low cloud.|9/9/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101838.html|1|ndxe199303| 3-31-1993 at approximately midnight:  Large, silent , motionless black triangle just above low cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years ago I saw an inexplicable sight whilst walking home late one night on the western outskirts of Norwich, Norfolk, England.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Taking a shortcut through a deserted industrial estate (via Morgan Way, to cross Francis Way in order to reach Richmond Road where I lived.) something made me look up, I had not been aware of any sound or movement to attract my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a windy night with low cloud that revealed night sky only patchily.  The visible stars were quite bright and the wind somewhere between north and North West.  This particular area was often frequented by the Fokker Friendships of Air UK on final approach for Norwich Airport, so, I was fully aware of what such air traffic looked and sounded like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw on this occasion was quite startling; a huge black triangular shape that hung motionless and silent above me.  I could not determine the actual extent of the shape as the rear end was obscured by the clouds, but it appeared to be at about the level that I judged the cloud tops to be, probably not much above 200-300 feet/<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its shape was clearly defined because it obscured the stars within its outline<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I recall endeavouring to make an estimate of its size but due to the obfuscation of the cloud I never saw its full extent; but my judgement of what I could see made me decide that the whole thing would have been bigger than a football pitch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound, that I recall, but this may have been due to the wind which was quite strong and caused a slight roar in my ears anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and watched the shape for some time but it showed no sign of movement and there were, certainly, no lights showing anywhere on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought at the time surmised that this had to be some new secret device that someone was trying out. I had the uncomfortable feeling that I was being watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What brought it back to mind was the discovery, in an item on SETI and UFOs, on a DVD of the remake of ‘The day the Earth stood still.’ that such a sight had been seen in other areas of the UK, although others reported lights on and from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time I had ever heard of these sightings. (I have no TV which might explain my missing news of such events.) I searched on the internet and very quickly discovered the details including the information that this had been named the ‘Cosford Incident’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with the friends, that I had been visiting that evening, and they recalled that I had told them of my sighting but could not recall the date, which I knew had to be before March 1994 because that was when I had moved away from the Costessey area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having noted the date of the Cosford Incident (31 March 1993) I endeavoured to make enquiries to see if I can get a weather report for that area on the night in question to see if it matches my experience in order to determine if I saw it on the same night.                                                                                                                 I also attempted to discover what TV shows had been broadcast that same evening to determine if they were items seen at my friend’s home before my sighting. I had no success in these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to report my experience to BM BUFORA in London having found their site on line but my letter was returned due to it no longer existing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, having discovered your address on the web, I thought it may be of interest to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another little known incident, that occurred during WW2, was reported by an ex ATS radar operator to a writer which he used as a basis for a new book ‘The F&amp;#369;hrer’s folly’. The sighting and resulting examination of the girl are accurately used in the, otherwise fictional, story.

I did attempt to send a sketch of the view I saw but it did not transfer..<n>

It had one bright light. As it neared, a fireball came out of it and the fireball descended to very close distance in front of us and hovered close to our faces. It interacted with us for several minutes, apparantly able to scan our brains. It then instantly returned to the craft of origin. My friend was extremely tramatized by this, as I must say I was profoundly affected also. I have never reported this before, but would like to know if other reports are avalilble regarding the intelligence obviously present with this fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was and still am a school library clerk. I was traveling home to Lubbock, TX. I was traveling much later than I planned to be, because of car trouble near Oklahoma City. I have seen &#34;lights&#34; that I have wondered about and some strange things before and since this, but have never been sure enough to state that I thought I&#39;d seen a UFO. Of the following I AM SURE: During March of 1993 I was traveling south on I40 at approximately 2:00 A.M.. I was about 5-10 minutes out of Amarillo, TX. To the left of the highway, I observed &#34;dancing,&#34; round, blue lights. They seemed to fill the skyline to my left. My best guess is that they were about half a mile away. There was nothing to compare the size with though, so I really have no way of knowing how far away or what size they were. Looking back, I really don&#39;t know why I was not alarmed by this. I was simply incredulous! It was such a beautiful and graceful display! They were too perfect and perhaps coordinated to seem anything but choreographed. I did not hear a thing. It never occurred to me to stop. I just kept on driving and eventually they were &#34;just gone.&#34; To this day, no one has taken me seriously. I know what I saw though. I have never found an explanation. I&#39;ve also never heard anything of this description. Please believe me and perhaps tell me that I&#39;m not the only one that has seen this. Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1993 is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were at lease fifteen miles (as the crow flies) from the landing site. When each one of the disks entered the opening , one after the other, then the earth closed. I was the only one who remembered the sighting, as the others only noticed that a few minutes had elapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pass through Pojoaque daily and I have tried to find the exact landing site, but it is on a Native American (Indian) reservation land. A particular section of the reservation that non-Indians are not allowed to visit or enter.<n>

3/15/93 20:30|Lee's Summit (suburb of K.C.)|MO|Light|four minutes|Multiple LITS abserved for 4-5 minutes dropping below horizon then returning 15-20 degrees from orignal location.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18040.html|6|ndxe199303| ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date so that the report sorts to the year 1993.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple LITS abserved for 4-5 minutes dropping below horizon then returning 15-20 degrees from orignal location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in early spring of 1992 or 1993.  I noticed what I believed to be &#34;flashlights&#34; in a field directly south of the house I was in.  Activity after dark was not common this time of the year so I went outside to check it out. I quickly realized the lights were not flash lights at all.  The Lights appeared to be multy colored orbs or balls of light that changed color rapidly.  I would say the flashing or color changning was similar to when one is star gazing and the stars seem to flicker in wavelength.  They were brighter and more clear than any light I have seen at that distance. The LITS were SE of my location and moved to the E before the event was over.  The is a local airport approx. 1 mile S of the house.  I tried to rationalize what I was seeing as Chopper&#39;s from the airport, but the LITS ducked below and then would reappear randomly and differnt locations.  The wind was not notably strong, but even on windy night I can hear all manner of traffic at the airport.  That night I heard nothing.  The Lights, there had to have at least seven, were continually dropping below the horizon then returning to maybe 10 degrees above the horizon.  The were not connected to each other in any way i.e. moved seprately.  They were moving to quickly verticly and horizontally to be winged aircraft and sometimes would hover in one position.  I observed the craft for 2-3 minutes when I decided to find a witness.  I literally dragged my younger brother out into the back yard to watch.  He saw the same thing I did, but with fewer craft, maybe three.  One craft stayed in a hover the other went below the horizon for a final time.  The one that was hovering by itself flew almost exactly east to west flying directly over our heads.  It was had gained a lot of altitude in a short period and was probably @ or above 10,000 ft.  The lone LITS went from hovering above the eastern horizon to below the houses in about 10-15 seconds.<n>

AND &amp; tend to be long-winded, sooo....I think it was either late December, early January or March, in either 1992 or 1993. Sorry for being so vague; I know I was home on some kind of break from college.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ****SIDE-NOTE...a few months earlier while I was still at school a friend of mine from Round Rock called &amp; told me that she &amp; her fiancee (also a friend) had seen a UFO (in Round Rock). She said that when they went outside they immediately saw it because it was the brightest light in the sky; you couldn&#39;t miss it. She said they sat there &amp; watched it for over an hour.****  Anyway, so its a few months later &amp; I&#39;m home from school. My friends (the 2 I mentioned earlier) &amp; I had planned on meeting at his apartment in Round Rock &amp; going to dinner in Austin. Leaving my parents house I was driving North through their neighborhood &amp; turned East onto a main road, driving towards Round Rock. It was already dark outside, I&#39;m guessing about 6:30 or 7:00. As SOON as I made the turn East onto the main road &amp; looked up, I saw this bright, captivating light. It was in the Northeast. I had completely forgotten about the UFO my friend had told me about earlier. This light was so bright &amp; out of the ordinary, I watched it for the entire drive to my friends place. The drive took about 5 minutes &amp; the light didn&#39;t appear to be moving. It didn&#39;t even enter into my mind that this was anything other than a really odd light of some sort. But it was so interesting, I had planned on mentioning it to my friends. So I got to my friends place &amp; I hadn&#39;t seen them in a long time, so we got caught up in talking &amp; I completely forgot about this light. I&#39;m guessing its around 7:00 or so now. We went into Austin &amp; had dinner. We were driving back to Round Rock (north) on I-35 around 8:00 or 8:30 or so. I think we were somewhere between Pflugerville &amp; Round Rock &amp; my friend said &#34;Oh my god! There it is!&#34; &amp; told me that was the UFO they had seen a few months ago. It was the same light I had seen earlier that night &amp; I told them that I had been watching it on my way to his apartment. We watched the light as we continued to drive up I-35. We decided to go park on this small hill about half a mile or a mile East of his apartment &amp; watch the light. It was a quiet area w/no lights around. I dont think it was an overcast night, but I dont remember there being many stars in the sky either. So we back the car up the hill for a better view &amp; we&#39;re facing South now. I dont remember the light being any color, just a bright clear light. It was very dark &amp; the object wasn&#39;t close enough to make out a shape. It would blink occasionally in a seemingly random pattern. As soon as we got there &amp; were sitting still we could see that the light was moving. And MAN, was it MOVING!!! It was jumping all over the place. We couldn&#39;t actually see it moving, it must&#39;ve been moving too fast. One second it would be in one spot &amp; half a second later it would be to the left or to the right or up or down. It was absolutely not moving in any kind of set direction like an airplane, etc. It was bouncing all over the place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little while later another light showed up &amp; then a little while later a 3rd light showed up. They were all in the same general area &amp; were close to each other. They never seemed to get right next to each other though. It never looked like any of them were close enough to touch. When the 3 lights were there, they seemed to be more active than just the one when it was by itself. They were all blinking &amp; moving around &amp; seemed to be communicating in some way. They weren&#39;t constantly moving though. They would each stay still for a while &amp; then jump around and then stay still again. We sat there &amp; watched the light/lights for about 1 1/2 hours, until they left. About an hour into watching the lights, my friend &amp; I (not her fiancee) got the VERY distinct feeling that the UFOs knew we were watching them. We both felt like they were extremely upset at us; that we were seeing something that we weren&#39;t supposed to be seeing. Guessing I first saw the light around 6:30 or 7:00 and last saw it around 10:00 or 10:30. Between my drive to his place &amp; the 3 of us sitting in the car, I viewed it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Haven&#39;t seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Or at least the ones we know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lived very close to DFW airport, on the south side, near American Airlines headquarters.  Was walking the dog one evening and to entertain myself, watched the planes setting up to land, from southwest to northeast.  (This is DFW&#39;s flight pattern or the reverse, depending on the wind.)  It was just after dark.  I started watching a light coming in low from the northwest -- opposite the flight pattern.  That&#39;s what caught my attention.  I first thought it was high enough to still pick up the sun and make it reflects, but no, the sun was down.  It was a mild yellow color without any red/green blinking lights that are required as a warning to other planes.  The weather was cool and clear  with a just few high thin clouds.  I was standing on a hill with trees below my line of sight so there were no obstructions.  I heard no noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept coming in my direction in a straight line.  Suddenly, it almost made a 45 degree angle turn, shot up through those high thin clouds and was gone.  I could barely turn my head fast enough to watch it shoot up through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No aircraft I have ever seen (1) turned that sharp, and (2) moved that fast.

So I decided to look up a month I too saw something I could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 11, 1993, 2 friends and I were heading out for spring break, first to Austin, TX and then to South Padre Island. I looked at the reports for March 93 and found, &#34;I SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS&#34;. I can’t say it was the same object, however, I know it was the same stretch of highway and at about the same hour. Heading south from Fort Worth, TX, between Waco and Austin, we saw something in the sky that we cannot explain. I know, 13 years have pasted but this experience, I’ll never forget. We saw an object moving East to West at about 8:30 - 9:00 PM, a strange object with segment of lights blinking in a row. We first noticed it from a distance as it was moving from our left to right at a slow rate. Shortly after, we saw that other vehicles have pulled over on I-35 to watch this object in the sky. I-35 runs North and South, so the object appeared from the east and moved over I-35 to the West, it wasn’t moving very fast at all. Then from the South East, a huge bright light appeared, but that turned out to be a helicopter flying fast towards the direction of the object. When I look back to the object, it was nowhere in site. We know a helicopter in the sky, but we could never identify that object. This night has always been the strangest experience of my life.<n>

I looked up and saw what I thought at first were meteors  coming down but I quickly realized they were coming down too uniformly and not burning out (not leaving a trail).  At first I was seeing two &#39;burns&#39; then, looking for more, I looked ahead of the direction they were going and seen a third &#39;burn&#39;.  I didn&#39;t think of them as lights, they were more like a friction burn .  These three burns against the starry sky outlined a huge triangular object.  We were heading to work therefore didn&#39;t wait for it to go out of sight.  I called the local TV station the next day and was told they were meteors.

There was a 1.1 mile loop that I ran several times a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a cool day sometime in the spring I was running up a large hill near a local middle school.  I looked up at a large cumulus type cloud and noticed what looked like a tiny silver sphere hovering next to the upper right part of the cloud.  It was very shiny, reflecting the sun like a car would on a sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately stopped running and stared at this object trying to figure out what I was looking at.  I could tell the cloud was moving slowly towards me, but the object seemed to remain stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments the object moved to the left, appearing to go inside of the cloud.  It stayed hidden for a few seconds, then moved right and again hovered in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few moments, and it seemed to begin to move vertically very slowly.  Then it again moved left into the cloud and didn&#39;t emerge for what felt like several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I began to run again I looked up one last time and saw a brief glimpse of the object as it moved in and out out of the cloud on final time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I came to a stop at the light and looked up. Although it appeared to be silver it pretty much blended in with the blue sky. It was a combination of tear drop and egg but it just hovered there while i stared at it closer to the ground than an airplane. no noise no movement. the light changed and as i drove away i lost sight of it. Dont know how long it stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared to be hovering in the south part of the Prescott, AZ valley. The object I saw was roughly 2 miles away and around 3000 feet high. When I first saw the object I was standing on a porch outside my grand parents house so I had enough time to rush inside after a minute of amazement and grab some binoculars that were hung on the wall beside the entrance facing east. My close up look revealed that I could clearly see the craft from all sides because although it was fixed at one point in the air it spun around counter clockwise at around 20 RPM showing off all sides of the craft. The color of the craft was tarnished silver metallic and it was weirdly shaped like a cut precious stone or like a diamond kind of slanted in a 45-degree angle. I say weirdly shaped because its design did not signify any form of conventional aerodynamics. It literally looked like a rock that should have fallen out of the sky. It appeared to be the size of a small prop aircraft or it may have covered almost a nickel I think. I did not see it fly off it was simply gone after witnessing it’s presence for at least 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source elects to remain anonymous.

3/1/93 05:30|Ganado|AZ|Other|20years|For many years since 1978 to 2004 there have been different types U.S military air craft flying over my families home and my neighbors|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57331.html|18|ndxe199303| For many years since 1978 to 2004 there have been different types U.S military air craft flying over my families home and my neighbors homes on the Navajo Indian Reservation a small town known as Ganado which is located in Arizona. During this time my father, brother in-law and I have witness only one sighting of a strange shape air craft along with five bright lights blinks in the evening sky in March 31, 1992.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5:30pm on March 31, 1992 As we were traveling west on state high way 264 passing a small Hopi village heading to Tuba City, Arizona my brother in-law saw  five strange lights blinking in the evening sky other vehicles in front and back witness this strange lights from the evening sky. There were two vehicles in front of us that pulled over aside the road to look at the strange lights the other three vehicles behind us pulled over aside to watch this light from the sky. The three of us kept driving west to Tuba City and suddenly the lights disappear into the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have also been different types military cargo planes flying at low altitude in the dead of night. During this time my family and neighbors have watch these strange these air craft flying below a military cargo plane in the dead of night sometimes if we’re lucky enough we would see these strange air craft flying below a cargo plane on a full moon. For many years we watch the us government test the Northrop Grumman switchblade aircraft and other classified air craft flying over our homes on the Indian reservation. So basically we’ve watch these aircraft come to life but the weird thing is that we don’t see these strange air craft flying any more on the Indian Reservation no more low altitude fly by’s, all the strange air craft we don’t see any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/1/93|Merseyside (UK/England)||Sphere|1hour approx|3 shiny metallic spheres flew in highly complex patterns and appeared to "play" with each other.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17569.html|19|ndxe199303| 3 shiny metallic spheres flew in highly complex patterns and appeared to &#34;play&#34; with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO&#39;s could be seen in the distance (somewhere nr Jodrell Bank in Cheshire) &#34;playing&#34; with each other and &#34;chasing&#34; each other in and out of the clouds. The complex flight patterns and height and distance travelled in only a short matter of time proved that the objects were definitely not birds that had been mistaken for UFO&#39;s. One witness used a pair of binoculars and agreed that the objects were not birds. The UFO&#39;s were shiny metallic spheres which reflected the suns rays as they moved. They seemed to centre around one particular cloud that was quite large and they flew all around it and freauently disappeared inside it. The whole incident lasted for about an hour (if I remember correctly) and ended when thay just flew away into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
