Noticed a dim orange object near horizon above tree line which didn&#39;t look like a star or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly darted down and made quick erratic movements like a hummingbird and then came back to &#34;rest&#34; quickly... that really got my interest!  These movements lasted only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to photograph it but by the time I got my camera out of the back of my SUV and gotten the exposure right for night shooting the UFO dropped down and to my left and appeared to go behind the tree line.<n>

I didn’t take the picture but this was posted on the same night on Channel 5’s website:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://my5.live5news.com/Media/View/3193309<n> <n><n> <n><n> These seem to be similar to the lights my friend in Surfside Beach, SC, has seen numerous times over the Atlantic.<n>
2/28/13 18:55|Santa Fe|NM|Light|~1 minutes|Mysterious bright colored lights, red and green, moving through the sky.|3/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96473.html|5|ndxe201302| Mysterious bright colored lights, red and green, moving through the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately five minutes to seven, p.m., I was in my bedroom watching television whens strange lights appeared in my peripheral vision, attracting my attention toward the otherwise darkened sky outside. Turning to the window, I observed a set of bright colored lights, red and green, moving slowly across the sky. They were an unusual color of red and green, like no lights I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky before in all of my forty plus years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were constant, not flashing or blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I was seeing was obviously not a helicopter, plane or balloon.  It was utterly strange both in its appearance and in its motions, which were unlike the motions of any conventional object seen in the skies.  There were two light sources, one red and the other green, which were aligned horizontally to one another and which retained a constant spatial relation to one another as they moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no actual object, just these two lights moving together in very close and fixed proximity to one another, as if they were emitted from the same object (if indeed there was an object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astonished and curious, I ran outside, not stopping to put on my shoes or coat.  I stood in the snow wearing just my socks (I wanted a good look, and time was short).  I ran outside because the lights were passing directly over my house and the window view would not have allowed me to watch the mysterious &#34;object&#34; (if these lights were emitted from an object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sensed something being emitted from this &#34;object&#34; which was not light, which was very mysterious, and which I do not know quite how to describe or explain.   Perhaps I was feeling sub-audible sound waves, which my body could feel though I could not hear these waves?   I had the strange thought that somehow this thing was aware of my observation of it, but I must admit that this is just a speculation.  I have no actual evidence for this, and might have merely imagined this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt as if I were affected mysteriously by the thing, but just how I cannot say.  I felt something strange and perhaps impossible to describe. It affected my senses, especially my hearing, which seemed to be strangely diminished, as if some sort of sub-audible, low frequency sound were emitted from this &#34;object.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the apparently connected lights varied as the &#34;object&#34; moved across the sky.  At maximum, at its nearest approach, would be contained by a two inch ring held at arm&#39;s length from my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment when I had a feeling that the &#34;object&#34; were aware of my observation of it, it turned and reversed course, its flight behavior utterly unlike any object I&#39;ve ever seen before; not fitting with helicopters or planes, etc.  The &#34;object&#34; did not appear to emit sound audible to my hearing, as a plane or helicopter would have under similar conditions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my partner (we live together) about this experience by phone, and we talked about it further when he returned home.  As we sat together in our living room discussing it, I was facing a window.  Then it appeared again!  This was well over an hour later, but the time is uncertain. (I didn&#39;t look at the clock.) I pointed it out to my partner, who also saw this &#34;object,&#34; but only through the window, and at greater distance than the closest proximity of my observation earlier that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was unusual enough an experience that I decided to use the internet to explore whether others have seen and reported this, perhaps in the news.  I used search engines to explore this question, and this is how I came to discover this forum for posting such experiences.<n>
2/28/13 18:00|Carmichael|CA|Formation|90 seconds|Orb triangle formation at sundown.|3/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96464.html|6|ndxe201302| Orb triangle formation at sundown<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the sun was setting, 3 lights appeared in the sky, as if out of nowhere.  At first glance they looked like helicopters.  One light went out, then another, you could not see a plane or helicopter behind it (I.e. a helicopter turns its light off and you can see it clear as day).  There was no noise that we heard, and it was moving slow, but fast enough that we could see it moving.<n>
2/28/13 15:30|Reno|NV|Sphere|~8 minutes|2 small, silvery spheres over Reno, NV, 3 times faster than jet,, appear and disappear out of clear blue sky.|3/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96465.html|7|ndxe201302| 2 small, silvery spheres over Reno, NV, 3 times faster than jet,, appear and disappear out of clear blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to report a UFO sighting which my husband and I had this afternoon, February 28, 2013, approximately 3:30 p.m.  Big, puffy, white clouds and blue sky.  Bright sunshine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting outside at our picnic table, talking. I was drinking iced tea, he had beer, and we enjoying the warm, sunny weather, when I commented on the jet passing over our heads.  It seemed to be rather low, or very large.  As we were looking up, He said, &#34;There&#39;s an object!!&#34; and pointed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up, and didn&#39;t see anything unusual, &#34;Where?&#34;  &#34;There!!!  An object!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I squinted and looked harder, and my eyes fell upon a tiny, silvery white spot in the blue sky, just on the edge of a cloud.  &#34;Wow!  What is it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I don&#39;t know!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I jumped up and ran in for the 2 binocular cameras we have for bird watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came out, it was still there.  The cloud had moved, but the object was in the same spot.  We each took a camera and tried to focus on the shiny object.   We could see it better, but it was still only a shiny round sphere, hanging in the sky.  It was not bouncing or moving and appeared too large to be a mylar balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I tried to click a photo of it, my batteries were dead, same with the other camera!  That&#39;s when another commercial jet came from the north.   I jumped up to run into the house to grab my Canon Rebel with 300 zoom lens.   He yells, &#34;It&#39;s going!&#34;,  as I ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back out carrying the zoom camera, he said again, &#34;It&#39;s going!  It&#39;s moving like a bat outta hell!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to catch it with the zoom lens and focus, but it was moving too fast.  But, I clicked a picture in case it could get SOMETHING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He exclaimed, &#34;It&#39;s going!&#34;   When that plane appeared, it took off like a bat outta hell!!  3 times faster than the plane!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, another one appeared right behind it, out of the clear blue sky!!  The first one did a &#34;swoosh&#34; upward and toward the southeast, and the second one also did a &#34;swoosh&#34; upward and to the southeast, exactly like the first!  They disappeared right before our eyes!  He commented, &#34;They were going 3 times faster than the jet!  Can you believe that?!!  We saw a UFO!!  What do you think of that?!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could say was, &#34;Cool!!&#34;<n>

They seemed to be completely still except for the lights blinking.  They were blinking primarily white with intermitting red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came around a bend and closer to my home, it was apparent that the lights were moving but very slowly.  Almost hovering and all blinking in synchronicity and moving at the same time and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the driveway and immediately got my husband to come outside to see what I was seeing.   The lights we moving extremely slow and then one by one blinking out of sight.  The last two of them were a lot slower and separate from the group and hovered over the trees next to the field by our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They began in a formation where it looked like one behind the other.  Both of the objects blinking in exact time with each other.  It was close but absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved further from our house it actually looked like the lights were a part of something big. Meaning a light indicating the right and left side of something.  It was difficult to determine what shape it actually was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found very unusual about this was that these final two lights/objects got to the same point of the other five and then immediately blinked out of sight just as the other five before them did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before in my life.  It scared me.<n>

I quickly looked around to see if anything was happening nearby.  I looked up at the sky and saw a bright, red light which seemed to be traveling upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was some sort of flare, but the light quickly became brighter and traveled in my direction.  I quickly went to get my grandmother to show her the UFO.  She briskly walked outside and looked at where I pointed, and she stood there staring with intense curiosity at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the object seemed to be almost directly above us, but it seemed to be going higher and higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, wanting even more witnesses, I ran to my house to get my mother.  I excitedly told her there was a UFO outside, and she followed me back outside. The object was now farther away, more towards the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother ran inside to get a pair of binoculars, but by the time she returned, the object had almost completely faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened throughout the course of approximately three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Dozens (if not more) of people called local news outlets to report them.  When the news outlets contacted RDU airport, they were told that helicopters were conducting &#34;military exercises&#34; and that there was &#34;no threat to public safety,&#34; and &#34;nothing to worry about.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses (myself, my adult daughter and my sister included) all saw unidentified craft that sometimes hovered, sometimes darted, and that moved at times with incredible speed.  Some of the crafts had only white lights, some had only red lights, some had only intermittent strobes and were completely dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First we saw three unidentified craft over the area near Six Forks Road in North Raleigh.  They had white lights and moved very slowly at first.  As we continued to watch them, the left and right aircraft turned off their white lights and turned on much dimmer red lights, at the same time the middle craft became very bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they all three went almost dark, and suddenly sped from the Six Forks area, crossing over Falls of Neuse Rd and moving over toward Atlantic Avenue/Capital Blvd at an incredible rate of speed, then suddenly slowed down and resumed moving slowly, at very low altitude, and again with white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then left the area and travelled toward Durham on I-540.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the sky was filled with white strobe lights!  The lights would go dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time - there were at least 12 to 15 of these craft and they were moving slowly and at a low to moderate altitude (1000 feet?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While viewing these, three triangular shaped craft with red lights only appeared back toward the airport, at a higher altitude and approximately 45 degrees away from the objects with the strobe lights.  The strobe lights appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly - the red objects were moving more quickly, toward the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon two longer craft appeared in between, shaped almost like long-wing gliders, with a row of white lights down the central part of the object and red flashing lights on each end.  We would occasionlly see commercial airliners landing and/or taking off, and these were obviously not similar to those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did we hear any noise from any of the objects, even those we were closest to.  For the further objects we were not close enough that we would have expected to hear anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been around airports and even Air Force bases all our lives (two of us were Air Force brats growing up, one former U.S. Army infantry veteran and one lived near an Air Force base in California) and we all agreed this objects/craft were unlike anything we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left the area and continued to our homes, west of Durham.<n>

I was at stop sign juncture of Macon Road and Ray Road.  I thought at first it had to be three military planes flying in perfect formation and i was amazed at the slow speed and exact eqiudistance and how the planes maintained that exact distance but were also able to stay in air at such slow speed.  I realized they were only at most 2 to 3 miles from rdu airport and i decided to try to take a closer look. There were 3 lights on each craft.  Once i pulled over and looked back either the trees obscured my view or they took off.  I never saw side view or any view other than complete triangle appearance which was weird.<n>

Centro and I saw 3 bright orange triangle or arrowhead shaped ship.  They was in straight line then went to a triangle shape.  Then it disappeared.  About 15 mins later I was in Brawley at my house in the country and I was looking up at the sky to see if  anything else would appear.  Then 3 orange bright triangle or arrowhead shape lights reappeared. Stayed stationary for about 5 mins. Then one by one they disappeared in the night sky. I have photos of the ones in Brawley which I will email to you. The whole entire sighting ended at 9:05 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was seen my mother and myself.<n>

I am an amateur astronomer and also a nurse at the local trauma hospital (University Hospital in Columbia MO), so I assumed that the light was a &#34;Life Flight&#34; helicopter en route to the hospital (3.5 miles SSE of my house).<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I looked up, there was no helicopter... and the UFO was completely silent.  The UFO was a fireball, best described as an intensely orange light (seemingly lit from within) with flame-like orange  light emanating from the center without consuming it.  The speed of the craft was less than the speed of a helicopter, and despite the &#34;fire,&#34; there was no decrease in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO traveled fairly low ( the clouds were low and the UFO traveled below or at the cloud cover) in a south/southeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately two minutes, the UFO seemed to &#34;extinguish&#34; abruptly and faded from sight with no decrease in altitude.  I remarked to my friend several times that there was no sound at all from the UFO; the night was very quiet and I could only hear the traffic from I-70, one mile south of us.  I asked her to take a photo with her cell, but she was so disturbed by the UFO that she ran into her house carrying the snow shovel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my approximately 40 years of sky-watching, I have never seen anything resembling a UFO ... and certainly nothing resembling a slowly-moving fireball that burns without consuming itself or losing altitude or making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time, expertise, and dedicated work.<n>

2/26/13 18:30|Kearney/Lexington|NE|Unknown|25 minutes|Strange chemtrail formation over southwestern Nebraska.|2/28/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96446.html|26|ndxe201302| Strange chemtrail formation over southwestern Nebraska<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 6:30 p.m. CDT on Tuesday, February 26th, 2013, I was driving a taxi westbound on Interstate 80 in south-central Nebraska from Kearney to Lexington to pick up a customer and transport him eastward.  The sun had just disappeared behind a dark strip of clouds which extended low across the western horizan.  There was also a large blanket of dark clouds overhead which extended westward just far enough to leave a horizontal strip of much brighter and clearer sky between the two dark cloud banks.  With the sun setting behind the lower cloud bank, view of the western horizan was quite clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the area of clearer skyline, I suddenly noticed an unusually long, thick, white and roughly-textured chemtrail.  It was descending southward at an angle from the lower edge of the overhead cloud and then sharply turned back to continue angled descent toward the north.  The turn was so sharp that the chemtrail, just beginning it&#39;s northward descent, was beginning to form a &#34;V&#34; tipped sideways.  I also noted quite visible shadow outlining of the chemtrail, but I&#39;m certain that the sunset occurring in the background was responsible for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said before, the lower area of the chemtrail was just beginning it&#39;s northward descent.  Fascinated by the unusual formation, I realized that the lower section was being formed as I watched.  I can only speculate at how far away this chemtrail was from my location.  But Nebraska skies are typically clear for great distances and therefore, I&#39;d speculate that it was forming over the south-western Nebraska airspace between McCook and North Platte. Because of the distance, I could not descern what was forming the chemtrail.  However, the object was obviously descending very quickly, disappearing behind the lower cloud bank within a matter of less than 15 seconds from initiation of the turn.  Given my estimation of the distance being nearly 100 miles from my current location, whatever was creating this formation had to be traveling very fast.  For a moment, I wondered if it were a meteor.  But those do not reverse course.  As soon as the object disappeared behind the cloud bank, the! entire chemtrail, which later remained remarkably solid in appearance until full sunset, turned black.  Again, I assume this was due to shadowing from the sun setting behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now these are the reasons I think I was seeing something unusual.  First, the airports across this region of Nebraska are limited in aircraft size and do not typically handle large aircraft landings.  The angle of descent of the object made it appear as though it were indeed in the process of landing.  Smaller jets which are typical to airports in this region only rarely create visible chemtrails.  While larger jets do fly over the area on a regular basis, they appear to be at a much greater altitude, make no obvious descent, produce only thin and straight chemtrails, and only make gradual turns.  Additionally, I home school my teen son and we frequently watch videos on flight, space exploration and physics.  What I witnessed strongly reminded me of videos I&#39;ve seen of the space shuttle descent.  But I have no explanation for the sharp turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total observation time covered 25 minutes travel time.  Total observation time of the actual partial chemtrail being formed was less than 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it is always possible that I was simply seeing an unusual aircraft maneuvering through our air space, my instincts tell me otherwise.  After 50 years of Nebraska skywatching, I&#39;m left with the clear impression that this was something quite different than that and I just happened to be paying close enough attention to catch it.<n>

They were almost impossible to see with the naked eye but showed bright and clear in the photos taken by a member of the store&#39;s management team.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared near the end of a severe thunderstorm.  They were there for approximately one minute or so before vanishing.  Their disappearance only documented by their absence in the last picture that was taken because, as was previously stated, they were almost entirely invisible to the naked eye.  In the photos you can very clearly see a row of &#34;lights&#34; possibly and energy source along the bottom of the craft and one single &#34;light&#34; at the upper most point of the top of the craft.  I say &#34;light&#34; in quotes only because I assume if it were an actual light them people would have been able to see its luminescence with their own eyes wit! hout having to use a camera to see it.  So it may have just appeared as lights in the photos and not actually been lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after their disappearance the entire area suffered a huge power outage which knocked the power out for nearly 14,000 surrounding residents and businesses (Walmart being one of them).  The power outage was even reported on and was so odd and massive that it was written about online so you can look it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is no joke.  Those involved are afraid to say anything because we don&#39;t want anyone to think we&#39;re insane.<n>

No other stars, the moon, or objects in the sky were visible at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was seen for 20 minutes.  At first it was a single white light that was unmoving.  I thought it was an airplane but the light was in the same place for 10 minutes.   In the past plane lights would move into the landing pattern at either Bush Field or Daniel Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time a smaller red light was observed slightly south of the bright white light. The red light faded and blinked out then came on again. Just after that the larger white light faded and blinked out for 2 seconds and came on again.  The red light and white light repeated this two more times.  Then the red light blinked out and did not come back on.  The larger white light moved sharply up, down, left and right as if it were hopping or dancing.  Then stopped in prior position and was steady for another 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It faded off, came back on brighter than before, blinked out and then on two more times then faded out and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer has experience watching airplane traffic for 48 years.  The observer has been interested and an avid watcher of commercial and private aircraft, hot air balloons, meteorites and, meteor showers.  The observer is very familiar with the airport approach patterns in the Augusta, GA, area (Bush Field and Daniel Field).<n>

Nevertheless, this object changed colors which consisted of magenta, teal, and plum.  It descended to a point and disappeared.  When trying to identify the spot of sighting I came across 2 college students that were tracking what they saw as well.  They asked if it was me and I replied it was not me and I was doing the same thing; trying to find the spot where the ufo might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We live in a very wooded area.  There is no light pollution.  We thought of it as a joke at first.  Everyone who came to our home saw it.  We called it our light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time went on the object got closer.  It got to the point we could see it in the scope of our gun, but the object was constantly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a large object that we know is lower than the stars because when it is extremely overcast and cloudy, we can still see it.  This tells us it is in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along with the larger object, there is always three smaller UFO&#39;s that change colors very quickly. These objects move faster and in ways that our conventional aircraft simply can not.  We would love to know what these things are.  There is no way these are weather balloons or objects reflecting light.  We have hours of footage and pictures of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point they got so close to the house and tree line it scared us.  We d! id not see the objects for quite sometime after two jets flew over the house chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fighter jets were in combat mode trying their best to keep up, but it was like the UFO&#39;S were just teasing them.  Every time the aircraft got close the UFO&#39;S would just go from one point in the sky to another point in the sky in almost the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been in the past week that the objects have returned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anybody has any answers we would love to hear and explanation; because, we are running out of reasonable explanations<n>

I was looking towards the southeast when I noticed objects in the sky that appeared to be glowing lights, red and white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I saw approximately three of four glowing objects (they were not twinkling like a star but constant light) lined in an indiscriminate pattern resembling a box.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sizes of the objects were similar to planets that are seen with the naked eye in the winter night sky of the northeast.  The angle that I first sighted the objects was about 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then witnessed another four objects that seemed to rise up from the horizon and then join the other objects.  The objects then rose to approximately 45 degrees in the southeast sky where they silently hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned from the objects for about one minute.  Turning to see the objects again, they had disappeared.  Taking a short car ride to find them, I could not locate them again anywhere in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I got a clear view of the craft, I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Heading Northbound on I-75 off of Rockwood exit, 27, I pointed to something in the sky and said, &#34;What is that!?&#34;   In the same direction I pointed, was a water tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Dad responded, &#34;That is a water tower, son.&#34;  That is not what I was pointing at.  There was a blue light flying towards us at a remarkable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object became closer, I realized it was not a light.  I got a very clear view as the object passed our car.  It was a vibrant sky blue and it appeared to be almost glowing.  It was clearly in the shape of a disk or saucer.  It appeared to have black lines running perpendicular to each other around the craft.  It was traveling at a remarkable speed, quite low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and my eyes did not deceive me.  I saw a blue, flying saucer.  Maybe it was government technology? Or extraterrestrial?   My Dad, who does not fully believe in flying saucers, caught a glimpse.  He was quite shocked.  He is 58.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second UFO encounter.

Instead of going home through Pigeon Forge, we took the back roads home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned onto Goose Gap Road and went around the 90% turn to the right and started up the hill on the limited straight away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon the straight away I immediately saw two bright red lights in the sky just above the power line pole coming up in the next curve.  I said, &#34;Oh my gosh! What is that?! It&#39;s not an airplane!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove through the curve and lost sight for a few moments as we dipped and the trees were blocking our view.  As we started back up the hill again the craft appeared just above the trees and was leisurely moving along.  It was very large and in that moment I could see the third bright red light. It was triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were awe struck.  My husband was driving and I leaned up over the dash to watch it fly directly overhead and head towards Knoxville.  At this point we made it to a little church on the right side of the road and could watch for a distance.  It continued on its path.  Underneath the triangular craft I could see the craft was dark in color.  We heard nothing.  We felt nothing.  We have yet to tell our families as we thought no one would believe us.  I decided to do research and see how many sightings were located in this area and there has been none.  However other people have reported other sightings in the Knoxville area.  We were the only car on the road that night.  It was the most amazing and inquisitive moment to say the least.<n>

It looked as if it was a star but imagine it 1/6th of a full moon, the moon was full so I was able to compare it to the moon.  No other visible lights came from this orb, it was like bright almost ice blue, more white than blue but bright and it just disappeared as it traveled.  I then witness a chopper about a minute after the sighting heading toward the same area I lost vision of the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Remained outside for the next couple hours and didn&#39;t see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There are many things it could have been such as a satellite or a small space rock falling towards Earth, this I regarded as something ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting Two: Casey’s General Store   I was sitting in my friend’s Jeep while he bought gasoline.  I was downloading &#34;Sky Maps&#34; from Google Play on my phone because I wanted to identify a bright space object.  The object I was trying to identify was star-like in appearance, yet not uncommon.  It was most likely a planet or satellite, but still close to Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later, I saw something otherworldly out of the corner of my eye and I stuck my head out of the window of my friend’s Jeep.  When I observed it fully, I was facing it, Northern Skies, the same part of the sky the moon was in and a bit far away from Jupiter.  I saw two orange lights on what seemed like a cigar or disc shape, the object slowly floated to the left of my field of view and had vanished, like it had faded into the sky while still moving slowly in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are the locations where the sightings took place, no names or personal addresses included:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://tinypic.com/r/30idd0j/6<n>

Around 5pm I noticed from my yard five bright circular lights.  They were in a formation like an arrow.  Three made a triangle and two directly following the triangle.  They moved back and forth slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained in the same place  without moving forward for a few minutes.  No sounds were noted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation broke off and they disappeared behind the trees.  I took some pictures.  I was only able to capture three of the lights.  They were breaking formation by the time I got my camera and was able to focus on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like stars or round balls of white light.<n>

I looked up to see that one but then saw a small cluster swarm of around 11 of them at what looked like approximately 3,000 feet up.  They all looked like whitish dots moving in a circular pattern.  I took my eyes off of them briefly and really had to look hard to see them again in the same area of the sky flying in the same pattern again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes they collected closer together and sped off at a faster speed in a Northwestern direction, true North.  The cluster behavior resembled that of a flock of birds, like hawks or something just moving in a circular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s when they collected together and sped off that they moved faster than what birds could possibly maintain.  No birds I am aware of move that fast.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited to see if anyone else has reported anything and have not heard or seen anything on media or online.  I have never reported things like this online but what was seen was intriguing, I was checking out if anyone reported something to online media, I found this site and decided to post it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I had an iPhone, the optics would not have been good enough to catch what was seen.<n>

We wanted to get closer so we exited 51st and drove back towards the lights on the frontage road.  The lights began to disappear higher into the sky till there were none left.   We turned on 35th ave and saw another one moving past us at a high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then pulled into a driveway that went into a open desert area and one came from the tree line heading towards us.  As it got closer it began climbing higher and was straight ahead of us and stopped.   From the same tree line a second ball of red light that had a cone of light shining from the top of the ball began to follow the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the second ball got closer to the first the first one began to take off again heading away from us and climbing higher into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the second ball followed the first ones path turning away from us a THIRD one began to fly towards us from the same tree line.  This one seemed closer and even bigger.  It turned away in a large turn and quickly sped behind the other two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three got to such an altitude that they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone else had to see these flying they were right next to the highway!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Each orb was surrounded by 2 spinning orbs moving counter clockwise around the main orb which at a certain point only one surrounding orb would be visible then both would be visible at a certain apex of spin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was freaky, I live right in the air traffic zone of LAX and I saw this thing clear as day and close to the ground at roughly 200-500 feet and it was massive.  It seemed to be trailing a plane that was flying at a much higher altitude, while other planes overhead and in the area (one roughly 10-15 miles behind it) diverted back towards LAX.  I personally saw 3 large passenger jets turn back withing 5 minutes of this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between 7:50 pm and 8:11 pm there was zero air traffic in one of the busiest international airports, airspace.<n>

As we turned south I watched them and  more appeared in the night sky, in a line; some 2 or 3 across in a formation of sorts – keeping their equal distance from the center light.  They seemed to be moving closer very slowly and climbing higher. (like the video I found on your site – a line up in the sky)  We turned west again and parked to watch them between two houses.   I initially counted 9 or 10.  Then it seemed a few of them disappeared, or the lights went out, so I started counting again.  Then the ones that went out came back on in their original formation, still in line with the other lights. Then more started appearing at the horizon…..until we counted 25.  I tried to photograph them with my cell phone camera, but was unsuccessful at capturing them clearly. (7:01 pm) My husband noted a jet with its red flashing light far below these orange lights. (We live where we can see the East to West flight path of jets at night, approaching LAX)   These orange lights were very gradually moving south.  The jet was moving along its normal path from East to West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We needed to move our illegally parked car and get going to our destination, so we were unable to study them more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be floating in the sky, gradually moving up and toward us (N to S).  Their size was bigger near us, than the size of the lights on the horizon but the color was consistent for all of them.  They maintained a bright orange color…no fluctuations.  There was a single light at the front/top of the column of lights.  Their formation and slow movement in a column, made me think of invading aircraft from the old war movies and I actually said,” Are we being invaded?” as more and more of them appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound – too far away.  We considered helicopters, but we have seen plenty of military and police aircraft, having livied here for 30+ years, and have never seen anything like this or anything with this color of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O  O     O      O  O          O  O    O      O  O  O        O        O     etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Male and female, mid-50&#39;s, college educated, laborer and secretary, grown children....just regular folks out for a Saturday date night at the local symphony.<n>

They also seemed to change in color as they moved around, from yellowish to bright orange/red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes these objects seemed to fly straight up into the night sky and just disappear, however, 3 of the orbs hung longer than the rest but eventually they to just disappeared.<n>

I stopped on the road to look because the lights seemed to low to be a airplane.  As I watched I noticed a 3rd and then a 4th light appear and so on.  I thought maybe they were helicopters so I rolled down my window to listen but they were completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew to the northeast and the first light disappeared into the cloud cover. By then a 5th light appeared. All the lights were evenly spaced and traveling at the same speed, which was to slow to be a aircraft other than a helicopter.  If these lights were helicopters the blade chop from several would of been loud, but they were dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as one would go into the cloud cover, another would appear.  I counted a total of 11 objects in all, they were spaced out enough that only a couple were ever viewable at one time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the military and have seen just about every aircraft there is and I know of none that are silent and can fly slowly.

Over the Grand Canyon, I saw a black craft shaped like a bullet going at an amazing speed in the opposite direction very close to our airplane leaving a trail of thick black smoke behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, an identical craft with the same black trail went by.  I would concede it may have been a military plane, but thing that bothers me is that the smoke trail dissipated at the exact same speed as the craft, as if it were a part of it.  If a military plane were emitting black smoke from burning oil, it would have left a trail across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What my friends couldn&#39;t see because I was in the window seat is just before the second craft left my view, I saw it tilt upward and the black smoke trail disappeared in a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crazier part of the story is that when I returned home, I was telling my son the story while looking out the window of our home in Beverly Hills, CA.  I saw two brilliant white planes flying towards us.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it until the one on the right just disappeared, then the one on the left made a perfectly tight loop in the air, then disappeared.  It was a manoeuvre that would be impossible with a plane, and it was close enough that I could tell it was not a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was at about 3pm on 2/24/13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And that&#39;s my UFO story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Im not joking. A few minutes ago I was walking my Dalmatian, Harley and I saw three BRIGHT lights.  As I was watching them IT &#34;zoomed&#34; across the sky.  Trust me I have seen jets, shooting stars and tons of fast planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this was a bright shooting star but about 5 sec. later it &#34;ZOOMED&#34; back.  It was the FASTEST thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I sprinted home, yelled at my mom and sister to go onto the deck to see this.  She called her friend/our neighbor and we watched.  They did see it come to a hault and this thing was silent.  I have much experience air  planes fly over all the time. And this thing did NOT make a noise.  It also stopped and completely changed directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I AM FREAKED OUT AND PUZZLED ALONG WITH MY FRIENDS/FAMILY!!!!!<n>
2/22/13 23:30|Eastvale|CA|Sphere|3 minutes|Red Pulsing  Sphere Photographed and Videoed by two witnesses|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97363.html|65|ndxe201302| Red Pulsing  Sphere Photographed and Videoed by two witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 22, 2013 at about 11:30 PM was driving westbound on Limonite Ave about 3/4 of a mile West of the 15 fwy in the City of Eastvale California when I spotted an object in the sky I could not identify. I was listening to new reports on the radio of a meteor that had passed over Southern California about an hour prior and I was scanning the sky hoping to catch a glimpse of a second meteor when I saw a Red Glowing Sphere that looked like it had a slight haze around it.  The Object was south of me over a residential neighborhood and moving in a northwesterly direction. I pulled over and started filming it with my cell phone camera (HD). I filmed two video segments and took several still photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a hard time judging the size and distance to the object which was moving much slower than a meteor and not near as bright.  It was also gaining altitude not losing it. I think it was only about the size of a basketball and probably only a few hundred feet away.  There was no sound or noise coming from the object that I could hear. It did remind me of a chinese lantern or little hot air balloon but it appear to be a perfectly round ball with a pulsating light in the exact center and not a candle at the bottom as you would expect from a lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved diagonally across my westerly path and gained altitude.  Shortly after it crossed in front of the moon it disappeared. Its speed seemed to be slower than an airplane but it is hard to judge exactly how fast it was going because it was hard to tell how far away and how big it was.  If it was the size of basket ball and only a few hundred feet away then I would guess its speed to be about 10 mph.  I am sure it was not a real airplane, helicopter nor toy or models size version.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said I have still shots and video as well as witness who was in the car with me.<n>

It also had a white &#34;smoke looking&#34; tail.   It couldn&#39;t have been a meteor because it had a red blinking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know a meteor would burn up while coming into the air friction of our atmosphere, but the light kept blinking.  It could not have been a plane because it was travelling at least 50 times faster across the sky.  It looked high in the atmosphere; maybe around 30-50 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was travelling from the south heading north over the ocean from south near Mexico past north county San Diego.<n>

My son described it as several orange flares.  His friend thought they looked more like the Asian balloons that have the candles in them.  They said they could hear a dog going crazy on the other side of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes my friend and I decided we should go out and see if we could see anything.  It was at this time I noticed a bright orange light flickering and moving towards the camp from the other side of the lake.  As I walked into the driveway to try and get a better view I noticed two more of the same lights.  They at first were in a triangle formation but as time went on they separated and moved in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of the next 30 to 40 minutes they would leave and then come back.   Finally, a high altitude jet went over head and we could see the red and green blinking navigational lights as well as it contrail.  The flying orbs were still visible and appeared to be a larger object and brighter light than the jet.  It was at this point when we could hear a sound but it seemed more to be from the jet than the orbs. The orbs made no sound that we could hear.  As the noise from the jet became louder the orbs just kind of blinked out one by one and we did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dog(s) across the lake also stopped barking after the orbs disappeared.<n>

I noticed that there seemed to be a lot of airplane traffic on my way home from Bloomington, and some very bright stars looking to the west from Interstate 494 north but it was when I was approaching the highway 12 bypass, while still on Interstate 394, that I noticed an either extremely large or very low flying set of lights in the sky coming from the west.   As other planes were also visible in the sky (they did not appear to be &#39;chasing&#39; the object) I really didn’t take much notice of it until I registered just how big it was and then realized it didn’t appear to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that depending on location of the objects and positioning of the viewer, some moving objects can appear stationary.  This did not appear to be the case, and I could see all the other airplanes in the area moving in the direction of the airport.  The object was on the north side of the road and above the trees.  When 394W ends the highway splits, one way takes traffic highway 12 through Long Lake, and the other is the bypass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was centered between the 2 highways.  Had it been a normal road I would have pulled off to the shoulder, but that stretch of road is not safe to do so, but I could see it through the windshield by leaning forward and peering up at it.  There were noticeably more lights on the front of the object than would be on an airplane, all along what would be the wings if it were an  airplane; none were blinking and all were white; there were no red or green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In hindsight, I wish I had circled back through Long Lake because I really believe it would have still been in the same spot.<n>

So I thought maybe there was a squirrel up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He then jumped forward so I decided to go out and see what had him so wound up.  There was a dark object floating, moving very slowly.  It is too dark here to really get a better description.  There were no lights at all.  It kind of reminded me of a hot air balloon the way it was hanging.  There was also no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it from the side and then from the rear for about 4 minutes as it disappeared into the dark.  Not once did a light flash or a sound come from it.  There is an airport near here and an Air force Base.  I just found it odd that an object would be out at night near an airport (about 5 miles away) with no lights.  Also, the Base is about 5 miles away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just thought I would see if anyone else had seen it.  This is the first time my dog has ever barked at something i! n the sky.<n>

This sighting took place at approximately 9pm from my home in Sarasota, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on my deck talking on the phone with a friend when I spotted an unusaul white light in the night sky at just about a 45 degree angle traveling at a slow, steady speed, at what looked like a linear path approaching me from the South in a North or Northeast heading. This light was about the size of a pencil eraser or around 3x the size of the brightest star Sirius, but not as brilliant.  I asked my friend if he could see anything and he confirmed he did.  He was about 12 miles Northwest of me in the neighboring town of Bradenton.  He was further from the object than I was and it would have been lower in the horizon from his point of view, but he still had an unobstructed view since the land here is completely flat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was excited like myself, and urged me to bring out my telescope to have a closer look. I wanted to but I did not want to miss anything, and I was afraid the object would have disappeared by the time I set up my telescope (about 2 minutes time in a hurry). Both of us agreed this was not a Satellite, much too large and traveling too slow at what appeared to be an altitude of 10,000 ft. or so, definitetly not orbital. I also ruled out a helicopter because there was no sound. I still had not ruled out a possible large aircraft on approach to Sarasota/ Bradenton airport. It was not far off the appoach path commercial jet airliners take, and so I thought it might be the nose and wing lights appearing as one light head on, as they often do.  As the light traveled east of me and I was looking at it from the side, this now seemed unlikely. In addition, there were no red and green navigation lights, and again there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3-4 minutes of this white light traveling in the sky, it suddenly changed to a red color! The best way I could describe it was the white light was extinguished and turned to a more subduded deep red color. It appeared to continue to travel in the same direction and speed. This lasted for maybe 5-10 seconds and then it disappeared all together. I immediately asked my friend to describe what he saw, and he collaborated what I just witnessed. We couldn&#39;t believe it! I continued to scan the skies for several more minutes, but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summing this up, I witnessed a large white-lighted object for a duration of approximately 4 minutes, traveling in the night sky at a slow rate of speed, then suddenly turning red before disappearing. The light was always steady, not strobed. Impossible to make out a shape of the object behind the light. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself a competent sky observer, having a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and the night skies. I&#39;m 44 years of age and this is the first and only time I have ever observed a light in the sky that I could not explain to my satisfaction. This event happened earlier this year in February and apologize for submitting this late, but I thought it worthwhile. At the time of this sighting, I did in fact check the online submitted UFO reports and local newspaper to see if this strange light had been reported by anyone else here in Sarasota area, but I did not find anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Just killing time waiting for my dog, I studied them and they had lights at regular intervals along the side or perhaps bottom.  The moon did not provide much light but what I observed appeared to be &#34;bars,&#34; long and rectangular, with lights equidistant along the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood there, I realized these objects in the sky were not moving at all but were totally stationary.  I watched a plane fly over but the &#34;bars&#34; were exactly where they were when I first saw them, perhaps 20 minutes before.  They were not aligned in any pattern but scattered randomly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As someone who firmly believes in UFO&#39;s, I was slow to accept that I might be seeing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, I first thought they were large passenger planes and that I was seeing the windows lit up; however, they were too high up to be such.  I waited for them to move but they did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little frightened since they were in the sky right above our house, I took my dog and went in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus, I don&#39;t know how long they were out there, but I was out watching them about 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The location of our house is Lyme, CT, right by the Connecticut river.  This is a remote, wooded area and very dark at night.  The only light in the sky at night comes from the moon or rarely an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an aside, our heating furnace ceased to work during that night and it turns out the motor was blown.  Probably not related because it was old, but a strange coincidence.<n>

Immediately, I called my son and wife to come out thinking it was a large meteorite flying by.  The object looked like it had a fire trail and was fairly large.  I told my son to run in the house and grab my cellphone and as soon as he brought it out I started filming with the phone&#39;s video camera.  Object was moving fairly fast and had a very shallow approach angle but seemed to slow down later.  I turned on the phone&#39;s video camera and caught some footage of the object.  The other thing that we all agreed on later that there was no sound (no prop or engine noise).  As I was filming, our trees where in the way so I briefly lost video of the object but then got the camera back on it.  Object looked reddish orange with some yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have video but it&#39;s 52 mbytes<n>

I was driving to work the morning after from my home town of Brampton eastward on Finch ave. to North York Toronto.  The air was heavy with mist and fog and at about 7:00am (quite bright, not dark) I stopped at the red lights at an intersection a few Km from my work destination. I looked northward to my left and saw two white hazy lights in the sky which looked quite odd. They looked to be about 150 meters away horizontally and at a 45degree elevation and they were separated horizontally and vertically by about 2 degrees. They were totally motionless as if fixed to a pole or building,  I could not see any such structure below them and if there was, I should have been able to from that distance even though the fog was there. I began wondering if they were from a chopper, but there was no sound, a plane but there was no movement and it definitely couldn’t be from a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started moving again on the green, I kept looking back as much as I could and for as long as I could and there was no apparent movement.  The next morning while on my to work again, the sky was totally clear and as I passed the same spot I thoroughly checked to see if there was any very tall supporting structure that was obscured by the fog and there was absolutely none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Mechanical Engineer and a backyard astronomer and will readily identify natural earthbound objects; I am totally convinced that those lights were from an unknown/unnatural source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As I walked out onto our back patio I saw a light shoot across the sky heading south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought I had just seen a shooting star until the light returned and swiftly moved from the west to the east before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The early morning was overcast so I saw nothing except a round light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hesitant that this could be a &#34;spotlight&#34; but there were no other lights in the sky and the movement seemed too quick before disappearing completely.<n>

I was taking my dogs outside to do their duty before bed it was about 1 or 2 in the morning.   When I walked out my front door I saw this orange light coming over the mountains to the north of Tucson.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where I take my dogs I had a better view of the object in the sky so I watched it for about 10 minutes.   It took about 7 minutes to go about 3 feet in the sky and it stopped for about 3 minutes and just disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound and when it disappeared it looked like it just turned the lights off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Lasted about 2 or 3 seconds, hard to tell exactly what happened but it seemed to fade out or disappear at the end.  Definitely too big (and seemingly a bit slow) for a shooting star, but way too fast for a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called the police, but apparently no other reports called in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No audible noise (probably too far away for that).<n>

There were many people in town that were watching what appeared to be 5 objects in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw were 5 red triangle shaped objects also out our backyard over the Columbia river. They were coming toward us at a slow rate of speed and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects would draw close to each other and then away until 3 of them went straight up and behind cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We video taped the whole event from start to finish.<n>

I thought it was a strange color to be in the night sky, so when I got closer to where they were nearly over me, I pulled the car onto a side road and got out to watch them.  I was amazed to see that there were many more coming and that they were traveling on a diagonal from southwest to northeast.  I counted 12 altogether.  The last one tagged along quite a bit behind the others.  I saw it come up over the horizon in the distance, and  although it was far behind, it flew at the same speed as the others.  None of the “vehicles” made any noise whatsoever, and they all stayed at the same altitude all the way, which was lower than the small aircraft in the sky at the time.  They were obviously on a mission, moving in a straight line but then disappearing into what seeme! d to be nothingness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I stood there and studied them then they started moving to my right slowly,  As I watched them a third light appeared behind them which formed a triangular formation, which really baffeled me.  So the third light in the back which appeared disappeared about 2 seconds after it appeared.  Then the others disappeared with about a 2 second interval in between each.  The craft was a couple hundred feet above the treeline, was fairly big, made no noise, lights weren&#39;t blinking and the way it appeared were as if all the lights were in sync with each other.  I&#39;m not sure if this was one craft or three seperate ones.  Note, As I said when the lights disappeared they didnt fade into the distance nor did they disappear simultaneously it was all at seperate times. They just disappeared where they were.<n>

It appeared to have a another craft flying close by.  Cloud height.  Pink, orange or red.  Smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger craft had a trail behind it and the other was flying in an around the craft and through the trail.  Really couldn&#39;t tell the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a pic of it but only caught the bigger craft.  Sorry it was just crazy to see so I never thought to get out my phone until it was some distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The larger craft was shiny.  We thought it might have been the sun&#39;s reflection until we noticed other dark planes in the area because of Philadelphia airport&#39;s close proximity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangest thing and it&#39;s taken me this long to report because I thought someone else would have seen it.  It was in plain view.  Startling.  The larger craft wasn&#39;t what made the sighting weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller craft flying around it at different angles an speeds made it different.  We passed it off as! a drone.<n>

I WATCHED IT ABOUT 30 SECONDS BEFORE IT CHANGED COURSE BY MOVING UP AT ABOUT A 30 DEGREE ANGLE AND DISAPPEARING INTO A CLOUD.  THE CLOUD WAS NOT LARGE AND WAS VERY THIN.  THE OBJECT NEVER CAME OUT OF THE CLOUD.  WITHIN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES THE CLOUD BEGAN BREAKING UP AND BECAME VERY WISPY.  I NEVER SAW THE OBJECT AGAIN.  THE SKY WAS MOSTLY CLEAR AT THE TIME WITH JUST A FEW CLOUDS. THE UFO WAS SHAPED LIKE A DEEP FRYING PAN WITH NO HANDLE.  IT WAS SLIGHTLY WIDER AT THE TOP THAN THE BOTTOM.

I happened to look up towards the southeast, looking for the moon. It was somewhat cloudy that night, but there were stars.  But there were at least several in particular that caught my eye.  They appeared stationery; but they appeared to be moving at high speeds, while some moved slowly, stopped, changed direction, then moved off in a westward direction.  I noticed there were planes in the sky that night, because I could see their running lights.  These lights were a solid, with no flashing lights. I snapped a photo with my digital camera, which appeared to catch nothing but blackness.  I also attempted to capture video, but it, too, displayed only blackness, with no sight of anything.  I know that at least twice my fiance observed the lights with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fort Wayne is near an airport, so I see aircraft in the sky quite frequently.

I instantly and very clearly could see what she was wanting me to see.  It was severall fireball looking aircraft flying very slowly across the sky at what I thought was fairly low altitude and they made no sound.  Prior to this event I was researching the meteor that had hit Russia so when I stepped outside emediately I was sure I was witnessing another meteor  breaking apart into our atmosphere but realised shortly that the fireballs were defineatly not meteor debre  but intact aircraft  flying in formation  btw not ferfect formation whitch is not uncommon because my home is beneath the Spokane airport and Fairchild airforce base  flightpaths. I reported this to the airforce base looking for info on what kind of aircraft they were and no answer. I checked the news as well and nothing.  I spoke to my brother about this and told me to check this site out and noticed we weren&#39;t the only ones to witness them even thow it was at different times.    I thought the right thing to do was to reasure others  they&#39;re not nuts cause we saw them too. However this doesn&#39;t confirm &amp;quot;aliens&amp;quot; just confirms UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

All of a sudden, I see a small, white, round, flying object in the sky, moving slowly and further away.  It didn&#39;t leave any trail of any kind or make any noise.  It then disappeared. Minutes later, there was another.  Exactly  the same, but it came out of no where.  After that one disappeared into the sky, another came out of the blue, and it also disappeared. We didn&#39;t see any after that.  That was the third sighting I&#39;ve had of any UFOs around my home, and it&#39;s odd because I live in a small rural town that many people don&#39;t even recognize.<n>

THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO GIVE ANY KIND OF REFERENCE WOULD BE TO HOLD YOUR ARMS STRAIT OUT WITH INDEX FINGERS POINTED STRAIT UP,  APPROX 8-9&#34; BETWEEN FINGERS (FOR DISTANCE TRAVELED), AND APPROX 1/4 TH   THE SIZE OF THE FINGERNAIL (FOR SIZE).<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE  EVENT LASTED APPROX 3-5 SEC.

They were to the west of me, not directly overhead.  We live close to a major airport (CVG) but these were not moving in an usual direction for normal air traffic patterns and also there is not any commercial air traffic at 1130pm on a Sunday night at CVG.  Plus, they were too close together to be aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought for a moment they might be helicopters, but they were completely silent.   And the lights were steady, bright orange-not blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my husband and my phone and binoculars.  By the time my husband got up to join me, we had to go out to the front to see them.  They were much higher in altitude by then, still moving steadily and! directly (not erratic) in movement, still to the north.  They were spread apart at various altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them moving away for a couple minutes and then returned inside.  I was not able to get any pictures of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 59 year old woman, married for 34 years to a now 61 year old man.  We are both college graduates.  I have worked for a major airline for 35 years.  My husband works part time.  We have lived in our current place for 2 1/2 years.  Neither of us has ever witnessed these lights before.  I frequently walk the dog late at night.<n>

I thought at first it was a model airplane somebody was using a remote controller, but it couldn&#39;t have been the way it was moving around..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it for about 10 minutes, then it just vanished into thin air..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed where this took place at,, about a block down the street is a store called Meijers and they have all these towers outside with flashing red lights, maybe something from that signal the ufo, if that is what this is...

At approximately 10:20pm while driving northeast on Hurstbourne Lane towards I-64, we witnessed at least 20 glowing red orbs in the eastern sky towards the town of Shelbyville, KY.  The sky was overcast, with high winds, low cloud cover, and probably less than ten miles visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold a private pilot certificate and have worked several years in the aviation industry.  I know these were not manned aircraft for several reasons:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  	The bad weather/visibility would have prevented a large group of aircraft from flying in close formation at such low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	  There were no position lights.  U.S. powered aircraft always have a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.  Prudent pilots will always fly with a flashing omnidirectional beacon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	  The orbs of light mostly stayed stationary in the sky and did not seem affected by the high winds. Occasionally the orbs would move vertically (both up and down) at high rates of speed. The sky was overcast, these were not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	  They were bright red orbs. The intensity was strong and the light didn’t waver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	  They were in a strange formation, some were higher/lower than others. They didn’t seem to be organized in any sensible pattern either horizontally or vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.	  They suddenly disappeared.  This video is very similar to what we saw, though there were many of them all at the same time:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi-6DFe2fEg&amp;list=PL4D428923123EF286<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible explanations/problems with our sighting:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  	I thought they could have been sky lanterns (like those used in eastern cultures).  They seemed to be flying over part of the U of L extension campus. It’s possible that a group of students launched a bunch of them to celebrate Valentines Day weekend.  However, as stated before, there were really high winds that night and the orbs appeared to be relatively stationary in the sky.  The orbs also moved vertically at high rates of speed.  I have also scoured the internet to find news of celebrations involving sky lanterns.  I haven’t found anything.  We do not live in Louisville so we do not have ready access to their news outlets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  	They could be helicopters flying in a rough formation.  The problem is: no position lights, it was overcast, very dark, with high winds, and really what would be the point?  I don’t see a bunch of pilots participating in a potentially dangerous flight at night with low visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  	They could have been stars.  It was overcast, the orbs moved, and stars don’t shine red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	  The only exasperating part of our experience is that I can find no evidence on the internet that anyone else witnessed what we saw!!  These were high enough in the sky that thousands of people could have potentially seen them.  It was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, or at least hear that someone else also witnessed this! If you have any information I would definitely be interested in hearing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not my first experience with a UFO sighting in Louisville, KY. In 2000 I was working at Standiford Field (the Louisville Airport SDF) for the summer.  It was a warm night and the skies were crystal clear.  Several airline agents and I witnessed a large white lens shaped object seemingly floating in the night sky to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it might have been an advertising dirigible flying over Papa John’s Stadium.  However, it seemed to just suddenly appear.  We could not hear any engines (to indicate that it was powered). It was not present the night before, or the night after our sighting.  It did not move at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We contacted the control tower to ask what it was and they had no explanation.  There was nothing on their radar.  We had to work an inbound flight, but when we were done, the object in the sky was gone.  A possible explanation is that it might have been a large balloon tethered to the nearby stadium.  However I have several problems with this:<n> <n><n> <n><n> (1)  It was huge; it appeared to be the size of the good year blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (2)  It had no top: there were clear skies and its top seemed to just fade into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (3)  It did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (4)  There was no visible advertising on the side.  It seemed to be illuminated by the city lights below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (5)  It disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> (6) ATC (air traffic control) did not know what it was  (7) Standiford is a busy airport, and is a major hub for UPS. Huge cargo aircraft are constantly flying in and out of SDF all of the time (especially at night).  I do not see the FAA allowing such a huge balloon (if it was a ballon) to be tethered so close to the airport, especially at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to hear more information on this one as well.  We do not live in Louisville, but we do live in another major city nearby.  I find it ironic that both of my sightings have been in Louisville.  I’m still very skeptical, but just a little excited too.  I hope this information helps in some way.<n>
2/16/13 21:15|Golden Valley|MN|Light|2 minutes|I saw 3 orange lights slowly gliding through the night sky in the Minneapolis, Minn area.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96344.html|117|ndxe201302| I saw 3 orange lights slowly gliding through the night sky in the Minneapolis, Minn, area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday evening, Feb 16, 2013, I was driving to the grocery store between 9:00 and 9:30 PM.  I was not wearing my watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cold night, and rather dark (except for street lights and the moon).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A number of airplanes (airliners, I presume) were in the sky, landing or taking off from the MSP airport, located towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no military airport in the area, but Navy Reserve and Air National Guard planes used to be based there (and possibly still are - I don&#39;t know).  Many decades ago, the Navy based Panther jets and some other planes there, and the ANG based F-89 Scorpions, C-119 Flying Boxcars, T-33s, and some other planes at their side of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [Note: Some models of the F-89 were capable of carrying the Genie air-to-air nuclear-tipped guided missile.  I don&#39;t know if our local F-89s were equipped with any Genie&#39;s. The Genie went into service in July, 1957. The F-89 is now long obsolete, and the Genie probably is, as well.]  The point is that our &#34;civilian&#34; airport has not been purely civilian, over the years, and there&#39;s a chance that some of the ANG Scorpions carried nuclear weapons. Not too likely, but possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded down Noble Avenue, a few blocks from home, I noticed something in the sky in a southeast direction, viewed between obscuring trees. There appeared to be a clump of stars and lights. I noted that if some of them were stars, they were unusually clear and bright - like one would see in the country - not the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I vaguely recall that the pattern of stars looked like the Big Dipper, but it could NOT have been the Big Dipper in such a southeast location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mention it only because it attracted my attention - not because I think the Big Dipper moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that some &amp;quot;extra stars&amp;quot;, so to speak, were orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen orange stars before, and doubt that any exist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious, I pulled over as soon as I could (there was no traffic), and viewed the scene between the trees while stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 3 orange lights in an arrowhead shape slowly moving westward - possibly slightly north (west-northwest).  For a movement reference point, I used a utility line (probably a cable TV line or phone line), and watched them as they slowly passed over the utility line, with the point of the arrow head leading the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no red-white-green navigation lights or anti-collision lights visible (strobe lights), nor any flashing red lights on, or near, any of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear any noise, as far as I know, but any noise would probably have been drowned out by the several airliners visible in the 25-mile vicinity.  (It looked like a busy night for air traffic).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Airline passengers could probably have seen the lights if the plane was northbound or southbound, by looking up and towards the the east (when I saw them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After perhaps 15 seconds, they disappeared either behind some light clouds or a tree (I don&#39;t remember), so I headed to the nearby school parking lot to get a better view, in case they were still visible.  Unfortunately, they had vanished, probably behind a large area of broken clouds.  I remained there in my car for a few minutes, but never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I arrived at the grocery store parking lot, about 5 minutes later, I did scan the sky for a while after exiting the car, but just saw the usual broken clouds and the moon.  It was very cold, and I didn&#39;t stand there for long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if the lights were connected to a large object. All I saw were the orange lights, and didn&#39;t notice any stars being blacked-out.  In terms of observing, the conditions were terrible, but at least I saw the silent, beautiful lights for a little while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ================================================================== ==================================================================<n> <n><n> <n><n> [NOTE: Peter, the directions on your web page are almost impossible to read. In fact, I could **NOT** read them.  They are tiny red letters on a gray background.  I had to do a copy-and-paste of the requested date format to a TXT document, and enlarge the letters to read:  &#34;Use MM/DD/YY format..&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guessed at the formats for the other boxes because I couldn&#39;t read those tiny red letters, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If your webmaster designed the page, he did a TERRIBLE JOB!!!!  Making instructions legible is BASIC and ELEMENTARY, and is not ROCKET SCIENCE.  You should have him fix it with much larger font and some other color.  In fact, you could lighten or eliminate the gray background.  It doesn&#39;t need to be there.  But the gray background could stay if the tiny red letters are junked - as they should be.  The black letters stand out well (oddly enough) and are large enough.  What was he smoking when he designed it???  I&#39;m running Internet Explorer V8 (IE8) under Windows/XP SP3.  The view size is 100%.  When I enlarged it to 150% size by using the ZOOM tool, I could STILL hardly read the red letters!!

As we watched for what seemed like several minutes the formation broke up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the objects moved rapidly up and to the right and disappeared.  While this was going on I pulled out my iPhone and started to take video of our observations.  The two remaining objects seemed to move up and away from our position and seemed to turn to a bright white color as they moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly there was no sound as you would expect with a jet, light aircraft or helicopter.  Additionally the flight patterns were not consistent with any aircraft that usually transit this area.  The movement of these objects as we observed would move right or left, stop and hover then cross within what appeared to be very close proximity of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent the video of this sighting to your organization which you can hear the reactions of the three witneses.<n>

They were traveling slowly in a south-easterly direction, at approximately twice the altitude of the nearby water tower.  No sound was heard in association with lights.  After the first group of 5 or 6 lights passed overhead, two more followed, and then a final light behind those.  All seemed to be moving the same speed (15-20mph) and direction.  Sky was slightly cloudy from snow, so shape of any attached craft was un-discernible.  Leading 5 lights were shaped like an exponential function (curving upwards concavely), trailing lights had no notable geometry.  The lights did not flash but remained steady through the sighting.<n>

It was 6 or so bright orange lights that did not blink and they were silently flying in a v formation but would move so it did not appear to be one object.

I observed from north, bright red lights at very low altitude from west to east, climbing as they passed by.  Close enough that I should have heard engine noise, but silent.  The first three flew in a triangular formation, one in front, two behind.  Called my wife out to have a look.  We watched as 5 more passed by at approximately one minute intervals on same trajectories.  Tried to view with binoculars, but red light too bright.  Flew right over March ARB, which is restricted airspace.  Stayed well away from commercial flight paths, of which there are several in this area, e.g., Ontario and John Wayne approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  these must have been some type of aircraft conforming to aviation rules, which require a red light on a left wing.  But the brightness of the light made them seem to be very close, ½ mile or less, while completely silent and very fast.<n>
2/16/13 14:50|Los Angeles|CA|Sphere|15-20 minutes|White orb slowly turns orange, and then white a few times.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96339.html|125|ndxe201302| White orb slowly turns orange, and then white a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down Santa Monica Blvd towards Century City when I noticed a white dot in the sky traveling with a fair amount of speed, in a south west direction.  It was obviously not an airplane and my thought was it was probably a large white balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out a pair of binoculars I had with me to get a better look at it.  Balloons typically have strings attached and rock a bit due to being heavier at the bottom but this did not.  It just appeared to be a white orb....at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then seemed to stop moving west and seemed to begin to ascend a bit, then remaining suspended in the same location for about 10-15 minutes.  During this time it would occasionally slowly change from white to glowing orange, and back.  It did this two or three times.  It then began to move back in the direction from which it came, and then towards me.  I believe at this point it was higher than it had initially been.  It changed to orange one more time, and back to white, and then I lost track of it after I put the binoculars down to rest my arms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe this was a balloon as it did not exhibit a string or characteristic rocking.  I believe the orange coloring was emitted light rather than reflected light, because the sun was not low enough in the sky to cause an orange reflection, the change from white to orange to white occurred slower than expected if it were an object turning such to reflect light, and when objects in the sky reflect light, the intensity usually increases to a bright point quickly, and then decreases quickly.  This object did none of these things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Looking out of the window we were immediately drawn to TWO red/orange circular lights in the sky...traveling what looked like north to south, appearing to be heading towards the ground.  They seemed to be traveling together, not to or from the airport, LAX which is super close! They seemed to have their own groove, not like the airplanes, a slight back and forth movement whilst traveling, looking like heading towards the ocean?  When we see the planes, they give a white light, not a red light!  There was a haze...maybe because the ocean and full sky as a background? We absolutely could NOT identify them as being aircraft that we are used to seeing.  Was a very strange sight in all.  NEVER seen anything like that before! We came inside and went straight onto the computer to see if there were any reports of them..we know there&#39;s meteor activity out there ! right now...but we came across your site instead so decided to submit a report.  I wish I had grabbed my iPad to record it, will be on the lookout and film again if we see again!<n>

I saw her outside and asked what she was looking at.  She explained that she wanted to hear what these aircraft sounded like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I joined her outside on the deck to check it out.  We were unable to hear any sound like jets or helicopters.   We see a lot of aircraft from our house, which overlooks Greenlake as a lot of air traffic comes in from the north when the south wind prevails.  The breeze we had this night was from the north.  The sky was clear for the first time in days and we were able to see a series of orange orb - like lights that seemed to come up from the NE horizon, maintain speed as if it was an aircraft and head south while gaining altitude.  We could see 2 or 3 at a time.  They did not blink or flash like aircraft usually do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they got about due east, they would fade out and new ones would appear coming from the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs, got my little camera and took a few photos and a little bit of video while we watched for approx. 10 minutes.   At one point, we could see a small aircraft with its flashing lights that appeared to be much closer to us than the &#34;orbs&#34; heading south.  We probably saw 15-20 lights in all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would be very difficult to tell the distance – but we both figured at least about 5 miles away – but it’s only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting, I turned on the news, thinking I’d see some explanation, but nothing was reported.  Checked the net first thing this a.m.; nothing there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have a clear view of  Greenlake and the Cascade mountains from our deck , kitchen and upstairs and had even commented earlier in the day how clear the view was. Also, we’ve lived in this house for about 30 years, seen a lot of aircraft – but this was different.<n>

Sounds funny but you never know nowdays how thing have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I notice the objects flying slow, I got out the van and took a picture.  My fiance noticed them right away too.  I kept looking at the sky and the guy next to us and hid wife were stund.  The mans wife then noticed a forth one following the other three not to far behind.  As we were watching them fly slowly away, they were diappearing one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all couldn&#39;t think what just had happened.

We went outside, we live in an apartment complex, and looked up at the sky facing NE, and we saw some white circular shapes.  First thing we told my niece is that they are birds.  But we kept looking, and we saw that light was reflecting off of the shapes. If you&#39;ve ever seen birds, you can tell what their color is, and light does not reflect off of them. We kept looking for a good minute, and there were literally more than one hundred.  They were making fast movements, and out of nowhere, they would start disappearing in groups.  And then, they were gone.  It lasted about a minute and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today (02/15/2013 around 16:00) we saw them again. It lasted about the same short period, and there were hundreds of them.  And like the day before, they disappeared in groups.  If they are birds, I have never seen birds do that.  We birds fly away, as far as I&#39;ve seen, you can see them leave because they usually don’t go higher.  And light does not reflect off their bodies!  We are going to try to record them on camera tomorrow.<n>

I was sitting in the right backseat looking through the window into the clear blue sky when I suddenly spotted two objects that were pretty distant from each other in height.  I could tell that the lower one was a jet because of its trailing contrail.  The other object however, did not have one, and was white with a cylindrical shape and seemed to move slower than that of a jet flying at the same height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As both were flying opposite directions out of my feild of view, two more objects had suddenly popped into view and this time they were the same cylindrical shape, color, and altitude but were a few miles apart traveling in the same direction.  As time went on I started to see more appear but not one right after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lowest flying object had appeared as we were driving through Chillicothe.  It was flying very low, maybe between one and two thousand feet.  I couldn&#39;t get the clearest view of the underside of the thing but it had the cylindrical shape and white color to its body and as it flew over head I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a red sphere on the right side of its undercarriage and a black sphere on the left side.  I lost sight of it as we were going the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, between 12pm and 2pm I saw 16 objects, and from what I could tell only 3 of them even remotely resembeled aircraft.  I&#39;ve seen eight jets in one day fly over head before but never in my life have I seen 13 white, cylindrical objects flying around in the sky.<n>

It just moved away at a very measured speed,while previously stationary in the sky , (for what seemed to be about 10 minutes)...looking like just another star!.. I followed it across the sky until it just faded out...that ..was on 2/14/13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 2/15/13, same exact time..went out with dog to see these same 2 stars visable. again.. (Minus the third moving star)   All of  the sudden up comes this moving star..(or craft ?   Drone??)   it rises and drifts over to the original place in the orions belt string of stars placement..stops dead in TRACKS!  HOLDS FOR A MOMENT! THEN REVERSES DIRECTION! THEN RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL TTRACK...FADES OUT AGAIN!   Kinda freaked by this, this happened in the northern sky and there is NO orions belt in the northern sky at 6 am.. This could not be a satalite,as they do not stop and go or reverse direction..although it appeared as a bright star,as bright as the others in what I originaly thought was the belt of orion,I t was something else for sure..any thoughts?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were no strobe lights or any other lights blinking on it.  I watched it to see if it was moving, and it was, very slowly.  It almost seemed to move and then wobble back and forth, but continued moving across the sky.  I kept watching it to see if there would be a strobe that would show up proving it to be an aircraft of some kind, but there never were any.  After about two minutes, it faded away<n>

A few days earlier my mom and older brother saw a orb of yellowish light  and when my older brother touched the door knob it collapsed on itself and vanished. I do not know what is going on... sometimes we hear noises in the woods we can&#39;t explain. It sounds like a persons scream but its like a animals growl.  We&#39;ve been by the woods and shined lights in them and saw somethings eyes that reflected red but we couldn&#39;t see the creature. It a closer every time we looked back.  When we shone lights at it it turned its head slowly to where we couldn&#39;t see its eyes anymore.  I believe these events are all related and would appreciate some explanation to what it could be.

I initially thought it was a light from an aircraft but the descent speed was much too quick.  I then thought it was a plane in distress and expected to see it crash.  When the light got a few hundred feet above the treeline it simply disappeared.  It was still way above the horizon and I was travelling towards it so there is no way I could have lost sight of it.<n>

A large white light came directly straight down from the sky appearing to come out of the atmosphere.  At first I leaned forward in the seat as I was watching this out of the windshield of the car while driving, and at first I thought it was just a shooting star.  Then it came to a complete stop for approximately 1/2 second to 1 second changing directions traveling directly South and was out of sight within another second.  The entire event only lasted 3-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also after the event was over I thought about what I observed just a few months ago.  I saw a shooting star no more than 6 months ago driving East on SR373 in Marshall County as well and the size or the brightness had no comparison to what I saw tonight.  The white light was so bright I can only compare it to a spot light but it didn&#39;t have the blinding effect, it was so beautiful.  The size of the white light appeared to be about 100 times larger than the size of a star you would see in the evening sky or a blinking light from a commercial aircraft. I listed the shape as unknown but just like looking at any light or a star it appeared to be sphere shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reported by: Law Enforcement Officer<n>

It was orange and rough in appearance, not like a sharp, well-defined light.  It looked the same color as a sodium-burning street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over to observe.  It traveled in a straight path.  It was not a windy evening.  It made no sound and being at low altitude ( I would estimate 500-1,000 ft.) made no sound.  Flight path was straight.  I&#39;m not quick with the camera/phone like kids are but wanted to observe.  It was heading towar! ds the Smyrna/Mt. Juliet area and I thought it interesting a couple other similar reports earlier in the year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep running over this in my head and can&#39;t figure out what it was and I&#39;m the first to think there is a logical explanation.  The Russian Meteor happened within 12 hours of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was taking many photos due to the strange sky above - I did not see these 3 spheres at the time as my focus was on the Sunset but also the Sun high above, then we witnessed a second Sunset later on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only when I got home did I notice the 3 spheres in a triangle formation.  There seems to be one yellow one in the center, and two orange/red spheres to the side.  These were taken through the windscreen, however they are not on the windscreen as they move position in the sky, these are distant objects.  Please see photos<n>

You could cut a verticle line down the middle to separate the two colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange stayed on the left and red was on the right.  It was so bright that it was hard to look at it for more than a couple seconds at a time.

I did take a video with my blackberry, which I will submit. sorry for the quality and the language in it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GulUCgJ_-A (sorry if this is the wrong place to submit a video, but I don&#39;t see any where else too, only still images. my name is not in the video, only my youtube handle)<n>

Wasn&#39;t flashing, blinking, or anything, just stayed the same color moving in one direction at quite a fast speed.  I live about 30 min south of atlanta airport and i know what the planes look like, this was not a plane....just one dark red light...vantage point was from directly beneath and it moving south, didnt see any other lights with it.

They were all a brilliant white and were traveling east to west at different altitudes.  Their speed seemed to be around twice that of the passenger jets that I see frequently flying east to west or vice versa.  Some of these objects were below the clouds some were in the clouds and some were at very high altitude.  I heard no sound associated with this phenomena.  The sighting lasted approximately 20 to 25 minutes as I counted in excess of 50 objects flying by at different speeds and altitudes.  The objects seemed to pulsate bright white. There were no navigation lights on these objects.  There were also airplanes in the area that were significantly dimmer and flashing colored navigation lights.  On several occasions I saw objects change direction and or stop in-flight to avoid flying aircraft.  In fact I saw two objects change direction at 90° angles instantaneously to avoid aircraft, then continue their Westerly progress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an amateur astronomer most of my life.  Consequently I know an airplane when I see it. These were not airplanes.  I have always been a skeptic of these kinds of phenomena.  I am 55 years old and can honestly say I have never ever seen anything like this in my lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted taking video with my I-phone and photographs with my digital camera (which has a zoom lens).  The video did not turn out, however I do have a couple of photographs with stationary stars in the background and an image of one of the objects as a white streak.  If you request I would be happy to forward these to you.<n>

Two friends and I were walking around talking in another friend&#39;s big open drive way when we saw two UFOs hovering a few hundred feet over the trees in the distance.  The UFOs ascended behind the trees and then only moved horizontal after that.  They both were sphere shaped, pulsating bright lights, and changed colors between orange, red, yellow, and white.  They were almost hard to look at because of how bright they were and they kept getting closer.  Neither of them made a sound even as they started getting closer and closer. They got so close they  were in the neighbors yard and then not that far from being directly over us so we darted inside fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

I didn’t notice it at first, but all of a sudden I saw a very large red/orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe it was Mars, since I somewhat remember being able to see a faint red glow of a planet in Los Angeles – where I am from.  But I started thinking that it was too big to be a planet. My friend and I didn’t know what to make of it and both tried to take a photo – which didn’t work because all we had were our phones.   Then the bright star looking thing starting moving across the sky at a controlled speed that was fast, but not super fast, and pulsing slightly – so slightly I could barely tell it was even happening.  After about 15 seconds it stopped moving and began to fade until it was gone and I was back where I started admiring the sky.  My friend and I were at separate functions before this, we do not do drugs, we come from complete different backgrounds (SoCal and Massachusetts) and we saw the exact same thing.<n>

Light intensity was very deep orange, significantly larger than the warning lights on the cell phones towers about the same distance away.  After one minute, an additional orange light rose from the north east with about 1 km distance from the triangle object.  The light was slightly larger than the lights on the triangle.  It followed the triangle at the same speed.  The path was not straight and looked like it flowed as if it could have been a baloon.  However after rising first about 2 km over the hill, it looked as though it sank altitude 500 meters for a final altitude above 1 km.  It then proceeded to follow the triangle south east until both were out of sight.  There was absolu! te silence outside.  The weather was light snowy with moderate cloud thickness.

I thought it was an airplane but it was too loud to be that.  The sound was shaking my window and pictures on my walls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled up my blinds and there was an elongated kind of trapezoid looking shape with multiple bright yellowish lights and big flashing red lights at the end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;d seen before so I came here and read the last report for SC, it also mentioned what seems like a good description of what I saw, &#34;Reddish flashing lights on the side or rear of the bright yellowish lights.&#34;.<n>

I immediately became aware of 3 orange lights moving fast from northwest to east as they appeared from behind the roof of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I say  i saw 1 to 3 craft in the form above, but i believe it was one craft shaped like a triangle, with 3 orange lights, one light on each tip.  It could have been three craft in triangle formation, i just do not know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were orange, moving  much faster than an airplane, about as wide apart as my first three fingers held at arm&#39;s distance.  We live in the flight path for newark airport and see all kinds of planes fly over with and without landing lights on, sometimes we see the landing lights go off or come on.  we are close enough to the airport to see the planes drop or raise their landing gear.  When they pass over, they are 4 minutes from landing at newark.  This was not an airplane.  It made no sound, was lower than 1,000 feet, and moved faster than any airplane i ever saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were orange and in a triangle formation. The odd thing was, one point of the triangle was pointing away from the direction of flight (you would think one point only would lead---like a formation of geese, but no), the two other lights were abreast of each other and leading , like a triangle flying backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were not firey, they were like a lit up bulb. No flickering, no drifting like balloons or lanterns.  These lights moved together as if attached,  and maintained their direction and speed.  It was around 10:20 pm, on february 11th, 2013.  it was too late for them to be satellites, they remained bright till they got too far away into the eastern horizon and tree line. They faded from view due to distance.  I could not tell if there was a structure attached to the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cold (30 degrees) and very breezy.  the sky had intermitant clouds and became very  cloudy after the event.  These lights appeared in a swath of clear, dark blue sky.  The stars were clearly visible during the pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites, these were not satellites.  The wind was blowing from northeast to west, the lights moved from northwest to due east.  They took approximately 20 to 30 seconds to cross my view and be gone, if that long.  My wife looks all the time to see if there is anything strange in the sky.  I thought she was crazy until tonight.  I do not believe they were chinese lanterns, or anything commonly mistaken for a true ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited and watched for another half an hour, but did not see the lights again.  Other planes flew over and by, but they were regular craft, and not in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nuforc has my permission to contact me, but it is not neccessary as far as i am concerned.<n>

As I recall, it was around 2200 and the moon was nearly full and there was some sporadic cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front of my home faces east and it is located about twenty five miles west of the Atlantic ocean and about eighty miles north of Cape Canaveral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I gazed up at the moon, I observed a dark, elliptical shaped object silently pass in front of the moon, almost blotting it out, and then disappear in the cloud cover.  I was able to view the object for approximately two seconds, as it crossed south to north.  It was hard to gauge its size, but the impression I was left with was that the object was very large; it was oval shaped in the middle, but the ends were blunt, or square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly dismissed the object as being an aircraft because it had no wings or navigation lights.  The object was completely blacked out.  It was several days before I mentioned the sighting to my wife, who met my revelation with a very perplexed expression.  We’ve been married for twenty three years and she served twenty of my twenty one years in the Marine Corps married to me, not to mention the past seven years that I have been a police officer, and my wife knows I am not easily impressionable, prone to exaggeration, or likely to joke about such things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally I have caught glimpses of shuttle launches from my front yard, but I truly cannot explain what it was that I saw that night in February.<n>

Although the sighting was unusual, it did not trigger much anxiety until the same object was spotted circling around the same area three days after the first sighting.  The reappearance of the object left people and authorities little worried.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting of the object has been reported to the government as there was a report earlier that oil refineries including the one in Jamnagar are under threat from Lashkar-e-Toiba.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;On 24 January, 2013, around 8.30 pm, one unidentified bright object, perceived to be of the size of a volleyball, was seen hovering over the refinery.  It was seen to circle four times before disappearing,&#34; RIL executive director P M S Prasad wrote to Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily, reported The Indian Express.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It could have been treated as a one-off occurrence, however the morning of 27 January again witnessed the same phenomenon between 6.30 and 7.00 am. Process cameras installed in the refinery caught some images.&#34;  The refinery has managed to capture the images of the object in the second time.  Prasad has also asked Moily to take this matter further to the defense and home ministries. He wrote, &#34;Local forces and capabilities are ill-equipped to deal with high-technology air-borne assaults, should anyone try and attempt them.&#34;  According to the police, a complaint has been filed and the security officials are on high alert.  &#34;Immediately after a complaint was lodged by the refinery at Meghpar police station, army and air force officials visited the spot along with us.  There are various theories going the rounds, but we are on high alert.  There were even reports of finding some unidentified particles and batteries near a cement factory, 150-km away from here,&#34;  The Business Standard quoted a police officer as saying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photos and footage have been sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) for further observation.  Security has been beefed up at the refinery and nearby places after the sighting was reported<n>

My husband looked out of our large bay window (from the second story of our house) and noticed 2 solid orange/red round lights coming over the trees from across the street (from the East).  They were spaced apart and flying evenly spaced.  We all looked out the window and noticed another set of 2 lights coming behind the other 2, spaced evenly apart as well. Then we noticed another set of 2 lights, also spaced evenly from each other.  There were 3 sets of these lights, 6 altogether, flying slowly and evenly in formation in a Northwest direction.  We ran outside to get a better look and to determine if they were planes or helicopters, but there was no sound coming from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Intrigued, I called our next door neighbors (who are our relatives) to look out of their front door to see the lights.  By the time they got there they saw the last set of 2 lights.  They didn’t hear any sound either and couldn’t figure out what it could be.  We have a military airstrip not far away and frequently see military planes practice over our houses on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but we all determined these were definitely not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were orange/red in color and were round in shape.  I thought I saw a small blinking light in them, but it was very tiny in comparison to the solid orange color.  They moved slowly and evenly and seemed to eventually disappear as they were flying north.  My son described the lights as flames coming off the back of missiles, but I thought they were more consistent in shape than a flame would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came back inside and a few minutes later a single orange/red light started coming from the direction the others had come from. It was not spaced out evenly behind the others; it was farther behind the rest.  But it moved slowly following the same path the others did.  It eventually disappeared in the sky as well.  We tried to get a video but couldn’t pick it up in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to check online the next day to see if there were any reports on the news and if anyone had seen these strange lights in the area.  I was shocked to find your website and to see that others had seen these at different times and places and am convinced they are the same things that others have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I first saw the objects at approximately 6:25pm.  They were very bright and seemed bigger than any airplane, helicopter or other aircraft.  They were several miles from me and were definitely flying over an area in Sacramento County.  They could have possibly been flying over Citrus Heights, California, Fair Oaks, California or even Rancho Cordova, California, depending on their distance from my home.  The objects were very bright and were mostly yellow-colored, but they occasionally changed to a green color, and even red.  They move in all directions and change direction quickly.  They appeared to stay relatively low to the ground, but they would sometimes fly higher up in the sky. F rom my window, I saw two other people on my street who were outside witnessing these two objects flying in the sky.  They wer! e capturing video footage of the objects on a cell phone, smartphone, or a similar device.<n>

They were headed toward ATL Int&#39;l airport right into the flight pattern, but lower than the usual airliner, and so I thought they were probably a group of military C-130s.  Problem is, they made absolutely NO sound and traveled at an estimated speed of 400-500mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Air Force aircraft mechanic and aviation enthusiast, and know all forms of man made aircraft very well.  Either what I saw was classified military aircraft, or something otherworldly.  And so far my attempts to contact anyone at ATL&#39;s ATC for information, has failed.  They keep giving me more phone numbers to call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only checked NUFORC&#39;s site because after I told my brother about the event, he recommended I take a look at the similar reports.  I was shocked to find so many, and am now convinced I saw something unidentified.<n>

2/8/13 22:20|Edmonds|WA|Other|10 minutes|Feb 8, 2013 - Large orange shimmering object seen in Edmonds, WA.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96254.html|205|ndxe201302| Feb 8, 2013 - Large orange shimmering object seen in Edmonds, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home (around 10:20PM) and heading north when as I was approaching the driveway, I saw a large glowing yellow/orange shimmering object that resembled the look of the shell gas station logo.  I pulled halfway into our driveway but had to stop because the glowing object was so large that it startled me.  I thought maybe they had a big promotion using some sort of light to shoot their image straight up into the air, because it was not moving and it was stationary just over my neighbors house.  However, I could not see any lights underneath or around it and there were no letters or symbols.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stepped out of the car, I realized that the object was not a sign, airplane or anything I have ever seen before. I reached for my cell phone to call my husband to come out of the house and see what I was looking at.  However, before he could run downstairs the object started moving slowly away (to the East) as if it noticed that I was watching it.  It began to become smaller and smaller as it slowly moved east from our area.  We both video taped it on our cell phones when it was leaving as it elevated into the sky.  As it gained altitude, it was noticable that the speed was increasing before it disappeared, even as it was moving away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called the news station to report it, but they told us they were getting ready to go on air and hung up.  I managed to get a pretty good video of the color.  It is difficult to describe the experience because it is not something that I have seen before.  Looking at our cell phones, it lasted for no more than 10 minutes.  Did anyone else see this same sighting?   Description:   It looked like the shape of the Shell logo (a triangle with a circle on top) but it was more orange/red on the inside and yellow on the outside.  From my view point (my drive way to above my neighbors home), the object appeared very large, approximately the size of an actual shell gas station sign up in the air and in the shape of an upside down pear diamond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not blinking, it was like watching a shimmering fire but there was no sound and it only shimmered around the outside.  There was more of a shimmer effect from the bottom portion of the object, but the object appeared as a perfect clean shape and not blurry.  So beautiful that I felt mezmerized and immediately had goose bumps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have 3 videos (2 are taken at the same time from 2 cell phones) and 1 photo (camera was shakey).<n>

And then I noticed these lights, as bright and slightly larger than the stars, the color of a lit match- something between red and yellowor, like a hot orange.  There were 5 or 6 of them moving steadily from right to left in an elongated V formaton at a moderately steady pace.  The one furthest to the right was highest with the next one slightly lower, the next lower still, the next dropping much lower, the next much higher and the last higher still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren’t blinking or alternating color like lights from a plane, neither was there any noise like helicopters make.  I followed them as they moved across the sky until they were blocked by large tree, so I went out into the street to follow them and noticed two or three of them were gone.  I watched the ones remaining as they continued their path across the sky and noticed that one by one, from the right to the left, they were becoming fainter, losing color until they disappeared.  And then they were gone..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was truly the strangest thing I’ve ever seen and have no idea what they were.  I’m not one for conspiracy theories and figure there’s an explaination other than extraterrestial, but I’m totally at a loss for what it is.  When I did a search online, I was shocked to find so many hits of similar sittings over the last year and from many locations across the country.<n>

At first it was in the shape of the Big Dipper (but sideways) I began filming.  A couple minutes later, they slowly started ascending upwards into space.  Flickering slowly.  Then they eventually created a Small Triangular shape.  One light was slowly hovering near another one as if to &#34;encourage&#34; it to move.  It floated around the other light until they all slowly ascended upwards and disappeared. At the time I was facing North /Northeast.  I was located near the entrance of Greene isle park and was looking towards Bellevue street.

Object then began 2 climb and as it climbed I could see other aircraft beneath it in the distance.  I watched it till it disappeared.  It was so bright I could see it out a very long way and guess it was visible for at least ten minutes.

I could see some stars, so I moved forward on the balcony to get a better view.  There are a lot of trees on my property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, a strange looking star caught my eye.  It seemed to move around like a bug-- going side to side and up &amp; down, all while moving diagonally upward-- but was shining brilliantly.  I noticed there was a hint of a warm color in it, but could not determine which one.  Red?   Yellowish?  Thinking it might be a satellite, I kept my eyes fixed and saw that it was not just one light, though one was brighter than the rest, there was a line of lights, like matinee lights, lighting from front to back in succession.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt quite dizzy from the sight, as I have never seen anything of the sort before... &amp; let&#39;s just say I am a skeptic on the idea of alien UFOs.  It continued to dart around, making me move about my upstairs deck to catch it through trees, until it was visible in a clearing, unobstructed.  I had doubted what I had seen until this moment, when I felt sickeningly certain of the bizarre lights and even more bizarre movements.  Suddenly, it stopped. I thought my eyes were strained because it became more and more difficult to see.  The light became a pinpoint in the sky, hardly visible, and then disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited around a little, then went back inside to look up sightings, though I believe it was probably too soon.  After a moments searching,  I decided to go back out for another look.  I stood where I had been on the balcony when the lights vanished, and looked around, examining each star I could see in the area.  I feel very hesitant to describe my next experience, as I could just be hyper sensitive due to the mind-blowing phenomena, but I sensed something out of the corner of my eye, very close to me that made me panic, briefly.  I was in the front corner of the balcony, second story, and to that corner of my eye there should have only been air-- it was beyond the railing.  Strangely, I ignored it and my panic, still scrutinizing the patch of night sky, and then I became overly aware of the &#34;thing&#34; next to me.  Turning my head quickly, all I saw was a strange wisp of silver-ish smoke/vapor, but only faintly. It scared me half to death and I ran inside, after which I fo! und this website, knowing that I could probably never tell this story without people&#39;s skepticism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do wish I could know what I just saw, it was incredible and unbelievable.<n>

It was a cloudy night and these objects were below the cloud cover.  There were no stars or planes visible to us. The objects appeared to be hovering and initially were not real close together.  A few seconds later they got very close to each other.  They were round objects that were glowing bright  and looked like they were on fire.  They parted, one going west into the clouds and the other going north very quickly then into the clouds.  There did not appear to be any sound.  We were so stunned we did not think of recording the event on our phones.<n>

The craft seemed at least big enough to be a C5 transport ship, but wasn&#39;t moving, or was moving very slowly.  I could see stars around the craft, so it wasn&#39;t a blimp.  Very familiar with the area and the sky around here and the lights were very noticeable and different.  I saw nothing when driving in the exact same place and in the same direction 3-4 hours later.<n>

It was 5-8 bright lights all stationary and each brighter than the stars that had just come out.  I couldn&#39;t fathom what it was but I was driving so I kept glancing at it and it just stayed in position.  I first thought it was a meteor breaking up but there was no dimming of the lights or any sign of a trail- just bright stationary lights.  When I pulled over at a brightly lit gas station, I tried to see it but it was no longer there.  Spooked me.

The sky was clear (cloudless) and in the twilight, the lights were significantly brighter than the faint stars behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The row of lights were stationary in the sky and the relative position of one light to the next did not change for the minute I was able to observe it.  Some of the lights appeared brighter than others, but the overall intensity of each light remained the same.  All lights were white and there were between 5 and 7 of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching, the lights simultaneously faded away, but the stars in the background remained visible, so this was not simply due to a passing cloud or fog.  There was no sound.<n>

It was very low to the ground and unmoving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to look at it as I drove, for about 15 seconds total.  It didn&#39;t move at all during that time and was quite bright.

2/5/13 01:30|Santa Fe|NM|Changing|45+ minutes|UFO over Santa Fe, NM, possibly disk shaped, stationary, with light rays of various colors emanating from it.  ((Sirius??))|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96204.html|237|ndxe201302| UFO over Santa Fe, NM, possibly disk shaped, stationary, with light rays of various colors emanating from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe it was disk shaped but it was a dark (non-starry) sky, so it was hard to see.  At first I thought it was Venus, but then realized it was too early for Venus.  My bedroom window faces west.  I turned off the bedroom lights and watched it some more, thinking it was an aircraft, but it didn&#39;t move closer or further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So next, I assumed it was a helicopter, since it was over the general area of the 599 road/Old Agua Fria Village, but it remained fairly high, 1/4 mile up (estimate).   As I watched it, it seemed to be shooting out lights, to the side, downward at angles, and to the sides at slight angles.  Periodically it glowed across the top (giving a disk-shaped appearance).  The lights were white and also bright-colored, and shot like rays, rapidly, and not far out from the craft.  I watched it for about 45 minutes.  I thought of taking pictures, but then figured no one would believe me, plus my cell phone probably couldn&#39;t capture the image in the! dark sky anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am partially handicapped too, otherwise I would have gone outside to try and photograph it.  But I live alone, and that would have been dangerous for me.  My dog was here, and she remained asleep on the couch the whole time.  Finally I just thought, &#34;Well, if I&#39;m seeing it, someone else probably is too,&#34; so I threw the covers over my head and went to sleep.  I woke up later (3:30 a.m.) and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up, went to the bathroom and kitchen, where I could see the moon low on the horizon, in the south-east sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning I checked the news but didn&#39;t see any reports, so I figured I&#39;d leave one here.  I am 54 years old, female, and not prone to hallucinations.  I usually discount UFO reports.  All of which is to say, I saw something strange enough that I am reporting it here.<n>

I would have chalked it up to two helicopters but these two objects had connected and were very still with no noise.

I then saw another object moving toward the UFO.  I thought it was a plane that might hit it but it stopped and hovered next to UFO.  It was a lot smaller then other one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off the next exit so I could go back to exit 6.  When I got back to that area the larger UFO was still there!  I went back again but it was then gone.  It was large and definitely in the shape of a diamond.  It hovered for several seconds!<n>

At the intersection of North Davidson and 11th street, near the onramp to 277 we observed an object hovering stationary in the sky toward the East/South, roughly over the Eastern side of Plaza- Midwood area, could be directly over Central and Hawthorne. It was on a Monday morning at around 8:55 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon entering 277, we watched the object stay stationary and kept it in visual range until the beltway passed the exit for 4th and 3rd street, roughly 2 minutes.  During that time the object did not change position.  It struck us as odd because it was not behaving like an airplane or bird, and was too low in the sky for an airplane other than for an approach to landing or takeoff.  It was in the right location for a large bird, but it was not flapping any wings or gliding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The oddest part was the shape, which is difficult to describe but I will do my best:  It was kind of a lopsided &#34;kidney bean&#34; shape, vertically oriented and proportioned so that the upper half was slightly larger than the other, rounded, and slightly curved or -c shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far away to make out any discernible details, but it appeared to have a surface texture or facets, and did not appear smooth and shiny. After we were out of visual range, and I was dropped off at work, my counterpart returned to the area about 10 minutes later, but the object was missing.<n>

I think to myself this is probably mars.  Mars behind some thin clouds as it also had a red glow I was assuming from shining through clouds.  It seemed too big to me to be Mars but I was still going with that notion until it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some background about me. I am an avid aviation person. I have my own aviation website. I am a student pilot and have soloed.  I have served in the Air Force and have 20/25 vision.  Better than average. I can tell you what an aircraft is from a distance of miles and my head always turns to the sky when I see something (anything) flying.  I keep a pair of binoculars in the car and pull over when I see something I want to check out further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This night when I headed out the driveway I stopped when I saw the red light. I got out of the car with my binoculars and began watching. As I am watching the object faded out as if it went further into a cloud and just got swallowed up.  I have seen that with aircraft before.  As I took my binoculars from my eyes I instantly saw out of my peripheral the same object or one like it. This time it was east about 100 degrees.  This time it seemed closer and had the same red center and red glow but this time it had a short searchlight about 35 degrees wide.  Again I thought it’s in clouds and the searchlight must be hitting the outer edges thus stopping and not going to infinity.  The searchlight was panning up and down and in every direction and seemed to me at least from my vantage point to be on a single plain, as in it wasn’t round it was a flattened light.  During this time the object/craft is moving a short distance in its general area.  Not hovering but not really covering any g! round just staying in a relative position in the sky.  I realized then that there was not a cloud in the sky.  None just clear sky and stars…<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided I needed a witness so I was going to call my friend and get him to look outside.  Instead I decided even if I got him on the phone he may not get out of wherever he was as see it in time so I decided to take my phone and take pictures instead…  I got 4 good pictures at full zoom… With each picture I am watching the craft in between shots as what I see in the view finder is a speck compared to what I actually see with my eye.  After the fourth Picture I pulled the camera/phone away from my face and see it is shooting down towards the ground it seems slow and takes about 10 seconds but the distance it went was a good distance across the sky so I know it was much faster than it seemed.  An aircraft such as a Cessna could not cover that much ground that fast, and also do the slow hovering it had been doing…  The craft shot to the ground and left a trail or light path of dashed lines to the ground I looked at the pictures after it was too low to the ground and had passed behind trees and houses.  I did not realize I caught this on camera.  I at first thought image 4 was a blur because I moved the camera.  Upon examination and thinking about it. I had captured the first part of the shooting towards the ground.  I realized this because there were 2 objects in the picture.  One blurred and one not blurred.  If I had moved the camera then both objects would have blurred. There is definite shape to the second object and with enhancement it becomes much clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 3 images the craft were centered and the pictures came out with one image containing 2 craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw one craft with my eyes but 2 are visible in the pictures. What I saw with my eye and what the eye of the camera saw were different. My eye sees subtle things like a glow while the camera picks up things fainter than I can see. Together they paint a picture of a craft I do not have knowledge of and cannot explain.<n>

It comes out of the east over looking lookout mountain and tracks north movement is slow but deliberate.  I just want to know what it is star satellite or whatever.  It usually pulsates red and blue colors but it changes frequency and color through different times of the night.  Sometimes blue and purple sometimes green.  But it is easier to see than all the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A seperate sighting of a completely different kind occured last December around 3 a.m..  I was duck hunting on the tennesse river near Stevenson, AL, roughly 50 miles northwest of fort payne.  I saw a gold light to the east moving very erraticly it even appeared to be dancing at times.  The sighting lasted around 30 minutes before descending out of sight behind the mountains<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD))<n>

We both agree that this is an extremely accurate representation. The two smaller stars travel with the orange star from slightly behind and on each side. No sound, medium altitude, no flashing lights, clear night.  We saw this go from horizon to horizon at above-average airplane speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The picture I made was as viewed from the front as it approached.  When it got over us the orange light seemed to have been attached to the front of the vehicle, shining forward, which would have become less visible as the front pointed more and more away from us.  It had two small, dim, orange lights on the bottom of it, (not pictured).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this is not an actual photograph of what we saw, but it is an extremely accurate representation we made.<n>

The light did not blink and seemed unusually bright for an aircraft.  It moved smoothly north at first, but later changed direction and headed south and down towards the ocean in the middle of the Monterey Bay.  Before disappearing below the tree line, it shot what looked like a line of about 10 flares UPWARD in a rapid fire manner that only took about five seconds.  The flares didn&#39;t fall, but seemed to float in place for about 10 or 15 seconds then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this was a helicopter, because I heard the sound of a helicopter nearby, but soon it became apparent that there was indeed a helicopter moving north, but it continued north even after the orange light changed direction.  There was no discernible sound coming from the orange light nor its fl! ares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a constant stream of planes flying north over Santa Cruz day and night, but this light seemed to be much lower than the usual planes, and I could see a plane fly above it at what I guess to be about 5000 feet - I think the light was at about 2000 feet before it moved downward towards the ocean.  It seems likely that other craft in the sky would have seen it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried driving down the street to a better vantage point to see where it went, but I saw nothing.<n>

I was the only person to see the object, as I voiced it as I saw it fly south, as I was driving east (used google maps to see which direction we were facing.)  It zipped fast through the sky as I noticed it. Something alerted me to look ahead.  I was traveling fast, but slow enough for me to see it.  It was a very flat shaped object with bright, flashing lights located on the side of the vehicle.  The flashes were what I noticed, and it got my attention.  I think I saw a red, or pinkish light in some place too.  The area surrounding Savanne Road is nothing but swamp area.  I even saw on Google Maps that the direction the vehicle flew would be swamps for a good, long time, and distance.  The vehicle seems to be the same type as seen with the Chinese airport ufo that shut it down for days, and the saint louis cathedral ufo inside new orleans, la.  It was skinny the same way, slick, and had lights on the side.<n>

As i drove farther down the street i noticed that they were moving slowly through the sky.  I called him back and said lets pull over i want to record this.  We pulled over in a church parking lot you could see airplanes all around the orange lights with their green and red flashing lights so we new it wasnt an airpalne.  As we got out of the vehicals all of the lights started to vanish.  Stunned in amazement we were walking back to the cars trying to figure out what we just witnessed when another car pulled up rolled the windows down and said please tell me you guys saw that we explained what we saw and it matched what they saw.

2/2/13 20:30|Dallas|TX|Light|20-25 seconds|Orange-Red Flying Object Vanishes In Mid-Air Over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96179.html|264|ndxe201302| Orange-Red Flying Object Vanishes In Mid-Air Over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 2, 2012 at approximately 2030 hours over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas, there appeared in the dark, evening sky an unusual orange-red light, or composite light.  The temperature was 55 degrees.  There were no clouds over this area of Dallas, and the stars were clearly bright and visual in the background.  There was virtually no light pollution over White Rock Lake this evening and the lake was still and dark.  White Rock Lake Park was mostly deserted in this area, however there were several other people walking along edge of the lake.  Apparently they did not notice the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving with my wife and south on West Lawther Drive on the West side of White Rock Lake.  White Rock Lake is rimmed with large residential estates on the West side of the park, all facing East and overlooking the lake.  West Lawther Drive winds around the perimeter of White Rock Lake Park on the West side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange red light was moving from the East to the SouthEast across the 65 degree horizon and in the general flight path approach for Southwest Airlines into Love Field Airport to the West of White Rock Lake.  There were other airplanes in the approach for Love Field Airport in the general vicinity over White Rock Lake.  The orange-red moving light was noticeable and unusual because there were no strobe lights or white lights as are common with commercial or private aircraft.  The orange-red light appeared in the sky at a 65 degree angle from the road and the light source was the approximate size of the commercial aircraft in the area.  The orange-red light was not moving rapidly, or erratically, but rather deliberately on a particular path and at a speed in common with the other aircraft in the vicinity. The orange-red flying object was not a star, planet or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing this object move through the sky and over White Rock Lake for approximately twenty seconds, the object faded and vanished in mid-air over the lake.  Upon closer observation, the orange-red light appeared to have a composite light source of multiple lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given that this area of Dallas is restricted airspace and in the approach path for Love Field Airport, it was highly unusual for any flying craft to have no strobe, and to have turned off its lights and or disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disappearance of the orange-red flying craft was not immediate, and it appeared to have diminished in size before vanishing, leaving one with the impression that the source of the light gained altitude at an unusually rapid speed and not on a trajectory common with traditional airplanes.  This process took less than several seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was scanned for several minutes in an effort to locate the object, however this was unsuccessful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a graduate of the University of Virginia and Southern Methodist University and have experience piloting private aircraft.  I am familiar with the appearance of aircraft making an approach to Love Field Airport in this vicinity, and of the identifying lights required of aircraft, and can attest that this object was not a commercial, private or conventional military aircraft.  Furthermore, I have observed meteors, comets and other natural celestial phenomena and this object was neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for the reply.  This was a very strange experience.  I intend to contact a few Southwest Airline pilots to ask around if any of their colleagues saw the same on their approach tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

It didn&#39;t dart around.  It stayed in a straight, steady line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my girlfriend saw it, she said it looked like the object was on fire because of the way it was glowing.   We watched it for a couple of minutes until it went out of sight.  (The hillside in front of the house, which is the side of Rt. 50, obstructed our view.)   It was so weird, yet exciting!

I wanted to add a bit more detail, I also sent an e-mail to director@ufocenter.com with a short video I recorded, but I just found another e-mail at the bottom of this page I&#39;m going to also send it to:<n> <n><n> <n><n> was informed to give more information, and I hope this is a better report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent an e-mail to the Lake Zurich Patch – not sure if I’ll get much there – I haven’t a clue to who to contact at the FAA, so I wish I could be a of more help on that front.  I don’t frequent this site or know the procedures very well.  My hope is others may also report the same thing or a similar occurrence in the area.  I mean there were A LOT of these orbs/lights up there and unless I just happened to be in the exact right place at the right time and nobody else was, I find it hard to believe nobody else saw these odd things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also shot a brief video I’ll enclose for your viewing.  I’m afraid it didn’t come out very well, but you’ll at least get the color and the jist of what I saw.  I wish I could have filmed it in a way that showed them moving, my apologies!  Here’s my &#39;more in depth&#39; report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 6:15 (18:15)  Facing directly North I witnessed a mass of at least 12 orange/red orbs of lights moving, one after the other, sometimes in almost equal distances from each other, left to right across the sky into the overcast sky.  I gather this would mean they were headed in a southeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it’s important to note they seemed to hold a line formation, or follow each other in sometimes equal distances from each other as I mentioned.  But they did not adhere to this formation strictly.  For example, one of the orbs/lights seemed to speed up (or accelerate) to one of its neighboring orbs playfully.  It passed it and then slowed down to match the speed of the orb it passed.   None of the objects stopped completely, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost contact with them as they travelled into the overcast sky to the east.  I don’t know if that gives an approximate altitude, but they were certainly above the clouds!  They were also moving faster than any plane or vehicle ! I’ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their light was quite beautiful, in subjective words, almost like looking at flickering stars.  I was told they may be balloons of some kind, but I think the best objective evidence or observation going against this is the fact at least one of the orbs clearly maneuvered and accelerated.  (My point of reference was the orb it accelerated to.)  If there&#39;s anything else I can do let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I&#39;m not really sure who to contact at the FAA, etc.  I don&#39;t think we even have a phone book lying around!  If you guys could help me out with this I&#39;d appreciate it.  Thanks. :)<n>

After getting done eating and setting up our sleeping arraignments we were looking at the stars in what was a partly cloudy ski.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden a white light flash through the clouds from the Southwest to the Northeast going out to sea. The light seemed to dance through the clouds lighting them up from the inside out.  It lasted just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a few seconds after that a green beam of light flashed by coming and going in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it before and suspected it could be some type of laser range finding gear being used to calibrate the telescopes at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex....<n>
2/1/13 23:00|Grand Junction|CO|Cone|10-15 minutes|Cone object with Red and Green lights found near Grand Junction desert.|2/18/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96196.html|274|ndxe201302| Cone object with Red and Green lights found near Grand Junction desert<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening (11 pm) of 2/1/2013 in the vicinity of D1/2 road &amp; 32 road in Clifton I was parked stationary for about 10 minutes while waiting for my son to come out from a friends home.  I was looking at the stars as it was a clear night.  While gazing upward a red flashing light caught my attention and I started looking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first thought it was an airplane but as I continued to look at it, the light continued to flash red but didn&#39;t move along the horizon as a plane would.  Then it disappeared from that spot and literally jumped to another spot.  Still flashing red light but now I&#39;m seeing sporadically flashed of green below the red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it jumped to various potions in the sky around the same vicinity that I originally viewed the light. I was very interested in what this was, but my son had come out to the car by then and we went along our way but I did share with him what I&#39;d just seen minute earlier.  From D 1/2 road and 32 road we! headed to I-70 to get to our hotel on I-70 headed west to Horizon Drive in Grand Junction.  As we approached the Horizon Drive exit, my son says,  &#34;Mom, there it is,&#34; and points directly to the driver&#39;s side window or to the south side of I-70 headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I looked to see a very large cone shape with rotating red lights at the top of the cone and green strobing lights underneath that were blinking and and circulating as well as moving up and down as like a spring coiling and recoiling.  The object seemed huge to me, the cone being as big as maybe a 15-20 story building.  There was also some sort of mist or cloud around the outer edges of the cone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to continue looking at this but I had to direct my attention back to the road as we immediately exited the interstate and parked as fast as possible, but once we had gotten out of the car, the object was gone.  I have never encountered anything like this but my son had been telling me for about four years that he and two of his friends had seen this before but not experiencing it myself, I couldn&#39;t wrap my head around it until now.  I&#39;m still rewinding my memory to try and visualize it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We continued to watch and counted 5 lights all flying on the same path the same distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to go back to our car to get our phones so we could record what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We began recording and we saw 5 more orange lights flying the same speed same distance away, for a total of 10 lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I began to get scared and decided to leave the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were orange with a pulsing glow; the entire time we saw these objects we heard no sounds.<n>

Watched for it but it did not show up again.<n>

It was in Orion, so my first thought was that I was seeing either Mars or Betelgeuse, then I realized it was too bright for either one.  It then faded away.  I noticed several other red lights in the sky following the same path.  I watched for a moment, thinking that they might be airplanes, until I saw an actual airplane fly by, between me and the lights.  These lights seemed to form a wide arc across the sky, then one by one they faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the arc of lights faded, I noticed several lights that, from my vantage point, seemed to start near the south-south-east horizon (at least under the tree-line), rise up about 10 degrees in a straight line, then fade away.  I saw about five follow this pattern, before the cold and my dogs forced me back indoors. I was out for about 15 minutes.  I tried to see if I could see the lights from my window, but my view of where they were coming from was blocked by other buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if they were flares, but they traveled in straight lines, not an arc like something shot.  They also didn&#39;t flare, they stayed the same brightness until they faded away.  I also didn&#39;t hear any noises that made me think that they might be flares or fireworks.<n>

I thought it was my eyes so I looked at another star.  It was normally coloured.  I pointed it out to my mom and she seen the exact same thing.  When we got close to our city, I could see a faint gray manta ray-like shape even with a short tail.   All the while the light was flashing. I could see that it was zig-zagging and moving about our speed(100 km).  I tried to look at it with my telescope, but it wouldn&#39;t focus.  I have seen another like this with flashing lights but in a triangle shape about 1 year ago.  Was this just my eyes, or is it real?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As The Garage Door Completed Raised I Looked Up And Saw These Bright Yellowish Lights In The Sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At First I Thought It Was A Plane But Immediately Knew That It Was Strange.  The Lights Were Very Bright, Yellowish, Almost Like Very Large Headlights Very Close Together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I Watched The Bright Lights, Waiting For It To Move It Appeared To Be Hovering.  I Kept Saying To Myself “This Is Strange.”   I Also Saw Reddish Flashing Lights On The Side Or Rear Of The Bright Yellowish Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Am Still Thinking It Is A Plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Then Dismissed It And Left For The Gym But As I Got On To The Main Road I Saw A Plane Flying Across The Sky And Said “Ok, I Know This Is Not What I Saw Earlier.”   Still Not Thinking Any More About It.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later That Evening I Saw An Article In The Local Newspaper About UFO Sightings In SC.  Then I Was Telling A Close Associate Of Mine About What I Saw And As I Was Describing What I Saw I Realize It Was A UFO And That Airplanes Do Not Have Large Bright Yellowish Headlights Like What I Saw That Morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I Became Excited And Frustrated Because I Had An Opportunity To Get A Picture Had I Been Awake Enough To Realize What I Was Looking At.<n>
