It was at night, not sure of the time. I was in my sleeping bag looking up at the sky. A formation flew over. It was really high and going very fast. I didn&#39;t think at that time we had any thing that could fly that high or that fast. It was not shooting stars. I had seen them a lot and knew the difference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Technical performance|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07716.html|3|ndxe195007| As a student of astronomy, this writer witnessed ufo&#39;s performing astounding aerial maneuvers. Silent propulsion. Technical performance could NOT be duplicated by anything flying today. Also witnessed by two adult relatives. Clear, cloudless skies. No obstructions. No reflections. Not birds. Not insects. Glowing &#34;metallic&#34; discs or spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working with star maps in by own backyard, in the summer of 1950, when I was 9 years old, I noticed a glowing object approaching at moderate speed, high altitude, from the west. It got my attention because it was completely silent. As I watched, the object (a warm colored sphere or disc seen from the bottom) was about to cross my zenith when it came to a complete and abrupt stop. There was no time between when it was moving and when it stopped. As there was no sound, I knew I wasn&#39;t seeing high altitude helicopters. And there were no silent &#39;copters back then! I was exteremely mistified as to what I was seeing. I would estimate the altitude to be anywhere from 15 to 30,000 feet. As I watched, another object of the same exact size and colr approached the first, coming from the east, at exactly 180 degrees. When the second object reached my zenith, it too came to a complete and abrupt stop. Both objects hung there in complete silence for moments. I would estimate that the distance between them was approximately twenty diameters (twenty craft diameters). I have no way of estimating the craft dimensions as there was no reference whatsoever for comparison. I can only use my sixth sense. As I continued to watch, the two objects began traveling in a small, tight circle, orbiting one another. First slowly, but quickly accelerating. I was alarmed and called for my parents. My father and my grandmother came out. I pointed the objects out. They had no idea what they were seeing. By this time, the objects were moving so fast that they appeared as a hard-edged glowing ring in the sky! We watched with our jaws dropping. Moments later, the two objects slowed and came to a stop again, hovering in the same place they started. Moments later, one object moved off to the west, and the other to the east. They disappeared into the horizon. Neither made a sound. They flew in mechanically straight lines, not wavering or drifting, but with absolute perfection one could &#34;feel.&#34; The incident lasted several minutes. We checked the news reports for days afterward but never saw anything. Many yaers later, in a publication similar to Project Blue Book, I came across a reference to a similar sighting by two brothers in Ohio. They described the spinning/orbitting objects as looking like &#34;Two bright dots on the edge of a spinning record. But what I saw was spinning not at 33 or 45 or even 78 rpm - more like 400 rpm. These were not insects or birds. This was not a meteorological phenomenon. As a young student of astronomy I knew the difference between a celestial object and a manufactured object. I was aware of news reports of &#34;flying saucers&#34; in those days, but had never heard of Roswell, though this was a mere few years later. I consider myself to be a rational, scientifically-minded individual, perhaps even more so as a child.<n>

Looking north towards the Youngstown area we noticed 2 lights flitting in and out of a large thunderstorm.

My friend and I were waiting for the tide to go out, in order to wade in the shallow water along Beach Blvd at Washington St and entered at approximately 9:00 PM and waded toward the downtown area, each with a Coleman gas lantern and spear, looking for flounders and soft crabs.  The sky was crystal clear.  I was 14 years of age and my friend was 17.  Looking up into the sky above Beach Blvd was West, slightly North.  I was an astronomy buff, and looked up immediately into the unusually clear night; there were only a few streetlights contributing to light pollution every few blocks,  Beach Blvd was much higher than the shoreline in places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately noticed that there was an extra &#34;star&#34; in the constellation Pleiades, slightly brighter than its very dim stars.  As we walked back and forth between the sand bars, going steadily toward town, past it,  and then back to Washington St., this extra star got brighter and brighter, gradually becoming a 4th, 3rd, 2nd, then 1st, 0+ magnitude &#34;star&#34;. On our return to Washington Street, we stopped at the railroad bridge, at approximately 2:00 AM (I looked at my watch repeatedly) July 3rd and this &#34;star&#34; was then as bright as a 200 watt light bulb. 200 W bulbs existed then, and I was often in a building owned by my family that used them.  It then began dripping what appeared to be a silvery liquid metal, like a foundry pouring molten lead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;star&#34; took off over Henderson Point i e to the NorthEast, at extremely high speed, completely silent, leaving 2 red-orange glowing trails in the sky , which remained visible for over 30 minutes.  I estimate the speed at thousands of miles per hour.  I have no idea of the altitude, as I thought initially thought it a star, but it was obviously in the atmosphere.  I never felt fear of any kind, although my companion was very scared.  There was no missing time or any strange after effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the the length of this event, I remember it vividly, over 50 years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

7/2/50 13:00|Coeur d'Alene|ID|Cigar|10 seconds|Bright Orange, Cigar-Shapped Object Travelling at 18,000 MPH|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65062.html|6|ndxe195007| Bright Orange, Cigar-Shapped Object Travelling at 18,000 MPH<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about July 2, 1950, at a family home at Twin Beaches, Coeur dâ€™Alene Lake, Idaho, in the early afternoon, my aunt and uncle and I were sitting on the porch facing East, when over the mountains, across the lake, a brilliant long cigar-shaped object, moving very fast, came into view.  The entire shape was colored bright orange.  We saw this for perhaps five to ten seconds, at which it appeared to turn right, and in so doing, it revealed a circular view, which glowed a bright whitish-yellow, perhaps magnesium flare type disc, and quickly went out of vision.  This was an awesome experience and is as clear in my mind today as it was then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurrence was widely reported in Eastern Washington, all the way to Montana.  The approach of this vehicle was so close, that the occupants of the airport control tower, located at Geiger Field at that time, were concerned for their safety.  The object was, to my recollection, clocked in Montana at 18,000 MPH.  I cannot recall hearing any substantiative follow ups on this event, though I am sure that the U.S. Air Force had nothing that could clock 18,000 MPH.  I was 19 years old at the time of the sighting, and 77 years old at this writing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To follow up, I had The Spokesman-Review, our local newspaper, search their archives from July 1950 to 1952.  Several reports were found, but one, dated July 3, 1950, was right on with my experience, except that this sighting was at night and ours was in the early afternoon.  I cannot tell you if our sighting was before or after the reported evening sighting.  It appears, by virtue of the 12-hour lapse, to have been two separate events.  Incidentally, the distance fro Spokane to Missoula, Montana is such that &#34;only a few seconds later,&#34; (the viewing lag between spotting the UFO in Spokane and Missoula) would be about 14.5 seconds at 20,000 MPH, which is not far off from my recollection of 18,000 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am submitting via email the supporting article from The Spokesman-Review.<n>
