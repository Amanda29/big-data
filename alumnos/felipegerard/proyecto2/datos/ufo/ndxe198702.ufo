I was babysitting for a lady I babysat for regularly.  She lived just out of town off  at that time very rural road called Old Tuscaloosa Hyw.near Bessemer Alabama.  She returned from a date around 1 am and I left her house soon after that for the aprox 45 min drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As was our usual arrangement I promised to call her when I got home to let her know I had made it safely and she could go to bed.  There were very few houses on that stretch of road until it reached the Bessemer city limits and few streetlights.  I can only guess the time as my car had no clock and I did not wear a watch, but I would guess it was between 1:15 and 1:30 am considering the time I had been gone from her house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my window down so I could smoke a cigarette without stinking up my car.  I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine, and soft music from the radio.  I saw a light, like a single headlight coming up behind me in my rearview. It looked like it was about a mile or more behind me.  I glanced down for just a second, looked back in my mirror and was surprised to see the light was almost caught up to me and was coming fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine and was startled because I assumed it was a car or motorbike and I heard no noise.  As it rapidly came up on me I thought I was going to be rear ended, so I turned on to the shoulder of the road and braked hard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know, I seemed to awake, though I do not remember passing out.  My car was switched off with the keys in the ignition.  It seemed like only minutes since I stopped.  There were no lights around and it was still dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments I pulled back on the road and continued home.  As I got into the city of Bessemer, I was surprised to see more cars out and about than there usually were at 1:30 in the morning.  I arrived home and went in.  I picked up the phone and called the lady as I had promised.  She answered on the first ring and when I said I was home she scolded me for not calling sooner.  She said she had been calling me for more than an hour and was just fixing to come looking for me.  At that moment for the first time I looked at the clock. It said 4:20 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A drive that should have taken less than an hour took me almost 3. I still donâ€™t know what happened that night.  But for a long time after that I had trouble sleeping and panic attacks.  I heard you on Coast to Coast saying how important it was to document strange things, so I decided to write you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,<n>

It came back around and hovered over me for 15 minutes and that blasted of into the air. After that it went up high in the air and dissapered.  There were these weird lights that orbited around the rectangular ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/1/87 14:00|Lucas|TX|Other|2 minutes|Car in the clouds.|12/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104902.html|4|ndxe198702| I saw a car in the clouds for about 2 minutes.  It appeared to be a chevrolet caprice about 1980 model or so.  I was attracted to the sighting by the lights of the car turning in my direction and the headlights hit my eyes as if a spotlight was shined in my eyes.  The weather was cloudy with low lying clouds but bright outside.  The sighting was very vivid.  The car appeared as if it were directed at me for about 5 seconds then tilted as if the headlights were pointed just above my head.  It stayed in that position long enough for me to grab the attention of my father and uncle.  They dismissed me very quickly and did not even look up.  I was trying to see if I could tell the make and model of the car when it turned to the right then, turned away from me.  I could tell it was grey in color and had red glowing tail lights as if it were breaking.  It disappeared into the clouds in a translucent manner.  At this time this car was a common car on the road (it was a car I was used to seeing).  The car was at a 45 degree angle away from me upward and seemed no more than 200 yards away.  The distance of the car was much closer that the clouds but, it still appeared to be coming out of the clouds.  I have never told this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me if there is any info on this event or others like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
