I looked again at the polestar en saw two lights circling around it.<n>

Yesterday me and my wife saw something which we could not classify as an ordinary event. About 11.30 PM I came to kitchen to take a coke from refrigirator. The light in the room was of but I did not turn it on because I came only for short time. Since it was dark in the room the  light object suddenly appeared in the window has drawn my attention. It was disk-shaped brightely lightened object flying in the sky. It came out from behind of the tree and crossed the part of the sky visible from our window and disappeared behind the building. Astimating the distance I would say it was about 3-5 miles away from my place so it was located above the Newark or North Newark. The object was heading west or north-west and was moving fast enough. I can not judge the object&#39;s size but can assume it was same or larger than passanger aircraft. It was flying below the clouds. Totally I have observed it  about 10-15 seconds. Once I saw it I called my wife which was just in the next room. She also saw the same object but for less time. We are absolutely sure the object was real. Both of us saw exactly same picture. I don&#39;t know whether this information has any value, but we were so amazed. I just want to share this information with someone who could find it interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your response. Yes, both my wife and I are Russians.  Here, in USA, we are in ((graduate)) training.  Both of us are ((subject deleted--biological science, generally)) and ((credentials deleted)). So, probably you can assume we are serious people and scientists. I would like to assure you there is no joke or kidding in my report. We are absolutely positive in our UFO sighting experience. It was a really solid, material object of distinct disc-like shape, brightly lighted or fluorescent.  It was not light spot, cloud,aircraft or something else. I can be mistaken only about object&#39;s size and distance of it. Of course I was trying to figure out some more realistic explanations of my sighting. My only guess it could be balloon (dirigible) which I saw once (about 3-4 months ago) in Newark vicinity. That time it was white balloon with blue HORIZON inscription on it.  I believe it was advertising balloon. But, on August 31, the object was 11.30 PM and a balloon&#39;s pilot would be crazy to fly such vehicle at night.  And, theobject which we saw was glaring very brightly and moving much faster than a balloon (but I assume slower than aircraft).  About your supposition about Teterboro Airport, I would say that there is Newark International Airport much closer to our location.  Aircraft frequently cross above our home and especially to east from it preparing for landing.  So I am rather familiar with this stuff. But the object which we saw was flying absolutely quietly and didn&#39;t look like aircraft at all. Regarding your question on object&#39;s location, I can say it was moving to west from us (Ibelieve parallel 280 highway, away from NYC, heading Newark orBloomfield). I think it was crossing Passaic river so it was on open territory for some time thus probably it could be seen very well by many people. At the conclusion I can say that it was one of the weirdest things which I&#39;ve ever seen. This is the only reason why I wanted to report this phenomenon.  Regards, ((name deleted)).<n>

The lights change colors red, blue,green, yellow and white.  The lights pulse then disappear.  My camcorder shows a craft that changes shapes.  I have watched these lights for many nights.  They are in the east, south, northeast and southeast from where we live.  Some nights, the lights in the southeast have numbered three in a row and one on either side. The sizes I have seen vary.  One night, Sept. 7, I saw a solid looking one that changed from a lemon looking thing to separate, then separate again, three in all.  All of these craft were different sizes of the same craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that twinkling stars are one possible explanation for the sighting.  PD))<n>

I have been noticing on several occasions in the late evening, flying crafts traveling either due North or due South at high rates of speed.  They seem to appear at approximately the same times, are at high altitudes, have no flashing lights like commercial airlines, and show no contrails.  Could these be satellites or high flying military flights?  I was told that satellites really don&#39;t have high visibility to the naked eye and these are very bright.  Got an idea?  Or are these shuttles to Venus and back - just joking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our guess would be satellites.  PD))<n>

Myself, and two other men were on top of Vulcan Mountain, it was after dark when we arrived.  The night sky was so clear and beautiful, you could see what looked like every star in the sky.  We had set up camp and was just getting settled in.  We had been seeing several sattlites moving across the sky, when suddenly I told my two other buddies tolook at what looked like a sattlite in a extremely high orbit traveling at a high rate of speed.  Suddenly, while we were all watching this object, it started dropping out of the sky, directly at us. I mean it fell,or traveled I should say, down to where it was less than a thousand feet directly over us, suddenly a very bright light was aimed at us and we started to yell that it was going to fall on us as this is what it looked like. It happened so fast that we were shocked.  After the rays of light hit us it suddenly turn and disappeared out of sight, up into a higher orbit.  Nothing I have ever heard of could travel so fast.  I truly believe that this was a visitor from another place, as do also my other friends that witnessed this strange event.  I am looking for others who might have seen anything like this to respond to this message board to share their experiences, as we know what we saw was real--Thanks  ((name deleted))<n>

As I neared Davenport, I was about 10 miles west, I noticed a small silver object at about 8000 ft in the air, that was straight North of Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was going slow, and then in a burst of speed headed straight South and slowed and stopped somewhere over the Davenport area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it slowed, it turned red and had a slight bounce to it. It settled to a stop and continued to glow red.  After several seconds it accelerated and headed back North and within a few seconds it was out of sight, also when it accelerated it turned from red and back into a silver object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This year, 2004, I again went to Chicago for the labor day weekend. I examined the map of the area that I saw this object over and learned that the Rock Island Arsenal is right directly south of Davenport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our so called leaders have assured us that we are in danger of a dirty bomb attack, this could be true, and instead of being made in the Mid-east, it might actually be from the Midwest. I have noticed recently reported  sightings in Kewanee, Atkinson and Prophetstown Illinois. I think that these higher level beings are marking the locations where we might find the people who are working their hardest to bring about a thermonuclear winter as a way of saying thanks to us for giving them our tax money.

These planes are usually travelling in a northerly direction, heading for San Jose airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However the object I watched was travelling extremely fast and made no sound. It moved in an exactly straight line from east to west. To help describe the speed, imagine lying on your back with your feet pointing south, hands pointing out and the sky above is one half of a clock face: your left hand is east and also 12 o&#39;clock; the right hand is west and 6 o&#39;clock. I spotted the object at around 1 o&#39;clock and watched it travel until 5 o&#39;clock in less than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved it was completely silent and left no trails. It appeared to go through brightness changes, as if light was being internally reflected off the inside of a sphere. The brightness changes were as linear as the object&#39;s motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched many planes over the skies here and this was not a plane (well, not a normal one anyway).<n>

I immediatly spotted a couple satelites and then about five minutes later looking to the Northeast I spotted three points of light forming a triangle gliding across the sky in a southeast projection staying on it&#39;s course with all three lights at the exact same intensity! I was able to view it for a full two minutes as it earily glided across the sky. I tried to see if I could see stars in the background but couldn&#39;t although it did not seem to be on a path where you could see a lot of stars and as it came up to one bright star the left light in the back lined up with that star perfectly so I could still not make out if it was a solid object! If it was a solid object it would of had to of been huge! the lights moved together as if it was one object! It appeared to move slower than most satelites I have seen and if I would of been looking North a little earlier I probaly would of gotten to view it for four minutes. This is the third time now I have seen this formation in the last three summers or years! It still is very earie to watch! I was so mesmerized by it,I failed to take the binoculars off to see if you could see it with the naked eye! I believe though that if one would of been looking I think they could of been seen! This thrird time now I noticed it was on pretty much the same course as it was last year when I saw it! I watched it until it got to far east and then the lights just faded out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites may have been the cause of the sighting.  Please see other report from Ontario, Canada, for an explanation.  PD))<n>

It slowly appeared; maybe 2 or 3 seconds.  I told my friend and she noticed it too.  I think the light appeared in the southeast direction at about 65 degrees.  The light was very bright, fairly large (much bigger than a star or shooting star), white, and perfectly round.  At first we thought it was a headlight to a plane that was low but realized there was no sign of a plane (i.e., noise, blinking lights, etc.)  The light seemed to look like a headlight on some aircraft that was flying fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were both looking at it, it seemed to peak in brightness - as if the light were shinging very close to us - like a spotlight.  It then dimmed from very bright to nothing in the next 2-3 seconds.  I think the dimming was the light source turning to the right and then away.  When it was turning to the right, we were able to still track the dimming light for about 10 degrees to the right then the light completely disappeared.  We continued to look in that direction for the next 20-30 minutes and never saw anything else other than the usual stars and planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never any noise, any other lights attached to it, and never saw any shape of the object other than the light itself.  The weather was clear and calm.  It was too far away to have been an aircraft to have had had bright of a light shining from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we continued to look for any other lights, we discussed what we saw.  We both described the same thing and hopefully my description explains what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the flare from an Iridium satellite may have been the cause of the sighting.

I was admiring the stars and suddenly noticed one moving. It was very high up. I would guess that it was not within our atmosphere. If this object had been standing still I would have thought that it was a star and thought nothing of it, if it had moved in a straight line I would have thought that it was a satellite or meteor, but it did not move in a straight line. This object moved across the sky in a zig zag pattern (in a repeated s shape). I watched it for a few seconds and thought about going to get my wife to have her come and see it, but I was afraid that it would be gone by the time that I got back. I watched it for approximately 10 seconds and then it disappeared. I watched for a few minutes after this and went back out a couple more times to see if I could see it again, but I did not see it again that evening.<n>

I was on my cell phone with my girlfriend when I saw something resembling stadium lights in a field where no such thing belonged. I pulled over about 1000 feet south of it. It was a triangle shape, and had numerous white lights. It was hovering approx. 200-300 feet off the ground, and didn&#39;t make a sound. I was about 6 or 7 miles from the Dover Air Force base, but no craft I know of could hover still like this. After about two minutes it very slowly made its way across the road, heading NE. I quickly hopped in my car and made a U-turn, but it disappeared over some trees. Many other people were on the road and I&#39;m sure someone else saw it. I didn&#39;t report it to the local police, because I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me. I arrived at my house an hour later, where my stepbrother and his girlfriend were waiting. He had been 15-25 min. ahead of me and he said they saw the same thing. At first I thought he was taunting me, but I soon realized he was telling the truth. While searching this site for related sightings I came across a very similar report from two years ago in the same area (http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/S14819.html). Word for word its exactly what I experienced. I&#39;m wondering if this has been going on for awhile in this area. Maybe its some experimental aircraft, but why would you hover by a main road on Labor Day weekend if you wanted to keep it a secret?<n>

Glanced out window. Saw what at first I thought was a flight of geese in a long skine. Then realized it was not birds, but something that looked lik a long &#34;banner&#34; with vertical bars. The banner like object appeared to be slowly undualting and drifting to the west—there is an easterly surface wind. Didn&#39;t have much time to obsereve since the traffic was heavy. Next time I had a chance to see it, it was to the wset and somewhat smaller as if parts of it had dropped off or disspeared in some way. Did not notice anything falling.  I don&#39;t know if  the strong odor noticed shortly afterward had any connection with the object, but it was very strong and smelled something like fertilizer you might spray from a garden hose attachment. After I got home—about a mile from where i first saw the object—i could stiil smell the odor.<n>

It was way too high for anyone to make out what it was but we could tell it was huge. It stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes (since we got there) and it slowly turned into just the round circle in the middle. No one could believe it. The orange triangular craft formed into a circle right in front of our eyes! It starting coming closer to Earth. Still high in the sky but closer. It started moving in circular patterns in the sky. Heading even closer. Then it instantly went back up and vanished.<n>

It was  around 12:45am early Friday morning. I had to go to the bathroom and decided to look out the window , which was right across the entrance to my bathroom. I notice this BIG bright white light in the distance, towards the Northeast direction. As I looked at it, I noticed it changed from white to red then green. I went to the bathroom and decided to see if it was still there when I came out. It was still there so I stayed for a brief period of time and watched it.  It continued to change color and was VERY bright. Brighter then any other object in the sky including all the stars.  I went to bed and just assumed it was a star or something. Later that same day I was talking to my roommate and told him what I saw and we both decided to wait and see if it was there that night. The night of Aug. 30-31 we went and checked to see if the light was there. At around 12:30am on Aug. 31 the light was there again. Both my roommate and myself saw this bright light. My roommate went to bed and I decided to stay up and watch this strange bright light. It still changed from white to red and then green, but this time I noticed it would sway to the right, then the left, then up and final down. It did this for quite sometime and then I decided to go to bed. We both continued to check for this same light the next two nights and it hasn’t been back at all. I have not left my address or last name as I don&#39;t want both to be exposed to the public.

At this time, there is a storm blowing through the Denver metro area.  I just walked outside to the south of my building to watch the clouds churning, looked up to the southwest, and I saw a dark circular object -- almost like a child&#39;s helium balloon -- sort of hovering and &#34;drifting&#34; toward the north.  I was surprised at how slow it moved because the wind was pretty strong.  It was at this point about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away. I watched for a few seconds and could tell it wasn&#39;t a balloon, and it went out of sight around the corner of my building, so I ran through the building to the other side and caught sight of it again.  By this time it was a disk shape, more elongated, still dark in colour, and flying a bit faster toward the north.  It suddenly slowed down, then wobbled and went slightly sideways, and at that point it changed to more of a white colour briefly, then it tilted back to a horizontal position and started moving again to the north. I ran inside and yelled to some CSRs (who were just 15 feet inside the door), &#34;Come tell me if this isn&#39;t a flying saucer!&#34; and they all 4 ran out.  One of them could also see it, but the other 3 couldn&#39;t.  It was flying rapidly to the north, seeming to fly faster all the time.  It was still an elongated dark object.  We watched it for a few seconds until it disappeared.  It was moving from SW to N/NE.  When I first saw it, it was probably about 1/2 to 1 mile away, and by the time the CSR saw it it was still about 1 mile away but was travelling to the west of our building, toward the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.

At midnight I seen a vary bright star to the west as i turned on Arkansas State Route 90 going to Walnut Ridge, Arkansas.  The sky was cloudless ful of stars, and it was hot out that evening about 85 F.  As I was driving south the star I noticed got larger and brighter.  I pulled over because it seemed to be following me, but kept going.  Then it droppedin altitude over the black river refude area.  Then 3-4 smaller red lights came out from it!  I was damned scared, i got the hell ou of there becaus this was no airplane.  I got into delaplaine, ar an saw another truck so i pulled over but the driver was asleep, the truck eas runing lights on but he was asleep very strange.  by this time I have seen noone else on Arkanasas State Route 90 comming from Walnut Ridge or behind me.  The bright star was following me and there was a red light flying to the east of me, the redlight pulsed it must have traveled aboput 50 ft above ground.I went to O&#39;Keene and saw nobody there so I floored it by then coming to Walnut Ridge.  Got inot town and the objects were gone.

As I studied the light, a second one appeared to the lower left which was moving at a moderate pace and fading from very bright, identical to the stationary light, to nothing at all, then back to very bright.

I glanced up (about 60 degrees)and spotted a bright light in the sky.  It was still very much daylight, and I thought to myself that I might be looking at Venus, which is certainly bright enough at times to be visible during the day; I thought this because the object was motionless.  However, upon further consideration I realized that Venus would be much lower in the sky by that time, so I reached inside my sliding glass door and grabbed my binoculars which I keep close by to look at the planes making their final approach to Hartsfield Airport.  It is difficult to say at what altitude the craft was hovering but since I could see no detail with the naked eye I am going to estimate that the craft was at about 10,000 feet) When I centered the object and focused, I saw what looked to be a metallic sphere surrounded (seemingly attached) by three or four smaller spheres which were rotating around the larger, center sphere (imagine a basketball surrounded by three or four bowling balls).  The object drifted slowly to the west, but definitely under control, not at all like a balloon caught in the wind -- it was a very windy day at least at ground level but the object drifted only about two hand lengths during the five minute or so time span that I watched it.  As well as drifting to the west, the object also drifted higher.  The longer I watched it, the less detail I saw.  I finally lost the object after watching it for about five minutes.  At no time did I see any type of contrail or evidence of propulsion.  A bit later (two or three minutes) I did spot a plane which looked to be flying toward where I last saw the object (very high and extremely small) but I could never quite center the plane in my binoculars and soon lost sight -- I was interested in seeing what kind of plane it was.<n>

On 08-28-02 at approximately 3:30pm myself and a friend were at the swimming pool at an apartment complex located at brodie lane and west william cannon drive(austin tx).  The sky was very clear with a few clouds in the distance.  My female friend stated, &#34;whats that&#34; and pointed to the northwest.  I looked up and observed a shiny metallic object hovering in the sky.  The object was shaped like a 3 pointed star (like the mitsubishi symbol).  She asked me if I thought it was balloons.  The object then changed formation slowly and began moving towards us.  It is difficult to estimate the altitude of the object when we first observed it, but it would cover about 1&#34; in size held at my arms length.  The object then came very close over the pool area (almost directly over) where we were.  It had changed shape and was now like a vertical cylindrical object with blurred features.  The altitude had dropped to perhaps 100&#39;.  I knew that something was way out of the ordinary when I observed a metallic object projecting from the right side of the craft (?).  The sun was reflecting on the projecting object and I know without a doubt that it was solid and definately not a balloon.  It appeared to be almost chrome colored.  It also appeared to me that the object was traveling against the wind (moving from northeast to southwest).  We were, up to this point, the only two people at the pool.  Just as the craft was over the pool area 4 teenagers approched (3 males 1 female).  I asked them, &#34;do you see that...what do you think it is?&#34;.  They all watched the object with us for a few minutes and did not reply.  The object hovered over the pool area for 1-2 minutes and then began moving towards the southwest again.  As it did it changed shape again and started gaining altitude.  I lost sight of the object as the roof of the clubhouse blocked my view.  Let me state that I could hear the noise from the traffic on the roadways, and air traffic in the distance (a ! southwes t airlines plane flew by from east to west) - but at no time did I hear any noise from the object. Based on the slow speed and low altitude of the object I feel confident that many other observations were made in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this police officer and found him to be quite credible and convincing.

I went to open the window for a better view. The object had a bright orange light in back and 3 or 4 small orange lights where the wings would be. Using the spacing of the small lights where the wings would be, it was either very large or low flying. I observed the object for 10-12 seconds. No sound could be heard. There were no flashing anti collision lights that you would normally see on an an airplane at night. I have never seen an airplane at night with all orange lights. Did anyone else report anything like this?<n>

These lights separated forming 2 triangle type shapes. Within what must have been 20 seconds they were over us. They stopped above us then moved about ten feet south again over the lake. Then one came down on top of the water and hovered there. This one triangle was all black with lights on the three corners. We could see what looked like 2 windows on the front of it. They were illuminated a bluish colour.We could see what looked like to be people or something moving around in there. There was a door or something that opened on the right side of this thing and something came out that looked roundish in shape and scooped up some water. Then this thing took off straight up in the air. we moved back because we felt an intense heat just shoot out form it. These two things then took off again to the south. We have video of this event which we are now in the process of showing our local police and news departments.<n>

Approx 22:30, clear sky with approx 1/10 high level cloud. Noticed a strange light in sky approx NNE from our position at about 20deg elevation. Lights appeared to be white, red and green stacked ontop of each other. At first put this down to helicopter (live near to the Breacon Beacons and area used for military training). However soon became apparent that we were not witessing a known form of aircraft. Light began to pulse bright and dim and move from left to right at a medium speed but with no slowing or stop between changes in direction. This continued for about 1/2 an hour. Object became obscured by cloud. We all seemed to have seen the same thing but were lost for a sensible explaination. Girlfriends sister visited us at about 23:15 and object was again visible in same area of sky. This time two aircraft seemed to be closing and movements became erratic before vanishing. I come from an engineering background in the Armed Forces and have witnessed many aircraft in flight, this object was not something I can readily explain.<n>

It wasn&#39;t as bright as Venus but brighter than any other star in the sky.  It moved in a North-Easterly direction until it reached directly overhead where it simply stopped.  There were no marker lights that you would normally see on a normal aircraft and it moved at a slower pace than most aircraft move over our skies.  In addition there was an unusual amount of aircraft in flight that night; 11 at one point in time.  The object stayed overhead for quite some time.  Through binoculars, it was located near a dimly lit star where it remained until I went to bed, nearly 3 hours later.  Using that dimly lit star as a reference point you could see with the naked eye and especially through binoculars that the object was bouncing around, moving erratically in all directions, yet staying within a near proximity of the dimly lit star.  The object remained in this location until I went to bed, around 23:30 hours.<n>

8/27/02 02:30|Caribbean Sea||Triangle|5 minutes|Multi-light triangle shaped UFO over Caribbean Ocean, as viewed from a cruise ship.|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55084.html|58|ndxe200208| Multi-light triangle shaped UFO over Caribbean Ocean, as viewed from a cruise ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is an account of a real UFO sighting from the balcony of a cruise ship in the Caribbean in 2002.  I’m not sure why I have waited this long to file this report, but once an ardent skeptic of most UFO tales, everything changed on a late summer night in the Atlantic Ocean.  So although late in arriving, here is my story:  On August 27, 2002, while cruising aboard the ship Carnival Pride, I woke up from a deep sleep, only to find myself oddly sitting on the edge of the bed, facing our cabin’s patio door.  The drapes were drawn.  I do not know what alerted me to arise from my sleep, nor can I explain what prompted me to go out onto the cabins private balcony that early morning.  It was approximately 2:30 am.  As I stepped out onto the balcony, I moved forward to the balcony railing.   Our ship was roughly 200 miles out from land, with the first destination stop, being Half Moon Cay, Carnival’s private island.  Our cabin was positioned on the port side of the ship, facing west, traveling in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I was drawn to the front of ship, as the moon was out and nearly visible through a small bank of clouds.  The illumination of the moon cascaded over the dark blue pristine waters below.  Then I proceeded to glance upwards, staring straight port side.  To my amazement I spotted a very large cluster of multicolored lights. One light appeared to be very bright and white at its center, while a series of smaller individual lights of blue, green and red surrounded it.  I can’t be sure, but it appeared very much as if its shape were triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess is that it was approximately 70 degrees off horizon and its scale, although difficult to determine would have covered a bald fist at arms length.  By this determination, I gather that this object was very large and probably close.  It did not move or make a sound.  It merely hovered.  A very slight misty cloud obscured about 25% of the visible object. It took a few minutes for my brain to register what it was seeing. I watched it for about 10 seconds.  I was stunned! It definitely was not a plane. It was also unlikely a helicopter, especially given the distance from any land mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit, despite the initial state of shock, I was quite proud of myself, in that I immediately recognized the rare nature of this observance and quickly took action.  It registered with me, that only a photo or a video of this object, would exonerate me of any embellishment, should I choose to share this unbelievable sight with another.  So the following actions occurred within the frame work of 7-9 seconds:  I quickly remembered I had left our camera bag, just inside the patio door, on the floor, out of the way of the normal traffic aisle. The small quarters of our cabin made this a logical storage place.  Coincidentally, it would also offer me the shortest distance in retrieving the cameras and film this object.  As I turned to open the door, I placed one foot inside our cabin, keeping my other foot outside, thereby propping the door open.  I reached in for our video camera and as I backpedaled to the open balcony railing again, I opened the lens case, activated the camera, all at the same time.  This is why I reference the time frame of 7-9 seconds.  Why is this important? It will become perfectly clear with my next testimonial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I swung the camera upwards and toward the direction of the object, to my utter dismay, it was gone.  It had simply vanished. I couldn’t believe it. Only a few seconds had passed.  I was however, not deterred.  I noticed off in the distance, a very small but bright light.  At first I thought it might be a planet, such as Mars, which as I recall, was highly visible in the Western sky at that time of the year.  I still decided to zoom in and film it, in the event it might have been what I watched in total astonishment a few seconds earlier, and twenty-times larger!  I took nearly two minutes of video.  I used the railing cap to steady my camera.  While I realize, that a digital camera, zoomed to a near infinite range, can cause square pixilation’s and that some subjects, illuminating brightly as a source, can create false images, such as a rainbow effect with twinkles of various colored lights; what I saw, was something far different. It seemed to have a single image of light, countered by the surprise emergence of a second (different) colored light from behind.  Then a third colored light.  I don’t think Mars would react that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I felt I had recorded a sufficient amount of tape to make a convincing case for something obviously unidentified as nothing short of an unexplained, unidentified flying object (UFO).  It was now time to wake up my wife. While keeping our two children sleeping, I would soon add a second set of eyes, in a sanity check, to see if I was imagining the whole thing.  I went inside our cabin and awoke her.  Despite her groggy state, like a good trooper, she trudged out on the balcony with me, to add an equal witness to this sighting.  While she manned (woman) a set of binoculars, I continued to film the subject.  Once again and much more clearly, a red object immerged from behind the larger brighter object, as if hovering or orbiting around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mystery only became more bizarre, as within minutes of the sighting, a group of three ships floating on the water, off in the distance, suddenly appeared.  I know for certain that they were not there before.  After discovering them, my film shows at least one of them floating on the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To conclude, I can only surmise the following:  Did (what ever it was) possess some artificial intelligence that flagged it of my observing presence on deck?  If so, did it react by speeding away at an incredible rate (as I’ve heard of, in other cases) to avoid a video camera image that clearly would have rivaled the one I eventually captured?  To film it at maybe 1-2 miles away vs. perhaps 20 miles?  I’ll never know.  And what significance did the surprise appearance of three smaller vessels on the ocean have to do with this experience.  I have enclosed snapshot pictures or frames of the video I shot.  I have kept the video to myself.  As of this writing, after 4 ½ years, only 6-7 other people know of our UFO encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it was about 200 feet in the sky and it was not moving at all. It was triangular shaped and very bright. We rolled the windows down and pulled over to the side of the road. There were lights around the bottom of the object. We also noticed how quiet it was. There was complete silence we then dialed the police to report what we were looking at and the object suddenly took off rather quickly. When it took off it made the sound of an airplane taking off and it had several flashing lights. It was out of sight rather quickly. The police then transfered us to the UFO center.<n>

The light was white at all times. We were alarmed at the speed of the approach and that it seemed headed directly toward us (position fixed). The light was too far out to distinguish shape or size. The object remained stationary a few seconds and then began to dim to the relative size and brightness of surrounding stars. The light then began moving what appeared slowly from directly overhead eastward to 45 degrees (2 minutes elapsed). The lighted object zigged right (south)a few seconds and then resumed an eastward course for about 2 minutes before disappearing over the rim of the volcano.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was our first sighting of a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The flash of an Iridium satellite would have been visible from Keokea, HI, near the national park at 19:46 hrs..

When it stopped it seemed to gather it&#39;s energy. Turned really bright than for a second we could see that it had a gold colour to it. It almost seemed liquid. Than it took off at an amazing speed. No sound. There was clouds in the night sky and I could see that it penetrated the clouds. I&#39;ve never seen something like this and I know that what I saw was not what we are accustomed to seeing flying in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We first noticed some lights in the sky at 23:00hrs. When we looked at it through binoculars you couldn&#39;t make out the shape but you could see red, yellow, blue and green lights flashing on the object. At 00:00 we noticed another one in the vicinty. By 01:00 we counted 6. 5 of them were in a cluster to the NW, the other one was alone in the NNE. We saw a plane fly in the direction of the one in the NNE, it was much closer than the others, as the plane was getting closer it shot straight up in the sky. At 02:00 I saw a yellow flash of light at the front of the house, at the same moment my sister saw a blue flash of light in the back of the house. At 03:00 we heard a sudden noise in the backyard. It was like a vocal noise but you couldn&#39;t understand what was being said. At that point in time we ran into the house and locked the doors and closed all blinds. We then ran to my truck and sat there until my Aunt and Uncle came home. They then checked the backyard and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD))<n>

I  got my girlfriend to get me fieldglasses and i had to adjust the focus quite a bit by then the object was far east an then the light speeded up considerable and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back on to what i was doing (sorting out dirt and sand on a plastic container) and I dont know weather ten minutes or half an hour past i raised my head after hearing some people two adults and a few kids walking on the sidewalk in front of me saying look at those lights and I got up and there where 4 lights similar in size as the one I saw early, but this time they where comming from the west south of the texas line from the direction of the mountain towards and on top of juarez(not to high up but close tothe grownd maybee 100 to 200 feet up?) down town one after the other one maybe half a mile a apart from eachether and while they reach more or less the same point where the previous one passed by . they formed a square and then the one from the far and upper left and the one on the bottom right I think started distanciating from the other two creating a rombo (in spanish terms )or an square buth of irregular sides. while this was going of I focuss one of the lightswith the fieldglasses and after focussing the shape is like an yelloing orange shape bowl almost like dark burning object a total circle but at the shape of almost a half moon patern seems to apear like more solid shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have time to explored the other three because the kids close tome wanted to look at them too but they appear to be of the same size after geeting my glasses back I think regaing lookin at the same one and lost the other three the one in question kept goin east but now under american soil and straight east just south of freeway ten and norht of the rio grande. The moon was close to full and this thing was at the same height and very small compare tom the moon size but i can compare the size to alinner plane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after I no longer colud see the light at plain sight I steel was able to find it with my fieldglasses and it seems to be maintaining the same speed.

I emediatly knew what it was since i have seen these lights before. its a light that many people are studying. infact i personly have helped investigate these lights before. they usualy apear in 1 or 2 lights. they hover and move very slowly and when they move fast they blink randomly and either speed off out of sight or simply stop blinking. on this night the light did exactly that. it moved from a south western position to a south eastern position where it disapeared. i called fox 10, a news channel in az, and asked if they knew what this was and they ended up doing a report on this particular light. they talked with officials from williams air force base who said &#34; the light was just a beacon on a cesna airplane&#34;. personly i do not believe this explanation becasues cesna planes cannot fly so high as to look as though they are moving so slow and the cannat fly at their normal altitudes at such a slow speed. also, cesna plaines have other blinking lights on them not just one that suddenly stops blinking. i have seen these lights more then 10 times and i would love to here and see proof of what thy really are. oh well maybe some day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was living in Terrace at the time but am currently living in Pr. Rupert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fairly sure that my experience occurred in the early morning of Sunday August 25, 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not what I saw that intrigued me as I really did not see anything, it is what I heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4:30 am I awoke to go to the bathroom.  The window was open in my bathroom as it was quite a warm night as it has been lately.  As I was standing at the toilet a very loud and intense noise quickly filled the sky.  It was loud enough that I wondered if it would wake up anyone else in the area.  The noise lasted for approximately one to one and a half minutes and then was gone again quickly.  The noise sounded very much like a military plane flying overhead with one very distinct difference. This noise did not come out of or move into the distance.  In my experience with military planes you can hear them come from a distance and as they pass overhead you can hear them go off into the distance.  This sound did not move like that.<n> <n><n> The skies were clear and bright and I could not see anything in an direction that was visible to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m curious if you have had any other reports from that time or confirmation of any military exercises in the area at the time.  Any information would be helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

8/24/02 23:50|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Disk|over 1 hr|UFO sighting Sat Aug 24/02 in Vancouver, Canada|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24722.html|72|ndxe200208| UFO sighting Sat Aug 24/02 in Vancouver, Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday Aug 24/02 at 11:59 PM in Vancouver. My wife recieved a phone call at 11:45 from my brother. She then told me that the meteor I was waiting for can be seen in the sky. I told her it was last saturday. I then saw the object she was talking about west. I told her it was an airplane characteristic of the blue and red flashing lights. She then told me my brother also saw it 18 KM away. I said that was impossible. I decided this requires more research. I hauled out my telescope. Spotted the object at 50 power and noticed it was no airplane. Went to 200 power. I then had a clear picture. It was close to the characteristic flying saucer shape. It glowed very intensely. Had a weird rotating sensor beam on the top part of the saucer. It flashed aqua color first and then orange-red second. Much like a rotating spot beam at a 0.5 second rotation. Obviously one beam that could scan orange-red and then aqua. I then took relative size calculations. Today I took bearing calculations at my place and my at my brothers to figure out the distance to the object. I also took an object that looked the same size in the telescope at a distance that i measured to figure out the size. I went over to my brothers who pointed to where he saw it. I used my GPS to get the bearing at his place. Using math I calculated the object was 30 meter diameter at a distace of 200 KM. That puts it over Vancouver Island. The object also moved much like a star in the sky. This indicates that it could not be an object in close orbit. The object must of been under power. My brother watched it for over an hour and me for 45 minutes before it went behind some trees. I can say this was not weather ballon or object burning up in the atmosphere. I cant say this was a Alien space ship, but if it was not, the Earth has developed a new type of ship that is quite impressive.<n>

The two objects seemed to be round, and were very bright (white). The two objects began to spin in a clockwise circle together as if synchronized and tethered together, they did 4 rotations, then they stopped the rotation and traded places vertically very quickly, the top one going to the bottom, and the bottom one going to the top, they did this three times, and on the last time they did not stop, they kept traveling apart from each other until I could no longer see them.<n>
8/24/02 21:45|Sacramento|CA|Unknown|4 minutes|Very bright Orange Pulsing Light Suddenly Vanishes in Skies Near Sacramento|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24670.html|75|ndxe200208| Very bright Orange Pulsing Light Suddenly Vanishes in Skies Near Sacramento<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I began talking about a very bright orange light in the southwestern part of the sky; we realized it was too bright to be a star since it was at least 3 times brighter than Venus and orange and pulsing as though with some movement, though we couldn&#39;t actually track any progress through the atmostphere. So, we figured it was  a plane heading right towards us and I listened expectantly for the sound of the roar of a plane, but it didn&#39;t come. As we continued to discuss the orange bright pulsing light . . . suddenly, it just was gone. Just like that. Nothing. No clouds for it to behind, just absolutely vanished.  There were no flashing tail-lights or any identifying light patterns that signalled any aircraft we were familiar with, so this was rather a mystery.  If it was indeed a plane that made a suddenly turn, it&#39;s puzzling why no other lights were then visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange Bright Object Suddenly Vanishes: part 2, seen in Sacramento, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is to update the earlier report. I spoke with my mother and she described the intensity of the light as &#34;brighter than any object in the sky&#34; (including the moon) and that it looked to her as though it were actually out in space, &#34;not in our atmosphere.&#34;  My earlier description was more of an estimate of size, since I was tired and not thinking terribly clearly.  Yes, it was brighter than the moon, though of course much smaller.  It was as bright as a firework, but again small, meaning you could imagine it being a planet, though in comparison with Jupiter/Venus etc. it&#39;s bigger, as it appeared on the ground.  She also was skeptical about the light being a plane landing light, since the light did not diminish before vanishing; wouldn&#39;t a plane landing light fade somewhat as the projection of that light began to make its turn? And why no flashing tail lights? Was this a distant stellar phenomenon perhaps?  There must be some other reports of this somewhere.<n>

Fast, far, within the atmosphere (seemingly over Capital Hill); not a meteor, satellite, helicopter, or plane. Visible for 2-3 seconds, moved across 40-50 degrees of azimuth. Newly risen, red-orange moon was visible above Queen Anne hill, and this object passed directly beneath it.<n>

I saw this object, which I believe to be a weather balloon, or an advertising balloon, appear to be climbing, and went almost due south. My wife obsevered this ufo too. I just hope if it is an advertising balloon, that the wire that keeps it on the ground snapped off at the right end, otherwise it is a danger to any aircraft.<n>

She said, &#34;Mommy, there is something in the sky, look.&#34;  We went to the glass door and watched what appeared to be a very bright, white disk-shaped object traversing the sky about 500-700 feet up going precisely south to north at a fairly fast pace.  I have watched many, many planes fly over my house and this did not appear to be a plane.  It had a definite disk shape to it.  We grabbed the binoculars and ran outside to the back yard following it across the sky.  I kept saying it must be a balloon but it didn&#39;t seem to behave like a balloon.  (I video tape and photograph known flying objects in the sky for my IFO web site - this did not fit anything I have in my IFO database.) I watched it fly to the south through the binoculars then noticed it seemed to rotate or something happened because it began to change from a disk shape to some other shape (this is when I knew it was not a plane for sure).  It was descending to the ground behind some houses at about a 25-30 degree angle.  This is when I had serious doubts that it was a balloon.  My daughter also said she saw it maneuver in the sky while I was getting the binoculars and she said balloons cannot do what it did.  No sound was detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a B.A. and M.Ed. in counseling psychology and research UFO&#39;s, phenomena and military technology.  I hesitated filing this report because I believe most UFO sightings tend to be misidenifications of conventional aircraft and/or other common objects seen in the sky.  I have to admit it was clearly disk shaped and seemed to be flying under some type of control and it went down to the ground as if landing.  It could have been a balloon or it could have been a UAV.  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve seen other unusual objects in this area now and then.  (It was partly cloudy but mostly sunny today, winds out of the south at 5-10 mph.)<n>

We are time travelling in a body of mankind the thing that we are addicted to because of it&#39;s beauty and power. The message  was that open contact will only be made to save the planet from nuclear destruction. At which time we will be recycled to another planet and continue the mystery of man being alone.This experience immediately took me back to the actual sighting of this alien when I was six. It scared me then because of it&#39;s ugliness. It refuses to be sen until I am ready to see myself again.<n>

We were just outside of Gary, Indiana at 4:28am when I happened to look up in the sky and noticed a dark, very large circular object hovering over the highway just ahead of us.  As we approached, I expected it to move, but it was stationary as we drove right under it.  Unfortunately my friend who was driving had his eyes on the road and missed the whole thing.  There were no lights or sound at all.  It was about the size of a frisbee at arms length, so it was either very close to the ground or very large.  Our headlights did not illuminate the bottom of the object at all, so I&#39;m thinking it was pretty large.<n>

Both move continuously, up, down, right, left, backwards, etc,  but remaining in the same general area.  Tonight they are very high, must crane my neck, but on other times they have been lower, or in another area in the night sky.  The most unusual activity I have seen was one night when they lowered dramatically and dimmed, as a plane went overhead.  This always above the Gulf of Mexico, I watch from the shoreline, in the wee hours.  I do not know about weather equipment, satellites, etc.  It is just very interesting, and would like to know what it is.<n>

I asked my sister if she saw it too.  We watched it begin to ascend and move northward in a straight pattern.  It was moving away from the earth.  We thought it could be a satellite, but another flash occured and began moving away from the earth right after the first one disappeared.  We then noticed a satellite flying by, and knew at that point it wasn&#39;t a satellite.  Definetly not a plane, either.<n>

She and her husband drove back to my house to let us know about it, and my whole family watched it.  My oldest son was on the phone with a friend, who lives about a mile away, and he went outside with the phone and also seen it in the sky.  It was very bright red, almost like a lazer pointer color and brightness.  It would sit stationary for a while, then move slow either east, or north at times.  We watched it for about a half hour, and later that night, I watched the news, and it had been reported on Fox 10 news, they even showed video of it.  The news reported they contacted Williams Gateway Airport, and they said it was a cessna airplane, but no plane could sit stationary like it did. I called the news and told them we witnessed it, and there was no way it was a plane.<n>

Again it was a Red/ Rust color but I got a vague glimps of something blue on it, and it was oval but round in hiegth and it it had something consistent along the belly of the  craft like air holes or somtthing it was a consistent pattern all the way around.<n>

When we got up, we began to walk across the large field in back of the school. When we got to the middle, I felt something strange and I looked up in the sky and as soon as I looked, a bright blue oval appeared from nowhere exactly where I looked. I told my friend to look and we stood there and watched the object fly across the sky. It was going very fast, probably several thousand kilometers an hour and it made absolutely no sound. Overall, the object appeared, flew east and disapeared. We decided to stay there to see if it would return. A few minutes passed, and we observed a helicopter from the airbase fly halfway to our location and then return. Someone else must have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
8/23/02 02:30|Louisville|KY|Light|30 min|dancing light(s)|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24679.html|95|ndxe200208| dancing light(s)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just about to go to bed on Friday night, and was sitting in my bed. I had just turned off my reading light to try and force myself to go to sleep because I knew I needed to get up relatively early in the morning even though I wasn&#39;t particularly tired. I lay there in bed and happened to look out my second story window and saw a small gray object outside my window. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was so I sat up and took a closer look. As it turned out it was nothing but some piece of electrical equipment attached to an electrical wire coming from the pole. I had a good laugh at myself and was about to lay back down when a quick flash of light caught my eye. My window looks directly east.  ((NUFORC NOTE:  Should read &#34;west.&#34;  Please see note below.)) In my field of vision was a two story apartment building with parking lights pointing in my direction. Directly behind that is a 4 story hospital. Well about 1 1/2 hands high above the hospital is where I saw the light. It was a smallish light - mostly white but every once in a while I would see red glimpses. The reason it caught my eye is that it was moving at incredible speeds. So I sat there and watched it for a moment. At first I thought thought there were 2 or three lights in the sky -because it seemed like they were chasing each other. They were doing impossible loops, switchbacks and S curves. I got excited and ran downstairs to get my housemate who was still up watching TV to make sure I get someone else to see this so nobody could say I was crazy. He came up and and saw the light too. He saw them doing the loops, etc. but he is the kind of person that quickly dismisses anything outside his purview. He said: It&#39;s just a light - probably a spotlight - and left to go back downstairs. I continued to watch it. The light(s) were appearing on just past the edge of a line of clouds from a front that was passing by. The front contained the kind of clouds that look like thick fish scales - I forget their name - like a tight pattern of small cumulus clouds but not very thick. Just past the front where I was seeing the light ! there we re some high cirrus clouds that were thinning to the point that I could see a star. When I first noticed the spectacle I thought that there were 2 or maybe 3 lights up there dancing around, but the more I watched I realized that I was just watching one light - the other must have left or it was always just the one. Anyway, the light was smallish in size - about as bright as say Venus or Sirrus and about as big in size. I got the impression that the light was quite a distance away because as it was doing its loops and spirals it was reflecting its light in the thin clouds around it. With my roommates thought of a spotlight in mind I tried to discern whether this was really the case as it was staying in the general vacinity of where I was looking - namely just above the hosiptal. I quickly dismissed this idea becuase it wasn&#39;t showing any kind of pattern that I could see. At times the light was moving slowly and then it would suddenly move as fast as a shooting star. It seemed to be roughly circling something but it was just going around in cirlcles. It was doubling back on itself in extremely tight turns at very high speeds. Because there were some electrical lines in my way of sight I decided to go downstairs to see if I could get a better view. I ended up standing on the bed of my roomates truck and ended up watching the light for a total duration of about 1/2 hour - 45 min. Even though there were lights illuminating the parking lot across the street the light could still be easily seen darting in and out of clouds and doing its dance. The light was not constant in that I could always see it. For brief moments it would disappear behind the clouds or moved so fast that my eyes had to catch up with it. It watched it until another line of thick clouds obscured the light and I thought it was over so I went back to bed. Once upsatairs and in bed I took one last look outside and saw the light one last time - this time it shot straight up and that was it.  I never thought I&#39;d be reporting a UFO though I&#39;ve alw! ays want ed to see one. I&#39;m currently an umemployed fine artist and I had just moved here less than a week ago. I like to think that I have an excellent eye for detail and have enough control over my emotions not to latch on to any one idea, having a very open mind. I was a Benedictine monk for 2 years and had just recently finished a 6 month stint infiltrating and gathering information on a racist organization. (if you could leave that part out it would be greatly appreciated). I am telling you this to let you know that although I may be eccentric and in some folks eyes considered weird - I have my head firmly planted on my shoulders. Also I was completely sober throughout the whole experience. I would like to know if anyone else in this area had seen this light. The next day I looked at a map to see what falls directly east of where I live. The Ohio river is directly east of me along with a neighborhood and right on the river I saw the Louisville/Jefferson county Riverport Authority which according to my map which was dated 1995 was still under construction. I hope any of this can be of help. I knew of you people from looking at rense.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> dancing light(s)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello - i filed a report earlier today about a dancing light i saw friday night here in Louisville, KY.

For the last two nights no reoccurance. The skies seem to clear of commercial aircraft before midnight,local ones anyway. I do know that planes as I have seen plenty when banking toward you will look like bright headlights except when they turn they always show red and white lights.The things I described were different because no sound and no light plus all the air traffic seems lower on the horizon . One real and possible explanation is military aircraft going out of mcCord or Fort Lewis undercover of darkness. Funny thing on Sept. 10th last year the night sky traffic was really odd I was out on nisqually fishing all night and tonight the things moving around remind me of the things we all saw that night in the sky glowing orbs and darkened craft not sporting what one would consider proper lights. Although I believe these things military related. Hey if you want to hide just look like everybody else.<n>

Initially thought it was a streetlight but Rt 17 never had streetlights.  Then noticed that it was so bright white but not blinding &amp; unlike any light I ever saw, didn&#39;t have heat/distortion waves &amp; was a perfect, uniform brilliant white.  I was going 65 in the fast lane &amp; there was a car 10&#39; ahead of me also traveling the same speed on the slow lane.  Suddenly this orb shot out ahead &amp; above us, crossing the 2 lane highway to the meridian.  Both myself &amp; the other car hit our brakes.  While it crossed us, the orb had a puddle effect with 2/3 feet like Caspar the friendly ghost &amp; it looked like waves undulating across its surface.  Then it shot directly up into the sky so fast it blinked out.  The other driver &amp; I gunned our cars!<n>
8/22/02 22:50|Williamstown/Hammonton|NJ|Triangle|10 minutes|Multiple Triangle crafts spotted on the Atlantic City Expressway|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24665.html|98|ndxe200208| Multiple Triangle crafts spotted on the Atlantic City Expressway<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were driving to the shore this evening.  We were traveling on the Atlantic City Expressway headed towards Atlantic City.  We started out about 10pm at the Walt Whitman Bridge, and around 10:25pm or so, we had just passed the Williamstown exit.  The road conditions were excellent, dry. The sky was illuminated with a full moon and a slight haze of clouds behind us in the west, but clear skies north/south and east.  There was no fog, fires or anything else in the sky to obstruct our view.  As we are chatting I notice straight ahead about 2 miles and about 15 degrees off to the right of the highway, a very large object which looked more like a stick since the distance made it impossible to distinguish anything from it in the sky, appears to be 2 football fields wide, no more than 3/4 to a mile up with only three lights apparent, and not bright lights either, a dull yellow/gray.  One on each end and one in the center.  As we were looking at this for about a minute, it starts to bank hard to its&#39; left which is south- the banking of the lights was greater than 90 degrees and it was heading lower as well.  We lost it very quickly in the treeline which lines most of the highway so I reduced my speed from about 65mph to about 40 and headed to the right lane.  As we are waiting for the tree line to break a bit so we can look further south, a full minute goes by and then the trees start to break up.  Within a few seconds, the tree line breaks up for a solid mile and as we look to the south, we see more objects.  This time there are at least two, possible three objects with slightly brighter lights of the yellow gray color, but again only 3 lights per object but we can only clearly see 8 lights.  They are hovering about a mile from the highway in a field, one had a downlight beam of gray/white, the other one or two didn&#39;t.  We still at this point could not make out any shapes, but they were definitely closer, definitely lower to the ground, maybe only 500 feet from the earth.  They seemed to be abou! t half t he size each of the large first object we saw.  There was no noise from the area.  There was no sign of the large object we had seen.  I am slowing the car at this point and am half in the shoulder, only traveling about 20mph now, getting ready to stop the car.  The treeline starts cutting in and out again at this point.  We are still trying to gain more of a glimpse of these objects when we both notice something flying towards us, it was the lights we noticed again first, this time a dark grayish color, about 500-1000 feet up and about 1/4 mile away.  Within a second it is flying over the treeline and looking up as it is about to go over the car and highway we can clearly see what it is.  They are two triangular shaped crafts, with a light on each point.  They are dark gray in color, but clearly visible in a full moon medium blue sky.  They are perfect equilateral triangles and there are two.  They are both flying point first, appear to be only about 1000 feet above us, no noise, the dull lights on, flying neck and neck and appear to be about the size of a Lear jet.  We watch as they cross over the car, and the highway.  They were flying due north towards us, but as they approaced the car seemed to have shifted course every so slightly as if they were flying to Seaside Heights area versus Central New Jersey. They are not flying all that quickly at this point, no faster than a jet in landing mode.  But as they get about 1000 feet away from the highway, they just zip away, leaving no trails, but the three lights virtually disappear in an instant.  This is the biggest thrill of my life.  I am going to head back that way tomorrow since it is only about 45 minutes from my house with a camera to see what happens.  I will keep you posted either way. I did contact two local news stations, neither seemed too interested.  I had to wait to come back home to post this since no puter at the shorehouse.

I happened to look up, as I often do to check for UFO&#39;s, and noticed a small dot of light about the size of the surrounding stars (a pinhead at arm&#39;s length)moving from West to East.  It covered the length of a ruler at arm&#39;s length in about 8 seconds.  I told my wife, &#34;Wow, what the heck is that?&#34;.  She said, &#34;It&#39;s probably an airplane&#34;.  However, there were no blinking lights on it and, from it&#39;s very small size, near to the size of the planet Mars, I was more than certain it was very high up.  As we watched it I suddenly said, &#34;Look!  It just got brighter!&#34;  As it moved along in a straight path its diameter increased, it glowed more brightly, from a pinhead size to almost the size of a pea at arm&#39;s length.  This lasted for about 2 to 3 seconds. (At this point, I had very quickly run into the house and grabbed my binoculars.  When I saw it through my binoculars it had a fuzzy appearance to it and it seemed to have white dots around its perimeter.  I was using a Bushnell 10X50 to view the object).  I then wondered if it had been reflecting light from the sun or if it had actually glowed internally.  Then something amazing happened.  It dimmed to almost nothing. It was now barely visible, and there were no clouds along the entire flight path of this object.  Finally, this is the amazing part, it made a 30 degree (from the horizon) turn to the right and then disappeared, the whole time travelling at the same rate of speed.  It&#39;s color had first been a pale white and had glowed to a very intense white when it&#39;s diameter increased and then had returned to a very dim pale white before it made its turn and disappeared.  It&#39;s travel path, again, was from West to East and travelling down toward the horizon at almost a 45 degree angle.  By the way, my wife also viewed it through the binoculars and said it had a jumpy movement right before it disappeared, AFTER its 30 degree angle turn.  I asked her if the ! jumpy mo vement had been from her hands shaking the binoculars, but she said that it had not, as she had both the object and a stationary star in her field of view at the same time.  I just couldn&#39;t believe what we had seen!!  It was my very first UFO sighting in Hawaii!!  I was very certain it wasn&#39;t a satellite, as satellites don&#39;t make turns.  It was not a meteor; they don&#39;t turn either and it was definitely not a CONVENTIONAL aircraft.  It may have been military but, again, from its diminutive size I was very certain this object was WAY UP there in space…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No Iridium satellite flashes are indicated by www.heavens-above.com satellite for Honolulu for this date and time.

I wanted to kill him for waking me up but just then I heard the notes. It was very similar to the notes and pattern in the movie Close Encounters but had six notes not five. He knew I heard it and gave a sigh of relief. It did it again an couple of seconds later and this time I said, Whoa, it sounds just like the &#34;song&#34; in Close Encounters. My husband was so happy. he said he had been listening to it for about 15 mins and thought he was losing his mind. He had to wake me up to see if it was real or not. He said he purposely said &#34;music&#34; so as not to influence what I said I heard. I then said well the kids must be watching the movie or have a radio on even though it was repeating too often for me to really believe this. We opened our bedroom window and it was much louder and definately coming from outside. My heart was beating about a thousand miles an hour now and we went through the entire house checking every TV, radio, etc. We opened the garage to check the car radios and the hot tub (has a radio).It was storming unbeliveably outside, lightening and thundering like crazy but you could hear it plain as day. Sometimes it would get faster but always the same notes in the pattern. We went back to the bedroom and had the window cracked alittle because it was raining so hard when there was a boom which was similar to a sonic boom, it was that intense of a crack and the entire sky went completely white. This was no thunderbolt. The entire sky was completely white for about 2 or 3 seconds. After that we continued to hear the notes but they were much fainter and sounded much farther away.This was so completely weird and its freaking us out. My husband keeps saying that he had to have someone else verify what he heard. I know without a doubt what we heard but have to admitt I&#39;d love knowing others did too.<n>

A Demon?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not really into this type of thing.  I am a ((denomination deleted here)) preacher&#39;s wife.  But, I keep seeing things.  And my husband sees them, too.  It&#39;s freaky.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s metoers, or our imagination working overtime...or some rich kid on the hill with neat-looking toys.  One night a few weeks ago we saw a whole bunch of firey balls darting to and fro over the sky towards our west, and we watched them for 20 mintues.  Some came, some went away, and some stayed, and kept moving.  Some were going straight, and some made sharps turns.  Some got brighter, and some faded. There were no metoer showers reported. We thoughts some planes were about to crash.  Tonight was like my umpteenth sighting of something strange.  I woke of insomnia and was looking at the stars, when a big flash of light came out of nowhere, and I thought for a long time what a bright plane it was.  Then I thought maybe it was a angel.  But, as it got closer, it&#39;s path northwest to southeast, I noticed it had a line of lights at it&#39;s middle flashing different colors.  It was pretty close to the ground.  I don&#39;t know, it may just be someone playing with a giant toy to freak people out at night. I don&#39;t necessarily want to be contacted by any investigators, but, I can show you where the sky is hot.  North of town in Durant, Oklahoma. I have seen another freaky thing recentyl.  A small glowing object, mostly red in color, flew right toward my house and over it.  It was dark in the middle, and red glowing.<n>

It looked like the headlight of an airplane, large and bright.  Quickly though, we realized the light was not moving and looked peculiar.  It was red and glowing.  Within about 5 seconds another red light appeared to its right.  This light was far away, perhaps 500 yards (just guessing here).  Suddently four or five more lights turned on sequentially between the two outside lights.  All the lights together seemed to make a formation.  I was looking through my binoculars and thought I could makeout the shape of an aircraft.  But it was hard to tell for sure if it was one aircraft, or two, or whatever.  If it was one aircraft, it would be the largest aircraft I have ever seen!  The lights did not appear to move at all and there was no sound.  Then, suddenly, and all at once, the lights blinked off.  Gone.  The was a very real and unusual sighting, leaving all of us scratching our heads.<n>

Took off when it knew we seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last summer my younger brother (age 18) and I age (34) were outside my trailer house shooting off fireworks into a soybean field and then playing around with a spotlight shining it in the fields looking for coyotes, when I happened to look up as something caught my attention.  The night was clear, dark and warm with a slight breeze and a lot of stars.  There was no moon.  Directly overhead of me (At a high altitude, or so it seemed.) was a bright white light, with a haze around it, about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arms length away.  At first I thought it was the moon because it was bright, shining down on us.  I told my brother to look up which he did and said &#34;What is that?&#34;  Exactly when my brother looked up the light shrank to the size of a pea held at arms length away.  It seemed like it knew we had seen it.  What creeped me out the most was that I wondered how long it was above us shining down on us before I (we) noticed it.  The light sat still for about 5 seconds then moved South of us at a slow speed, and then blinked off.  I am familiar with aircraft and satellites and stars and planets and I&#39;m 99.9% sure it wasn&#39;t any these objects.  I would compare the sighting to a helicopter shining a dim spotlight on us from a great distance above.  But the light emitted no noise and was totally silent.  The light seemed to know we had seen it and took off!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I havn&#39;t said anything to anybody about this because I didn&#39;t think anyone would take me serious.  To the person who reported the sighting on the same date in knoxville, IL...I agree, it couldn&#39;t have been a shooting star.  I was sitting on my front porch, waiting for my wife to get home from work.  The sky was clear and there were quite a few planes flying around the area.  I was watching the sky as I always do at night, when I saw a very bright blue light to the south of town.  It was falling from the sky at a very slow speed.  It had a tail behind it made up of different colors.  I have never seen anything like it before or since then.  I felt very disturbed by this, uncomfortable.  It may have lasted longer than what I saw because I watched it disappear behind the building across the streat from my house.  The sighting in knoxville the same night was in a different location but the same discription.  I found this website and started reading sightings in Illinois and when I came across the report from knoxville couldn&#39;t believe it.  Anyway, I hope this reaches the person who reported the other sighting so that they don&#39;t have to feel alone, I know I did until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.

Suddenly, I noticed a bright blue fire like object come across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. It was rounded in the front.  I yelled at my neighbor to look, but by the time she got turned around it had passed on behind the trees.  It was blue in the front with colors of yellowish, green, white mix behind it. I knew this could not be fireworks of any kind, because of the way it was traveling across the sky.  And, I have never witnessed a falling star that looked like that. There was an airplane in the distance behind that had it&#39;s lights flash as usual, so I know it wasn&#39;t a plane. I&#39;m not quite sure what it was, but I have never seen anything like it before.<n>

The lights on it were white like the stars but, all three lights were moving at the same speed and with no trail following them. From this I fell that the lights were one object It was moving with no sound and very fast.  As I called for others to come see it had moved behind a tree and never came out the other side.  Only momments after that there was three small aircraft  that slowly came over to the area that I had first seen the object.  They flew over the area for some time but I did not take notice of when they left.  There is an older airbase by my home and I am very use to aircraft in the night sky but the object that I saw was too fast to be any of the local aircraft that comes from there.<n>

We drove around the area near the Westchester County Airport, going down one road, turning around and trying another road, etc., for about 15 minutes.  At one point, I pulled into the entrance to the Westchester County Airport (Airport Rd.) and made a U-turn there to get back onto the main road (Route 120A).  I turned left out of the airport entrance onto 120A South, and as I completed the turn I saw something on my left, quickly approaching my car.  My daughter saw it too.  It looked like a small disk, no more than 12 inches or so in diameter, and it was rapidly spinning vertically and moving towards us.  It was dark in color (brown?) but had a metallic quality, and as it passed the car it made a strange sound.  Not a buzz, or a motor-like sound.  More of an electronic sound that changed pitch as it approached my car, then hovered for a second just at the left side of my windshield, very close to the driver&#39;s side window, and then quickly disappeared.  We both saw and heard the exact same thing.  It lasted only a few short seconds, but it remains very clear in both of our minds.  There was no one else around, no traffic, no houses, no people.  We didn&#39;t actually see it &#34;disappear&#34;; it just flew quickly away and wasn&#39;t in sight anymore.<n>

Each appearing where the last one did. We watched that sky space as each object appeared out of nowhere. What started as a pin-glow got bright as the moon, larger than the brightest star, then seemed to grow a little more and started moving rapidly to the north as the glow turned into more like moon light reflection.It faded from a sliver of reflection into nothing. No noise. Duration 10 seconds tops. We observed this 5 good times the first time we only saw the bright glow and the fade.Even though they appeared really bright at first I think it was reflection off the almost full moon because it was the same color.{as opposed to self lit} It would be like someone holding a round mirror and reflecting moonlight right on you then turning the mirror and running away. The top part seemed curved by the way the light reflected off it.After the 6th one a big jet from the SE flying low in the direction of the entry point ended all activity. From this jet we could see that these objects were much faster and had a totally different lighting.{none except reflected}If I believed in secret crafts or aliens then I would say last night someone or thing came to visit or to stay, because what or whoever it was, definately got in.<n>

There was a large amount of twinkling visible and the object appeared to change color and perhaps shape and size.  It was difficult to view with great resolution as I was forced to look through a screen window to see it.  I stared in amazement for about five minutes while trying to determine if the object was moving when suddenly it dimmed out and dissapeared.<n>

Suddenly in the sky about hundred meters above, from nowhere appeared three orange colour spheres. They just came out of nothing. In the non perfect triangular formation they started to move south-east, without any acceleration at all, they just started to move fast. Because the area is heavily populated, we could see them until they reahed the other houses and were lost to our view. The shperes were of orange colour and when moving they changed the formation, but still keeping it triangular. There were no sound coming from these shperes or we could not hear becuase they were about hundred meters from us.<n>

My parents stay in pondicherry. i keep shuttling bw bang. and pondy quite often. i usually take the night bus(8:30 PM). on one of my recent journeys to bangalore, on the way when the bus was passing through tiruvannamalai, i happen to see a quite-bright light in the night sky exactly above the hill( it was dark everywhere else).  the light was arched, in somewhat a circular shape and it was huge. i first thought it was some light coming from a big bulb-or-something situated on the hill. but as the fast-moving bus went a little further i could see some 4-5 people prostrating in the direction of the &#39;light in the sky&#39;. i felt amazed ! i am really puzzled at what i saw !  i want to know the significance to the light which i saw. was it an artificial light or what? did anyone other than me see it? i wont accept if u tell me that it was some sort of imagination, because i really did see it with my eyes wide open !   i am not a very spiritual person , so blving that the light was natural , is a bit difficult for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking forward for ur reply urs sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first it scared me because I thought it may be a large airplane flying extremely low. Then I realized that it was not moving. I got out of my car and looked. There was no sound. Then, I saw another set of bright white lights just to the north, approx. 150 yards from the first set. Again, no movement, no sound. the lights went off, then on again, then both went out. This happened approx. 1/4 mile from my home. I had never seen anything like this in the area before, nor since. I noticed 2 or 3 small airplanes flying from the west, from Wichita.

The edges were not smooth, but kind of jagged-almost like a sand dollar.  There were marks on the outside of the top of the object.  It was completely soundless and was bobbing up and down at the sides very much like a gigantic balloon.  As we watched the vehicle slowly moved westwardly and higher in the sky.  We got back in our car and breifly followed it, but it dissappeared into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We left Seattle in the morning, and around 11 p.m. we decided to look for a motel in Twin Falls, ID.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw road signs indicating that Twin Falls was within a few miles, so we began looking for the exit.  And we looked.  And we looked.  And we realized we had driven way too far, and must have missed it somehow, so we turned around and headed back the way we’d come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ahead of us, we saw something that at first appeared to be an airplane in the distance, but its flight pattern and speed seemed off.  The light came close enough for us to see the underside of the object, and we both knew instantly that it was a UFO.  The lights on the underside were rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object never got close enough for us to determine its shape.  We parked on the side of the road and watched as the object moved across the sky and disappeared behind some mountains.  Then we got in the car and continued to drive towards Twin Falls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turns out we had indeed missed Twin Falls, and we had also somehow failed to see 2 exit signs.  We weren’t paying close enough attention to the time, so I’m not sure if we were missing time, but we could never figure out how 2 people who were looking could fail to see 2 exit signs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My husband, taller than I, saw approximately 16 lights.  He saw them first.  When he realized it was not the moon or any star, he called me ( approximately 2 minutes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went onto the front porch, I saw in the sky, in the timberline, approximately 12 or more lights in the sky.  The lights were in two horizontal rows or appeared to be.  I could make out approximately 6 lights or more in a row.  The lights were sort of amber in color, but very bright.The lights were too far for me to see any particular shape to the formation other than straight lines.  My first thought was stadium or ballpark lights,  we watched for approximately 1 to 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened and could hear no sound other than the air conditioner and the television.  I grabbed my shoes and took off for our truck to get our binoculars so that I could get a better look.  I grabbed the binoculars and took off down our road at a fast walk or trot.  My husband was following about 20 foot behind and our son had stopped at the end of the drive.  I had gone approximately 40 foot just getting ready to look with the binoculars when the lights went out.  Just like flipping a switch.  Our son came onto the front porch a few seconds  after I went out.  He thought it was flares or something. So, he saw the lights. He also mentioned that we should check that area regarding the livestock. I called the local Sheriff&#39;s office and the State Police to see if anyone had called in a sighting or saw something unusual.  Both departments said, no.  We lived in a rural area.  Very small and very quiet.  We have lived here for 2 years we go out at nigjt to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is wildlife in this area and we have livestock. To date we have never seen anything like what we saw tonight.  We are close to Fort Smith, Arkansas which has a small airport and an &#34;Air National Guard&#34; we are used to occasional sights and sounds of some of these type aircraft.  What I saw tonight did not fit into any previously seen or heard aircraft.  I wish I could have gotten closer before the lights went out.  I&#39;m 51 years of age, my husband is 53 and our son is 15.<n>

It appeared like birds but only to big to be birds. Because they covered the ball, it appeared they were startled from the lighting and they flew into a boomerang type formation. There was a yellow glow at first turning to red as they drifted southeast, towards Canada.  When the lighting lit up the sky, the top of the building lit up white.  Thats when it appeared to me that angels were taking off.  I know it sounds silly but this is what I saw. I was not drinking nor do I use drugs and had a restful nights sleep the night before.<n>

My mother saw something that caught her eye and stopped the car.  Directly in front of us was a strange formation of lights.  I can&#39;t say how high it was, as I&#39;m a horrible judge of measurement, but I assumed it was  a helicopter.  The thing was, however, that the lights didn&#39;t look like any lights I&#39;ve seen on a helicopter at night.  They were a bluish white and made out the shape of an oval, as it was dark, I could not make out the shape, I would assume it was some sort of disk, however, the lights only gave me a 2 dimensional feel of the object.  I rolled down the window of the car to try to hear the rotors of a helicopterm by it&#39;s distance, it should have been audible, however, I didn&#39;t hear a thing.  At this point my little sister started panicking a little bit, and the shape started to move; very slowly.  My mother decided to follow where it was going, as it seeme! d to be following the road we were on.  This chase occurred for a few minutes, and then as it was passing some trees, the object gained speed and suddenly disappeared from our line of sight.  Now the part that bothers me about the whole thing isn&#39;t the sighting itself, as is the fact that my sister nor my mother remember seeing anything.  All I get from them whenever I ask them is a weird look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is illogical.  Correct date, based on the report description, should be August 18, 2002, we presume.

It moved slowly to the left then down and right before our eyes it disappeared, just like someone turned off a light. I had a hp digital camera and she went to grab it but the flash didn&#39;t work; she most likely dropped it earlier.

Within a second or two I observed what I initially thought was a second blue light, but in fact what I was seeing was the original blue lite moving rapidly to the southwest roughly parallel with the interstate hiway.   Although it isw impossible to accurately guage distances without a benchmark it is my estimate that the blue lite was not more than 10 miles north of the interstate at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  I had this lite in my view for approximately 8-10 seconds and saw it move at a speed that I believe was in excess of 500 mph.  I was driving northeasterly on the interstate at approx 80 mph so the lite and my car were more or less passing each other in opposite directions.  I called my wife&#39;s attention to the lite (she was a front seat passenger) and she was able to see the lite momentarily by looking over her shoulder through the back window of the car (something I could not do as a driver)   She saw the lite for only an instant before it disappeared into the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these events took place approximately opposite the Colorado DOT truck inspection station on the south side of the interstate several miles west of Ft. Morgan Colo.  I am convinced that the blue lite that I saw was not on an aircraft given its speed of movement and its relatively lo altitude.  In fact I have never seen an aircraft display a blue lite while in flight.I don&#39;t have a lot else to add to this report, but would be happy to answer additional questions if someone wishes to call me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is confusing.

We arrived at the beach shortly before midnight. The water was strange that night. If you placed your hand under the surface and churned the water it would glow a light green. Treading the water with our feet caused the same effect. I felt like I was witnessing a miracle. Shortly before dawn(about 5am)all of us simulataneously looked to the sky and noticed what looked like a falling star. It descended into the atmosphere and headed straight towards the bulkhead of the thunderstorms hovering over the Gulf that had been threatening to rain us out.  The three of us watched quitely as this object pulsed and spun at an amazing rate of speed, flashing colors of red, blue, purple, white. This object then began to &#34;play&#34; with the storm, circling the bulkhead. I told my husband it appeared to be drawing energy from the bulkhead as it would grow brighter when it would approach the storm. Several times it disappered into the storm. After about 20 minutes we noticed a second object hovering near the storm. It never approached the storm, but was the same size, pulsing with the same colors as the first object. We watched these objects for about an hour. When sun&#39;s light began to fill the sky all of the stars disappeared, but these two objects remained faintly visible. We continued to watch them until even they were no longer visible. On the ride home we all agreed that it felt as if they knew we were there and had allowed us to witness this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your interesting report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illumination coming from the water probably was due to a phenomenon called, &#34;phospho-luminescence.&#34;  It is caused when micro-organisms in the water are disturbed at night...they give off a soft, whitish-blue or greenish light, and it is beautiful.  If you ever take a cruise on a large ocean vessel in waters where luminescence is present, for a beautiful view of the phenomenon, I suggest you stand on the fantail and look at the wake behind the ship.  It is beautiful!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regard to the streaking light, it may have been a meteorite, although we will never know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hovering bright lights may have been celestial bodies...stars or planets.  There are some very bright, quite colorful &#34;twinkling&#34; stars in the morning sky during the fall, so that may be the explanation for those objects you saw.  Generally, a genuine UFO does not hang around for an hour, or so, although there are exceptions to that statement that we know about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your response to my report, however I have witnessed at least five meteorites enter our atmosphere, throwing off a bright florescent green tails behind them as they came.  One of them was only 500 yards above our heads and fell into a Ryder Truck parking lot, a chain link fence topped with razor wire being the only thing that kept us from retrieving it.  The &#34;falling star&#34; I spoke of had no tail  At first it was the size of the stars, moving in an arch across the sky, but it soon descended into Earth&#39;s atmosphere and headed straight towards the thunderstorm.  A planet or &#34;celestial body&#34; does not whirl about in space, pulsing and appearing to grow larger/brighter as it approached the bulkhead.  If Mars would be the size of a grain of sand, what we saw was approximately the size of a lintel/pea held at arms length.  We distinctly saw the oval shape of the object and that it appeared to spin on an axis and pulsate between and oval shape and a circle, flashing colors of purple, blue, red, and white.  I hadn&#39;t browsed through sightings listed on your website before I filed my report, and now that I have I realize that what we witnessed doesn&#39;t even compare to most sightings, and due to your response to my report I fear you won&#39;t post it on your sightings page.  Which is why I would like to revise a few sentences in my report if possible, adding that the &#34;falling star&#34; had no tail and I said &#34;star&#34; because when we noticed it, it was the size of the stars, but grew larger as it entered our atmosphere.  I would like to thank you for clearing up our questions about the water that night, this phenomenon being the second most beautiful thing I&#39;ve witnessed during my life.  Please respond and let me know if I can revise a few of my statements or re-file the report with the statements I&#39;ve added here.  I would hate to think one of the few people in the world who would believe in what we saw would discredit our report due to my inability to express the moment as clearly as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your time and patience.

(my dad is a pilot- i&#39;m pretty familiar)  Then it was as if they saw us- we were on I-5 heading south and one appeared on the left side of us on the other side of the freeway and was going the same speed as us (75-80 mph). It was at the same height as our small truck- maybe a few feet higher. It started swaying from side to side like it was going to crash.  It stayed with us for about one minute and then dove down into the corn field and completely disappeared.  We kept looking back and never saw it or any others again.  It looked like a long cigar with a white and I believe a green light on each end pointing forward (i guess they can&#39;t see in the dark:-) ).  They were about 50 ft. long.<n>

I worked as  a Peace Corps volunteer in nearby Nikolayev (Mykolayiv), and a Ukrainian friend of mine and I went to the beach for a weekend.  At approximately one AM, as we sat on the beach with a third individual, we saw what we believed to be a satellite moving from southeast to northwest in the sky.  In the dark skies away from Ukrainian cities, satellites can easily be seen tracking across the sky.  This appeared similar in color and in speed as it crossed the sky, until it began doing 90 degree zig zags and altering its speed several times, occasionally coming to a near stop.  It had to have been very high or very far away, but it was obviously very fast and very mysterious.  This incident was witnessed by me and two Ukrainian friends/acquaintances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A night on the ranch is usually quiet and calm but not this night as I felt the cattle were a little uneasy. I was the first to witness as the wife was inside making some drinks. It began with cattle bcoming more destressed and as I went to investigate thats when it happened. A low but very clear huming noise coming from northern hills, myself I was feeling alittle uneasy as the cattle were never like this. The noise incresed to an even deeper hum although nothing was visible at this stage. The wind began to pick up and from over the hills came something moving in the distance. A very bright object traveling very fast, it moved over my head at a low altitude. At that point I called the wife. As she arrived I had my eyes fixed on the object, I heard my wife ask what was wrong but then I could feel fear coming over her as well. Our eyes were both fixed on this single disk shaped object which moved off into the distance. At that point I thought our sighting was over but how wrong I was. The craft not only returned in our direction but also reduced its speed. The craft almost came to a standstill about 150metres away from us. The ship just hovered for I am guessing a time 7mins. THe ship then took off at a great speed and then circled back over our heads and that what the lsat we saw before it travelled south.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The more we looked at it the more everyone agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was verticle and, cylinder shaped and very bright, like crome.  It looked as though it was going straight up in the sky and gaining  altitude. The craft had a very small after burn, or trail of smoke, but very, very short.  I took five pictures with my 35mm camera, but it did not pick up the trail of smoke. It all took place in about five minutes.  As soon as it was there ....it was gone out of sight.

It may have been up several thousand feet or more.  It appeared to be a round bright red light. The size, relative to arms length was about 0.15 inch in diameter. It was like looking at a really bright LED from 20 feet. The sun was behind me, not obscured by clouds and may have been illuminating the object uniformly, if it was translucent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be self-illuminated, it&#39;s red light seemed to be brighter than it should have been from ordinary reflected light. The only thing I can think of that would get the same visual effect, would be a large red tinted mirror reflecting the sun directly to me. The light intensity didn&#39;t vary at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told the other person at the field to look up at the &#34;red light&#34; above my plane, he said &#34;what is that&#34;? Later, he said it must be a &#34;weather balloon&#34;.  The object was in view for about 2 to 3 minutes as it moved SE (the direction of the prevailing wind at ground level).  The object suddenly disappeared as it approached almost over head. The object was sighted at about 50 degrees elevation and went to about 80 degrees before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was keeping an eye on my RC plane, I&#39;m not sure if the object was moving when I first sighted it. For the first 10 or 15 seconds, it didn&#39;t seem to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had an instant fear that it was somthing like a very large meteor heading right at us (since it didn&#39;t have a tail).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The RC plane is very light and flies very slowly. I was able to orbit the plane between me and the object so I could watch both of them at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it had not just disappeared, I would be more inclined to believe it was some kind of high visibility weather balloon. We didn&#39;t see anything (like a parachute) falling in the area (Burlington MA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have 20/15 vision and today the sky was clear enough easily to see hawks flying in thermals at several thousand feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does the weather bureau use this kind of bright red translucent balloon? Do they release them on Saturday mornings?<n>

The object was approximatly 100 feet above me in the sky. There was no sound, no propellers, no windows, no doors, nothing. Approximatly 50 feet or so in front of me the object disappeared before my eyes. The side facing the east was shinier because the sun&#39;s rays was reflecting off of it. It&#39;s hard to guess the size of the object but if I had to take a guess I would say it was about half the size of a Voltswagon (Beetle). Later that same week I saw the object again. It was much further away from me then and higher in the sky. This object also disappeared as I was oberving it. Both obsevations were on cloudless days, against blue skies.<n>

We were at Saltspring Island looking out over the water towards the sunrise. The sun hadn&#39;t risend yet but it was pretty light out. I noticed and light in the sky by some trees. It was definetley not moving like a plane or anything that i&#39;ve ever seen. It wasn&#39;t moving in a straight line like planes or helicopters do, it was wavering and bumbling along slightly and flying quite fast. I turned to me friend and asked her if that could be a plane and she said that it was moving way to fast to be a plane. I was just about to take a picture when it dissapeared behind some tree tops. Saltsping isn&#39;t a very populated island and I doubt that any planes or aircrafts would be flying about at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was up late with a friend. I noticed the lights in the sky. My friend that they always see them. I began to noticed that there were approximately 15 in the sky. Some above 2 to the west but mostly all of them were in the eastern sky. A few seem to be in a distinct pattern 3 verticly and 1 on either side. We also noticed movement on a  couple of them. I viewed them through binoculars and there appeared to be the the same light pattern on all objects. Half red, half blue. They stayed in the same position all morning long (0300-~0530).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the ASU physics and astronomy dept. to get more info on satelite characteristics. I also read up on the internet about satelites. Nothing I read could explain or com close to the characterstics of these lights/objects. They suggested it was possibly aircraft or dirty binoculars. Absolutely not! An airplane cannot hold it pattern like that and the binoculars were clean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are still up there at night and numerous people in town have noticed them.<n>

It was the same size and brightness of the other stars in the sky, and was obviously not a plane due to the high altitude.  it looked like it was barely in our atmosphere, if at all.  It seemed to be travelling rather quickly for the altitude, came to a complete halt, made several drastic turns, stayed for about 4 or 5 minutes, the seemed to shoot straight up and disappear.<n>

My sister and her boyfriend saw this happening, so they decided to call my name. About a minute later, when I was outside, the next light appeared. Again, a small blue light, this time traveling in a straight line, and it seemed to go faster than a normal plane would travel. This one faded away quickly too. After a couple minutes the 3rd and final light appeared. My neighboor saw this too, because he asked himself why we were gazing at the clear black sky and so he went outside. This one also travelled in a straight line, again seeming to go a faster than normal airplanes would travel. After a couple of seconds the light disappeared, slowly fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained outside for a bit longer but I went back in, because nothing happened after that. I&#39;m not saying it was an alien craft, but the zig-zag-movement and the color in particular made it a very strange event, which I&#39;ve never seen before.<n>

I then asked her if she&#39;d ever seen a star that low as it appeared to be just above the horizon of the ocean. She said no. She said that if in an hour its gone we should get suspicious.

I looked up to see two jet airliners heading northeast. as the first jet got closer I noticed a ball of light coming out of the northern sky.  It looked like It was going to hit the plane but it was only 1000 to 2000 feet up and the plane was 20000 feet up.  I could not believe the pilot did not see it and then banked left to avoid.  The plane following  made a slight turn left all the planes that night made same turn to avoid this spot.  a couple hours later I watched five balls of white light playing in eastern sky and for some reason I sensed they knew I was watching them.  the five of them hid in a star formation cassipeia ?  I knew they were there but they did not move. I never took my eyes off of them. a half hour has gone by still no movement.  then I notice dim light 150 feet away from me on ground.  I went over to see it closer. it was 5 lights very dim shining on ground on  the same spot they were over lapping one ano! ther. I was still watching them and they were watching me. I went back to where I was sitting. another 30 to 45 minutes went by still no movement. I had to go in the house but did not want to leave. so I called there bluff. I went to where the lights were shinning on ground looked up at them and said I must be seeing things? so I shrugged my shoulders and headed toward house. the whole time watching them while I walked away from them. when I got to my door out of there sight all five of them moved off there spots and headed in a southeast direction. I yelled at them as they drifted off I knew you were there! this is only one of very many sightings I see most happen first week of august to the third week. I also have abduction story in Alaska. and many in house abduction were at night they come take blood and put things in me or take things out of me.  I would like to go to hospital but I get this feeling I would be betraying them I feel they have helped me. and they really like my A negative blood every 3 months more needle marks appea! r. well I will end this here. good bye and may alien be with you!<n>

My children and I were swimming at my mothers house. It was shortly after dinner time, but the sun was still above the trees. They live outside the city on and acre of land and recently had 5 very large trees removed from the backyard in order to put in the swimming pool. We are about 25 miles away from Akron/Canton Airport so we are used to seeing aircraft flying overhead. Those traffic lanes are generally East-West and NorthEast-West.  We also have several small airports nearby where little two-seaters and bi-planes take off and land. What made us stop and stare at this particular craft was that it was flying at about 2-3000 feet and going from North to South. The craft was shaped like a missle almost, but there were no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL. The sun (which was in the west) appeared to be reflecting off the exterior of the craft, yet as it traveled south, the glare never stopped. If you have ever watched an aircraft pass overhead, there is always a point where the sun is no longer reflected off the aircraft and back in your eyes and you can get a better look. This was not the case. What I originally took to be sun glare (bright white) must have been lighting of some kind. My mother (58) and step-father (60) both saw it and we discussed it for almost an hour after it was gone. Two of my 4 children also remember seeing it, but have nothing new or remarkable to add.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a crop duster plane or something. It then lifted back up, as if it was aborting its landing and made a complete about face while flickering the row of 3 lights on and off...the lights were brighter than halogen and when they were off there was a small red and blue light.  I was thinking it was gone but woke up my husband to tell him what I saw.  While I weas waking him up it came directly at me at only a height of 2-3 stories, and flicked its lights off and on in my eyes almost making me not be able to drive.  I thought for sure it was trying to land on the freeway ...it then about faced again, at which time my husband awakened...i told him nervously we &#34;were being chased by a UFO&#34;...as I finished the explanation of what I saw he said &#34;you mean THAT? and it was directly above my...spotlighting me and literally chasing us at an extreme low altitude.  We came up on an overpass and we were sure it was going to hit it.  I accelerated to avoid the impact, and the craft dodged the overpass...followed us a moment longer then immediately almost disspeared.  It had a stealth like shape...and was almost paper thin...with huge lights on the front and maneuvered like no conventional craft.

Sometimes they were deviating from each others, and after that they were regrouping, but always distinctly. It was flying together, but independantly too. Their moves in any direction were very rapid and sudden. It was no plane, no satellite, nor known astronomic phenomenon or meteorit, wich I know very well. It was disappearing to the North-East in about 1&#39;. I did&#39;nt have the time to call my wife who was sleeping in the room with open door on the garden where I was standing. It was flying very high, in my opinion, minimum at jetflight&#39;s heigth. It was completely silent. The 5 lights magnitude were similar with Ursa Major eyesvisible stars.<n>

We got in the car and started driving. A local golf course is nearby and it is a very wide open space. We pulled in there and saw the jets all going into the same direction. We then saw a huge yellow bright light staying in one spot over the field. It was maybe 2,000 feet over the field. Jets were still flying towards it. We stared at it for about 15 seconds...it was still making no sound and did not move at all. We checked for flashing lights to see if it was a plane, there was nothing. When the jets started to get close the object and light in the sky totally disappeared. It did not move in any direction...just fanished. The jets started to just circle around. We got freaked out and immediately left.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, her boyfriend, and her father, and they seemed sincere in their respective descriptions of what they allegedly had witnessed.

(2)  It was obviously MOVING at a slow but deliberate pace (again, I could best compare the speed to that seen with airplanes on their landing approach.  Next, I pulled my car over to the shoulder of the highway for a better look (as it seemed unusual to see aircraft in this vacinity (as it is very close to Vandenberg AFB and their no-fly zone).  There were only a few cars on the highway and this was a very clear night (no fog or clouds).  -Star visibility was good.  I watched the craft/light move southwest (towards the coast) when it appeared that the light did a gradual fade to light green...then solid/deep green (as if someone were controlling it with a dimmer switch to control its intensity of color and brightness).  I continued to watch the light for about a minute more and again, it faded; but this time it gradually dimmed completely out and I could not locate it within the clear night sky.  I am familiar with satellites, but must stress to you that this light was very low in the night sky (at low-flying airplane altitude.  I also am familiar with iridium satellites and their tell-tale green flashes.  This light did not flash at all and was much brighter than any satellite I have seen.  Even though the craft was low in the sky, I could not make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to NUFORC, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.  We have spoken with her about the sighting, and we have no explanation for what it was she witnessed.  The object was moving to the southwest, which rules out most satellites.  Also, as she watched the object fly from her right to left, she witnessed a green light, which rules out any kind of conventional aircraft.  PD))<n>

We were a few hundred feet north of delaware street in the parking lot of the elementary school there in this real small town of 3000.  When we examined the sky a bit more, we noticed that upwards and to our left was a shining silver sphere with no visible markings.  The temperature of the craft seemed to be much different than the atmosphere because there was a mirage around the whole thing in the clouds, just like a jet&#39; s rocket.  Once this jet got to the altitude of the craft it headed straight for it, but alas could not keep up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m guessing this lasted for 2 minutes and we saw the jet remaining in the sky for a minute or so after the craft was out of sight.

I was working outside in the back yard and looked up to see a silver sphere. The object was in the north and it was flying in the eastward direction.  The object was moving to fast to be a civilian plane or a commercial plane at the altitude that I was looking at. I would have seen some type of wings, the rate at which the object was flying was extremely fast which is what got my attention other wise I would have just dismissed it as a plane that was going to land at the airport given the time of day.  The object came across the sky and then stop for about 5 seconds from the angle that I was view the object would have put it just south of the Lancaster airport but still in the airspace of the airport. The object was stationary for about five seconds then started to move east again slowly and then just took off out of my view to fast for my eyes to follow. When I first spotted the object it was a silver dot and as it moved closer the object started to take shape I could see that it was an sphere and the object was silver in color. It was definitely not an airplane. There were no lights that I could see. I just discover this site 4/22/03 and would have reported it sooner had I known about it to have give the exact times and dates. I don’t know if or even how to find out if the airport had a track on the object or even if they keep a record of it.

We were above the clouds. I was just enjoying the beauty of the sky and clouds when I noticed off in the horizon a silver oval, barely visable, but flying at the same speed as our plane. I leaned closer to the window across my husbands lap to get a better view. I told him to look but he could not see anything. I kept trying to point it out. He accused me of making a scene. I watched and wondered if I was seeing a UFO. I sat back and thought about it, and when I leaned over to look again I noticed another aircraft flying towards the silver oval. This other aircraft looked like it was painted in military camouflage. I tried to tell my husband again, but he was scorning the idea. The clouds began to cover my view so I could not see anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What makes this odd to me is this....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier this year I had a dream that I was chasing some sort of aliens that were jumping and swimming along the coast.

I never did catch up to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the UFO I went camping with family on the beach 2 weeks later. I heard something out in the water with headlights. I grabbed a flashlight and it was deja`vu. I was running along the beach with a flashlight chasing something that was in the water. I never did see what it was as they went out into the ocean. Some of my family say it was jetskiers, some believe, like I do, that it was aliens. K<n>

The flash was large enough to light up both of my neighbors houses and my house.  About 2 to 3 seconds later a heard a noise, like a jet plane hitting its afterburners. I looked up into the direction that the flash and noise came from.  I saw what I can only call contrails, but being at night they where lite up.  Simalar to what the tail or a star or metorite might leave. The really odd thing was the trail of now disapating light went from the lower star in the Big Dippers ladel to the first star in the handle of the Big Dipper.

Left to right then left to right etc.  After a few minutes it would seem to shoot out red beams in a straight line and then in a triangluar form.  We continued to watch as it would fade and brighten.  The light was only white at this point and then a light orange.  It faded completely it did not move off just faded off.  It came back momentarily then faded altoghter. We have seen strange lights with strange movements on three other ocassions.  Not all were observed by the same family members.<n>

Seconds later the light crossed over us.  We both thought it was a police helicopter until we realized that it made no sound.  To our surprise the light then appeared again to our rear and hovered just to the side of road.  Slowing down to see what happened we observed the red light change shape several times - round to diamond to round to diamond to round...  Then two small round blue lights shot out of it and they all moved out of sight.  We wondered if it might be some sort of govt./military stealth aircraft.<n>

After about 12 miles, I saw up ahead what looked like a small plane making &#34;touch and go&#39; landings.  There were three lights and the craft made what seemed like approaches and barely touched the ground and then arose again into the sky.  It took a bit to realize that there is NOTHING out in the desert there; no habitation and certainly no airport.  As I drew closer, the lights would change from a V formation into one single light, then into another formation or another alignment.  I saw that it would go over the road to the right (north) and then go very low to the ground, swing up and over the road again and hover on the south side then return in the same pattern.  I crossed the road after a sweep and looked out of my window and up about 500&#39; to see the three lights havering at about l0:00 south.  The lights were very white and bright, narrow in focus and appeared to be in a southerly direction and there was no sound at all coming from it.  As I just passed it, the light nearest me started a slow turn in my direction and I kept on going, not frightened or threatened but nervous and with the purposeful message that &#34;they&#34; were working and I should keep on going.  I could not tell if it was one craft that morfed into shapes or if it was a configuration of three different lights.  My instinct says that there were three lights but I have no proof.  i continued on the road but stopped up ahead and the craft(s) continued to go in the same pattern and did so as I then drove off and watched in my rear view mirror.  I would approximate that there was a total of 8 or 9 passes that I observed during the + or - 1/2 hour that the event took place.  I cannot stress how desolate and uninhabitated the area in question is.  It is desert land and not an open range.<n>

Fast moving and odd..not plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend, son and I were camping and laying out watching the stars and around midnight on the fifteenth I saw what looked like two shooting stars coming out of the corner of my eye.  It confused me because it didn&#39;t seem normal, as we hadn&#39;t seen much all night.  It moved closer and we could all make out a dark round silloutte illuminated a little lighter then the sky (gray).  It moved very quickly left to right and then did that same movement about three times.  Suddenly it darted out above the trees and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It made no sound and didn&#39;t fly like a jet could.  It moved too fast back and forth (side to side).  I am still kind of in shock.  Never gave UFO&#39;s much thought.  We all saw it though and we were all amazed.  Still is sinking in.  Hard to believe, but true none the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a very bright white light, very low to the ground - just above tree level.  I thought that it was a helicopter or something, so I slowed way down and kept looking at it.  It had two less brighter lights on the back.  I could not see any body form, just the very bright light up front and the two behind.  It was not moving and I did not notice any sound.  then, right before my eyes - I did not look away, I did not blink, it disappeared.  It just vanished and I could see a much lighter night sky again.  I mentioned this to a friend of mine that is a clan mother for the Onondaga Indians (Iroquois) and she said that there have been many sightings around the reservation and that her people have invited them to speak with their counsel of chiefs.<n>

It didn&#39;t seem to move and was stationary against the setting sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw another report and decided to post.

It looked exactly like the ship from the last scene of M.I.B 2 that is driven ny Will Smith but it was blue. I didn&#39;t notice that till after my grandpa died. He was the only one too believe me. I don&#39;t expect anyone too believe this but it only matters if I believe it. THe only two explanations that were possible to rule out was an alien space ship or a really advanced jet made by human beings. It was going about 6 g&#39;s and about a 100 yrds away from me and about 60 yrds from the roof of my house. This object left a very long trail that dipersed all most instantly behind it. This was the most memorable 15 seconds of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I did not see the plane, but saw a strange, boomerang shape, silvery and distant. The clouds are broken at around 8-10,000 feet,moving east, and this object was moving opposite the clouds, to the west, in and out of the clouds erratically. I had my wife keep an eye on it while I ran to get the binoculars and camcorder. Blinded from the sun, It took a while, 5 minutes to get back to looking. I saw the object through binoculars but could not get a fix on it with the camcorder. By this time, it was much higher, well above the clouds moving north then west, then back north. Through the binoculars the shape was clearly boomerang and would stop motionless for several seconds then move again. Each time, in a different trajectory, but generally northward until I lost it behind a cloud. I&#39;m glad someone besides me saw it, but wow!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

My 3 year old daughter said &#34;mommy what is that&#34; as she pointed acrossed the street. It is almost 8 pm and the sun was setting and the Sears building at the Sea-Tac Mall was a bright orange color. I said &#34;silly, it is a building&#34;. She moved her finger to aim higher saying &#34;no that, what are those&#34; she asked adamantly! I was holding her up in my arms and could not answer her as I continued to try and figure it out for myself. I turned to ask someone in the parking lot if there eyes were better than my (20/20 vision). She was just getting out of her car, looked up and said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; and walked to the store. I was hoping that they would come up with some brillant insight for this occurrence or at least see something more clear than apparently me. I stood there watching what seemed to be a mixture of possibilities but no one answer; Blue Angels Jets, lost small bundle of balloons, birds or something I can&#39;t identify with....<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)Blue Angels, were in town for the hydroplane races for the week of August 6th, but not too likely that they would still be in town. I mention them because when I was watching them at the races sometimes they would go into different pattern and would get so high in the sky that they would almost look like little dots in the sky. After seeing the Blue Angles I could determine that these four things did not fly like the jet, but seemed to be floating or drifting to the SouthWest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)Lost small bundle of balloons is kind of the best way to discribe their casual movement toward the airplane flight route. They were all the same size... like bally black ovals, but not balloons! Three of these objects danced around, but not in front of one that seemed to have more of a focus. They were higher than the airplanes that where flying by, but for example they seemed like three playful cubs, staying close to their mother as they went for a walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)Birds... well there was something in the clear blue sky, but I will difinitely protest to chalk it up to a flock of birds flying south for the winter, especially since it is still summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)Something I can&#39;t identify with.... it was the way that these objects moved that intrigued me! Moving slowly at a SW angle, yet almost hopping up and around another. I saw them moving from four high, diamond, almost v-ish to three high and one in front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking up as I loaded the bags, still trying to think of an answer for my daughter repeated question, but &#34;I don&#39;t know was the best I could do&#34;. I looked up again and they were gone!!! I called my step dad and asked him to get out the telescope and told him what I just saw.<n>

This time the object seemed to have disappeared and in a blink of an eye was about 500 feet above and in front of our vehicle.  It seemed like a flash frame, it was far away then right above, as if it were trying to see us.  Just like that it was far away again, then disappeared for good.  It felt as though it had tracked us from Georgia and wanted us to see it.  It seemed to have green lights when it came close, but like I said it happened so fast that it was only a split second, and the human eye cannot seem to catch a good look in such a small time.  Truly amazing!  The only camera I had was disposable and the photo I tried to take didn&#39;t even collect any traces of an image, it was so far away.<n>

At first i thought it was a airplane flying low due to the rain an lighting at the time.But i notice that this craft was round an white with flashing lights an very large like a jumbo jet..the prolbem with this is that a jumbo jet isnt round an silent,nore dose a jumbo jet fly so very low over peoples homes.i,ve never seen anything like it befor.i watch the local news to see if there was any reports of ufo,s or people reporting seeing ufo,s but there wasnt anything on the news.I wanted to report this but i didnt know who to report this to.Due to the angel of the direction the ufo was going i belive it was heading towards(or near )  Edmonton,s International airport. Iam haveing a hard time excepting what i saw but it was amazing to see it.Iam hopeing other people saw this as well. I,ve allways belived in ufo,s but never thought i would see one for my self.<n>

Lauderdale Florida aboard the SS Oceanbreez cruise ship on a 2 night cruise to Nassau, I was laying on reclining chairs watching the meteor shower at just before 3 am.  As I was talking with a friend I had met on board when she pointed to the sky and sat up saying,&#34;What is that?&#34;  I followed a light about the brightness and size of a star that appeared to be a satellite because of its steady and unvarying course.  Just as I was about to tell her it was a sattelite, the object stopped and made a 90 degree S-turn to the Southwest- We were heading Northwest.  Then the object returned the other direction towards the Northeast and then back to the North until it faded out of view.  The sky was very clear directly above our heads where we observed the object, but I can&#39;t be certain if it just disappeared into the mist of the clouds near the Northern section of sky or just faded by the sudden increase in distance.  In all, my time seeing the object was between 10-12 seconds, but the friend I was with said she observed it moving in a little circle just before she called my attention to it.  The friend I was with holds a Masters degree in Psychology and I myself am a pilot. This created a spectial interest to me because while trying to explain what we experienced, I know it could not have been any aircraft known to the public at this time.  I&#39;ve seen the best of fighter jets and they don&#39;t maneuver with such smooth and sudden turns and with no sound.  As far as I know as well, satellites do not make 90 degree turns in their orbit.  We considered the possibility of a bird, but this object was illuminated, with a white possible slightly red tinted light which was steady until it dissapeared.  I waited another 45 minutes, but nothing was observed a second time.<n>

I did not notice how long it had been there, but it caught my eye.  I thought it might be landing gear lights on an airplane but the airport is in the opposite direction, the object was traveling in the opposite direction, and the object was high in the sky.  The light was aimed towards the city as I think the object might have been at an altitude that normal aircraft fly, although it was hard to say.  The light was very bright, seeming like the object was just 5-10 thousand feet in the air (like a hot air balloon), then, as the light began to weaken, the object seemed to travel farther away (the trajectory path was not altered).  After 5-6 seconds, the light completely disappeared and the object looked like a speck in the sky (like a satellite).  My wife was sitting with me but I just thought it was a plane and did not tell her what I saw until the light went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not get a detailed look at the craft, all I saw was a bright light in the sky.  I like to think of myself as someone that doesn&#39;t get fooled very often and is very skeptical of certain things.  I don&#39;t see but maybe one other explanation other than a U.F.O.  The news has been broadcasting clips about shooting stars or something to do with meteor showers.<n>

As I stopped I looked up over some trees a little distance away and notice a very large ovil shape object with four bright yellowish lights in the sky. It took a second for me to realize that it was a foriegn object, but once I had I noticed that it moved very slow across the horizon of the trees.

I went blank.  Two hours later I awakened.  I was still standing and there were two incisions on my abdomin<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information about the wound.  Witness identifies self as a medical professional.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Kenny Young and Donnie Blessing for following up on this report.  It appears that the original report was a hoax.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> After receiving the information on this story from Peter Davenport I tried calling the phone number that was provided to me from the contact info.  The number 724-((deleted)) belongs to an ((deleted))  agency by the name of ((deleted)) in Sharon, Pa. This place seemed to never be open after trying to call every<n> <n><n> day for several weeks.  I would leave messages for Dr. ((deleted)) to call me.<n> <n><n> The calls were never returned.  At one point I finally reached a receptionist.  When asked for a Dr. ((deleted)), she replied there is a ((deleted)) who works here but he is not a doctor.  I asked to speak to him and was told he was not there much and to leave a message. I left my name and number again.  The call was never returned.  In the mean time I was discussing this with Kenny Young.  He tried to call many times also.  He also got the run around by the same receptionist who, by the way, said they were open every day.  That was not true. Finally he was able to reach Mr. ((deleted)) after a 2 month battle with unreturned calls and no one in the office.  Mr. ((deleted)) informed Kenny that he had filed the report for someone else.  He would not disclose who it was.  He told Kenny that he would pass along Kenny&#39;s name and number to the claimant.  Of course Kenny nor I have heard anything from the claimant. I have concluded that this case was a hoax.  The reasons why I believe this to be so are the following:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. I believe that Mr. ((deleted)) knew we were trying to contact him and he refused to acknowledge our effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. He was evasive in comments made to Kenny when he was finally reached<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. When reporting the incident to NUFORC, we were led to believe that this happened to him personally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. He presented himself as a doctor in the NUFORC contact information and said he was leaving a medical building when this occurred.  He was a medical doctor.  He was not a doctor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. I believe that if he had been reporting this for someone else he would have stated that in the contact info instead of leading us to believe it was him this happened to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above reasons are why I had not gotten back to you on this case sooner.  Kenny and I were hoping that maybe there was a chance we would hear from the real claimant However, as of this date I conclude that this case is closed.

My boyfriend and I where on the way to my house and saw a giant object which at first seemed to be a plan. As it got closer we reliezed it was to big to be a plan. It was like a matallic silver and sort of a triangular shape mixed with the shape of a dimond. At the piont of  the dimond part where two giant red lights, on top a white one, on the back where two giant whinte ones. It was around for about five minutes andd while observing it, it disappered into thin air then would reappear in the same spot. Then it seemed to follow us and just dissaperd. The sky was clear that night. With our windows rolled down we assumed we would be able to hear a noise. It had to be about 100 feet in the air and not a singal sound was herd. There was only one.It also apperaed to have the three windows which would take turns flashing in a sequence.<n>

I saw a light about the size of Mars in the E/SE.  I thought it was a planet. Perhaps Mars. I saw it Move VERY slowly. That caught my attention. At arms length, it moved 4 inches. Tnis light was in the complete wrong direction of the meteor shower, which was coming more from a N/ NE direction.This was coming fromE/SE going to N/NW. After obeserving this very slow move for about ten seconds, it disappered! About 20 seconds later, it &#39;flashed&#39; on again, continuing in the same path it did. Then it went off, or at least was not visable any more. Most unusual. Right after that, I saw a bunch of the meteors coming from an entirely different direction. I feel that the light from this was not the I.S.S. It was too small. Not quite as large as Mars would be.<n>

Object would have been considered to have been at low altitude (approx. 1000 ft.)and traveling at high velocity within field of view for 1.5 seconds. The colors varied from a soft blue glow at the center that radiated out to eventually become white. Streaks from the rear outermost points were also white.<n>

The formations were single V, reversed V, multiple V&#39;s and a line, all changes were executing quickly and smoothly with no change on forward speed. I also experienced a deep sense of peace while watching these crafts fly over.<n>

I thought, when I first spotted it, &#34;satellite.... space junk.... space station???&#34;.  I watched it for about a minute or so (it wasn&#39;t moving very fast)... then it slowly changed into a fairly nice dot of light... then the dot started getting smaller and smaller and smaller... till it finally vanished.  I thought... well... I don&#39;t think that was a satellite and etcetera, nor even a meteor.  It made me think as it vanished though, that it was like... flying away from earth(?)<n>

All through the evening we had watched satellites passing in orbit through the sky. One of these satellites however appeared to &#34;flash&#34; on and off several times, as if the reflection from the sun was being blocked. This was not a normal flicker, but a repeated regular pattern, with the light source clearly switching on and off. The light itself was white as with all satellites. The flashing repeated probably 30 times (about half a second on and half a second off) as the object moved across the entire sky, without fading in strength as satellites normally do. We watched the object until it moved below the treeline. There was no sound during this time, and the object was definitely not a plane - too high, the light too small, and moving too fast. The object&#39;s path seemed constant and straight as it moved.<n>

It was like a searchlight and moved slowly to the right (east) before fading and disappearing. There was no sound and I estimate the elevation to be about 45 degrees.  The light was as bright as a car headlight and the size approximately the size of a car headlight at a distance of 100m.

The lights were more like shadowy shapes and were grey (sometimes changed to red) in appearance.  What we saw were bird-like in shape with the width (i.e. wing span) varying in width.  They generally moved across the Milky Way in approximately 5-7 seconds.  They started out dim, got brighter as they passed over and then dimmed.  At times they appeared stippled.  They almost moved like a wave in the water.  They moved in different directions across the sky.  Most of the time each shadow moved in a single direction, but rarely some changed direction as they moved.  Most of the time we saw one shadowy shape at a time, but occassionaly we would see two at a time moving in different directions. We saw approximately 50 during the half hour we viewed them.  We were viewing the Percieds at the best time of the year and saw many shooting stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses to the event, and they seemed to us to be both sincere and quite credible.

The &#34;object&#34; had an orangish glow not red and the boomerang or v shape broke up completely two or three times to form somewhat of a circle.  I was able to watch them long enough to determine with 99% certainty that what I was seeing was birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called two wild bird companies to find out what kind of bird migrates at 10:30 at night or later and could &#34;glow in the dark.&#34;  I was told that the  white faced ibis, for one migrates in v&#39;s, is brownish grey, and has luminescent feathers that will reflect light from the setting sun or possibly street lights.  I was told also that birds migrate at night and in this situation probably from the Great Salt Lake to Utah Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is one possible explanation for what we saw.

We all sat leaning back looking up at the stars. Very clear still and quiet night. We were enjoying being able to see clearly the events of the evening, a rare treat for England we are normally shrouded in cloud. We watched as the meteors made their occasional streaks of light across the night sky. We had been watching for about 50 minutes when from the East at around the 55 degrees mark from the horizon appeared 3 dull orange/Smokey coloured objects. They seem to drop into view rather than approach from a great distance. The object came towards us in a tight V formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they got closer they banked to their left giving us a very clear view of their entire underside. They crossed the sky in front and above us travelling from our left to right. At this point I thought I was looking at 3 large gliding birds the objects were completely silent. I quickly dismissed the bird thoughts as I looked closer I saw that the aircraft were similar to boomerangs with a bump or pip in the middle of the concave part of the boomerang which would be the back trailing edge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the 3 craft soared across the sky heading South West I stood up and walked forward to follow their progress, which would soon have been obscured, by neighbouring houses. I saw the formation head steadily along and then the craft to the left of the V formation seemed to flick into a quick shallow bank away from the other two which maintained exactly the same height and course. This was almost the same type of manoeuvre a pilot in formation may perform if he thought he was getting a bit close to another aircraft this convinced me that the craft were being piloted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I listened for engine noise, there was none. I can only estimate the height they were at as between 1000 and 3000 feet their speed was faster than conventional aircraft maybe a low flying military jet would be about the same sort of speed but would have defend us and woken up the whole street. These things, whatever they were, were like 3 hangliders travelling at jet like speed. They had no collision lighting or any other illumination. The whole body of the craft giving off this dull Smokey orange glow as I&#39;ve said before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has taken me a couple of days to make my mind up about reporting this I have always been very sceptical about the majority of reports. I am a serving Police Officer and regard myself as someone trained to give accurate accounts of what is seen.<n>

I had sat in a chair looking up into the sky, and had seen a few coming through the atmosphere. I had seen a few passenger jets go over, and noticed something moving to my left, i looked up and saw 2 dark grey objects, which i thought at first was a meteor breaking up. So i looked closer, i noticed that they werent meteors as they werent burning up. It was 2 UFO&#39;s, they looked triangular, although it was hard to see as they were dark grey against a black sky. The 2 objects were moving close to each other, occasionally moving apart, or one infront of the other, they were travelling from west to east at a very fast speed. I thought they may have been fighter jets, but there was no light from the rear as you would expect. They passed over head and had gone out of my vision in about 6 seconds, i listened out for any sounds that might tell if they were jets, but they were completly silent. So they must have been using propulsion technology that doesnt involve burning fuel as there was no sound, or no light from the craft. To me they looked af if they were travelling at about 6000ft, but as i dont know the exact size of the craft, i cant be sure, but they were moving very fast to have gone across the sky and out of my view in around 6 seconds.<n>

I was alone, everyone else had gone inside.  The embers from the fire over which we roasted our supper were still glowing warmly, beckoning me to sit by them.  No sounds but that of the crickets, owls and other denizens of the night did I hear.  I stared at the clear night sky, with its stars and moon shining brilliantly in all their glory, and then at the perfectly still, flawless surface of the river which reflected the scene in the sky magnificently.  It was as though I stood upon a plain between two skies, one above me and one below me, each an exact representation of the other.  Looking down I wondered that if I were to step off the dock would I truly plunge into the warm, placid water or would I in fact fall into the night sky?  Suddenly, on the glassy surface I spied a star that seemed to be moving!  &#34;Surely it is a satellite.&#34;  I told myself.  But it was much to large to be light reflecting off a satellite in orbit, and travelling much too quickly as well!  It made several arcs before me and it was then that I realized what I was bearing witness to.  It was not a man-made object encircling the globe from outside the atmosphere! It was right here, within our very skies, and it was not of this world!  I stood in stunned silence during the short duration of this spectacle and long after.  I never told a soul of this encounter, for fear of the ridicule by which our society meets such tales.  No, I have never, ever told a single soul...until now.<n>

Whilst watching I observed what I thought was a satellite.  I watched it move as slowly as a satellite for about 40 seconds (it seemed like longer) moving from north to south, then it sped up and made a sharp move to the left, moved in a wobbly semi circle, then moved back to the line it was on previously.  It then &#39;brightened/glowed&#39; then disappeared.  What I saw initially looked like a star, it moved the whole quarter of the sky.  It was not a meteor as that was happening in a different area of the sky and was much too slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object seemed to be on a  &#39;path&#39;, it could not have been a plane, it moved far too quickly in such a &#39;defensive&#39; or &#39;offensive&#39; manoeuvre.  I’d love to know what it was.<n>

There was absolutely no sound and it moved at quite a speed. The night was cloudless and moonless.It was not mentioned on the BBC news or Sky news and to this date no-one else apart from my daughter and I saw the object. My husband reckons it was a flock of geese but since when do geese have landing lights. Also there were no other lights as with an aeroplane just the orange lights<n>

It was traveling fairly slowing, and there were no strobe lights that would ordinarily be seen on an airplane. There was no audible sound.<n>

As I hit the curve after crossing the East Fork of the San Jacinto River I looked up over the trees and saw a large triangular shaped object in the sky.  It was covered in white lights that were not symmetric in the traingle.  I did not believe I saw it, so I looked again and it was still there.  As I preceded down the road the trees hide the object for a while.  Then I caught a glimpse of it but it had shifted directions and its side was facing me.  The side was rectangular and the outermost lights were white, then there were two green lights, and in the center there was red light. At that point I noticed a plane flying around the area in a circlular pattern.<n>

Looked up and saw a shape. First of all I thought it was seedpod or something floating on the breeze 10 to 15 feet up but on focussing properly I realised it was at least as high as any passenger planes 30 to 40,000 feet up. It was a silver &#34;craft&#34; comparitive in size to an airliner consisting of three equal arms around a small centre. It rotated every 2-3 seconds while travelling at speed 3 to 4 times that of airliners ( I live below a busy flightpath in central England)I leapt out of my sun lounger and watched the object disappear out of view after about another 7 seconds. I am a natural sceptic and I&#39;m also very interested in &#39;real&#39; science and I have neither seen or heard of anything like the thing I saw but I know what I saw. I was at once fascinated, amazed and excited. It was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept quiet about it until today even scanning my local newspaper for any report of the sighting but there was nothing. It wasn&#39;t a cloud formation because it was a beautiful clear day. It wasn&#39;t a fancy weather ballon or a child&#39;s kite it was powered and it was guided. I do hope somebody else saw it too but I am not afraid to tell of my sighting.

All during the time they were approaching Cygnus, the right front object was gradually decelerating, it did this until it was even with the rear object. The triangle pattern had now reversed. The reversal took the entire time that it took these 3 objects to cover the sky.  They proceeded in the reversed pattern until I could no longer see them. I watched them with 7x50 binoculars, where they looked pretty bright. Without the binoculars they were very visible because of their brightness; they apperaed to be as bright as gamma Aquila. They had no flashing lights, even in the binoculars, and did not &#34;wobble&#34; as satellights sometimes do. They also never appeared to drop in the sky, even as they travelled beyond the binocular range. It took nearly 9 minutes for them to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon! .  I was watching from a small city 10k population site with street lights...<n>

Ärzte hatte dem Bericht zufolge außerdem erklärt, viele Opfer könnten sich die Verletzungen unbewusst selbst zugefügt haben.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Die Dorfbewohner ließen sich davon jedoch nicht überzeugen. Ihrer Ansicht nach sind sie Opfer eines geheimnisvollen Fliegers, der vor allem nachts angreift. Die Menschen schlafen deshalb trotz der brütenden Hitze nicht mehr draußen, wie PTI berichtet.

I looked and first to mind it was a helicopter - but we could not hear it as we typically do for the Life Flight helicopter at the same distance and approximate altitude - which for the object we saw was about 8K feet above the water. I am a component engineer in the electronics design industry and am 46. The craft stayed - not hovering with movement - in one place and had two lights shine down to the water in cone shape with the wide part of the cone illuminating the water. The craft appeared to be a helicopter but had no wop wop sound. It shined a light toward our direction in the direction of east that was very bright as if to hide the outline of the craft while lighting up the water in an alternate sequence with each beam lasting about 2-3 seconds before switching to the other beam and often more rapidly then that. There were two red lights seen on the  craft separate from each other but close - if it were a private plane the red lights were about 10 feet apart. We watched the craft stay in one place doing all this for about 2 minutes. It then turned off the beams down to the water and the light shining east and came slowly east toward our direction for about a minute or so as if on a tightrope and then turned southerly angling toward Seatac airport at which time I saw a strobing white light in front of the craft, the two red lights, and then heard prop sounds typical of prop private airplanes and it continued flying toward Seatac. It was about 23:01 when I called the Burien police and told them and then called the Coast Guard at their prompting to tell them what we saw. I could not see the outline of the craf! t becaus e if was too dark outside. There was no green light on the craft at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be sincere.  He was familiar with the lighting pattern on civilian and military aircraft.  We express our gratitude to the U. S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue office in Seattle for forwarding the information to our Center.  PD))<n>

I began pointing out what various things look like in the sky. . .  planes, satalites, planets, etc, when in the northern sky I saw the familiar light.  It kind of looked like a planet, venus is in the southern sky right now and very beautiful, but it got much brighter.  It didn&#39;t necessarily flash, but it did increase in light intensity.  It then began to move in a Easternly direction and began to fade in light intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more I look up at night between 9:30-12:00 the more I&#39;m seeing this same phenomena.

Each time they look similar to stars, but increase and decrese in light intensity, change velocity and at times stop or curve in direction.  Anyone have any other ideas as to what this may be?<n>

Three bright lights in a straight line caught my eye as I was about 50 metres to my house. When I got out of the car and stood watching, I was still trying to comprehend what was going on. Three very bright and unusual lights were stationary in the sky, like hovering. They were redish in colour and looked quite far away. One of these started to move a bit. I sat at the car porch and they were there for about 10 minutes. Then they started to fade, as if flying further away. And then they dissapeared. Not planes, helicopters or statelite. They certainly looked very far away, so can&#39;t be lanterns(unless a very powerful lantern, because it&#39;s very high in the sky)<n>

At first I thought it was another plane, but there was no sound.  It looked round and not at all like a plane.  I would have dismissed it at that point as a balloon were it not for the color and speed of travel.  I ran to the house for binoculars and sure enough it was indeed round (spherical) in shape.

Was not any &#34;naked eye&#34; sighting involved. However, I did have a naked eye visual of one sphere later on, coming directly from exact East to West heading. Sphere was a bright golden/yellow color, with the light source appearing to be from the object itself and not reflective light from the sun. The weather was stable, not humid, and fairly clear sky, save for one small cloud formation. The sphere was about the size of a &#34;b-b&#34; held at arms length. It traversed  across about 1/3 of the sky in about 5 seconds, then entered the one small cloud and never exited the cloud. The sky past the cloud was very blue and clear and unobstructed and a good visual of the sphere sould have occurred had it left the cloud formation. It either &#34;blinked out&#34; in the cloud or perhaps ascended straight up?? There was no contrail coming from the sphere, no sparks, and it flew rapidly in a very straight trajectory. No sound  evident from it. Was  exactly the same type sphere as those in the photo I emailed to you and I  consistently have these sphere type objects show up in other developed &#34;sky&#34; photographs of mine, as well. Have had many anomalous craft appear in other photos, as well as visual sightings that I have reported to NUFORC and other organizations through most of my life. I have other sphere photos that may be of interest. The one I emailed was best for clarity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My friend was inside sleeping.  I was watching the metors for a while when I noticed a strange object in the sky off to my right.  It seemed to be just hovering there &amp; was dark in color.  At first, I just passed it off as some sort of metor or a star.  But after sitting outside for a while, I noticed it was still in the same area, justhovering.  If it was a metor or str it would have been moving, because the other strs &amp; metors in the sky were moving, but this was just hovering.  I got up from my seat and started string at it.  Then I relized it was metalic in color.  It was kind of low to the ground &amp; just hovering there, it had kind of a dome on top of it.  Then I decided to walk closer to get a better look at it. As I was walking closer to it, it just took off &amp; disappeared into the night sky.  This kind of gave me the chills &amp; scred me so I ended up going in the house afterwards &amp; not even finishing watching the metor shower.  This object was not really making any noise, except like a humming noise of some sort.<n>

I was out late in the evening walking my dog (lab/border c)and tryed to see the august metor shower. I could see some stars but their was some cloud present. Spring Valley is just a stream that comes out of a side of a hill and has carved out a little valley. It then became very quite, it felt as if the air pressure had changed, and the air curent was coming from above. The dog became aroused and when the air curent was coming from above the dog saught out low wood areas and tryed to keep me moving. When I looked above the sky was black and felt and very very heavy, the air curent became stonger and warmer.The presure made my ears pop, I had great difficuly walking . I fell a lot and seemed to feel heavyer then I am. We moved along the stream down hill to the end of the park, are way out. my dog seemed to be makeing a sound like when he is distressed and ran off. As I left the park I looked up and could see a faint outline of a very large object floating above the valley. From that angle I could see what looked like large wide V&#39;s ,the odur in the air was different, I felt physically exhausted, it had felt as if I had the air sucked out of me. I have a surgical pin in my ankle joint from a past bike accident and that felt as if it were burning. I do not know what this was about. I had to get a new whatch and new cards with that black stip on them.<n>

It was low-flying, like a small plane (maybe 8000 feet), only faster, and completely soundless. It was dark, and had no lights on. The only way we happened to see it was due to 3 dim lights grouped together underneath the craft which were barely illuminated.

We looked up into the sky to search for shooting stars. We saw a &#34;star&#34; through the trees that appeared to be moving. After watching it for a minute we realised it wasn&#39;t a plane because it would zig zag around the sky. We moved to an area unobstructed by the tree and the object was still there. We watched it for 20 minutes as it zig zagged across the sky. It then started to change slightly in hue to a reddish to a greenish and then back to a yellowish white. The object then began to get larger and smaller as it appeared to be movin closer and further away. All three of us witnessed this event and were quite stunned to say the least. All of us beleived it not to be a star or a plane or a satellite. Although my two companions were skeptics, they also believed it to be a UFO.<n>

The Flare color was very bright yellow - orange and lasted about 5 - 10 seconds and seemd to be composed of 1 to 3 lights (we saw 5 sets altogether).  I got a pair of 50X binoculars to get a better look &amp; noticed the &#34;Airplanes&#34; were not traveling in straight lines, some reversed direction &amp; followed others, some moved toward each other &amp; then turned together in a different direction. They seemed to be simply milling about.  We saw 5 flares, the first appeared to be 3 or 4 Lights the last 3 were single or double lights. they were about 2 minutes apart. When one of them flared the strobe or &#34;Airplane&#34; vanished.  After the last one flared the &#34;Airplanes&#34; dispersed gradually. Since this was 22:45 and I was looking toward the east, these could not be reflections from the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This Morning 08/19/02 at 06:25 My wife &amp; I saw 3 very bright lights with a strobe above the center one traveling very rapidly across the sky. I could see no red or green lights and the body was not visible even though the object appeared quite close. I was an air traffic controler in the Air Force &amp; would estimate these lights at about 2 miles away.  The first ones in this report were 10 or more miles away from the looks of the strobe &amp; assuming they were airplanes.<n>

They were in the house and I was on the deck, looking up at the stars.  The kids were asleep and the sky was clear.  No more than 5 mins. had gone by when from over the house, just above the tree tops three white, brite lights forming a narrow triangle flew above my head.  I could see no body attached to them.  They were pointed straight ahead like car lights.  If there would have been a craft attached to the lights I would have been able to see it.  After all, it was so low to the ground if I would have had a rock I would have been able to hit it easily.  They flew straight accross the field and over the tree line.  The speed was to slow for an airplane, but fast enough where their should have been some wind sound, there wasn&#39;t even sound from an engine. I watched it most of the way accross the field.  My wife and sister could not have made it out in time to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Upon exiting my residence, I looked up in the n/e sky and witnessed two stars like objects moving across the sky following each other headed north. After about a minute the one object faded and disappeared. I called for my father to come outside when the other continued north until trees and houses blocked it. My father was present during the sighting and he figured due to its path and extremely high altitude it was most likely a satellite. About a minute later after seeing it disappear, there it was again now headed south. It was on the same course as before but now headed south. The next thing that occurred was when it was directly in sight it began to light up intensely, (about 5 times brighter than any star in the sky) then dimmed again. This might have been due to entering the atmosphere then exiting again. After watching travel halfway across the sky heading south, it then turned 90 degrees and went east towards NYC. Due to the light pollution from NY, It became very dim and lost sight of it. I am aware of flight patterns that cross the sky nearby, but this was too high in the atmosphere to be a commercial plane, no noise whatsoever, but who knows? I would like to know if anyone else had seen anything Saturday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3 witnesses/ 2 different locations<n>

They were hovering there, and we were watching as we were driving. They simultaneously turned at such an angle that made the light reflect back to us... It was SO bright. It was obvious to us that they were silvery metallic colored &#34;saucer&#34; shaped things. A few seconds later they turned back to their original position. Then we drove by a tree and they instantly dissappeared. We parked on the side of the road to look for them in the sky, but nothing was there. It was a perfectly clear day... no clouds or any thing.

8/10/02 21:30|Buena Vista (None around for miles)|CO|Cylinder|Half hour|Several red/green randomly flashing lights bouncing in and out of an area with bright flashes (without lightning bolts or thunder).|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24430.html|330|ndxe200208| ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source for locations in Arizona and Colorado.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several red/green randomly flashing lights bouncing in and out of an area with bright flashes (without lightning bolts or thunder).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camping at 12,000 foot Cumberland Pass, San Juan Mts. continental divide, Colorado; GPS coordinates: 38.41 by 106.39, nearest little town with more than 100 people would be Buena Vista, off Hwy 24. Over 40 miles of extremely bad dirt road to get there. First I saw numerous flashes for over an hour, that looked like lightning, but not really because there were no bolts or anything, at GPS coordinates: 38.42 by 106.22. At first I thought that was UFO activity. Then after adventuring all day in the area, I camped there again the next night. Both nights had no clouds, no pollution, and no moon or planets (Venus I think) making light after they both set an hour beforehand. So I was in the best stargazing conditions possible - the highest elevation I ever camped at by 700 feet. When I camped there the next night (after scouring the whole area all day looking for a place to camp with a better view of that area so I could see it again, which there wasn&#39;t any because the stupid forest people closed all the dirt roads, so there was no way other than mountian climbing to get a better view of this - probably why they chose that area to do their thing so obviously), I saw thunderheads in a lower valley in the same area, so now I&#39;m attributing the flashes to lightning far away in a much lower valley close to Buena Vista. They were also having some kind of celebration in Buena Vista, so they may have been doing fireworks (but why fireworks on Friday night and then none on Staruday? And that was only 12 miles away, and I think fireworks go higher than 10,00 feet, so I would have seen them clearly if that what it was). Anyway, I concluded that the flashes were lightning, even though not once did I hear any thunder, and it&#39;s weird that clouds would all be so low - all under 9,000 feet. All that time, while there were bright flashes every ten seconds, in the completely clear, pollution-free, cloudless sky, there were these UFOs going in and out of the area of the flashes. They randomly flashed red and green lights, not p! eriodic like regular planes (and car turn signals). They went into the area with the flashes, and then right after a flash, they came back up. Extremely high speeds - thousdands of MPH with no noise or acceleration time. It looked like the same ones I saw chasing a storm cloud from a commercial airliner in the Sierras in CA July 2001. Several times it looked like one would go and touch another one that was just hovering after it got hit ny lightning. It looked to me that they were sucking up lightning from the storm, then feeding it to ships that were more stationary. This went on for so long that I tried to take pictures. They were moving way too fast to see with binoculars. As soon as I got out the camera, they disappeared. Also, maybe this was just a conincidence since it was almost peak annual meteor shower time, but several shooting stars came from space and disappeared into the same area. They looked like normal shooting stars, but they burnt out and disappeared right where all of the action was. In my opinion, they saw that I got my camera out, and then disappeared. There were a couple of UFOs that didn&#39;t look like the gatherers (all you could see where the randomly flashing red and green lights), it was too dark and they didn&#39;t emit enough light to see them well enough to describe them. I did manage to get some shots, but I doubt they came out (I have yet to take the film in to get developed.). Got bored and went to sleep. I went back and camped the next night a little higher, 12,200 ft. on the west side of the dirt road so I could get a better view in case it happened again, but absolutely nothing happened, even the thunderheads in the valley, that I couldn&#39;t see before, produced no lightning or thunder. Lots of shooting stars, but none that headed into that area again. One of the most obvious and flagrant display of UFO activity I&#39;ve ever seen, and I see a lot because I camp at high elevations and look about twice a month all over the U.S. I think they didn&#39;t care because the only area I know of with l! ess peop le is Canyonlands Nat&#39;l Park, Utah. I need a camera that will record this stuff!!!<n>

I was sitting in the back seat of my brother&#39;s car.  We were driving South on the 15 in laval, when I saw two bright red lights towards the South East.  It was hard to see how high it was.  It seemed to be high enought from the ground, but it was too far away to be able to tell exactly how high.  It was kind of like two plane coming over the horizon far away...  I asked my brother and his girlfriend if they could also see the lights.  They just seemed to float there.  One was a little higher up than the other.  They didn&#39;t see them right away because we were moving and objects like trees and buildings kept getting in the way. Once they did see them they said it looked like fireworks, but wouldn&#39;t fade away.  It was a good description I guess.  You know when a flare goes up in the sky and glows bright red?  Well imagine the same glow, but bigger and brighter.  They just suspended there for about 20 seconds.  We past in front of an object (a bridge or building) and I lost them from view.  I looked for 5 minutes afterwards but I never saw them again.  I guess I can&#39;t rule out that they were flares, but they really didn&#39;t move any closer to the horizion like flares do, and it seemed to high to have been flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well that&#39;s what I saw tonight.

It is very hard to come up with a approximate size or distance since the sky was so nice, but for one second I thought it might be a hot air balloon  so I asked my aunt  if she had binoculars or something like it, she went inside and handed me a set of bird watching monocular ( it looks like only one side of a binoculars. It took me a while to sight the object with the monocular but finaly I did and TADA! it was not a baloon, The best description of the object is a big red sphere with three smaller orange smi-spheres toghether, one thing that was very interesting was that we were able to see  some sort of &#34;vapor&#34; around it (like when the asfalt is very hot) The object started moving slowly  north, almost like drifting, then it stop completly and started moving south east this time a bit faster and longer to the point that we almost losted in between houses but all of the sudden the thin just rocketted  north west to the oposite side, the speed was not super super fast but but it was faster than anything that I have ever seen flying including fighter planes specially considering how hight it was. just a second after the thing blasted across the sky what it look like a business &#34;lear&#34; jet cross the sky with the same trajectory almost as if it was fallowing IT.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Me and my friend were staying up all night just to look at the stars. We saw a light that look like a plane but we kept looking at it coming toward us. As it came flying above us it had no sound an it was flying low. It was going slow too. It look like a clear circle with lights a round it. It had one light that changed colors. The colors were blue,white,red, and yellow. This thing kept going and we just stood there watching it until it fanished. The sourrndings were in the woods near a river called the Red River<n>

I stayed where i was all night and have not been back. i often have recurring dreams. im not sure if this has any significance with any other sitings. i also have never witnissed anything like this befor.<n>

This light was moving in small cicles, then forward, then back, sometimes at a slow speed, then other times it would move rather quickly.  All three lights repeated the same pattern of behavior for over an hour.  The same lights appeared on 08/11/02 and again repeated the same odd behavior for a long time.  Those lights this time were preceded by a light coming from the north, that at first thought was just a high altitude jet.  But then it sped up to and incredible speed , turned 45 degrees to the east and moved off faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen (meteor speed).  That light was witnessed by just myself, but the other lights had two witnesses.<n>

The horses graze on approx: 5 acres of open field. We usually park our Explorer near the barn, however this evening we parked in the wide open. We set up our chairs facing west,started a small charcoal fire in the Weber in prepartion to roast some hot dogs. We watched as the sunset, the sky grew dark and we began point out the usual constellations. We noticed want we thought be be the &#34;evening star&#34; in the lower western sky. As I tended the grill, my companion indicated she saw several shooting stars. At least an hour passed, we finished our meal, poured some coffee and relaxed. As i fiddled with the Weber, my companion said that the &#34;evening star&#34; was getting brighter and comming in our direction. As we watched the light grow in size, indicating that it was approaching, small colored lights became visible around the center light. I was the first to leave my lawn chair and got down on my hands and knees, the light had now become two very distinguishable &#34;head lights&#34;. The lights were now about 300 yards away, just above the tree line which separated the two farms. At this point the head lights turned downward and two beams were now shining on the tree tops. The &#34;craft&#34; was now moving straight towards us, the light beams moving down the trees, unto the ground and were then shining on the horse&#39;s pond. We were scared!!! We watched and said many things to one another. There was no Sound!! As the beams moved up the hill towards us a third beam shone down from the rear or side of the &#34;craft&#34; to light up the earth from which the two front beams had already been. The pond was about 150 to 200 yards away from us and the lights stopped about half way down the hill. There was still no sound. It looked like one of those police helicopter search lights, but there were three of them and no sound. The beams began to move towards us again but now there was a sound like you hear when you are on a jet approaching the runway and the engines have decelerated just b! efore la nding. All the while we are whispering all kinds of scared stuff. The ground was now lit up just 50 yards or so infront of us. Whatever this thing was, it was right on us. Then the beams went off and the blinking could be seen on this black space above us.It slowly began to hover southward, leaving &#34;our space&#34; I stood and watched it accelerate as it climbed, not too high and began to head for the horizon. At that moment while facing south, another set of colored lights appeared just southwest of the spot we had/couldn&#39;t move from. These lights were alot farther away and they started heading eastward and took the same flight path as the first. We watched the second light cluster disappeared. I started to look around the rest of the sky and now I saw the same distant type light, very far up in the northwest sky. It was the samre light as the first, but it was traveling at a good clip across the northern sky, then the eastern sky and then disappeared on the horizon where the first two had gone. Boy, what an experience!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the time and date.  PD))<n>

We noticed a star like object flying east to west across the sky.  Object was very high and it appeared to be traveling at a fast rate of speed. It definitely was not a falling star as it was traveling across the sky horizontally in a straight line and in a conrolled manner. It went from horizon to horizon in a bout 2 minutes time.  It had the same brightness as the stars.  I was wondering if anyone else saw this.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> White star-like light wobbled as it got closer to me, then it was scared away by 5-6 F-15s that scoured the area for hours afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camping at Alta Lakes, south of Telluride, CO (a 11,300 foot high lake on the continental divide, San Juan Mts.) Saw a white light with intensity twice that of a star. GPS coordinates of it&#39;s approximate location: 108.05 by 37.55. Since I camp all the time, and see things all the time, my first action was to see if it was just a planet, since Venus was out at the time. So I lined it up between two big trees that didn&#39;t move in the wind. It definately wobbled as it got closer to me. It was like it was trying to maintain it&#39;s position relative to me as it got closer so I wouldn&#39;t notice. I paniced and shuffled things into sleep mode, where I can hide locked up in the back of my truck with my .44 Magnum next to me, when all of a sudden three F-15s soared past me about 700 MPH. Two were on the other side of where it was, criss-crossing the area. I looked, and the light was gone. At least five F-15s (a couple could have been F-16s), scoured the area for over an hour after that. I thought I saw what looked like two orange lights comoing out of one, like it was shooting it&#39;s guns. Then I went to sleep and nothing else happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.  Note:  If F-15&#39;s, or any other plane, flies by a witness at 700 mph, it is not a &#34;roar.&#34;  Rather, it would sound like a huge explosion (actually, two explosions), since the craft would be supersonic at that velocity.  There are a few questions we have about this report we would like to resolve.  PD))<n>

However, as the craft came closer to allow for an inspection of the common blinking lights that planes or helicopters have, I discovered that it had none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights that were visible were also in the wrong position for a plane type craft as they were one in front of the other. As the craft moved out of sight, there was still no sight of red, green or any other color strobe light that would indicate it was a normal type of craft. As I live where i can see planes and helicopters fly over the city on a consistent basis, I would say that the elevation was similar to the height of a craft at 10,000 elevation. It moved fast across the sky and was out of sight quickly.<n>

I was biking in a new park with my cousin.  It was dark, and no trees obscured the sky.  Some stars where visible but very faintly.  One plane was also observed, it appeared to be a passanger jet with clearly visible light beacons.  When my cousin and I where close to a local school we both saw a peculiar three light triangular configuration in the sky,  extremely low to the ground.  I would say about 15 - 25 meters above the ground.  The lights where clearly visible and definately not faint.  They could not be mistaked for an airplane or stars.  They where roundish white and a little yellowish.  The lights gave an impression of a very large triangular object.  The lights where about 30 meters from us when they slowly begun spinning and rising at the same time at a low angle.  They gave an impression as if the object in the sky was very slow and heavy.  The lights then accelerated as they where rising and completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no sound heard throughout the event.<n>

We knew it couldn&#39;t be a star because stars dont move and it couldn&#39;t be a shooting star cause it was moving very slowly. We observed that there were aircraft in the sky taking off from a local airport and we noticed that one of the objects began to follow the aircraft and then disappeared. The objects changed colors very rapidly from blue to red to white. We observed that one of the objects had a green color change in it that none of the others had. They all were moving in a northern/northeastern direction. We saw 7 or more of these objects.<n>

Appears to be huge and rather in high orbit as you can see the commercial air traffic flying substantially lower than it over the mountains.  Object does not move, it appears stationary. Object is not seen flying away, it simply vanishes after 1 hour or more. No reporting on local news, however many people are actively watching this, nightly. One night I was observing it there was a plane out of Nellis AFB that headed straight for the object in an unusual flight path for them. As it approached the object it vanished.<n>

8/9/02 02:22|Seattle|WA|Diamond|90 seconds|Large diamond-shaped UFO with four round projections silently glides over downtown Seattle.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24303.html|364|ndxe200208| Large diamond-shaped UFO with four round projections silently glides over downtown Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:20am, still not able to fall asleep after a night of shooting a documentary about my ((personal URL)) website, I decided to poke my head out the window to look for stray Persieds. After just two minutes of looking out into space (facing generally up and to the north), a large, very slow moving object caught my eye, emerging from the limb of a building rooftop to the NNE.  It was a dark grey in color, appeared to be more or less diamond-shaped, and it had four lighter colored spheres or disks on its underside.  The object was approximately the size of my thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length, so it was quite large and easily seen &amp; tracked even though it did not have any lights on it.  It was moving very slowly from roughly NNE to SSW, curving slowly to the W as it passed nearly overhead and then headed out away from the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It displayed a slow oscillating motion; appearing to twist back and forth but with its movements limited to perhaps 10°, so the leading edge never became the trailing edge or vice versa.  The movements were very regular, like a cam on a slow-turning gearhead motor. It did not appear to emit any light of its own, nor did it emit any sounds that I could hear.  At first I thought I might have been witnessing a stealth aircraft of some type, but the very slow forward travel and the slight but noticeable oscillating motion ruled that out pretty quickly.  Birds in flight were also ruled out due to the very slow forward speed and the lack of flapping wings, which would have been visible on something of the same apparent size as what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the object for perhaps 20 seconds, I stumbled into the next room and grabbed a pair of 10X50 binoculars, then went back to the window and tried to zoom in on it.  I lost 15-20 seconds of possible viewing time in getting the binoculars. By the time I had finally got myself up to the window and located the object again, it had dimmed substantially and moved out over Elliot Bay; and I didn&#39;t see any more detail on it than I originally did with the naked eye.  After viewing the object in and out of binoculars for an addition 50-60 seconds, it faded from view; though only due to lack of illumination as it flew away from the downtown Seattle core and out over water. It was still plenty large enough in the sky to see with the naked eye had there been more light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the object body appeared to be a dark grey; and the color of the four circular devices or projections on its underside appeared white or light grey; the only source of light striking it was the sodium vapor lights reflected off the streets of Seattle.   Shape was that of a slightly elongated diamond with significantly rounded edges; and the round or spherical projections were positioned just inside each apex of the diamond.  Of several unidentifieds I have witnessed in Seattle, this one had, by far, the largest apparent size of them all.  Its longer axis was more or less aligned with its plane of travel at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Actual size and altitude are difficult to determine as there are no clouds or other objects to use as a reference.  I would have to estimate the altitude to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and the object&#39;s size to be approximately 20&#39; long by 15&#39; wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll try to depict what I saw in Photoshop and then email it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Simulation provided.

They seemed to fly in a formation like the number 5 in a dice. The &#34;5 dice&#34;-form was flying with the horisontal plane. The speed was really fast, but not as fast as shooting stars, rather a third of that normal shooting star speed maybe. The reason we saw it was that we were looking at the big dipper and pointing out were the exact north was so the both of us saw it extremely well.<n>

It never lost altitude or seemed to be falling. No sound was heard. A tail was following the object that continued to travel towards the east out of sight. It seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. It could not have been any aircraft currently manufactured by us at this time. It was a disturbing sight.<n>

It apeared to be a long plane that had (i think) 8 white lights. These lights were not flashing. However as it pasted over the house the were SEVERAL SEVERAL SEVERAL flashing lights of multicolors. Then which apeared not an inch (from our view) under neath it was a another simular object half the size of the first one, but with only 2 lights one in each &#34;corner&#34; both were white/clear lights that were also not flashing.  It appeared to me that the littier one was DEFFINTLY following the bigger one which was directly above it.  They were moving super duper fast too.  I mean CRAZY beyond belief fast. Like in now was shape or form could have been a normal plane fast.  Did anyone else see what we seen tonight?  Please let us know.  We would greatly appreachiate it. After we saw it we ran and got our shoes and jumped in the car and drove around looking for the object(s) but never found it...However we did find a lot of normal looking planes in the sky (About 30mins later.) We have noticed that to us anyway seems to be greater air traffic in the Annarbor area. This just us? Are we both nuts? Just noticing the Characteristics of the object we would like to note that there WAS NO SOUND from either of them...And just a few moments prior to all this sillyness our cable was acting funny, very simular to how it acted a few weeks ago when we had a large thunder storm, fadding in and out and such...Thank You<n>

The object remained stationary for several minutes and then started moving erratically for a few seconds, then perfectly still again. It repeated this behavior over and over for about 45 minutes, each time it moved it got farther away until we could no longer see it. The erratic movement included quick 90 degree turns, circular patterns and side to side patterns. It moved VERY fast for being as far off as it was (the exact distance I can&#39;t be sure of). I am no expert, but it does not take 45 minutes for a plane to pass overhead, and a blimp does not move quickly in any direction. I also had the impression that it was quite large. My wife and her mother also witnessed the object. The object moved off toward Aiken County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness, who remains anonymous, implies an evening sighting.  We have amended the time to 22:35 hrs.   I believe the witness later contacted us later to report that the object probably was a blimp, but I cannot find the message.  PD))<n>

I love to look skyward with the hope that someday I&#39;ll see something that I can&#39;t explain. Tonight, at ((deleted--60&#39;s))years old, I have seen something I can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking into the sky while talking to a friend on the phone. I had seen a number of shooting stars, one of which shot a very long streak from the North to the South. At about 10:30, DST, my eye caught a very brilliant white light looking towards the East. I watched it as it became very large and more brilliant until it was about 15 to 20 times larger and brighter than the brightest star. It remained motionless until it started to dim. It than started to move to the right. As it dimmed but did not disappear, it started to move Southward. Because it was so dim, I could see that it had a round shape. After 10 or 15 seconds , it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 hour later I saw the same object, but now it was further NorthEast. It reappeared the same way, became very bright and as it dimmed, it started to move, but this time, it moved towards the North. I am reporting this, because #1, it is the first time I saw something other than a meteor or a satellite, which I&#39;ve seen many, including the space station which flew over my area at different angles last week...and #2, I would be very interested to learn if anyone else witnessed these objects at the same time I did.<n>

The ligths were just like the lights of a car in the fog. I think it were approx. 10 lights in the oval shape. It didn&#39;t move. I can&#39;t say on what distance it was. I went inside to find my camera; when I came back outside, it was still there; I looked through my camera but I couldn&#39;t see a thing; the lights were so cloudy. After 10 minutes I went inside; it was still there. Up to now I check every night the sky, but I do not notice that phenomenon anymore.<n>

We were just sitting in our lounge chair looking up into the beautiful clear skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over the top of the roof of our house, thats when I saw the three dimmed lights coming over our house.  At first, I wasn&#39;t sure whether to stay right there, or go get my husband.  I just ran into the house and told her father to look at what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He didn&#39;t believe me, I kept telling him &#34;look it&#39;s right here on top of us.&#34;  He finally came out after me.  I told him &#34;look, you see it?  It&#39;s right there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was black triangle shape, with dimmed light at the tip of each end.  It took about 7-10 minutes, moving across the sky so slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM HUSBAND OF WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Black Desert Triangle with dim lights on each triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I observed this event in the summer of 2002.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first begin when I was watching TV when my wife ran inside and told me to see this object outside.  The way she explained the object, was just not convincing to me.  So I walked outside to see what she was talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first response was NO WAY!  So I told her to get my binoculars so I can get a closer look.  Boy, all I can say was, &#34;Oh my this is the real thing, we are watching here&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I flash it with my flashlight.  To see what would happen..  But nothing happen, it just kept on flying on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I thought about shooting this object with my rifle to see what would happen.  Because it was flying at a low altitude. We seen this craft on a clear night.  Also we live out in the country where our nearest neighor is about 4 miles away.  We can see the stars with great clarity.  It made no noise, a black triangle shape and also what was so unique about this feature was, it had low dim lights on each end of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witnesses do not indicate that fact.

They appeared to cover a large distance relatively quickly. As they got closer the lights pulsed slightly, changing from orange, to red, to white. The formation alternated, meanwhile, between a zig-zag and straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were the size of bright stars, and I estimated to be about two miles to the east. It was dark, and the sky was clear albeit for a slight haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after changing to white the objects formed two cirles and emitted trails of sparks as they descended out of my field of view, ie., behind buildings as I walked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite having lived near airports, both military and commercial, I had never witnessed anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A possible explanation occurred to me a week later, and I made a few email enquiries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting turned out to be a parachute display team, with flares, operating in darkness for the benefit of the attendees at a local agricultural show. It had me foxed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m English, and I&#39;m pretty sure that parachutists don&#39;t perform at night in the UK, but laws here obviously don&#39;t prohibit such activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this sighting may be of interest as it could perhaps explain a limited number of other sightings around the globe? It seems the objects were closer than I had realised, thus giving a false impression of speed, and the impressive formation was actually fairly standard for a skilled parachute team!<n>

I ran inside to grab my women so i knew i was not seeing things . We compared the hight and speed compared to the normal aircraft flying in and out of ACT airport. Both of us deciding it was way to high and fast to be any normal conventional aircraft. To fast to be a satelite. It was moving towards the horizon starting pritty much above us and was at the horizon within 20 seconds. As it disappered i looked at the same star cluster it had came from and noticed another one moving at the same speed but in a diffrent direction. It was racing along for around 10 seconds when it dipped down with no change of speed . It made a few turns then shot of in the direction it was first headed. I am spun out ....<n>

The temperature was approximately 70 degrees.  It was a breezy day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon exiting the store, I glanced across the 4-lane divided American Legion Highway toward the small Getty gas station directly across the highway from the donut shop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was immediately drawn to a solid black sphere, approximately the size of a large beach ball (about 5 feet in diameter) traveling no more than 30 feet in the air, coming from the direction of the Bell Circle traffic rotary. It was traveling in a straight line, at approximately 20 miles per hour, and its path was located behind the Getty station, heading in the direction of the 11-story Comfort Inn Hotel which is located just past the Getty station, if one is facing in a northerly direction in front of the station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance, I thought it was a child&#39;s large balloon, but the day was very breezy, and this object was traveling in a straight line, never once fluttering or wavering in its flight toward the gas station. The object was a dull, solid black in color, with absolutely no protrusions, or any other type of irregularities on it&#39;s surface... it was just a solid, dull black sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object, it continued its straight-line path toward the Comfort Inn Hotel. The traffic was light on the highway, and with the absence of vehicular traffic noise, I noted that I could hear no sound at all coming fron the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached the Comfort Inn Hotel, its altitude was at about the 3rd story level, and as it got closer, it began to climb at approximately a 50-degree angle until it cleared the roof of the hotel, at which time it leveled off for a few seconds, then began climbing again at the same angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To get a better viewing angle, I crossed the highway and positioned myself directly behind the object, and I could see that it was still traveling in an absolute straight-line attitude, with a total absence of flutter or wavering, even though the tree branches and foliage were swaying with the breezes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object once again interrupted its climb, and began to descend at an approximately 40-degree angle, heading for the roof the New England Confectionary Company (NECCO Candy) building, located in the next lot north of the Comfort Inn, again if one is facing in a northerly direction next to the Getty station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object came within 15-20 feet of the roof of the NECCO building, it again leveled off and traveled along the length of the roof, until it cleared the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the object once again began to climb on its 50-degree angle, in its straight-line attitude, heading for a large cloud.  It&#39;s speed never wavered from the approximate 20 miles per hour it was traveling when I first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still behind the object, I watched it climb toward the cloud until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time-frame from when I first spotted the object, until it disappeared from view was approximately 1 1/2 minutes, as best I can recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no people on foot in the immediate vicinity, and no people in the few vehicles going by seemed to notice it, even though I was quite conspicuous in my observation of it, even pointing toward it to try and get the attention of someone in one of the vehicles.  As far as I could determine, I was the only one on the highway who saw the object, but I&#39;m positive that someone MUST have seen it as it flew over the always-busy Bell Circle traffic rotary. I passed the rotary on my way home, but could see nobody on foot who may have seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To say that what I saw that day was strange and very highly unusual would be a monumental understatement!  It was a very exciting thing to see, and I can say without a doubt that this was no beach ball, child&#39;s balloon, or ANY balloon for that matter. This object, or craft, ot whatever it was, seemed to be intelligently controlled, in my personal opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An exciting day in my life, and one that I&#39;ll never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assure all of you that this story is absolutely true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in an industry that requires a substantial technical background.

My co-worker described it as a cylinder with definete edges and again with the light.  We called a third person over to see it but she could not spot it as it was disappearing from our view and probably going higher. I thought it was the color of a paper bag the light was white and intense.  The wind is blowing in that direction today but to us it looked self propelled as it left our field of vision fairly rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found her to be exceptionally sincere and lucid in her description of the event.

It was high up in the sky, but in the horizon. As it came out from behind the trees, it was white, &amp; round (like a circle). Behind the trees, it was in the SW horizon. when it came out from behind the trees, it was in the southern horizon. It moved accross the sky, towards the East Coast. It didn&#39;t just fly accross the sky, but it curved upward toward the sky. About 2 seconds afterward it just disappeared. It didn&#39;t streak off, there was no tail. It was just gone! The object looked like a round, white light, moving accross the sky. It was not a plane!<n>

When I saw a bright light to the east heading northbound. It apeared to be a disk shape illuminated by 5 light on one side.

The lights at our house went on and off for about 3 minutes maybe 5. I then went outside to check the transformer box on the telephone pole. Noticed that most of the dogs in the area were barking and that our dogs were in a highly nervious state. The cats were also nervious and were trying to get in the house. Then I spotted an object that could had been a meteror. It was a bright light that traveled toward the south-southwest at rapid speed. I went back in the house for a moment to phone electric company. Found out from them that power outages were occuring in Cannon and Rutherford Counties. Went back outside to check up on dogs. When I got outside, I discovered all dogs in the area howeling and barking. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a craft flying at the lowest level that commercial aircraft fly. (I had seen aircraft fly at this height in the daytime and at night) Noticed that object had several lights. two underneight flashed. Object made no sound at all. It appeared to be moving slower than commercial aircraft but not that slow. Maybe 150 to 200 MPH. This object could had been a passanger jet but I heard no sound from it. All other aircraft that I had seen at that level have made the normal jet engine sounds. This one did not. It was like it was gliding. Then object slowly moved on toward Smyrna and Nashville. Dogs were going mad at this point in neighborhood. My two dogs were running about. Cats were also running about. Then spotted a white SUV traveling at high rate of speed down road. I now remembered seeing several white vans cars and SUV&#39;s traveling around area but not going slow(As if looking for something) or as fast as the one I saw tonight. Saw other cars that might be strange. White cars etc. Now, these vehicles may have nothing at all to do with event tonight, but thought I would mention the cars anyway. As I type this, event is still on-going. The main act of the event tonight was the unusual behavior of animals, mysterious cra! ft that might had been a passenger plane or an true unknown. The lights on Unknown seem to suggest a triangle shape. Object seemed huge. However it is night and that size could be deceptive. If it were day, I might had been able to see more detail and also determine if it were a passenger jet. Also, begining of event, power outages occured and according to message at electric company it covered two counties. All of this might just be normal, however, Object did not make sound and I had seen other jets at night that did. Object seemed to have too many lights.

I noticed a bright yellow satellite or|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24270.html|385|ndxe200208| At 10:34 P.M., I was sitting on my deck stargazing. It is cool,clear evening. I am facing north. I noticed a bright yellow satellite or aircraft type like light in the area of the lower left aspect of the Big Dipper&#39;s bowl. This light is brighter than the star Lyra.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought is was a high altitude aircraft.  I used a 10x70 pair of binoculars to view the object and did not see the usual red and green tail lights.  I then noticed the brightness begin to fade quickly after it travel about 20 degrees in the direction of the North star.  It then disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to follow what I perceived to be it&#39;s trajectory, but it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:37 P.M. as I again returned to look toward th Big Dipper again, I observed a similar bright star-like object from the same &#34;bowl&#34; area. This time the object was moving in a due south direction and traversed about 15 degrees before it too, faded.  Both objects were yellow, and disappeared after moving toward the zenith 15-20 degrees.  I&#39;ve seen many satellites blink and flash as they roll, but the are always white in color and never this bright or yellow in color.<n>
8/7/02 22:30|Luray|VA|Other|2 hours +|Blue Ridge Mountains, Luray, Va - 8 objects dancing, zigzagging, constantly verying speed/direction or 2 hour+ period|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24320.html|386|ndxe200208| Blue Ridge Mountains, Luray, Va - 8 objects dancing, zigzagging, constantly verying speed/direction or 2 hour+ period<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:30pm, I opened my back door and looked into the night sky because it was very clear that night and the whole galaxy could be seen so I wanted to take in the view before I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I opened the door, I noticed two flashing objects in the sky over a short section of the Blue Ridge Mountains.   The section I&#39;m talking about is directly to the left of the restaurant Skyland, right over Skyline Drive here in Luray, VA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two objects were flashing red and white lights, possibly blue or green as well.  And they were moving in ways that I&#39;ve never seen anything move before.  Suddendly jerk to the left or right, constanly verying speed and direction in a 3-dimensional space.  I know this because their also happened to be a small patch of clouds in the same area that the objects would move in and out of.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, the two objects were soon joined by 5 or 6 more objects that included smaller triangle orange-white lights that didn&#39;t blink or strobe like the others.  The strobing objects flashed in an irreglur pattern.  When they would go into the cloud, you could see flashes like heat lightning kind of.  (The temp was 71 or so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the first few moments of this experience, I became extremely frightened and began to shout &#34;what the * is that!!!&#34; while tears began to roll down my cheeks.  This is the 2nd time in 7 months that I have seen similar objects over the exact same area.  The first time was about 7 months ago and there were two other witnesses that time.  We saw a similar irreguraly strobing light over the same spot but it remained concealed from view within a low cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like what I saw 2 nights in my entire life and it was a very powerful experience.  I get upset sometimes when I think about it.  And then other times, it feels kind of like its hard to hold on to vividness of the memory.  When I do see vividly in my mind what I saw, it&#39;s frightening and hard for me to deal with or understand.  I&#39;m certain there will be more occurrences, as 4 other people so far have told me they saw similar events here in this same area, and I haven&#39;t talked to many people about it yet.  I plan on investigating this event myself by asking more people and continuously watching every night.<n>

It looked like a raindrop on it&#39;s side with solid red on the top and solid orange on the bottom, it left a streak behind it for about 2-3 seconds, it appeared and disappeared without a sound even though it was traveling high in the sky and horizontal.  I then observed a aircraft following behind at a very much slower rate of speed, this aircraft had red and green flashing lights, a conventional aircraft.  The observation didn&#39;t last very long because of the speed of the flying object. I have lived near an airport for 20 plus years, I have seen satelites traveling in an arch high in the sky, I have seen meteor showers arching downward as they enter the atmosphere, but I have never seen something move horizontal and with no conventional aircraft lights.<n>

The light may have been part of a sprinkler system, according to that individual.  We cannot confirm that fact.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brilliant electric blue pulsating light moving at an incredible speed soundlessly passing within 100 yards of our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving north on an isolated section of State Highway 79 when we observed an object which at first appeared to be a police car with flashing lights. It appeared to be stationary in the center of the road approximately a mile ahead. As we closed the distance to approximately one-half mile, the flashing lights appeared to move slowly forward and then to the left approximately 75 to 100 yards. When we were approximately an eighth of a mile from the lights, we recognized that the lights were hovering approximately 10 to 20 feet above the ground over the field west of the highway. To our amazement as we watched, the lights suddenly sped at an incredible speed directly south passing our vehicle on the left side. In less than a second it seemed to stop and hover in the field approximately a half-mile behind our vehicle and remained there until we drove out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to be an brilliant electric blue pulsating pattern, approximately 18&#34; to 24&#34; in diameter. The center appeared to be circular with many narrow shafts of light emanating from the circle forming a criss-cross pattern. It moved at an unbelievable speed yet made no detectable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses to this event, and we felt she was unusually credible.  Neither she nor her husband had ever seen such an object before.  NOTE:  Not included in this report is that they attempted to dial the local police department, using their cellular phone, and it would not function.  Minutes later, after the object had left the area, the phone reportedly once again functioned normally.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM A READER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> in ref to the below sighting, I know exactly what this was as I live in the area.  In that stretch of the highway there are several sod farms that use pivot sprinklers.  At the end of the sprinkler set is a blue strobe light that moves with the sprinker, this let&#39;s the farmer know where the sprinker is and that the sprinker is operating.  Infacts as I look out my window now, I can see a blue light, red light and a white light, all coming from the irrigation sprinkers.  Furthermore, there is no cell phone coverage in that stretch of highway<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP<n>

It was just after dusk and they were way too big and too low to be stars, but they did not move but hung in the sky.

8/7/02 19:30|Humble|TX|Changing|30 min|Strange object seen hovering overhead in the eveing sky in Humble, Texas.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24263.html|391|ndxe200208| Strange object seen hovering overhead in the eveing sky in Humble, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking in the neighborhood, and in the same moment, both of us looked up to see a shape in the air. At first we thought it was a baloon because the way it swiveled up into the sky, but realized it couldnt be after it seem to drop in altitude, then swirl. At first it appeared to be a sphere shape, then moved and rotated and looked more like an oval. We realized how high it was when a commercial airplane flew below it and we could see the definate shape of an airplane, with lighs, but our craft had no definate shape and absolutly no lights. We watched in awe for about 20 minutes, people would stop and talk to us, but we were in allmost in a trance and didnt even respond. A guy rode by on a bike, and said something about &#34;lightning...&#34; to us, and we looked away for a second and when we looked back up- it was gone, we searched the sky for about 5 minutes trying to find it- but it seemed to have dissapeared. We live about 5 minutes from Bush Intercontintal Airport- we know what planes look like and sound like when they fly over at..even at high altitudes, this made no sound and had no color, and we are both positive it was not a plane.<n>
8/7/02 13:35|Arlington|WA|Other|15-20 min|At approx 1335 8-7-02 I was seated at my desk which is on the 2nd floor of the building where I work.  My office window is on the south|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24265.html|392|ndxe200208| At approx 1335 8-7-02 I was seated at my desk which is on the 2nd floor of the building where I work.  My office window is on the southside of the building, the building is located immeadiantly to the west of the Arlington airport, at the south end of the North to South runways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My attention was caught by a bright flash outside, which at first I thought was an airplane entering the landing pattern of the airport.  However, when I looked out the window, I observed an object which appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky, at the top of a cloud formation directly to the south of my location. The object looked like a straight dark line running from east to west.  As I watched, it remained stationary for approx. 2-3 minutes, then began a slow, jerky, upward motion, until it was slightly above the cloud formation, where it stopped again.  It remained motionless for a few seconds, then tilted forward at an approx. 20- 30 degree angle, and began moving very slowly, and wobbly toward the northeast.  At this point the object reflected the sunlight.  I could see that the object was a elliptical shape that appeared to be approx 3-4 times longer than it was thick when viewed edge on.  It also appeared to be oscillating or rotating clockwise.  It again stopped and hung motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I went down the stairs, to the 1st floor of the building, to tell other people of the object.  I encountered our computer system administer who is a former combat helicopter pilot, having spent some 14 years in the U.S. Army as a Warrant Officer in that capacity.  I told him to look out his window and tell me what he saw.  He looked, saw the object, and said he was dammed if he knew what it was.  He and I continued to watch the object as it moved slowly up and down, and back and forth, side to side.  It tilted several times, and displayed a definate silver metallic color on its topside.  When viewed edge on, it continued to appear dark in color, and thicker in its middle than at its edges.  We both agreed that it was metallic in appearance, and appeared to be oscillating or rotaing clockwise.  We then advised the switchboard operator, who also looked out and observed the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the operator dial the number of a friend who works in north Everett.  I told my friend what we were observing, and asked her to look from her location for the object.  She called back in a couple of minutes and advised that she could not see the object as there were cloud formations at her location.  The system admistrator and myself stepped outside the building where we continued to observe the object as it hung motionless, or slowly moved up, down, and side to side.  During the time we watched, approx 15-20 minutes, several private planes entered the landing pattern, generally by flying in from the north,on the west side of the airport, banking to the east, and turning north again to approach the north-south runways.  All of the planes were between us and the object which appeared to be approx. 2 miles (somewhat of a guess)from us.  The object appeared to be somewhat larger than a Cessna 172 type plane would at the smae distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch the object until it started slowly moving to the southeast, appearing to slowly be losing altitude, and eventually was lost to our sight behind buildings approx. 1/4 mile south of our location.  This was observed by the 3 of us.  Again, I would estimate the entire length of the sighting at 15-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former law enforcement officer, and served in a jet aircraft fighter/bomber squadron during my service with the U.S. Navy, I have received training in both oberving details, and reporting, as well as being familiar with aircraft.  This object resembled no aircraft I have ever observed flying.  The system administrator, former helicopter pilot, also could not identify it it as a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested reports from other witnesses, but they have not arrived yet.

Her amazing story never changed every time she told people about it either.  My Grandmother back then was still in good mind too, and was very good in details.  She had just gotten out of the hospital several weeks before from having had heart surgery, and was trying to sleep that dark night back in 2002.  As Grandma tells it, late that particular night she got up out of bed to get her a glass of water in the kitchen when she noticed something strange directly outside of her house low up in the sky.  Something seemed to be glowing outside directly above the treetops in her front yard.  When she looked outside the side living room window into the treetops she saw what appeared to be a cluster of glowing lights of some sort.  She said that they were moving around in every direction, were several different colors, and that there were many of them too.  They all glowed tremendously bright.  We both later agreed that they all could have been part of a very large object that was hovering directly over her house.  She did tell us that that she never heard any type of noise at all during this sighting, and that she did watch these mysterious objects (lights) for over an hour moving around in the same location.  My Grandmother back earlier in her life had a somewhat similar experience she always told us about too.  Back in 1962 or so she had seen a large jet plane being followed or shadowed by a small flying disk.  She could clearly make out the disk and the airplane in the Scottsville sky that day.  They appeared to be far away.  Anyway, I must tell you that my late Grandmother was always a devout Christian her entire life.  Grandma would never lie or make up a story such as this just for fun either.  I believe her strange story, and I thought that you might like to read it.  By the way, your Web site is spectacular and very informative.  The story that I have just told you IS true-not fiction.  Evidently, it seems that there are many people throughout the world that are believers in UFO&#39;s now because of their own encounters.  I can honestly tell you that I have seen them too, and that they are real-whatever they are.  Something strange is going on across our world that defies our own human logic or explanation.  Whatever it is truly mystifies us all!  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light became brighter during it&#39;s path, and I figured it was lowering it&#39;s altitude while I watched.  The light then went much dimmer and quickly went out of sight as if it the light just went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no clouds, and I could see all the other star formations around where it vanished.  I thought that was pretty weird, then noticed a second, slightly dimmer light also at high altitude approach the same area from the East, and also vanished in pretty much the same area of sky.

Just as we were gathering our stuff, my dad said &#34;Wow! Look at that!&#34; And my mom and I turned to look northward over a penninsula and about 45 degrees upward we saw a small orange &#34;meteor&#34; coming at a diagonal, then it seemed to curve eastward and get gradually bigger and bigger until it didn&#39;t look like a meteor at all anymore. We could see it in great detail: rounded, disk-shaped with three whitish lights on it and had an orange trail and haze around it. It moved at a moderate pace east and we ran out further on the beach to try to follow it, but it went past the trees and we lost sight of it. We all agreed that we saw the same thing, and to this day have no explaination for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Forwarded to Brian Vike, HBCCUFO.  PD))<n>

As I observed, the lights grew really bright and then started to fade. The light faded untill it was as bright, and as large as a star in the sky.

I reached for my binoculars so that I could follow it, but as soon as I grabbed the binoculars the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This light was flying roughly 100 meters over our roof top. It took a projectile path  with a trail of light. The trail went aound 100 meters. The object then disppeared in mid of sky. The night was dark. Hence the shape of the object could not be established. The next morning we came to know that many people saw the same object and it had landed and wounded a few people with scratches on the front parts of the body with the feeling of electric current shock.

NE of Tucson, ~4,500 feet, GPS coordinates 32.10 by 110.29. First, a helocopter buzzed the area without any lights. It shined it&#39;s searchlight onto the desert about a mile away from us for a second or two. Then my friend called my attention to a flashing white light over Driscoll Mt., GPS coordinates 32.11 by 110.27. When I looked to see it, it wasn&#39;t flashing, it was a steady white light, looked like a bright star. Then a second later, it took off to the right (south) at about 300 MPH (with no sound or acceleration time), and then disappeared behind the bottom of a cloud. If it would have continued on it&#39;s course, it would have popped out from teh other side of the cloud in a couple of seconds. Then the storm that was approaching us started to lightning. I looked up at the sky telling my friend that we&#39;re on a butte in the desert, so it&#39;s best to call it a night and hide in the tents. Just then when I was looking straight up, a huge flash went off right above me. There were no clouds above me. It looked like a big camera flash going off. No lightning bolt nor any thunder. I got scared and hid in the back of my truck where I sleep with a loaded .44 Magnum next to me. My friend reported the mountain seemed to shake like an earthquake - no such thing in Arizona.

I suddenly noticed a very bright light which I estimated to be in the -2 to -4 magnitude range, traveling in a SSW to NE direction through the constellation Ophiuchus. It moved in a zig-zagging, back and forth manner, at very high speed. At least 2 to 3 times the speed of satellites I had observed, and about 1/2 the speed of a meteor. Within 3 to 5 seconds, the object disappeared behind the trees. Altitude: Very high. Earth orbit, or near earth orbit. Size: Apparently very large. Possible dark or hollow center. Couldn&#39;t tell for sure. Also on the same night, I saw at least three bright flashes of light in differant locations, at differant times. These were very brief, lasting only 1/2 to 1 second each time.<n>

It was a Very Bright Light Blue glowing ball of light moving about half as fast as a Meteor would though this was much lower. It then stopped near the horizon and turned a light orange color and moved slowly upward until it was gone. A few minutes later a Jet traveling very fast screamed over the area with its afterburners on. Another few minutes a second jet flew over much slower rate of speed.<n>

I had just arrived to the front of my apartment from walking home with a friend from a late dinner.  As we stood talking, I faced south and he was looking opposite to the north.  A bright object caught my eye.  It looked like a bright star at first but then began to move toward us, slowly at first, but then becoming brighter and faster.  It then suddenly stopped!  It then slowly made a 90 degree turn to it&#39;s left, revealing a profile of an elongated cone-like structure with the smaller end appearing as the rear of the vehicle.  It appeared to have a shiney metallic looking surface.  After a second it began to shrink-- to actually minaturize before returning to a bright spot of light.  It then simply faded into nothing as it shot straight up.  It was then gone!  The whole affair took aprox. seven seconds.  As this was happening I tried to tell my friend to look up, but soon after I realized I was studder and stammering from the excitement.  As I was holding a brief case in one hand and a cane in the other, I could not even point.<n>

They remained at about the same overall altitude slightly changing in their formation. The object to the left had a blinking red light on its left side that would stay on for a second and off for a couple of seconds. We looked at the objects through good binoculars and could not see a defined shape, just light. There was no sound.<n>

They seemed to be spot lights at first, maybe attached to trucks, but a third light appeared out of the sky above them to the right and joined them. They slowly hovered from side to side staying in basicly the same spot for about 15 minutes. I didnt pay to much attention until they were over my left shoulder almost behind me. They suddenly shot up into the air about 100 to 200 metres high and flew over head and onto my right side and came to ground level 90 degrees to my right about 1km away and danced around swapping spots. As I approached the town lights of Echuca they shot off into the sky back in the direction I first spotted them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each were different colors, soft in tone, yellow, orange and white. They gave the effect of balls of light that gave off beams of light in all directions as they moved from side to side. As they flew over head they left a trail of light behind them that stayed in the sky for a few moments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told friends when I arrived in Echuca and sort of joked about it a little to help me come back to earth (forgive the pun), but the next day my friends parents rang them to tell them that there were several reports of the same thing made that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not 100% about the exact date which this took place. It has taken me a while to come to terms with this. I must admit I did not know, until watching a recent UFO documentary, who to report this to. I am not a crack-pot, I am an Art teacher at a school in the area of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I first observed the object I thought to myself thats strange I have never seen a plane so high up before that looked the way this one did. It did not look like a plane, It was sort of round and it appeared to be moving in a way that was like a smooth glide unlike any other plane that I have ever seen , but I thought  well mabey its just a plane so I kind of dismissed it. Then as I was walking away from staring at it I walked a few steps and I could not believe It. I looked up and saw this object that appeared to be silver moving at an incredible speed I  don&#39;t know what It was, but I have never seen a plane move that fast.<n>

They looked very black to me.  One was circular and the other was an irregular shape which I thought at first was a hangglider or something.  But they were moving so slowly that I couldn&#39;t figure out what I was looking at.  The circular object was closer to me and both objects were slowly moving Southwest away from me.  Soon the irregular one was out of sight and I pulled my video camera out and taped the circular one until it disappeared into the clouds away from me.  Maybe it was a weather balloon, but I still can&#39;t figure out what that second object was.  Bizarre.<n>

I live in Manitoba (Canada) and just to the Southwest corner of Riding Mountain National Park are a few lakes. I stay at a northern Lake. It was approx. 3:00 p.m... Variable cloud, otherwise a very clear sky. I had been out fishing for a few hours that day and the fish were slow at biting from the heat of summer. I was just about to come in to the shoreline somewhat from the center of the lake. I reeled in and set the rod in the boat. I felt a strong gust of wind, having been fairly calm all that day and week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caused me to look up to the sky, suddenly there directly above me stationary in the sky was a silver disc object. The blue sky in contrast for the background. I could see the edge of a cloud float by above the disc, then blue sky again. It was up a distance in altitude but not to the clouds. I was rather shocked, it is not what you expect to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thought: I was just seeing things, quickly I realized that what I was looking at was really there. I was in awe, my heart was racing..it was there for 1 to 2 minutes then it went straight up. The accent was different from any flying machine that I know of. It had instantaneous movement and it was very smooth. There was no contrail of any sort..nor was there any sounds from it, not that I could hear (the boat was idling) the ship (object) itself was not huge but not small from what I could see. I also noticed it to be smooth, but it was not close enough for any other details to be revealed. The lake where the sighting took place is rather secluded and the are very few people there during the week days. It seems the classic scenario, perhaps it is..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be spending my entire spring and summer out there this year. I hope for another if not a close encounter. I will let you know if I do. It is strange, people, they just look at me as if I am weird or nuts. I want to shake them and make them open their eyes. But all I do is smile and tell them it is true. If you have any questions, or feel that I have missed something out. Please feel free to drop me a line as I said I will be around until Spring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information:  The object ..the thought..was not even in my mind until I looked up and saw what was up above.. the summer week was hot lifeless air..no wind at all..I looked up to see if a storm was coming or something . Only then did I realize that I was not by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights that I could see...just a smooth silver disc object in the sky above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned the object was not close enough to reveal any other details to me...it seemed to be smooth in texture....but again...I feel I was not close enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first looked up..and saw the object...I began trying to figure out what I was looking at ....as the fact became more evident..my heart race increased and my breathing was more...intense...any other effects would more than likely be do to the increase breathing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boat was sitting in the water ...I was standing in the boat watching it..above me...from what I could see...it remained stationary for the entire time....then....wow....the way it moved...it was exciting...like watching a brand new concept.. and taking it all in, in awe. The craft was in motion instantly...no speed increase....just speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s own shadow was evident on the north side of the object..as for reflection of light..there was a slight glint off it a couple times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

Aug 5/2002 in Toronto, Canada. It traveled along its length, unlike a bird. It seemed to be illuminated in red from below but there were no blinking lights. I first observed the object  directly overhead but it did not seem at all to be among the stars; it seemed much lower. Though it was not streaking, there was no trail, the object went very rapidly, no more than 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared in the bright haze of the lower horizon in the ESE.  The trajectory seemed mostly straight although halfway through, the object seemed to adjust its course slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a journalist, photographer, private pilot (lapsed) radio control airplane builder and flyer, amateur astronomer. I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes, preparing for an evening of star gazing with my 10 inch telescope. I&#39;ve been looking up at the sky during the day and during the night ever since I can remember (I&#39;m aged 50). I was looking straight up at the stars when the object appeared. There had been occasional airplanes crossing my field of view shortly before and after (but not during) my sighting. This object was much lower and made no noise which I could hear. Although in a large built up city, the stars are still quite visible overhead. A few minutes later, when my wife joined me, we saw a small speck, a satellite go past the star Vega. As an astronomer I have observed satellites, man-made objects (ISS), comets and meteors moving through the night sky. This was like nothing I have ever seen before.<n>

At first I surmised that maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me from the long drive I&#39;d been doing from Reggae On The River, or maybe it was a reflection of oncoming cars&#39; headlights, but then, about twenty minutes later when I was coming down the Waldo Grade toward the Golden Gate Bridge - it happened once again! The whole southern horizon beyond the city of San Francisco down below me lit up for a split second! Weather conditions were completely clear with no clouds, so I&#39;m sure it couldn&#39;t have been lightning that caused it. I was astonished when the flash happened again the second time, thinking I might have been mistaken in what I&#39;d seen at first some minutes and distance before. I could not see any craft or airplane in the sky either time, and I heard no noise as my windows were rolled up and the events must have been quite a distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer is a professional person in her mid 40&#39;s that has resided in Bay Area for all of her lifetime, and has previously witnessed three other, more dramatic and detailed UFO events.

A very dim satellite/object moving near the zenith (top) of my field of view, slowly dimming even more, then suddenly, a relatively weak strobe (bluish light, same color as object), followed several seconds later by a very very bright strobe (astoundingly bright), followed by perhaps another several strobes of various intervals/intensities.  Object faded, and was very dim to begin with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen beautiful satellites before which are apparently tumbling and reflecting the light back to me in the proper manner to give me a “light house” effect…that is a rare treat.  But a strobing satellite ?  Do some satellites come equipped w/ strobes ?  My thinking is a military spy satellite with a given wavelength HID strobe where a high gain can be applied to that wavelength to amplify the illuminated image relatively free of noise.  Another theory is just an ordinary function of satellites so a ground observer can do a quick and easy visual check to verify proper functioning of the satellite (in other words, just another cheap easy, fail safe check…why not).  My final theory is that it may be part of a function to freak out paranoid terrorists (and I DO HOPE it freaks them out!).  Any thoughts ?  This is the second time I have seen this sort of thing.  The first one I ever saw was just a bit after 9-11-01, and was observed over St. Paul, MN.  Looked like a satellite, and then one HUGE strobe flash (brighter than the one I saw over the lake).  These objects all looked like satellites to me.  Very dim, moving, tiny tiny stars, very difficult to see and follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the first possibility to be ruled out would be tumbling boosters and space debris, which reflects sunlight in a pulsating fashion.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

I asked my husband to look at it to see what he thought and he wasn&#39;t sure, niether of us could see it very clearly so my huband came in the house and went back out with a pair of binoculars. When he came back and we had looked at it we decided we had to get actual video or photographic evidence. My husband came back into the house and took out the video camera. While I was watching the first one with the video camera my husband was looking around to see if he noticed anything else. He watched another came out over the tops of the trees and curve back in the shape of a U and dissapear back in the trees. We had watched the first one for about 45 minutes, never saw the second one again that night, and got 15-16 minutes of video footage. My husband went out about 3-4 more times that night to see if it was still there and it was other places in the sky but in the same general direction it had been in when we had first seen it. When I looked through the binoculars i saw tree lights on what appeared to be the bottom of it. The lights were arranged in a triangular shape, but I was unable to tell exactly what the shape of the object was. The color of the lights were red, green, and orange. They seemed to be strobing and rotating at the same time.<n>

The first few minutes, it seemed to be farther away, so seemed to be moving the way a plane would.  As it seemed to get closer and closer, it started getting brighter, and seemed to be pulsing.  As it got closer, I noticed that this object seemed to be hovering, as it was moving from side to side, in circles, etc.  There was no kind of noise at all, so I am sure that it was not any plane or helicopter that I know of.  One other friend spotted this as well, and we alerted the whole group.  We were all schocked and stared in amazement until the object suddenly shot in one direction and died of the pulsing light.<n>

I first noticed what I thought was the first star or planet in the late afternoon sky about 50 degrees above horizon. I then moved my eyes around the sky and noticed a second object to the right of the first only a few degrees higher. At this point I called over an acquaintance to verify what I was witnessing. She confirmed the two objects. I then looked around 20 degrees above these two objects and saw 3 more of the same type forming a triangular formation. At this point more people from the party I was attending observed all 5 objects for at least 7 or 8 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They looked like period sized white dots appearing to be about 20 to 40 thousand feet above us. They all maintained a stationary position for the duration of the event. For a few moments both I and the first person to corroborate what I was seeing saw what appeared to be movement from all the objects as they continued to maintain their original stationary position, like a group of helicopters hovering above highway traffic. It appeared as if they had some sort of black second hand that extended out just partially beyond the white spherical body and move quickly back and forth from a zero to 10 second position, imagine each object to be the center of a clock and the moving part was a second hand quickly moving from zero to 10 back to zero repeating this pattern again and again for a few moments. I walked inside to check the internet a came back out 4 or 5 minutes latter to discover they had all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> o o o o o Aproximate shape<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be an exceptionally good witness.

I was watching tv and leaned my head back and looked out the window. I couldn&#39;t believe that I saw a flying saucer slicing thru a cloud, and watched as the jetstream of the cloud moved slowly around the white disc. I yelled at my husband to look out the window and see the UFO. I pulled him down to look out the window, but it had moved out of sight. I pushed him up and shoved him out the front door. There it was, moving slowly, heading East towards California. There was no sound from it. It was amazing. It was very close. It was real. I still feel weird thinking and talking about it. I&#39;ve seen some strange sightings before, at night, never during the day, but ones that moved erraticly with blue, green and red lights... But never this close or during the day. My husband works as a maintenance man up on Mauna Kea. He has a BA from the University  of Hawaii @ Hilo. I work on our lilikoi farm, and I am a photographer and I have a year and a half left to get my degree at the University.

I also live ((deleted)) to someone that knew him well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seems to be a lot of cover up and misinformation surrounding this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends ((deleted)) work with Todd Sees father. ((deleted)) is related to the ((deleted)) of Todd Sees. The ((deleted)) best friend and Todd&#39;s son were part of the search party, and helped retrieve the body.  They are the only eye witness (I&#39;ve found) so far as to actually viewing the body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dogs never picked up his scent. nor found his missing clothes.  The body was found on Monday night at 9 pm.  So he&#39;d been out in the heat and humidity for 39 1/2 hours.  He should have been swelling from body gasses at that time.  But he was emaciated (as per the ufo report.  This has not yet been verified).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 wheeler was at the top of the ridge.  His body was found face down, 25 yards from his house. He was wearing only his boxers.  There was a spot on his right forehead that was showing signs of decay, the rest of his body was intact.  He was holding his throat (suffocating?)   An allergic reaction to bee venom, could have cause his throat to close and he might have suffocated (but no bee stings found)   And why call in the FBI for bee or snake bite?  He had a red rag tied around his right arm and there was a dead rattlesnake beside him. They expected to find puncture wounds from a snake bite, but there were no puncture wounds any where.  If he&#39;d been snake bit... there would be a good sized blackened area of necrotic tissue, surrounding the punctures.  As far as snake bite goes, this was a strong, athletic, 38 year old male.  Rattlesnake venom, would most likely NOT have killed him at all.  He would have been able to find his way home in time to get to a hospital.  With snake venom, he might have had some nervous system problems... disorientation, tremors etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The report that I heard yesterday was really bogus; &#34;We think he was stung by bees, but because his body was so decayed you couldn&#39;t see welts from the stings nor find venom in his system.&#34;  His body wasn&#39;t decayed.. and a toxicology report has not been filed.  And if he were being stung, why would he remove his clothing?  I&#39;d jump on the 4 wheeler and head down hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are two conflicting reports about the one shoe.  UFO report says it was in a tree.  The police report says beside the 4 wheeler.  Why would he take off his shoe, (maybe so he could remove his bibbed cammy pants?)  But if he did this, why would he leave the road?  This is a very wooded area, hard to walk through.  The road would lead straight home, yet he chose to take to the undergrowth and forest.  There were no keys, no other clothing found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my friends ((deleted)) asked questions of Todd&#39;s father, ((deleted)) told her that everyone was told they COULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT.   ((deleted)) says his father, the wife, the son the friend (who both saw the body), are not talking and are still just &#39;stunned&#39;. I was told they&#39;re acting very strange.. no expressions, just scared and emotionless.  The father did say that they don&#39;t know any more than the general public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now... here&#39;s the worst thing;   If he was stung by bees or snake bit... why were special agents (they say FBI) brought in?   Why did they take over?  Why was no one allowed near the body?  AND... no one was called to identify the remains.  No one, not even the wife was allowed to view the body.   There was a funeral, with a closed coffin.  NO ONE WAS EVERY ALLOWED TO SEE THE BODY.   The family has said they doubt that there was a body in the coffin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the reports by the local farmers, and the fishermen on the Susquehanna river:  Pennsylvanian&#39;s are VERY simple people.  They don&#39;t like change and they live very simple lives.  I haven&#39;t found any one, in the 3 years since we moved here, that has a belief in ET&#39;s, UFO&#39;s etc.  They would just laugh it off if that were ever suggested.  If they made a report of a strange sighting, then you can be sure they were telling the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received other information from this witness.

Todd vanished with out a trace,the 4 wheeler was keep in mind ,2 miles from his home at the foot of the mountain.  A pond a few hundred yards from the house was even searched by skin divers just so they overlooked nothing.

At 10 p.m., the search for Todd Sees of Northumberland was suspended for the night. Search coordinator Point Township Fire Chief Leon Geise said six teams with K-9 dogs planned to resume the search at 6 a.m. today, with more volunteers beginning a ground and air search at 8 a.m. &#34;It&#39;s not an easy thing to have to leave,&#34; he said of the decision to temporarily call off the search. &#34;We need some closure and we don&#39;t have it.&#34; Sees left his RD2 Northumberland home at about 5 a.m. Sunday to go scouting for deer on a portion of his 80-acre property, according to his brother, Ty Sees. &#34;When he didn&#39;t come back by 12:30 p.m., four of us went out looking for him,&#34; Ty Sees said late Sunday afternoon. &#34;It&#39;s not like him to be gone this long.&#34; Harold &#34;Brub&#34; Sees joined the initial search that yielded no sign of his son. &#34;We covered the area he normally covers,&#34; the elder Sees said. &#34;We hollered constantly, but didn&#39;t see or hear him. &#34;Todd knows this territory like the back of his hand. What bothers me is that he&#39;s been gone too long.&#34; Clad in a white T-shirt soaked with sweat, Brub Sees also worried how his son was coping in the intense heat, which climbed into the 90s by early afternoon. A coordinated search effort began at 2:30 p.m. when Northumberland Borough Fire Chief Josh Newbury received a call from Sue Sees requesting help in finding her husband.<n> <n><n> Newbury said Todd Sees was planning to go scouting on the ridge with another person who later decided not to go out.  Although no one saw Todd Sees leave early Sunday morning, his 18-year-old son, Nick, did find his four-wheeler on the west end of the ridge two miles from their home at about 12:30 p.m., Brub Sees said. Todd Sees is an avid outdoorsman who&#39;s known to &#34;walk for hours,&#34; Northumberland No. 1 Fire Department volunteer Nate Fisher said, but he&#39;s never stayed out for so long without contacting family.  &#34;The heat, that&#39;s what scares me,&#34; Fisher said earlier in the day, adding that no one is certain what, if any, provisions Sees took with him.  Ty Sees said his brother usually grabs a can of Mountain Dew and dresses in camouflage when he&#39;s gone out on similar excursions. Some volunteers speculated that Sees may have slipped on a rock and is unable to call for help. &#34;It very rough terrain and there&#39;s thick brush,&#34; Geise said. &#34;This is going to be a slow and methodical search.&#34; &#34;Be aware, rattlesnakes are in abundance,&#34; he told the volunteers preparing to head out on the search from the command post at the base of the ridge off Geise Road. However, the group had to wait several hours while three tracking dogs from Northstar Search &amp; Rescue of Selinsgrove and James Shaffer were sent out into the heavily wooded area to try to pick up Todd Sees&#39; scent. By 6 p.m. a state police helicopter from Hazelton had flown over the ridge looking for the missing man and Geise was requesting bloodhounds be brought in to assist the other canines in the search. At about 7:45 p.m., the bloodhound was on the scene and Geise decided he had to send the 25 volunteers out on foot to begin a sweep of a 6-square-mile area. &#34;It&#39;s been fruitless so far,&#34; the chief said an hour later.

Point Township police began investigating the death of Todd Sees after his body was discovered Aug. 5 in a wooded area at the western base of Montour Ridge about 150 yards from his house. An autopsy failed to conclude a cause of death and toxicology tests were ordered. &#34;Right now we&#39;re on hold until we get the test results,&#34; Point Township Police Chief Gary Steffen said Tuesday. The blood tests are expected to take another four or five weeks, he said. &#34;It&#39;s just a waiting game,&#34; Steffen said. &#34;Something certainly caused his death. The answer has to be in the blood.&#34; Sees was reported missing on the afternoon of Aug. 4, hours after he left his home on an ATV to go scouting for deer on Montour Ridge. A family member found the ATV about two miles from his home, but there was no sign of Sees. About 200 volunteers, along with tracking dogs and searchers in helicopters, looked for the missing man for several hours. About 30 hours after he went missing, Sees&#39; relatives stumbled upon his body in a densely wooded area of the ridge about 150 yards from his house. Northumberland County Coroner James Kelley said the autopsy revealed Sees had been dead between 24 hours to 36 hours, but found no signs of trauma or of coronary disease. n E-mail comments to mmoore@dailyitem.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> Investigation into man&#39;s death a &#39;waiting game&#39;<n> <n><n> By Marcia Moore<n> <n><n> The Daily Item<n> <n><n> NORTHUMBERLAND Investigators are still awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed a 39-year-old Northumberland County man found in the woods near his home last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Point Township police began investigating the death of Todd Sees after his body was discovered Aug. 5 in a wooded area at the western base of Montour Ridge about 150 yards from his house.

8/4/02 04:00|Keystone|CO|Light|1 hour|I woke my husband to look out the window.  I didn't trust what I was seeing with my own eyes.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24190.html|436|ndxe200208| I woke my husband to look out the window.  I didn&#39;t trust what I was seeing with my own eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were spending the night at the home of friends, in Keystone, Colorado.  This is a resort town in the mountains and because it&#39;s far from city lights the night sky was filled with stars against a pitch black sky.  I awoke about 4 in the morning and because it was chilly I decided to close a window.   I looked up at the sky and was in awe of the stars.  One particular star looked a little brighter than others so it caught my attention.  As I stared at what I thought was a star--I thought I saw it move.  I kept staring...and finally realized that it was moving...not a lot--but up and down and sideways.  Then shortly after fixing my sights on this &#34;star&#34; and noticing that it was moving--I saw a short burst of white light.  I kept staring and watched as every few minutes other short bursts came from this star--but not always from the same spot.  Sometimes to the right...sometimes to the left...sometimes above the &#34;star&#34;--and occasionally (very occasionally) from further out to the side...further than most times.  My mind was racing for an explanation.  A UFO was not the first thing that came to mind.  Frankly--nothing came to mind other than sheer wonder.  So I sat down on the bed and just watched...for maybe 15 minutes.  Finally I thought I&#39;d better wake my husband because he simply would not believe me if he didn&#39;t see for himself.  So I woke him up and got him to come to the window.  He also saw what I&#39;ve just described but had no explanation.  Unfortunately he had taken a sleeping pill earlier and wasn&#39;t as thrilled with this discovery as I was...or as curious.  He went back to bed but I kept watching...and wondering.  After about 30 minutes I noticed something that took my breath away.  Another &#34;star&#34; of a lesser intensity was located directly below the one I had been watching...and it was moving IN TANDOM with the brighter &#34;star.&#34;  Each moved slowly one way then another--up a  little then down a little.  So I started searching the sky for other &#34;stars&#34; that moved like these and found ! one more to the right.  It didn&#39;t move in tandom but it was moving just like the other two.  All three &#34;stars&#34; exhibited the light flashes I described earlier and in the same patterns.  Occasionally I thought perhaps I saw a red light but that&#39;s tough to tell for sure because I was staring for an hour at this display.  At one point I did see what I thought was a very fast &#34;shooting star&#34; to the left side of the two moving in tandom.  It&#39;s not that unusual to see a shooting star when the sky is that dark, but usually they don&#39;t move as quickly as this one.  And also, normally you can track them in the sky at a longer distance than what I saw.  This was so quick and short I questioned if I saw it at all--but I&#39;m sure I did.  I sat there for about an hour all total--and I&#39;m not sure what time it was although I&#39;m guessing all this started about 4 in the morning. (It was so dark I couldn&#39;t find my watch and there was no clock in the guest room.)  Finally, the sky was starting to lighten with the rising sun so the &#34;stars&#34; were fading and so was I.  As much as I hated to, I went back to bed.  I told everyone in the morning what I saw and I was so grateful I had woken my husband to support my story.  (Not that no one would believe me, but my husband is a very respected, retired businessman.  Definitely &#34;no nonsense&#34; and not one to say he saw a UFO.  In fact, he still maintains there has to be some logical explanation.)  As for me, I&#39;m 54 years old, and semi-retired.  I don&#39;t quite know what to think, but I know what I saw.  I&#39;ve never said I believed in UFOs, but I&#39;ve always left room for the possibility that it is possible.  In fact--when I returned from the mountains this afternoon, I went on-line to find a &#34;UFO Reporting&#34; site and this was the first time I&#39;ve ever even typed in &#34;UFO&#34; on my computer.  It isn&#39;t something that interested me--until now.  So--that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the excellent report.  We believe that the first possibility to be addressed would be a celestial body, possibly a &#34;twinkling&#34; star.  PD))<n>
8/4/02 02:00|Gardiner|ME||not known|A triple-ellipse "thought-bubble" crop formation found in  rural Gardiner, ME, investigated by BLT Research Team Inc.|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24473.html|437|ndxe200208| ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Nancy Talbott for following up with this report, and for reporting back to NUFORC.  The BLT Research website is &lt;www.bltresearch.com&gt;.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> A triple-ellipse &#34;thought-bubble&#34; crop formation found in  rural Gardiner, ME, investigated by BLT Research Team Inc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2 am August 4th Witness #1, who had gotten up to get some water, observed a bright white flash of light followed by a small (perhaps flash-light sized) BOL down low over a hayfield across the street from her house.  The BOL bobbed around over the crop for several minutes, then seemed to come closer to her location, then &#34;went straight up in a beam of light&#34; and disappeared.  At approx. the same time a neighbor (Witness #2) whose house is approx. 75 yards away from the hayfield, got up because her dog was barking loudly and repeatedly; she observed that the dog was facing the hayfield as he continued to bark for about 5 minutes. Witnes #3 (the wife of the hayfield&#39;s owner), who lives several hundred yards distant, woke up sometime after 12 midnight and heard a strange &#34;metallic-type&#34; noise which lasted only a few moments:  &#34;I have never heard that kind of noise before.&#34; At about noon on August 4th the hayfield owner&#39;s 16-year-old son went to visit his grandmother whose house is immediately adjacent to the hayfield and discovered the new crop circles.  The boy notified his mother and step-father, who called the local police; the officer who examined the field told the family that he did not think the circles were &#34;man-made&#34; and suggested they notify UFORC  ((National UFO Reporting Center--PD)), which they subsequently did. UFORC then notified the BLT Research Team Inc. of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 5, 2002, a BLT field-team arrived at the relatively rural location; both team members have investigated crop circles in the U.S. and in Europe, and one has extensive experience in many countries over 10 years.  A thorough examination of the circles and extensive interviews were carried out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hayfield is on a dead-end street with perhaps 8 houses along it.  The field is about 2 acres in size and goes up-hill into a large, partially open area; the house of Witness #1 is immediately across the street from the field.  Witness #2&#39;s house is about the same distance away, but behind a row of trees which border the field on that side.  Three contiguous, flattened, ellipses were discovered in the lower (2-acre section) of the field, with their edges just touching, creating what crop circle researchers call a &#34;thought-bubble&#34; design. Largest ellipse was 65&#39; at its widest point; middle circle was 35&#39; at its widest point; smallest circle was 25&#39; at its widest point.  The centers of all three ellipses were considerably off-center.  There was a slight curve to the overall design, perhaps 20 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plants (grasses and fescue with goldenrod, Queen Anne&#39;s Lace, clover and milkweed) were fairly gently laid over, with the thicker-stalked plants such as milkweed clearly showing bending at the base.  No broken stalks were found.  All plants were swirled clockwise and it could not be determined whether the swirls had begun in the centers or ended there.  The initial impression of the crop lay was of fluidity, with a clear undulating character to the flow of downed plants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The majority of the flattened plants were grasses (not the cereal crops most typically involved) and the stem nodes of these plants are so small that no real evaluation in the field can be made of stem-node change (such as elongated apical nodes and/or expulsion cavities in the lower plant stem nodes).  The only visible significant change in any of the flattened plants was the bending at the base of most of the larger-stalk plants, such as milkweed.  No plant or soil samples were taken in this case, largely because of the plant species involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No compass deviations were noted inside the 3 ellipses and no cell-phone failures or camera malfunctions occurred.  A stop-watch check (where one stop-watch is left outside the formation and the other taken in with the field-team) revealed no time differences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photographs taken with flash cameras the evening of the 5th in the now 2-day-old event produced multiple &#34;anomalous&#34; light phenomena (recorded on several different cameras) typical of those seen in flash photos taken at other crop circles around the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The field-team&#39;s evaluation here leans toward this event being &#34;genuine&#34; (not mechanically produced) because of the following factors:  (1) Node-bending at the base of the thicker-stalked plants and no breakage at the base of any plants generally (especially the hay, which was dry and ready for harvest); (2) the fluidity of the overall crop lay, with at least two layers noted in several places; (3) the fact that all three downed areas were markedly elliptical, rather than circular; (4) the fact that all ellipse centers were markedly off-center; (5) the presence of a double-center in one ellipse; (6) the animal disturbance; (7) the eye-witness reports of unexplained light and noise phenomena at the same time during the night the formation occurred; (8) the remoteness of the location and our character-assessment of the people in the near vicinity.  However, without actual in-depth sampling of the plants and soils and subsequent laboratory evaluation, no firm assessment can be offered.<n>

Before I do, you should know that I am a student pilot, an avid aircraft buff, and have been in/around aircraft all my life.  I know the subject pretty well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Derry New Hampshire, which is not far from the Massachusettes border.  On the morning of August 4th, I was still online at 1:00 am.  It was a very clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to hear a rumbling sound which very quickly graduated to a loud roaring sound, rattling the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sprinted outside to have a look.  Traveling east to west, high overhead, was a single bright white light.  I would guess its altitude to have been at least thirty thousand feet, if not more.  I could discern no standard aviation lighting, but that&#39;s not unusual given the height.  What was amazing was the roar!  I recently moved back here from Florida&#39;s Brevard County, where the sound of rocket launches was somewhat routine.  If I had seen this in Florida, I would have thought they were launching a rocket in the wrong direction.  As I said, the sound of this aircraft was so loud it rattled the windows, and sounded EXACTLY like a rocket launch.  There was no sound of turbines at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sounded extremely powerful.  My first impression was that I was looking at a missle coming in from the Atlantic somewhere.  The hair stood up on my arms and for a moment I thought...&#34;uh oh&#34;.  All I can say was that this was no normal aircraft, if that&#39;s what it was.  I do not believe this was a fighter jet with afterburners on.  It was not traveling especially fast, and continued at the same speed throughout its trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else in the area heard this that night.  It was traveling roughly over the Mass/NH border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound actually awoke others in my household, which has never happened before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time, Greg<n>

My &#39;window&#39; of observation is rather confined because of large trees in the yard. The back of the house also blocks views to the west, as well.  In addition, clouds were just moving in from the northwest and beginning to obscure the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did, however, have a good clear view of the sky immediately overhead with Vega shining brightly.  I decided to grab my binoculars and folding cot and enjoy the night air for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just laid down and gotten comfortable when I noticed a &#39;star&#39; of nearly the same magnitude as Vega and just to the southwest of it.  However, this star was moving.  I quickly put the 10x50 binoculars on it, but it still remained just a single bright point of light.  It was moving on roughly a south to north track at about the same speed most satellites move, but the unusual brightness suggested to me that this wasn&#39;t a conventional satellite.  I&#39;ve observed the International Space Station pass overhead and it was comparable in brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object move further north, it faded out as it moved behind the thickening cloud cover.  I quickly took note of the time and went online to www.heavens-above.com, a web site that provides orbital observation information on hundreds of space objects from the ISS to Russian space junk.  I found no objects that coincided with the time, magnitude [brightness] and track of this object that would have been visible from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever the object was, it was unusually bright for a satellite though it certainly exhibited most of the other characteristics of a conventional satellite.<n>

We hiked up one of the dunes , and sat there looking at stars for a couple minutes and then looked out over the Ocean. We spotted an orange light above the ocean, way out, that was too low too be a star, and yet too high to be a ship or a boat. We watched it for 20 minutes keeping our eyes glued on the UFO. It&#39;s movements we both caught as they were very unique. They stayed in the same spot, but jerked up and down, to the right and the left very fast, but not moving far. We checked the movements of the object as each of us had seen, and our eyes saw the same thing. Eventually it got duller and dimmer and dissapeared. This craft or thing, was nothing we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The planet Venus is visible in the western sky at the time indicated, and would disappear &#34;behind&#34; the western horizon in the manner described.

It appeared to become quite a bit brighter then it faded very quickly to a moving light (similar to an airplane, except it had no blinking lights).  The light was white and the only changes were in the intensity.  It didn&#39;t appear to move until after the intensity faded.  This happened twice in a 15 minute period.  There were also 4 meteors during a half-hour period from about 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., as well as other aircraft with the usual flashing light.<n>

I don&#39;t know how long it had been occurring but I watched them for about thee minutes before the event stopped. The lights seemed to circle independently, each moving in the circle while moving  but not in a locked position; each seemed an independent light darting about with the others and together forming a rough circle for a time and then at the same time joining together at the center.  They did not form a perfectly round center light when they joined; that is each round light seemed to remain separate and  &#34;touch&#34; the others at the center, forming a larger irregular center light .  Then they went  back out again to form the circle and repeated this process over and over.  At the end they joined in the center and, after maybe 10-15 seconds, the lights just &#34;went out.&#34; At the end the lights seemed to be more like one light, more totally merged into one.   I live near an airport but the lights were not like any I have ever seen and did not behave like the lights that the airport uses.  I have only once before experienced anything that I could remotely call a UFO sighting, four and a half years ago from this same house, but that time it was more like a bright star type light, two of them darting and then coming together before the light went out when they last joined.  This time the lights were very soft and diffuse looking, there were more of them, and they behaved very differently.  I&#39;m thrilled to have seen it and wish my neighbor was not away on a camping trip!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a &#34;sighting&#34; of an advertising light, swirling in the night sky.

The were circular shaped, and were also moving very slowly.  They all went different directions, and then the bigger one picked up speed (note that it never got smaller, so I could tell that the others came OUT of it), and went the other direction (started going west, then went east).  The others also picked up speed.  I realized that I was peeing all over the floor, and looked down very briefly (about a second, maybe two), and they were gone.

The formation remained visable for aprox 5 minutes.  Then a group of low level clouds moved through and the objects were hidden by the clouds moving eastward. When I reached my house(within 2 minutes) I ran inside and grabbed a camera and binoculars and went back outside. The clouds had,by now, moved off to the east.I scanned the sky,but nothing but blue sky was visable. Then I observed a single white cross of in the distance (due west).It looked like a large white airliner making a turn.

I found in the city Newspaper Insight \Section.That on August 3rd,2002 in the early morning.Farmers in Howick ,Quebec found strange crop circles.The formation being called a Qua! druple formation.It now confirmed to me of what I had witnessed that same morning on Aug.3rd 2002.There was a something intelligent and large over the skies in southern Ontario/Quebec that early morning to confirm.Just to note some other strange observations on the ground here at the time during camp Peter.My car clock was 13 minutes slower.Earlier in the week at camp.I heard strange animal sounds near 1:30am.I have never heard these sounds before-high pitched squeaking.Even a cottager across the river shone their high beam flashlight at the strange sound&#39;s location described.Here&#39;s the kicker to this story of paranormal.My 9 year old son said he saw a Koala Bear in the day.It was the same area as the shrinking that late night.He knows his animals-so what was it ?? The day I came home at camp.Near midnight, when I went to bed.I could hear this same type of sound I heard at camp, now here at home.My body felt highly electrified.Like all my body hair stood up ^ . I was so tired from the late nights before .Previous to 2002,I have witnes! sed othe r aerial anomalies at camp since 1999.It was this sighting and experience that sparked my interest to research and understand.What&#39;s going on here ? I feel it possible that I have been abducted numerous times-since childhood.It&#39;s almost like it follows you.I do believe this is a life time conditioning.Making it easier to except a intelligent presence around us.Lessening the fright factor.I will include the newspaper article concerning the crop circle formations found in Howick Quebec.Thx again PMS<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same source.

It was only lightnig but we thought it was like having our own free fire works display. We could still see the stars above us but the lightning storm was all around our city with just this clear spot in the middle. After watching the storm for a while we both noticed what looked like a car with its high beams in the sky off to the north east. It moved our way slowly and made no noise until it was right above us. It was a triangle shaped object with two bright lights on the front. It also had three white lights in a cirlce on the underneath with one red light in the center. It was about 45 to 50 feet off the ground and travelling very slow. There was no sound until it was right above us. It headed in a southwest direction at a slow pace (too slow for an airplane). I used to be in the army and I know the sounds of both airplanes and helicopters and the hum from this craft was not the same. As soon as it went back into the storm clouds two strange things happened. The wind, which was not blowing before pick up and started blowing at a high rate and within a minute after it disappeared the storm just stopped. when it passed right over my wife and I we both made out it&#39;s shape becuase the lights on the bottom lit up it&#39; outline and the sky was clear right above our heads.<n>

Upon returning to the window about 30 seconds later, saw no lights. I was puzzled, and continued to stare up @ the partly clouded sky. All at once, two lights simply appeared-as though switched on-above the clouds in roughly the same place; they were too large to be anything I could think of, and side by side, bright but diffused around the edges by the clouds. I stared up at them for at least five minutes, maybe longer, and they were stationary and unchanging. Suddenly, the one on the left both changed shape and blinked out, within a couple of seconds. Soon the one on the right went out-without changing shape first. The lights were within the atmosphere-much too low to be a satellite, but I&#39;ve no idea how many degrees from the horizon they were. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, ever!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her story to be quite convincing.

The crafts were in the same position as a flock of birds. They were in a V position. One at the front, then two behind it, then two more, and then another two. Me and two other work mates were sitting outside my house having a cigarette and beer when i heard a strange buzzing noise. It was like a loud hum and sharp radio frequency buzz at the same time. At first we thought it was a car, then the phone, then our pages, then even the fridge or microwave. But we couldn&#39;t have heard that noise from inside because we were atleast 30 feet away from the house. A small flash like a comet flew directly over us, it was pretty high in the sky though. Then two more, and two more and then two more. All seven crafts flew over my house. We could clearly make out the shape of them. They looked like air-craft that the Navy uses but literally 50 times bigger. They dissapeared every minute or so and then re-appeared with one large lige on each of them. As soon as i got my video camera from inside and ran outside they had already been there for close to a minute. Each time they flew over us the noise they made got more high-pitched.

8/2/02 21:30|Wisconsin Rapids|WI|Triangle|10 sec.|Large,low flying triangle|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25702.html|466|ndxe200208| Large,low flying triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife,daughter,&amp;sister-in-law were sitting on our patio, and I was in the house watching TV.I told them to let me know if they saw anything in the sky out of the ordinary.I&#39;ve seen numerous strange lights going in many different directions and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re satellites.They are at varying heights and glow at different levels of brightness.In May I saw a chevron shaped object that had a transparecey to it and it was of a fairly low altitude that flew over the north end of my house.I reported that to W-Files/UFO Wisconsin.I think my family thought I was a little bit whacko but I&#39;m out every clear night looking and I know what I&#39;ve seen.Anyway,I went out by the girls and they said they saw a white light moving across the sky but it could of been just about anything I guess.I was looking east over my house at the time and saw a dark triangle heading west directly over us and told the girls where it was.Thankfully they all saw it so it made me feel a bit better.This thing was about the size of a 747 or larger.I would guess it to be 300 to 400 feet up.It was kind of transparent like the other craft I saw but it showed a little more structure when it was passing directly overhead and as it was moving away to the west.It seemed to have some type of rectangular grid pattern across the back of it.There were points when you could see stars or what looked to be stars through it.When you see something like that it stretches your mind a bit because you can&#39;t get your mind prepared to see something it would&#39;nt ever expect to see.I asked everyone who saw it what they felt from this and they all said fear and evil.I felt the same.<n>

The lights weren&#39;t very bright, but they went all the way around it. and it changed shape like it stood on it&#39;s end and got shorter and fatter as it was turning on its end.  As it flattened out again it got long and skinny, like a cigar. I definitly was not an airplane or a weather balloon.  It was like what you hear on ufo shows.  It made no noise.

When I saw the first craft start to move, I saw that there was a second craft that the other 3 lights belonged to, but when I looked back after following the first triangle, the second one was gone as well. Less than five minutes after they were gone, a long SUV vehicle game flying down the road, as if in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I dont know if it was a UFO but it was definitely something I have never seen in the sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a rural area in northeast Nebraska so it gets real dark and quiet at night. One evening I was doing some work in my shop and I heard a faint rumbling noise outside. I decided to step outside and see what it was. Its pretty normal for me to hear the rumble of high altitude commercial airplanes or the occasional &#34;thump thump&#34; of medical helicoptors traveling to hospitals between towns. When I looked outside to see where the sound was comming from i saw a large boxy/rectangular shaped craft flying approximately 500-1500 feet above the ground a little to the south of me. It came from the east and traveled west. There were several lights on this craft, some in front some in back and some on top, more than a typical plane or helicoptor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there a minute or so looking at this thing trying to figure out what it was. It moved about the speed of a helicoptor but without the normal &#34;thump thump&#34; sound. The best way for me to describe this craft was that it resembled a semi tractor with its boxy shape and lights. I went inside and grabbed my binoculars. When I came out I followed it to the west for about 5 minutes with my binoculars until it was out of sight. I tried to see if it had wings or helicoptor blades or some kind of recognizable outline. All I could make out of the shape was the form of the lights. A boxy shape. I thought to myself that the whole incident was quite odd so I went back to work in my shop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later I heard another rumble sound and went outside to check it out. To my surprise it was the same craft traveling from the west to the east. Again I followed it with my binoculars as far as I could see to the east this time. There were no other aircraft in the air at that time, especially at that low altitude. That was the only time I have seen this thing. I figured it had to be something military but there arent any military installations that would be doing manuvers in my area that I know of. But then again who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a Southwest Jet passing over the area where I work. I could read the name on the tail and I recognized the Southwest colors and Logo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside, I do security at night outdoors.  I looked up and heading from where I was standing, North-East toward Love Field Airport I saw a Southwest Airlines jet passing over head. It was about to land I think at Love field as far as I could tell according to the direction it was traveling.  I noticed a light pink and orange object with no sound other than the noise made by the jet and I noticed this slightly glowing craft teardrop in shape or acorn and about the size of a small bus or van  off the jet&#39;s right wing about two hundred yards over and about one and hundred fifty yards to the right moving slightly behind  traveling at the same speed the jet was traveling as though it was pacing the jet. I would guess they were about 7 to 8 Hundred feet up and both very visible from where I was standing. It was just starting to get dark.  I watched until both craft went out of my view. This lasted about 45 seconds.<n>

One afternoon in the summer of 2002 he called me out to the back porch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He already had the binoculars out and handed them to me.  He pointed to a spot in the sky and said &#34;what do you think that is?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked through the binoculars and saw a silver disk shaped craft maybe 40-50ft in diameter.There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I took the binoculars away from my eyes I could see the object hovering maybe a half mile off and about 300 ft off the ground.  I started to look at it through the binoculars again and in a few moments it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that same moment my stepfather said &#34;where did it go&#34;?   I quickly looked around the sky and saw the object 15 miles away over the city of Pleasanton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stepfathers response was &#34;we can&#39;t have anything that can do that.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects dissapeared again and we never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stepfather passed away last year, but at least he got to see a real UFO.   He was never the same after that day, and he had started to consider the link between extraterrestrials and the history of the human race.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I loved him and I will miss him and I&#39;m glad we were able to share this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Unfortunately, I don’t remember the date, or where I was flying to.   It was around 2002 and I lived in the Washington, D.C. area--so I was either flying to or from Washington, D.C.  (Most likely to or from Kansas City)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of my window I saw a metal looking object.   It was shaped like a straightened out hot dog.  (Long, straight, cylinder shaped and rounded at both ends)  It was tilted at a 45 degree angle.  It was very shiny, and it seemed to hover next to the plane for a long time.  I could not tell if it was very close and small, or if it was far away and large.   If it was close, it was not dangerously close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it didn’t seem that we were passing it.  It seemed to remain in my sight for a very long time.  Maybe 15-20 minutes.  I think I may have stopped looking at it at some point because I don’t remember eventually &#34;passing&#34; it or it disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the flight I asked the pilot if he saw it, and he said no.

My brother-in-law phoned me to ask if I remebered seeing the UFO this past summer. I had no idea what he was talking about. He had only remembered because his wife had asked him about it that night. She did NOT see it. We had told her about it. After he began describing what had happened, I said &#34;Oh my gosh! I had totally forgotten&#34;. Here is the little bit that I do recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a hot summer night and we had gone outside . It was late and we were just enjoying the clear star filled night. I was visiting my sister and brother-in-law and life was good. All I remember so far is the bright streak of whitish light a loud boom like an explosion then the light stayed for a couple of seconds then it was gone. The whole thing lasted maybe 30 seconds. If we had not been looking up at the night sky, we would have only heard the boom, but it so happens we saw it and heard it. Our reactions were &#34;Oh my gosh what did we just see?&#34; &#34;What was that?&#34; . We expected people to come outside to see what the boom was but no one did. We went inside woke up my sister and told her we thought we&#39;d just seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, this was totally forgotten and never mentioned again until last night Dec. 29. My memory is not good about what we saw in detail but I definitely, positively remember the reactions we had to what we saw. I remember the emotion experienced rather than the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and consideration.

I was on the bus with my friend who also believes in UFOs.  We were out in the middle of nowhere.  Most of the people on the bus were asleep.  That&#39;s when I looked out the window and saw three half-orb lights flying in a triangular formation. You could tell it was one entity.  I got my friend&#39;s attention and pointed out the object to him.  It was moving very slowly, in the opposite direction of the bus.  We dismissed it as nothing at first but then we saw a second one.  This time the object had four lights and was flying in a square shape.  It was also just one entity.  Now we knew we had something odd on our hands.  It was doing the same thing as the first object.  Then, about ten seconds later, at the same distance between the second and first one, in a straight line from the first one, was the third.  Now we were getting excited.  I leaned over and woke up another one of my friends.  I pointed the objects out to him.  He was amazed at this.  Another kid on the bus overheard us and started telling the little kids.  We told him to stop so not to scare them.  About every 10-12 seconds, we would see another one go by, containing 3-5 half-orb lights and being in various shapes.  This continued for about ten minutes.  They were all in an exact straight line.  It was amazing.  I don&#39;t know how many exactly saw the objects.

I don't know its altitude, but it took up half my windshield!|11/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26100.html|488|ndxe200208| details of my first sighting of triangle in Hermantown. I don&#39;t know its altitude, but it took up half my windshield!<n> <n><n> <n><n> first of all, i&#39;d like to say i&#39;m very excited to share my observations with this site(which i just discovered). In roughly august 2001, i was driving northbound on highway 53 through hermantown. when i got to the dopplar radar, my friend&#39;s dad(itting shotgun), pointed to a &#34;airplane&#34; on the left side of the road. i thought nothing of it at first, but then realized it was much too large to be a commercial jet and started watching it. the craft continued to cross the highway directly over my car. i stopped right on the highway(as other motorists sped by!) the craft took up over half my windshield relatively-wise and i saw it clear as day. the most striking characteristic to me was that the craft did not seem aerodynamic at all! it was like a triangle, blocky ship(like a triangle brick, very thick)ttom. it was not smooth and was covered in what i can only describe as&#34;piping and ductwork&#34; this thing looked like it should just drop from the sky like a brick. it was equilateral with had a large white light on each corner and a blinking red light in the center.i got out of my car to listen and there was no noise. i know this thing landed just over the treeline, not more than 500 ft from hwy 53! it was right next to the ANG base(which is definitely in operation, by the way) on the right side of road by Pure Pleasures and the national weather service Dopplar station. this was the most exciting thing i have ever seen and it gave me newfound faith in the strength of the US military. if this thin could carry troops or tanks, it will change warfare forever. i watch the sky by hermantown everytime i drive by it; and i&#39;m willing to bet this craft lands here every day around 10-1030. i have seen the light pattern numerous times(app. 4-5)n, but never anywhere near as close as my first sighting. this ship has enormous capabilities, possibly cloaking( in one daytime sighting, the ship seemed to be the same blue as the horizon, only the bright lights showing) it also moves very fast(one evening sighting, the tri-light pa! ttern wa s over the treetops traveling south parrallel with the highway seemed to kick it down and go really fast towards hermantown. this light pattern was as big as a nickle relatively speaking.) sorry if this message is too long, but i&#39;m excited that theres an organization that studies this type of thing. i dont want to jeopardize national security, but this craft is real and I personally believe it is based out of the hermantown air national guard base. your investigators best time would be between 930-1030. there are numerous business parking lots right along the highway. If i owned a camcorder i&#39;d be there already! i just wonder why this craft has been stationed up here so long(at least one year) i hope this information leads you to an equally as amazing sight as we were treated to.
