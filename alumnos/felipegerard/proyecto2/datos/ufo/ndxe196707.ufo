There have been unbelievable events ever since in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have failed to report this event all these years.  I am now 53 years old.  On this date in 1967 I came home from work that night (going by Churchville Park)when I noticed blue lights. I pulled off the road and looked closer. It was a saucer hovering above the dense trees in the park. My first thought was &#34;oh my God, I need a witness&#34;. My home was only a couple of minutes from there. I rushed into the house and got my father to go back to that spot with me.  Though the craft was a little farther west than when I first saw it, we both sat in amazement as it hovered above us. It had blue lights around the bottom of it. It didn&#39;t seem to make any noise. But it amazed us that it could just sit there and hover. Somehow we felt we must have &#34;followed&#34; the craft because we ended up on a foreign road an hour from our home.<n>

We observed a brightly lit, numerous colored object that seemed to be burning.  It was giving off all the colors of the spectrum.  Could of been something reentering our atmosphere, that would explain the burning.  Always puzzled me and my friend. I don&#39;t recall hearing about anything from in the news about it.  My mother hadn&#39;t either.  The object was rather large.  Directly over head it appeared to be the size of a quarter if held up at arms length.  We watched it for about 90 seconds and it never stopped burning.<n>

7/16/67 20:45|Crystal Beach|TX|Disk|3.25 hours|Spent a sunday in July 1967 at Crystal Beach with friends, at dusk I spotted what appeared to be a speed boat in the Gulf heading towar|1/22/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11667.html|5|ndxe196707| Spent a sunday in July 1967 at Crystal Beach with friends, at dusk I spotted what appeared to be a speed boat in the Gulf heading toward shore.It was not what it first appeared to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a Sunday in Mid July 1967 I spent the day at the Beach with 10 other people between 8 years and 19 years of age, the sky&#39;s were cloudy and we pretty much had the beach to ourselves. I was 19 years old and the oldest. We drove to the Beach in 2 cars, when dusk was approaching, 4 of the group decided to go into Galveston to go dancing, they left in one car. Crystal Beach is located on the Bolivar Peninsula off of the road that connects the mainland to the Galveston Ferry, which takes cars to Galveston. We (7 of us) started driving on the sand watching the waves as the sun was dropping, 2 of the girls were sitting on top of the hood catching the breeze as we drove. We were in a brand new chevy, listening to the radio. While watching the sea as the sun went uner the horizon my attention was caught by what appeared to be a speed boat heading straight towards land, it moved the way a speed boat moves on water, the color at first was silverish, then it turned to amber, I told the others to look at it, at some point as we watched, the driver and I realized that the object was moving far too fast, and headed straight at us, at this point he had stopped the car, I told  the 2 girls to get in the car and we proceeded to drive out between the beach houses on one of the dirt roads that connects the main road to the beach, it is a very short distance, it was going on nine oclock p.m. I was sitting front seat passenger and watching behind us from the open window, I was startled to watch the object closing on us far too quickly and it was changing colors. As we made the turn onto the main road the object had caught up with us, I can&#39;t discribe how fast this took place, the radio stopped playing. It then proceeded to tail us, I won&#39;t go into what was happening between the occupants of the car, however it was not any type of craft that any of us had seen before, and it was obviously a flying saucer, which was supposed to not really exist, we were scared (real understatement here) Since I was the oldest everyone was l! ooking t o me for answers, I was praying. Suddenly the driver pulls over to the side of the road slowing down and coming to a stop, I was dumbfounded with that action and asked for an explanation, he silently showed me that the key was locked in the ignition, as I watched him trying to turn the key I noticed the car lights had also gone off. We carefully told the others that the saucer had taken the cars power, to stay calm, we rolled the windows up and locked the doors. The craft was hovering directly to the rear, very low, and clearly visible. I was watching it through the rear window. The craft had 2 decks and a dome on top, all 3 levels had port holes. At the center between the 2 large decks was a wide rim which held panels of colored lights, these lights rotated around the craft constantly. The craft was translucent, glowed with light, the paneled lights were green, blueish white, and orange, the panels were rectangular in shape, the colors were pale, but seemed to pulsate as they moved around showing more vivid color back to pale color. I could not see inside the port holes, the glass was thick and dull looking and crusted around the edges, the craft had rivets at the deck joints. I was watching closly for activity and trying to keep the kids quiet and calm. I started to realize that I was becoming hypnotized by the lights going around and I forced myself to stop watching them, and told the others to not watch the colored lights. The car then started, the driver took off immediately, the craft again tailed us as we drove down the road, it tailed us right up to the turn off that would take us back to civilization and I-10 East, and then it veered out to the right (top of craft tilted) and was gone, it left a streak even though it was night time, here is a strange part of this encounter, the car radio came back on, and the DJ announced its 12 midnight. The loss of 3 hours startled all 7 of us, we just could not believe it, it had seemed to have lasted less then 30 minutes. We started to report it, then decide! d we wou ld be branded as crazy. I am reporting it after all these years because this is the first time I have found a place to report it. I would like to talk to an investigator, if I can be emailed a number I will call. I have some questions and can give other details about my observation.<n>

But this is the way it is, I know what I saw, and in my opinion,it was some type of alien aircraft.

It was summertime, probably between 9:30 to 10:00 PM.  A couple of friends and I were in my front yard talking and looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point we noticed what looked like a normal star of average intensity (not particularly bright) almost directly overhead except that it was moving around, meandering around really, in no apparent pattern, over a small area of the sky that was equivalent to about the amount of sky that you could block out with a tennis ball held overhead at arm’s length.  At first we thought it might have been something like a weather balloon that was high enough to still be in sunlight even though it was dark at ground level since it wasn&#39;t that long after sunset, and was being moved around by high altitude winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This meandering pattern continued for maybe 30 – 45 seconds from when we first noticed it, at which point this single star-like object split into three star-like objects of the same size and intensity as the original single point of light.  Within several seconds, these three points of light aligned themselves side by side by side (like three cars in adjacent traffic lanes) and were uniformly apart from each other (the distances between each of the three lights was about the width of a pencil held overhead at arm’s length).  As soon as they were aligned, the three lights moved slowly off across the sky in a southerly or southwesterly direction at a constant speed, in perfectly straight lines, with the three lights staying perfectly abreast of each other and maintaining the equal spacing between each other.  At no time did we hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It would be the summer of 1966,67 or 68.  Since a number of highly credible sightings, which included photos during the summer of 1967, I am using the 1967 date but I can&#39;t actually remember the date other than I am positive it was summertime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was spherical, metallic-grey (gray), scratched or scuffed surface, perfectly stationary and seemed very close (&lt;500 ft). Vague memory of &#34;heat waves&#34; eminating around it but couldn&#39;t be mirage as it was well above the ground.  More like an optical distortion.  Appeared spherical due to sun shaping it as it would a ball. Hovered over golf course and was brought to our golfing party&#39;s attention by other golfers so there were more than 3 percipients.  Sky was very clear blue and the weather was sunny and warm and object was almost due West.  Gave up trying to make sense of it and teed off. Looked back halfway down the fairway and it was still there but slightly more SW direction which is another reason I feel it was very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On the rear of the building was a set of fire escapes leading from the ground down to the ground, just 50 yards away was a base ball field. One evening I awoke and noticed red and green blinking lights in our back yard, I looked out the window and saw something very large hovoring above the base ball field about 20 feet off the ground with red and green blinking lights around the bottom of the craft. The event didn&#39;t scare me, and I returned to bed after observing the craft for about a half hour. The next morning I informed my parents as to what I saw, being 9 years old they dismissed the incident as a vivid imagination, until the following day when the local newspaper the Demorcrat Messanger ran a story about the two guards in the temporary museum reporting seeing the same craft the same morning, the night was warm and the guards decided to sleep on the fire escape facing the ball field, they claimed they were awoken by the brightness of the lights of the craft, and eventually it simply rose into the sky straight up and to the northeast until it disappeared about 1/2 hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this particular occasion my buddy ((name deleted)) and I were laying on our backs reclined in his parent’s lawn chairs scanning the summer night sky for the usual targets as the full moon hung low to the north.  And, sure enough, by 2 or 3 in the morning we had spotted a couple shooting stars and at least one satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after the satellite sighting one of us spotted what (at the time) appeared to be a very slow, low flying plane.  However, as we observed it we realized that it was somewhat unusual in that it wasn’t making a sound on that calm, clear early morning and it was pulsating red, green, blue and yellow lights on and off.  Not flashing, but more of a fade in and out intermittently.  The blue would fade out and the yellow would fade in, for example.  I remember that we couldn’t decide whether it was a small plane or a helicopter and we had plenty of time to discuss our thoughts on it, as it slowly passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane flew over the practice football field behind Columbus High School while we watched from across the street. (I believe Columbus Drive).  It came in from the south heading north and then it must have moved slightly east/northeast after it passed by our location.  When it shifted east it just happened to go right over my parent’s house and it seemed to stay at the same altitude throughout the entire time we observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, UFO’s and flying saucers were not even part of our discussion until the object passed over my house and in front of the full moon.  Needless to say, we were astounded and exclaimed, &#34;Did you see what I saw!&#34; at the same time.  I pressed ((name deleted)) to go and get his Dad’s camera.  Which he did, not before waking his parents to share the amazing news.  His parents were none to pleased to be disturbed and by the time he returned the object had disappeared behind trees in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well. We had the rest of the wee hours of the morning to compare notes and here’s what we saw fly between us and the full moon.  The best way to describe it would be by comparing it to a coffee cup (minus the handle) placed upside down on top of it’s upside down saucer plate.  It was a solid black silhouette in front of the moon for a second and a half and then it continued on and eventually out of sight. but not out of mind. :^)  We both were pretty much pooh-poohed by our parents and our friends were merciless so, we never discussed it with each other since.  In fact, our friendship evaporated soon after for whatever reasons of which I can’t explain.  I often wonder what would of happened if we had signaled it with our flash light.<n>

He said he was driving along and all of a sudden the road lit up as if a plane was going to land. You see, back home. we lived close to an airport and this was commen  whenever a plane would come in to land. That was his first thought, then realizing he&#39;s out in the middle of nowere he started slowing down and looking out the window. He saw 2 huge cigar shaped crafts, floating slowly towards the east. No noise with steam or somthing coming out of the rear of the craft. He watched for a while untill he saw them split up, one kept heading east, and one went south. My mom did not beleive him and asked why do you see these things and nobody else does. This got dad mad and he went right to bed. That morning mom couldent wait for dad to get up after seeing the paper. There it was, In black and white, 2 huge u.f.o&#39;s spoted, One over lake michigan and one down south somwhere I dont remember. Well after seeing that mom never doubted dad again. Dad had seen them when they split up. Check it out in the milwaukee sentinal, thats what it was called back then. I am not sure on the date. Could be early to mid 60&#39;s mabe even late 50&#39;s I was very young, dad is pasted away and mom in her 80&#39;s can&#39;t remember the year anymore.

It&#39;s like it never happened and at least 500 people (probably more than 1000) witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside our home at ((street number deleted)) North 36th in Fort Smith, Arkansas.  My mother, father and myself were there.  Our neighbors were in their front yards.  Suddenly in the sky a triangular shaped object appear right above our home not 100 yards (app.) above us.  It had three lights on it with one on each corner.  We all saw it at the same time, as did many people over the whole city of Fort Smith, Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The radio station started reporting on it after many calls.  A well-known preacher in Fort Smith was praying about it, and the radio station had everyone gather at the Pepsi or Coca Cola bottling plant and there were at least 1000 people gathered there who had seen the object/objects all over the city.  The preacher also was there and it was quite an event.  It was in the news for a couple of days, and then some hokey story about a weather balloon was released and suddenly the story was cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the past few years I have spoken to people who did see it and remember it well, and we all remember the event and wish we knew more about it.  The craft we saw could move very suddenly very fast and just stop and hover in the air.  No one had ever seen anything like it.  Last year, I heard from a man who had been stationed at Fort Chaffee (just southeast of the city) who was looking for people who remembered the event.  He said he had never gotten it out of his mind.  He is out of the service now and lives in Florida.  I would love to know if anyone has reported this at this website or remembers it as I do.  My sister was in Oklahoma at the time and she and her boyfriend saw it from the bridge that leads from Oklahoma into Fort Smith.  Would love to hear more from anyone about this event.  The date may not be correct, but it was around that time.  By the way, many people reported that the lights changed colors on the craft.<n>

I am 57 yrs old, these things I swear by all that matters are true and did happen to the best of my recollection over the course of my life in Corpus Christi, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1st contact with strangeness:<n> <n><n> <n><n> The summer of 1967 was very hot, muggy as I recall.  One day in June or July of that year 3 men dressed in black suits, white shirt, black ties and black sunglasses appeared (actually I saw them walk up the steps) on my houses front porch at the screen door.  They knocked and stood very erect and still together.  They looked like candles as recall, they were not the same height, but they were very thin, tall and very white.  Their hair was white or blond and appeared plastered to their heads with wavy plastered curls on their foreheads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the door and asked what they wanted.  One of them bent down and stuck his nose close to the screen door at eyelevel with me (I was 10 yrs old) and asked me…”where are your parents?”  I told him that my folks were away at work and he said….”Well, they should be home, tell them we came looking for them.”  This was sort of not done in a nice manner and rather scared me.  My big sister (she was 13 yrs old) and in her room, I backed away from the door and yelled out her name to come to the door.  They turned around to walk down the steps to their car, a long black Lincoln or what looked like a crown Victoria.  I turned to look to see if my sister was coming to door.  It took me 3 seconds, no less no more to do this and when I turned around back to the screen door to look down the porch at the men walking to their car to get in it, they weren’t there, they and the car were gone.  I never saw them get in the car, I never heard the car start nor did I ever see the car drive away down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the following years, I had 3 more strange events happen to me,<n>

The time of day is also uncertain, but was after midnight. I should also mention that since early childhood I would not go to sleep unless the shade in my room was pulled because I was afraid of &#34;eyes&#34; looking at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke due to a odd pulsating, whirring sound and noticed flickering lights on my window shade.  I called to my father, who was sleeping on the couch in the living room (due to my mother not feeling well), but all he did was mumble incomprehensibly. I was very fightened and simply covered up my head with a blanket. I don&#39;t recall if I mentioned this to my parents in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/67 00:00|Maury Mountains|OR|Fireball|Unknown|Possible Crashed UFO In Oregon's Maury Mountains In The Summer Of 1967.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45557.html|19|ndxe196707| Possible Crashed UFO In Oregon&#39;s Maury Mountains In The Summer Of 1967.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the Summer of 1967 my parents and myself went on a camping trip in the Maury Mountains of Central Oregon.  The campsite was around 30-35 miles east of Prineville, Oregon past a small village called Post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night during the trip I was awakened by a streaking lime green fireball moving very quickly across the sky.  It was emitting sparks (also lime green in color) and I could hear a crackling sound from above.  This whole memory is only remembered in a dream-like state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the brush across from the campsite about 30 yards away I saw a creature in a spacesuit-like outfit.  It was short and rotund, like the Michelin Tire Man.  It was in a form-fitting light brown color jumpsuit/spacesuit outfit.  It also wore a dark brown space-helmet with some sort of night vision/binocular type device in front of where it&#39;s eyes would be.  It stood about 4&#39; tall.  It was just observing our observations of the fireball streak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However the next morning a group of military personnel in a jeep and two US Army trucks questioned my parents about the event.  I think they were working on the idea that this was a crashed UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember the creature probing my emotional state at the time.  Were we being tested in some way?  My parents are no longer around, I&#39;m 47 years old now, and I was 9 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
