3/15/62 12:00|Baumholder (Germany)||Rectangle|@ 3 minutes|Saw glowing, rectangular, but possibly cylindrical object that did not appear to be an aircraft during daylight hours.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05922.html|2|ndxe196203| Saw glowing, rectangular, but possibly cylindrical object that did not appear to be an aircraft during daylight hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was in the 4th Grade.  I&#39;m now 46.  My father was an NCO in the U.S. Army stationed at the NATO base in Baumholder, and I was his dependent. I&#39;m sure this story is of little use to you save as a curiosity at this point, but I&#39;ve never written it down or reported it to anyone prior to this. This was a very clear, bright day.  There were not haze or clouds. I was between classes after lunch. A friend and I were looking out the class window over the town of Baumholder. I observed a rather bright object coming towards the school.  It was curving in from what must have been the NNW heading towards the SW.  Because of its arc I was able to see at different times its port and starboard sides as well as it&#39;s bottom. There was no way to gauge altitude, so I couldn&#39;t tell you what its size was.  Likewise, couldn&#39;t estimate speed, although it seemed to be in no hurry. We thought at first that it was an airplane.  We began to joke about the Russians (remember where I was, and that it was 1962). As it came closer, nearly overhead the school, I began to realize that it was not a plane and that I had never seen anything like it before.  We gradualy became silent with out joking. It had no wings, empenage, or markings.  It made no vapor trail and had no exhaust.  I saw nothing to suggest an engine, cockpit, or windows. I&#39;d seen a lot of planes and helicopters in my young life (Army brat).  It was not a plane or helicopter.  Neither was it a blimp, balloon, kite, gyrocopter, or droud. It made no noise that I could hear.  It seemed quite graceful.  It looked like nothing so much as a flying florescent light.  It was long, but cut off very cleanly and abruptly on both of its ends.  It&#39;s lines were exceptionaly well-defined.  It seemed seamless. It did not seem metallic.  It did not seem to reflect the sun.  It had a very curious dull, off-white, glow to it, not bright, but very steady and uniform. It looked as if someone had taken a cookie-cutter and stamped out neatly a portion of the sky. I lost sight of it when it eventually flew beyond the vantage of my window. I can attest that I have never seen anything like this since, and I&#39;ve looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date so the report sorts to the spring of 1962.  PD))<n>
3/15/62 10:00|Camden|OH|Sphere|10 minutes|Large "sphere" shaped object sighted hovering with an up and down motion.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61670.html|3|ndxe196203| Large &#34;sphere&#34; shaped object sighted hovering with an up and down motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to report this event though it happened many years ago.  I never reported it to anyone before and thought it may be of interest to someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 14 years old at the time of this sighting.  I lived in a rural area, on a farm.  On a Saturday morning I left my house to do some chores.  Across the road and approximately 100 yards from me, I immediately saw a large &#34;sphere&#34; shaped object about 50 feet in diamater, smooth and dark gray in color.  It hovered about 4&#39; to 6&#39; above the ground and moved in a slight up and down movement but made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being frightened by this unexpected sight, I quickly went back into my house.  After some time, I ventured back outside to see if the sphere was gone.  After looking around I saw that it had traveled across the road, and over our large farm pond and was now down behind a row of trees on the other side.  It&#39;s up and down movement seemed to be more pronounced but otherwise remained stable.  I once again retreated back into my house.  Not untill that evening did I venture back out to find that the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date in March 1962.

3/8/62 21:00|Clayton|NC||30 minutes|Oh My God!!! I thought that it was just me, I was afraid to ask my neighbors if they had heard what I had heard on the evening of 2/27/|4/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96567.html|4|ndxe196203| Oh My God!!! I thought that it was just me, I was afraid to ask my neighbors if they had heard what I had heard on the evening of 2/27/13 in Clayton, NC.  Now I know that I am not losing it!!! My son was in his room, and I was in my room and I realized that there was a constant roaring noise similar to an airplane engine, but it appeared to be hovering over our apartment building.  I noticed that this sound was right over the roof and had a duration of 2 minutes.  It would then just abruptly stop, (I didn&#39;t hear any trailing of sounds, it would just stop).  The sound would come back after around 10 minutes it did this 3 times.  My dog&#39;s hair stood up on the back of his neck and he would not run to the window to see what was going on, he was clearly on alert.  My son came out of the room shaken, as was I and we surmised that it could not have been a helicopter nor a plane flying low because the sound was a constant loud engine sound directly above our heads n! ot like a plane totally indescribable, nothing that I truly have ever heard.  I shared this with a friend in another state, who texted me the next day to see if I had asked my neighbors if they had heard what my son and I had heard that evening.  I didn&#39;t want to seem cuckoo, so I didn&#39;t share my experience with neighbors.  I heard the noise again this evening on Thursday 3/7/13.  I am wondering if there is a coincidence of the fact that the woods have been cleared where I live and from the sky it my look like a landing field.  I know that what I heard that evening in those three intervals was not man made as well because the sound was too close and the noise stopped abruptly after a length of 2minutes of roaring.  The event lasted about 30 to 40 minutes.  I do believe then as I do now, that my son and I had encountered a UFO over our apartment building as we are on the top floor. We also live right off of Highway 70<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

3/1/62 08:00|Snohomish|WA|Diamond|25 Minutes|I saw a UFO shoot incredibly fast and straight across large areas of the sky and then stop instantly at a new location.|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59856.html|6|ndxe196203| I saw a UFO shoot incredibly fast and straight across large areas of the sky and then stop instantly at a new location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime during the school year of 1962-3 when I was 13-14 yrs. old, my mother and I saw a UFO from the East window of our house at ((address deleted)), Snohomish, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was getting ready for school and I looked out the window to the East, toward the sky to see the weather. This was probably around 8 A.M. and I am not sure of the time of year.  However, I do know on this particular day, it was already light outside and the sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember noticing what I thought was a bright star way up in the sky to the S. East and wondering why there was a star out when the sun was already up. The object I was seeing was approximately the same size, shape and color of a bright nighttime star, only it was not dark out at the time. I took a longer look to see exactly what this was, still thinking it had to be a star of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, and with unimaginable speed, the object shot straight across the sky, from its point in the S. East sky, to a new point in the N. East sky, stopping just as suddenly as it had taken off. After sitting perfectly still in the new location for a short while, the object once more shot at incredible speeds, straight toward a new location, this time in the S. East sky again, yet at a lower part of the sky than before. And like before, it stopped just as fast as it had shot across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I could not believe what I was seeing and called for my Mother to come look. From what I remember, we probably watched this object for around 20 minutes. During this time, the object would either be sitting perfectly still in the sky or it would be zooming in a straight line, at mind-boggling speeds, to stop instantly at a new location again. I remember how amazed my Mother and I both were at what we were seeing. It was truly unbelievable how fast the object could stop and go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother finally had to leave for work and I started out for school. I could still see the object, but it appeared to be smaller now, like it had gone further up in the sky, even though it was still moving in the same general East, S. East locations. I was hoping to show it to my Science teacher when I got to school, but it vanished before I got there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what we saw that morning in 1962-3, but I realized then that whatever it was, it absolutely went much too fast for anything on Earth. If I were to see this same or a similar object now, in 2007, I would still feel that there was nothing from Earth that could possibly go so unbelievably fast across so much of the sky and stop so instantly too..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
