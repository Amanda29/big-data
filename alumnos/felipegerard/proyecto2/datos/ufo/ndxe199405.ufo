She is very relucent to talk about it still.There was a car in front of me as well as one behind. I tryed to get the car behind me to stop to ask what he saw, but he speed out of the area? Afraid I suppose? My windows where down and no sound of a engine where heard.I have always wanted to believe in ufos but could not untill I saw one as for my wife she never did believe,now there is no question.This my first and only sighting and report.This was not a distant light nor any craft capabale of flight known to modern avation as far as I know it.The craft crossed the road again in front of us and we watched it slowly go out of sight. Sorry I did not have a camera with me but I guess that is the way it goes???????<n>

I was gazing out the window, when we came to a stop sign I looked up and saw a large triangle made of a series of lights. The back sections of the craft passed over each other. I looked at the center of it and could (barely) see what resembeld a domb, with a gray tent to it, and on the sides of the craft it appeared to have almost bumper pad shaped structures on it. It slowly passed over us and then vanished after about a 100 feet.<n>

Further sightings included lights moving rapidly then stopping at another point in the sky. around the date and time mentioned a ball of bright light was witnessed moving over houses and stopping around 1/4 to 1/2 mile away and 200-500 feet in the sky. The object hovered for around 45mins before it started to move away. Two police officers were called around to look at the object including a UFO enthusiast. He was baffled on what it was. All he said was &#34;Its not a balloon or aircraft.&#34; There were many call ins about this sighting with many in the border area of Calloway and Boone county. Later in september in Fulton a strange creature was spotted. Creature had a big head with bright glowing eyes(like a cat), it could run at very high speeds withs its very small body and the weirdest bit was it was observed running on a lake/large pond and pausing for around a minute staring at the 2 witnesses before it ran off into the darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

While we were waiting we saw the object appear from our east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a late night and we were listening to the radio when we saw the object appear from our east. I had seen the object first and told my friend who was sitting next to me to look. We were both very scared and could not move.At first we thought it was a hellicopter, but then we noticed there was no sound. As it grew nearer it was sphere looking object with 6 red lights in a circle.It then passed directly over us and went real slow, it was only about 50 to 60 yards above us, and then it passed to the west.It then went over the trees until we could not see it any more, then it went up so fast all it did was leave a streak in the sky.At that time my friend we were waiting for showed up and his face was as white as a ghost, and asked us frieghtenly &#34;did yall see that and jumped in the truck and we took off. This is the first time eather of us has talked about it. It was a night I&#39;ll never forget  as long as I live.<n>

Had they been UFO&#39;s in the night sky above Saskatoon, we suspect that our Hotline telephone would have been ringing off the hook, and the objects would have been reported by astronomers of all stripes.  We believe the most likely possibility is that the witnesses were looking at twinkling stars.  The moving red light might have been a solid red light on an aircraft.  However, all of this is conjecture, since we did not witness the lights.  The dates of the sightings are approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> streams of light and triangular lights seen over Saskatoon, SK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE - Date and time are approximate... This report is from 1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was caretaking in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. My wife-to-be (at the time) and myself would often open our apartment suite window and gaze out at the sky. We had often noticed in the sky 3 red lights at various locations in the sky that always seemed to remain fixed in the sky (at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, and certain fixed locations unknown degrees from north and south. they always seemed to be in the same place. for example one was always just a bit east of the peak of a house down the street.) even though the other stars in the sky would move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had jokingly called the red lights our &#34;friends&#34; and would often jokingly say, &#34;oh look, our friends are here&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, we were standing in the window watching south. one of the red lights was there, almost due south and always at the same height in the sky... We had suggested to ourselves that the light was nothing more than the light of a plane heading either to Regina (The Capitol city of Saskatchewan) or coming in from it. But, after over 45 minutes, the light had not changed position in the sky at all, and the flight from Saskatton to Regina was only about 50 minutes. So that ruled that out... and we still couldn&#39;t figure out the peculiar red color of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About this time we noticed that the loight would &#34;jiggle&#34; slightly... just a short, small up and down motion. We thought to ourseleves, ok... we are imagining it and continued to watch and it would jigle again... we watched the other two red lights and noticed they were doing the same thing as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To make this easier to follow, I&#39;ll call the red lights &#34;south&#34; (the southernmost one we thought might possibly be an airplane), &#34;east&#34; (the red light to the east of us) and &#34;north&#34; for the one just to the north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We became amazed when south jiggled yet again and then a stream of, well, for lackof a better term, northern lights style white light appeared to travel from south to east. A coupole minutes went by and a second stream went from east back to south after east jiggled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were amazed when we saw that... the light was in a straight line, and acted like an airplane contrail appearcing, making a longer line until it almost reached the other light and then slowly fading out after about 6-10 seconds... all to the south and east of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> then the same thing happened with a stream of the same style light from east to north and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, just to the south of the position of &#34;east&#34; there was a huge white flash (similar to the white flash from the fireworks that produce the huge &#34;bang&#34; minus the &#34;bang&#34;)and then the same white color stream proceeded to appear from &#34;East&#34; but it created a clockwise spiral pattern that radiated out from the spot where the white flash had occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued to happen for another 20 minutes or so, with &#34;east&#34; being the center of the activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a total I recall of about 8 straight lines and 3 spirals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the &#34;show&#34; had finished we continued to watch &#34;our friends&#34; the red lights, and saw a small trianglar shaped light (imagine the ship from the old asteroids aracde game) leave &#34;north&#34; in a northerly direction, loop around in a counter-clockwise direction and head north again at a high speed (approximately 1 handspan / per second with the hand held outstretched above my head). My wife claimed to also see the same thing happen to &#34;east&#34; as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have absolutely no idea of what it was we saw. It was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen in my life though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We would be willing to submit drawings of what we saw via email if requested.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of incident are approximate.

We decided to head due east, knowing we&#39;d eventually hit I-17. I looked up and was startled to see a v-shaped thing in the sky with 5 amber colored lights that really stood out in contrast to the brilliant white stars on that pitch black night.It was either incredibly enormous, or really low. It was almost stationary, and made absolutely no noise. My friend took off running, and was sobbing in fear. He made me swear to never tell his colleagues of this, or to ever bring the matter up in his presence.<n>

I don&#39;t remember the exact date but I do remember the day and time.  It was a Saturday evening minutes after 18:00, the field had just closed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped outside of the &#34;old&#34; tower, which houses the weather office and flight filing services,to observe the twilight.  It was very quiet as was typical for a Saturday evening after the field closes, no planes, no engines, no cars, you could hear a pin drop (almost).  I was facing east looking at the mountains which are about 35 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects or lights caught my eye to the south and I turned my head to view them.  I saw three &#34;solid&#34; coloredlights traveling abreast, moving north, at a relatively high rate of speed, they appeared to be about 2500&#39; AGL and about 10 miles south.  The two on the outside were red and the one in the middle was white (unfourtunately I am colored blind and cannot be 100% sure of the colors but two were definately dark and one was light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects wers solid colored and appeared to be &#34;lit&#34; or illuminated rather than reflected light.  I observed no strobes or marker lights of the kind you would expect to see on conventional aircraft and they were silent.  I could not discern any particular shape or other features of any kind, they just appeared to be circular or oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten seconds into the sighting the red or &#34;outside&#34;objects seemed to jet or rocket forward at a tremendous rate of speed for 3-4 seconds then, just as abrubtly, resume their previous rate of speed.  At the same instant that the red ones slowed down the white one, which had been in the center duplicated the maneuver, catching up and resuming it&#39;s previous position in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened two more times and by this time the craft were to my north and heading out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were abreast or directly to my east, they seemed to be about 5-7 miles away.  At this particular site you can see about 75 miles to the south and about 100 miles to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three things that struck me as strange were:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  The solid colored lighting with no detectable conventionalmarkings or lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The strange and abrubt maneuvering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  The sound, there wasn&#39;t any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was a USN trained weather observer/forecaster with 10 years of experience.  I had been working at this particular location for a little over two years and was used to identifing military and commercial aircraft of all types.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later asked a local resident, a former WWII Army Air Corp veteran who still flew privately, if he had ever seen anything unusual in this area.  He said yes, but would not elaborate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve thought that maybe they were something from Dreamland or Area 51, which is reportedly just to the south of this location, approximately halfway to Nellis AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But who knows, I may have imagined the whole thing.<n>

They were circling around eachother very close and at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in the sky at around 4:00pm, and towards the west, I observed 6 or 7 spherical objects moving north in a tight cluster. They looked very small, though it was hard to tell because I&#39;m not sure how far away they were. They were circling or&#34;dancing&#34; around eachother in a very tight formation, and at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be some kind of figure 8 pattern they were making around eachother. Then, they just kind of disappeared, one at a time. It was a clear blue sky in broad daylight. That was the background. My girlfriend also witnessed the event. I called to her to come &amp; look, because at first I thought it was a smudge on my sunglasses, or my contact lense. Then I realized that smudges don&#39;t move and pulsate like that. We tried to think of anything we could that would identify what we saw, but, we knew it was something that could not be identified. Anything man has made would&#39;ve crashed doing what they were doing. I&#39;m surprised they DIDN&#39;T crash!<n>

I was taking my daughter (12 at the time) home from school. As I drove down a long hill, I noticed something large in the sky, blocking the sky over much of the road in front of me. I mentioned it to my daughter who, needless to say totally freaked out and begged me not to stop. I didn&#39;t stop, but I did drive extremely slowly in order to get a better look at it and try to remember exactly how it looked from underneath. I did for about two minutes or more. It looked very much like the 3D picture I am inclosing. The 3D picture I am inclosing was hard to do and the lighting is not quite right, but it is as close as I can get to what I saw that evening bringing my daughter home from school. Although the picture shows square edges, I have yet to learn how to make rounded corners in the program I used.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large ship flew silently. It flew at a constant (almost sickning) speed of maybe 15 mph or less. The outside of the ship (or rather the bottom which is all we saw because of the size of it) was black, but not shiny. Dull black is what we saw. The ship was bigger than anything I had ever heard of, maybe being 6 football fields or larger. It was so large, neither one of us could tell if it was round or square or what... although I watched it intently, I believe it was of a rectangle shape, for we could see two of the sides, but not the other two. I looked to the right and to the left into the tops of the trees to see just how big the thing was, but could not see an end to it in either direction. It flew just above the tree tops, at least it looked very very close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew over my car (with my daughter now screaming histerically) I noticed that while one side of this huge ship was just beginning to hover over the car, the other side that was seeable was still about a quarter mile down the street. The bottom of the craft had something &#39;molded&#39; into the bottom like huge rooms with rounded off corners sticking out of the bottom. There were round tubes that went from one &#39;room&#39; to another. I only got a look at the part of the ship that came over the road. I drove even slower, hoping that someone would come down the road so I could stop them and tell them to &#34;Look! There is a ship!&#34; I saw no lights what so ever and the bottom of the ship was extremely visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t ever call it a UFO. This was a ship. It was bigger than anything I or my daughter has ever seen, and it flew right over my car and over the town of Zebulon, North Carolina. This is not the only time things have been seen here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I emplore the public to please report anything seen of this magnitude in or around Zebulon, North Carolia or anywhere else for that matter. Someone besides us had to have seen this huge ship or even got a glimpse of a ship that has huge molded &#39;rooms&#39; on the bottom! I have yet to read of anything like this in your postings or anywhere else on the internet. I need other witnesses besides my daughter and myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the late Spring of 1994, my daughter had turned 12 in January of that year. The trees had leaves on them and the children were still in school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

Observed changes in heading altitude and speed both normal and dramatic. no visible means of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS, APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE MENTIONED, TWO POLICE OFFICERS AND A CIVILIAN PILOT WERE IN A 182 CESSNA AIRCRAFT ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF A MAJOR NORTHWEST AIRPORT, OPERATING IN THE ARSA UNDER APPROACH CONTROL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A RACE TRACK HOLDING PATTERN ORIENTED NORTH AND SOUTH ABOUT ONE MILE BY TWO MILES, AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET MSL OVER A FREEWAY. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH BRIGHT OVERHEAD SUN, AND NO WIND, SMOKE IN THE AREA WAS RISING ALMOST VERTICALLY. VISIBILITY AND CIELING WERE UNLIMITED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS MILD TO WARM. OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA BUT NONE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AS THE TWO PILOTS WERE INVOLVED WITH FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, THE OBSERVER IN THE BACK SEAT WAS SPOTTING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND PRACTICING TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH TARGETS ON THE GROUND. ON THE SOUTH BOUND LEG, ON THE EASTERN MOST TRACK, THE OBSERVER SAW A ROUND BALL LIKE OBJECT ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SEAMLESS, MIRROR LIKE SURFACE TUCKED INTO THE FOUR O&#39;CLOCK POSITION, RELATIVE TO , AND KEEPING PACE WITH, THE AIRCRAFT, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET OUT AND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND NO LIGHT SOURCES. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS VISIBLE WAS THE CONTRAST OF THE SHINY OBJECT TO THE DARK GROUND. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO FOLLOW THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, THEN A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH. IT CONTINUED IN IT&#39;S RELATIVE POSITION, FLYING FORMATION WITH THE AIRCRAFT, ON AROUND TO THE SOUTHBOUND LEG. THIS PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE OBSERVER ALONE WHO DID NOT NOTIFY THE PILOTS, NOT WANTING TO BE RIDICULED. TOWARDS THE END OF THE SOUTHBOUND LEG THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT IDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT BEING ADVISED BY THE OBSERVER. UPON BEING ASKED THE OBSERVER THEN ADVISED THAT HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT WAS TUCKED IN TOO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE SCHEDULED TURN TO THE WEST WAS MADE THE LEFT SEAT PILOT MADE AN UNUSUALLY STEEP BANK AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE OBSERVER ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A MYLAR TYPE SILVER BALLON. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS A VIRTUALLY WINDLESS DAY AND FURTHER THAT THE INDICATED AIRSPEED WAS ABOUT 75 KNOTS AND THE OBJECT WAS MAINTAINING IT&#39;S POSITION AND TURNING WITH THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH CONTROL WAS QUIRIED AS TO THE PRESENCE OF ANY POSSIBLE RADAR CONTACTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE APROXIMATE RANGE FROM OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE CONTACT AND WAS ADVISED WITHIN ONE QUARTER MILE. THERE WAS A STANDY ORDER THEN AN ADVISORY THAT THERE WERE NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA, AND THEN , &#34;DID WE WISH TO MAKE A REPORT&#34;. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT WAS A LOW TIME PILOT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST HIS LICENSE TO FLY. THE OBSERVER WENT ALONG WITH BOTH PILOTS WHO DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO REPORT. THE OBSERVATION CONTINUED AND AN INQUIRY WAS MADE TO THE GROUND UNITS BY THE OBSERVER IF THEY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE, AND WHEN ASKED BY GROUND UNITS IF WE WERE WATCHING A UFO THE REPLY WAS, &#34;AS A MATTER OF FACT YES WE ARE&#34;. THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE GROUND. THEN AS THE AIRCRAFT TURNED ONTO THE NORTHBOUND LEG THE OBJECT SUDDENLY, AND VERY SMOOTHLY ACCELERATED OUT IN FRONT OF THE AIRCAFT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE. IT COVERED THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE SECONDS ACCELERATING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE KNOTS. THE OBJECT THE EXECUTED A NINETY DEGREE RIGHT TURN TO THE EAST, AFTER A RADICAL DECELERATION AS THE TURN WAS MADE. THIS MANEUVER CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS THE OBJECT DISPLAYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND FIRED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE TURN TO THE EAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AGAIN A DISPLAY OF ACCELERATION THAT WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AGAIN THE ANALOGY OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT. THE ACCELERATION, A BALLISTIC CURVE, AND THE SPEED WERE ALL ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD EXPECT WHEN OBSERVING A PROJECTILE BEING FIRED FROM THAT TYPE OF WEAPON. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE TREES ON THE NORTHWEST SHOULDER OF A MOUNTAIN TO THE EAST, APPEARING TO HAVE CRASHED. THAT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE PILOTS. THE OBSERVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE EXACT LOCATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACT WHILE THE PILOTS FLEW A NORTH, NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE PATTERN INTENDING TO OVERFLY AND POSITIVELY FIX THE LOCATION FOR GROUND INVESTIGATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN ABOUT A MILE TO A MILE AND HALF OF THE POSSIBLE POINT OF IMPACT, THE OBJECT FLEW UPWARDS OUT OF THE TREES AT ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE TO AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIVE THOUSAND MSL. THE ACCELLERATION AGAIN WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND SMOOTH, BUT AS THE OBJECT LEVELED OUT ON A SOUTHERLY COURSE IT, AS RAPIDLY, DECELERATED TO A MORE LIESURELY PACE, ABOUT ONE OR TWO HUNDRED KNOTS. THE OBJECT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WHEN IT EXECUTED A LEFT TURN, ABOUT FORTY FIVR DEGREES TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND ACCELERATED AWAY AT AN ASTONISHING RATE DISSAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. A SIMILAR OBJECT WAS SEEN AT A LATER TIME IN AN AREA TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT DISPLAYING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND LAST KNOW DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THIS INFORMATION CAME ABOUT AS A TELEVISION SHOW OF VIDEO RECORDED SIGHTINGS WAS ON. THE WIFE POINTED OUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS, A SILVER BALL, AND MENTIONED HER OBSERVATIONS. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SIMILARITIES OF THE TWO INCIDENTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONVERSATION. THE PILOT OF THE PLANE IS AN EXPIERIENCED HIGH TIME CIVILIAN PILOT. THE COPILOT IS A LOW TIME LICENSED PILOT AND IS A POLICE OFFICER WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS EXPIERIENCE. THE OBSERVER IS A TWENTY YEAR POLICE OFFICER WITH SOME EXPIERIENCE FLYING AND IS A MILITARY VETERAN. BOTH OFFICERS ARE STILL EMPLOYED AND THE TWO PILOTS CONTINUE TO FLY.<n>

My partner and our helper and I were out on the ice shelf at the runway readjusting the runway lights. I was down in a hole digging out a transformer when my partner exclaimed &#34;did you see that!&#34; Our helper said yes he did. I asked what happened and they told me a bright green light went streaking across the sky. It was still daylight at the time and clear sky since the sun hadn&#39;t set then. We figured that it was a meteor and had copper in it to give it the green color as it burned through the atmosphere. I was listening to you on Art Bell on the Sept 25 show and you mentioned no sonic boom. That brought to my mind about the above sighting... there was no sonic boom. We were basically out in the middle of nowhere... McMurdo being six miles away so the only noise being made was by us. Not sure now if what they saw was a meteor or not. It was seem by other people in the town too from what we heard when we got back. My partner and I are both electricians and our helper was just learning. Not sure what else you may need. My email is ((deleted)) if you need more and phone is 314-((# deleted)). I report this now since the green fireballs you were talking about to Art brought the memory back to me.<n>

The object took approximately 10 to 15 seconds to make the transit. The object was in sharp focus, not fuzzy at all. The moon was also in focus at the time. It appeared as if out of nowhere on the eastern edge of the moon, travelled across the moon&#39;s face from east to west, then disappeared into the black sky at the moon&#39;s western edge. I looked to see if it was visible with the naked eye after it had passed the moon, but it was not. I do not recall exactly which eyepiece I was using at the time, but I am sure the magnification was somewhere in the 30x to 60x range. I am currently 34, and I have been an amateur astronomer ever since receiving my first telescope at age 7. I am thoroughly familiar with the night sky, and I have perfect vision.<n>

Myself and my wife observed a large shatf of light out over lake Michigan.  It looked like a very thick bolt of lightning but continued to pulse about once a second.  It stayed in a genreral area moving back and forth.  It extended down from the sky to the lake and was very bright kind of like a strobe light.  It appeared to be thick in diameter and long given the distance out over the water.  As stated it would flash about once a second and move back and forth in the same general area.  It continued for about 30 minutes when it just stopped.  It did not look like a lighthouse due to the length of it and the way it moved from south to north and back again. I have a brief portion on video that is being sent via mail. I did not film the entire duration unfortunately.<n>
5/8/94 22:00|El Ajusco (Mexico)||Oval|3 hrs|UFO sighting and scanning sentsation in El Ajusco, Mexico|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38096.html|24|ndxe199405| UFO sighting and scanning sentsation in El Ajusco, Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working in Mexico City for the ((deleted)) Channel as ((employee)) of an eveining series show about ((deleted)).  We had been interviewing a local tribe of that region.  My crew (except for the cameraman and I) had left.  We stayed behind to spend the night for &#34;wrap-arounds&#34; and extra footage.  We were sitting high above a moonlit field or plateau talking with some of the natives over a  small bonfire.  I happen to detect an oval shape gliding over and across the large field rapidly.  When I alarmed the rest to witness, it had retrieved into the woods.  It had no lights.  It looked like a floating silohette about the size of a car. Natives and my cameraman wondered if I had seen a horse or a car, but I assured them that niether would have had the distinct abiltiy to move so steadily the way I saw this, and glide as fast across the open space.  They began to cajole about it as a superstition, so I dropped it to avoid further embarressment.  But later, after about half an hour I heard a noise (like someone blowing hard into my ear)and immediately felt like someone threw a burst of air on my back.  I reacted.  Surprisingly, I looked around and noticed no one heard or sensed this even though we all sat tightley in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night we went to bed in our cabin.  Needless to say I was a little scared, but the calmness and assurances of the natives made me feel safer, &#34;that none of these &#34;energies&#34; would bring us harm so long as we stayed away&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cameraman and I slept on the floor in individual sleeping-bags.  He slept in front of me facing away about five feet away.  I couldn&#39;t sleep, but just when I began to feel drowsy I heard that harsh noise in my ear again.  Then I heard the sounds of children(for about a second or two).  I didn&#39;t want to hear anymore, when all of a sudden the cameraman&#39;s head bobs up asking me if I had heard the same thing.  He scrammbled for his flashlight in his backpack.  I had the strange sensation that this was truley abnormal, but the juornalistic sense in me had me curious as to see what was going on, and we stepped outside.  As we reached about ten feet away from the front door.  I heard and felt the air go through me again.  I turned around and looked at my cameraman.  Staring at me wide-eyed he blurted, &#34;I heard it this time!&#34;.  We rushed back inside the cabin trusting the natives warning that &#34;these energies would bring no harm if we stay out of their way&#34;.  We didn&#39;t hear anything the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six years later, back in the United States, I hosted a conference for the Air Force.  But there was one group which anchored the event called Air Force/IPT whose activities were not to be disclosed or disturbed.  Their makeshift computer displays in secluede rooms of our Ranch were to be visited or touched in any way by our staff or anyone.  At the end of the week a small reception to place where all colonels, captains and respective staff memebers of IPT congregated for farewells.  They were a lot more relaxed and I was able to find out a little more about their organization.  &#34;IPT, they said, &#34;stands for Integral Programming Technologies, we put your military satellites in space&#34;.  Curious about their stand on UFO&#39;s, I was surprised that they admitted they did believe in them, and that in their line of work they had constantley interacted with them in one way or another.  They couldn&#39;t elaborate - sworn to duty...  I proceeded to tell them about my incident of El Ajusco.  They were intrigued.  One of them even said that, &#34;I may have been too close for confort&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can someone give me some enlightment as to what may have really happened?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What caught my attention the house to my right in their back yard; behind this large tree, I noticed a light. At first, I thought another helicopter. Then I thought the rotors would be slamming into the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started walking to get a better view, at that moment this craft slowly came around, was hovering above me, and slightly descended no higher then between the telephone polls “maybe 10 feet above”. From what I was observing this craft designs had no propellers, emitted a slight hum, “NO WIND AT ALL”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was afraid because I was thinking why can’t I clearly see the being looking at me through that thick glass; then I remembered a saying of mine “to see /think clearly one must get past their technology.” Being a Mechanic I focused my thoughts observing the crafts structure then I looked again and at that moment this being kind of leaned back with an almost surprised expression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, I pointed my hand to him then I pointed to the sky, the being tilted its head to one side with a little smile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My feeble attempt to describe what this being looked like I determined it was male because we guys have a strength within our movements, I could only see from his “chest up” I didn’t see any hair, his face was little longer then ours and I must say was quit attractive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting  aspect I noticed the “eyes/expression/personality” characteristics that of a cat or as plainly as I can describe picture a house cat but without the hair, fangs, claws that walks and looks not to different then us humans… 	 I have wanted to share my encounter Therefore, who ever are reading this and feel the need to contact me through email.

I was asleep,when i woke up to noises like a computer beeping directly behind my head-outside of the screen (the window was open).  More like spaceship&#39;s computer beeping noises, like on old TV shows.  I tried to turn my head to see what it was,but i was unable to move my head at all.It was like it was in a vice.I could sense that my brain was being &#34;read&#34;,and i mean that i was CERTAIN!  I thought maybe i was dreaming,but couldn&#39;t shake it,and started to get scared.I heard my daughter in the kitchen(right next to my room)and so i tried to yell for her,but i wasn&#39;t making any noise!So I tried,and with ALL of my might,to scream her name.This time it worked,and she came running.I still couldn&#39;t move,by the way.She opened the door and said&#34;what&#39;s wrong&#34;? So i yelled(since i couldn&#39;t move still,and the noise continued)&#34;The light!Turn on the light&#34;!  As soon as she did,the noise stopped and i could move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As creepy as this was,I figured it was a dream.But my daughter insisted that I sleep on the couch,and I was happy to comply!  Anyway,I pretty much dismissed this,but the next morning when we went out onto the porch,we looked at the huge tree behind my window.I have a second floor apartment,and this tree is so big and heavy with leaves that it hangs over the porch.Until THIS morning--most of the branches and some of the leaves were still there,but all of the bark had been stripped off the tree!!OVERNIGHT!! And the tree is in the exact spot where the noise came from!  By the next day,the tree was dead.This was a healthy,green and leafy tree! If it weren&#39;t for the tree,even though i was sure that i was NOT dreaming,I&#39;d still believe i was asleep.But what about the tree?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/1/94 20:00|Ocotillo Wells (near)|CA|Fireball|4 hours|Large stationary fiery ball|2/3/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86972.html|30|ndxe199405| Large stationary fiery ball<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping in the Mountain Springs Campground (along route S21) of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in May of 1994.  I was facing east across an expanse that included the Carrizo Badlands, the Carrizo &#34;Impact Zone&#34;,  The now so-called &#34;National Parachute Test Range&#34; (Abandoned), the Coyote Mtns which include Carrizo Peak and farther, Superstition Mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spent the early evening in my motor home when I stepped out at 10 pm to view the stars.  It was impossible to miss the bright hovering ball of flame located to the east.  I estimated it at about seven miles distant as I could plainly see from the light provided by this object that had lit up the entire area beneath it, maybe ten sqr miles, making this estimate possible.  A vehicle trail beneath it was clearly visible and I had been to that location (As most others in the park) prior.  I further estimated the fiery object as being approximately 1000 ft in altitude.  The object was just as I have stated, a ball of fire.  I observed it through 10x52 binoculars and it was clearly a round ball of burning gas with flames licking out exactly as videos of the sun show.  The overall color of this ball of flame was red-orange, mostly red like the sun itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though astonished I still tried to explain away the phenomenon but there is no explanation.  Skeptics would say that it was a flare but this siting lasted over four hours and the object never moved.  Others might say that it was something attached to the parachute tower but that locale is farther south and also only one or two-hundred feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was observing this oddity, I saw two USMC F4 phantom jets approach silently from the north below the level of the Laguna Mtns to my rear.  They had no lights of any kind and when they reached my relative position, they made a 90 degree turn and headed straight for the siting.  Strangely and whether this relates or not, I note that these two aircraft, noisy under any conditions that I knew of, made no sound whatever and they were so close to me (Estimate 500-600 feet lateral and about 300 ft in relative altitude.)  I could actually see the pilots silhouetted in their craft.  After closing the gap of several miles in just a few seconds the two aircraft returned to a heading that would take them to either the El Centro Naval Air Station or its sister base in Yuma, Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to observe this object until bored and returned to the camper only to check periodically to see if it was still there.  It was.  I checked perhaps five times until sometime after 2 AM it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After checking a map I determined that this aerial phenomena was above perhaps the southern border of the Impact Zone and the park boundary itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am from a family of pilots, air controllers and air crews and myself have a small number of flight hours.  I have flown over the region several times and camped in all the areas of this park many more times between 1964 and the present.  I have lived for years in the area and other locales that have military aviation and have never seen such an item.  I did not report this to any group or agency at the time and was unaware of the UFO Reporting Center until years later. After consulting with Peter Davenport I agreed to make this report, however late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely, after a 12 year absence I returned to the same site on Dec 10 of this year and had another sighting (s) which I will follow-up  with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of two credible reports from the same witness.  Other sighting occurred in San Francisco on, or about, October 01, 1998, at 10:00 hrs..  PD))<n>
5/1/94 18:00|Crystal Falls|MI|Triangle|1 hour or more|Multiple encounters over approximately 50 mile radius.|9/12/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09627.html|31|ndxe199405| Multiple encounters over approximately 50 mile radius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Begining in the spring of 1994 I was made aware of three specific areas in Iron County Michigan that were intense UFO encounter sites. The first encounter was at Glidden Lake several miles south of Crystal falls.  While sitting in a truck by the lake at approximately 21:00, a green triangular object lifted over the tree line on the oposite side of the lake.  I would approximate this object to be 30-35 feet in length, and 15 feet at the widest point in the rear.  The object had a very luminecent property, but was not like any other light that I could identify. By the time the object was approximately 200 feet in the air, a second object was seen coming from the horizon.  This second object was of a very similar shape and size, but was red in color.  The first object began to race towards my general direction and in less than a second had gained several hundred feet in altitude and was now positioned over myself and the other person viewing the event.  I got out of the truck to watch the object.  The second object, the red one, was now pursuing the first.  There seemed to be a buzzing sound coming from the second object and the radio in the truck became very distorted sounding.  two flashes of light came from the front of the red object, and the green object then exploded.  The explosion was close enough where it should have been heard, but it made no sound.  Also, when it did explode, it did not look so much like fire works or a gas explosion as it simply became many small fragments of light then disappeared.  The red object then shot directly upward and faded into the night sky. My companion seemed to be unamazed by the events.  She then explained that this type of thing had been happening for approximately 3 months already.  I had been unaware of this due to the fact that I had been out of the country for 10 months. Several other minor sitings at this location were seen over the next few months.  Then, in late July of 1994, while at a local ski hill in Crystal falls at approximately 18:00, a friend whom I will reffer to as &#34;Jim&#34; accompanied me to watching the sunset.  While we talked and waited for the next few hours, we saw approximately 9 of these same triangular shaped objects.  They grouped themselves into several airial formations, and seemed to repeat an airial acrobatics routine.  Jim and I watched them as they came and went over the horizon for approximately 4 hours.  After dark the objects returned one by one.  Each one forming a point in a series of three triangles.  The triangles then merged to form a shape like this: * * * * * * * *   * There they stayed for approximately 10 minutes.  They then formed a straigh line and travelled at a very high speed to the south and disappeared over the horizon. Several months went by before there was another sighting.  It was approximately the end of September.  This time it was in a feild almost directly underneath where the objects had come from when Jim and I had seen the sighting at the ski hill.  Myself and several friends were approximately 50 to 75 feet away from a row of trees that seperated two feilds.  On the opposite side of these trees, a slight hum was heard.  Then, as the hum quieted, the outline of a large triangular object could be seen.  The lower side of the object began to glow green and it lifted off the ground.  The object then left the area at a high rate of speed again leaving in a southerly direction. A few minor sightings were seen at both locations over the next 6 months, but nothing extraordinary as far as movement or paterns.  As the end of March drew close, the flight paterns of pyramids and now circles became very common. Approximately one year after the first sighting, yet another event happened that took my by surprise.  While out driving just north of town, I saw a green glow over the trees.  I immediately recognized the glow to be one of these objects.  I began to try and follow it by driving down old side roads and loging trails.  I could not seem to catch up to the object, and soon gave up.  When I decided to turn around and go back to the main road, I noticed the glow directly behind me.  I drove a bit faster, and it continued to follow me.  I came to an old gravel pit that was approximately 1/2 mile off the main road.  I parked on one side of the pit and the object came to a halt on the opposite side.  It then moved directly upwards, and I then noticed that there were 4 more craft hovering several hundred feet over the gravel pit.  When the object joined the others, they formed a &#34;V&#34; and left the area heading once again south. I had no more encounters over the next 9-10 months.  Then, in the winter of 1995/96, I visited a gravel pit just outside of Iron Mountain Michigan, which is to the south of Crystal Falls.  The pit is approximately the same size and shape as the one where I had my last encounter.  Within minutes of arriving at the pit, I was witness to yet another sky duel of one red and one green craft.  The same radio distortions happened, but this time the flashes came from the green craft.  The red craft began glowing several different colors.  One of the back corners of it changed from yellow to orange and back to yellow several times before it spiraled upward in a very awkward motion.  The green craft then vanished.  It didn&#39;t seem to have gone anywhere, but simply shut off it&#39;s light and disappeared into the darkness of the sky. I have since moved to the Detroit area of Michigan, and have since had no encounters with the craft. The craft never frightened me, but always excited me and made me feel like a little child seeing something spectacular for the first time.<n>

As I entered the house I noticed a silver sphere hovering over a pond acrossed the road.  I immediately woke my grandmaw who was staying with me at the time.  We watched this objest hover motionless for half an hour until it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/94|Sedgley (West Midlands) (UK/England)||Unknown||Mysterious Mi-8 helicopter and crop circles in Sedgley, West Midlands, early 1990s.|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53414.html|33|ndxe199405| Mysterious Mi-8 helicopter and crop circles in Sedgley, West Midlands, early 1990s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 24, and I have always had this hazy memory of seeing some strange goings on in the fields at the end of my street (Tanglewood Grove, on the Northway estate) when I was a kid during the early or mid 1990s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m really not sure of the exact date, but I just found another report on this site dated as 1995 from the same town, and its not a big town, so I think it might well be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically I didnt see a UFO, but one night me and my slightly older sister were upstairs when we heard a noise from the fields at the end of our street.  We went into my parents&#39; bedroom which afforded a view over the fields and we saw a helicopter landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, one of my passions has always been aviation, and even as a kid I could identify most aircraft.  For some reason I distinctly remember being convinced that it was a Mi-8 or Mi-17 transport helicopter of Russian manufacture.  I know that the helicopter was not camoflouged, and I think it was white and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It landed in the field directly at the end of the street.  People definately got out of it, and there was some comotion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After perhaps 10 minutes the helicopter left. There were no sirens or police cars around and the local police helicopter was very familiar to me, as was the local air ambulance, as they were based just a few miles away at what is now Wolverhamption Business Airport, and I saw them frequently, and it was not either of them.  The only other helicopter I saw regularly around there was a bright orange Bell 206 that was something to do with the National Grid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the point is that this helicopter that landed in the field that night was certainly not familiar to me, and was definitely not an Army Lynx or Gazelle, and definately not an RAF Puma, Chinook, or Wessex.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite not talking of the helicopter in the field for years, recently it cropped up in conversation and my sister (who still lives in the area) confirmed that she clearly remembered that night&#39;s goings on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day there were several large crop circles in the field that the helicopter had landed in.  The crop circles were clearly visible from my house, and I remember that me and my friends did our best to investigate the surrounding woods that bordered the fields, but we were too scared to venture into the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found nothing out of the ordinary.  From Sedgley Hall Park (which is on the hill going up to the town of Sedgley)  the circles were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is interesting to note that the fields where the crop circles appeared that night, and where the helicopter landed and the men were seen is near to a reservoir (towards Penn, Wolverhampton); could it be the same reservoir mentioned in the other Sedgley sighting?  There are a couple of reservoirs in the Sedgley area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Witness does not indicate what the time of the sighting was.  PD))<n>
