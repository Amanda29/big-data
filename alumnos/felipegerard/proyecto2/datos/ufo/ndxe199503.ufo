It was the size of a helicopter but made no sound and had no lights; it seemed to be bobbing or wobbling slightly, though that could&#39;ve been the movement of the tree branches.  I made a quick U-turn in order to drive close to it but it was gone by the time I went down the road towards the trees. I routinely never noticed the sky in that area but it was unusually pinkish in color that morning, causing me to immediately notice the UFO&#39;s silhouette.  I was excited after the event when I&#39;m normally very groggy while going to work in the early-morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

I had stayed in the computer lab late into the morning on Wednesday, March 29, as this day was University Day and we did not have class.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited Franklin Science Center from the inside corner of this L-shaped building around 6:30 in the morning and started walking across the lawn back to my dorm.  I was halfway across the lawn when I looked up and saw a ship hovering above the Dauphin Humanities building, maybe 4 or 5 stories high.  It was not a plane, or a helicopter or any other aircraft that I have ever seen before.  It was large and rather drum shaped with big round lights around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ship just hovered there, and I don&#39;t remember any sound coming from it.  I was terrified and just froze in place and stared at it for probably a minute or two.  The sky was clear and bright and there was just this odd ship hanging in the air!  It did not have wings or propellors or any other visible device to keep it in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how long I would have stood there staring at it, but it started to move foward in my direction, again completely silent, and this was when I started back pedalling back to Franklin Science Center.  Once I got inside the building I did not go back outside for 2 hours until other people were around.  When I looked at the same spot over Dauphin Humanities there was nothing there.  I felt like I was looking at a picture and someone had just erased the ship and there was a big blank spot in the sky where it had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any reports about this on the news and I myself never reported it to any officials.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

3/28/95 22:00|McAllen|TX|Disk|2 minutes|An out of control disk shape ship with an interesting white light.|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24882.html|14|ndxe199503| An out of control disk shape ship with an interesting white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared disk or saucer shaped. As I first saw it, it didn&#39;t look like an experianced &#34;driver&#34; was driving it. The reason I say this is because it was kind of out of control for the first few moments I saw it. The only way to describe it is as if you throw a plate (saucer)on the table and it wobbles around before settling, that was what this was doing in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship was silent didn&#39;t make a sound at all and looked just like they put them on tv, disk shaped, with red, yellow, and blue lights all around and of course the white light. The ship was spinning clock-wise as I looked up at it and the white light was spinning around the ship counter clock-wise. The one thing that I&#39;ve never seen or heard mentioned was the white light, that is tear or dip shape, didn&#39;t touch the ship at all. I always thought that the white light would be on the red, yellow, and blue lights if I were to see one but it wasn&#39;t, it was about two to three feet from the ship itself. I really can&#39;t describe it but the white light wasn&#39;t touching the ship and it seemed independant from the ship yet a part of it because even though the ship wabbled clock-wise with the spinning of the ship, the white light never missed spinning the opposite direction from the ship directly over the colored lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it was dark and I&#39;ve not thought of it much because I was afraid people would think I was a nut I&#39;ll try to describe the ship itself. I remember drawing it the next day and it seemed to be a metalic color and a hole on the bottom part, kind of like an opening maybe. Basically it seemed like two plates put together and a bowl on the top. It did spin out of control for awhile but seemed to have regained control after a few seconds after I was mentally willing it to stop or slow down, so someone else could see it. It wabble still but very slowly. I&#39;m not sure but I personally think because of me willing it to stop and as I did and having it slowly gain control, I believe it is flown mentally and not with control handles or buttons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though I saw the ship for two minutes or a minute it wasn&#39;t long enough for me I wanted to see more of it yet there was a tree that was going to block my view and no one to see it with me. What I did was wait until it hit the tree and ran inside to get the nearest person I could see to look at the ship too. I got my brother and he walked out and said &#34;Holy Sh*t a UFO!&#34;. I didn&#39;t wait to watch it leave I ran to call my friend who lived a few blocks south of me, the direction it was moving, and asked him to go outside to get a view. He didn&#39;t see it and my brother said it had quickly taken off. He said it kind of &#34;scanned&#34; the floor and took off, yet I don&#39;t believe him especially since he was young and it didn&#39;t sound like something that would have happened, plus the fact that he said it was a plane he saw two days later yet when he saw it, it was already kind of small as I pointed it out but still looked like what I saw only smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It changed color an|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02934.html|19|ndxe199503| Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft.

Lights flashing out of sync. red,blue,green,yellow,white and other colors. Rotated and slowley moved south.+<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 23 at 1:30am, a friend and I were camping in the woods in snoqualmie washington.I first noticed some lights high above us over and hill and commented that it looked like an airplane. He said it looked more like a helicopter.The clouds were fairly low and it was hard to tell so we forgot about it. A few moments later,we noticed that it was heading our direction. As it came down a hillside, we noticed that it had colors not consistant with regular aircraft.Red,blue,green,white, and yellow (there may have been other colors.) Lights were all over it flashing out of sync with each other. As it broke through the cloud cover, we saw air turbulence behind it. Not as an engine disturbing the clouds, but just as an object moving through it. It came to almost a hover aprox. 75 feet overhead and aprox 60 yards away. It made no sound and did not disturbe the trees it was very close to.Then a group of lights on the bottom rotated to the back and it rotated away from us. We noticed that we could see the color of the lights reflecting off the clouds overhead. The clouds were very low, almost a fog. It then headed south away from us.I have known my friend for 18 years, and he attends Western Washington University. I hesitated to submit this form, because everyone I have told has not believed. I hope that by telling, it will help in some small way.<n>

I saw under night vision goggles(NVG) only, 3 blinking lights at extreme alt.(30.000 ft+ and directly above my aircraft)seperated by 2 to 3 miles in a triangler formation. The blinking remained in unison for the duration of the flight(2+30)and in sight. Another object circuler in shape and moving up from a lower alt when sighted, with nvgs only, moving up and over my aircraft at extermely close range(-50 ft).Movement was from nose to tail of my aircraft. Object was circuler and opaque with what appeared to be flames or some sort of energy bleeding from the rear of the object trailing back about half the width of the object(like a ball that was on fire and it was thrown) ball width approx 20 ft. No other aircraft operating at that time in my area.No malf with my aircraft sytems before or after sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were woke up by a bright light, not blinking but all encompasing. There was no sound or vibration, and we were not afraid at all. We did not open our tent  and actually see what it was for a minute. When I opened the tent I saw a massive cylindrical object floating in the air over the pond. I zipped the tent and my friend and I fell back asleep. This thing had to have had some kind of psycotic (sic) powers or something, because I thought about it the next day and my friend and I agreed that we should have ran but we both fealt a surreal comfort during the sighting. I have always pushed this memory away, but I am more and more intrigued and everyday I catch myself staring at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a plane then I got a better look and it was NOT an airplane then I said LOOK LOOK! My mom looked up and saw it. My dad is blind so my mom told him what we saw. He ran inside and called my uncle and told him what happened. The UFO hovered over the local high school a quarter mile away. Then flew away about 15 minutes later. I later learned that night was called &#34;sightings  night&#34; and many other people saw UFO&#39;s and triangular UFO&#39;s like we saw.<n>

Westbound towards New York class B airspace Hudson River VFR corridor, ident signal from Carmel VOR which was being used for navigation, became very unreadable due to static. I was within Danbury Airport class D airspace, and in contact with their control tower. Directly at twelve O&#39;clock a large boomerang shaped object leaving a trail of what seemed vapor or fog, and a light glow around it approached our aircraft. We were flying a V35  Bonanza, altitude 3000MSL 2400AGL Groundspeed 130knots. No wake turbulence was experienced. Object flying at very slow speed. No navigation/position/anti collision lights. No traffic advisories from air traffic control. As the object positioned itself overhead, some type of observation ports or windows were noticed under the apex or tip of the boomerang. At this point the object made an incredible(as if the whole thing was not incredible enough up to this moment) high rate of speed climb until the object was no longer visible. Name is being withheld for the same reason I did not contact Danbury tower or New York approach to verify if they had seen what I just had. Did not report an incident report for a near miss.

A propane blue burst emited from the underside of each craft as they took off each going seperate ways. I heard noises comparible to a jet taking off for a split second after each one took off.

I looked up, and passing overhead was a triangular object, apex in the direction of travel. It measured approximately fifty metres end to end. and thrity metres wide. I wouldn&#39;t have though anything of this, apart for two reasons: we weren&#39;t under a flightpath there was no other noise; a silent propulsion engine. It circled directly above the city centre, then left at high speed heading north.<n>

Being from the East Coast, I&#39;d never seen the stars so clearly, so I was staring up at the Milky Way around 10 PM in a garden with a full 360 degree view of the sky.  I had been studying the stars for a few minutes when the leading point of something intruded into my field of vision.  The object was passing from behind me, directly overhead, and continued to slowly pass over for a long time, widening out steadily to a size which appeared large enough to cover the entire town.  There was no sound whatsoever. When the rear of the vessel came into my view I was startled, as I abruptly saw the straight line of stars reappearing behind it.  I did not go inside to get the others in the house because I did not want to lose sight of the craft in the night sky. I continued to keep my eyes on it as it slowly crossed the valley and went over the mountains.  Those mountains are thirty miles from Borrego (facing toward San Diego), and the vessel was still quite large (my thumbnail size at arm&#39;s length) as it passed over the mountains and out of sight.  Very impressive and unmistakable UFO sighting.  Quite a first for me!! Thank you very much for creating and maintaining this website.  It is a very dedicated and impressive undertaking, and gives people a way of sharing these experiences when there is no other logical method available.  Again, Thanks!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn&#39;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&#39;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &#34;capture&#34; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&#39;m sorry, I really can&#39;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&#39;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&#39;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&#39;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&#39;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!  Hope this helpful in some way; if you need more into, please contact me at any time.<n>

Taking somewhere between 5-10 minutes to approach my location.  As they did, two of the objects moved away to the east, the third coming to a halt almost directly in front of where I had now relocated myself on the verandah.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hurriedly, I obtained my camera and proceeded to note further details through the telephoto lens.  In the clear blue sky the black craft had three distinct &#34;bumps&#34; on the upper surface, and though apparently stationary, was clearly rotating.  Not only was I awestruck , but also scared, though not quite sure why.  At this point the UFO appeared to be the size of a dollar coin (Loony) held at arm&#39;s length.  At no time during the lengthy observation did the craft reflect light from the brilliant sunshine.  It was later assumed that as the object was visually at the at half height as the distant snowline, then its altitude could have been around 2000 feet.  No accompanying sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them.  This group watched the craft through binoculars.  It wasn&#39;t until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that I hadn&#39;t taken any photos!  This I very quickly did, being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total observation of this sighting was approximately 45 minutes, this was established through later questioning of broadcast program times.  A local weather check determined that the local wind speed was 8 km/ in this event a picture was taken and went national news on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was on a visit.  We went up the gondola to Grouse Mountain. I was telling her the story of what I had seen.  The person operating the gondola interrupted my conversation.  And he had said that he had seen the same three craft pass within feet of the cable wire holding the gondola up.  He was so frightened he said that he ducked down thinking these craft we&#39;re going to hit the wire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eighteen year old M and friend W were returning from shopping at Metro Town in Burnaby at 3 PM, April 5th, 1995, when they spotted what appeared to be the same three black UFOs in the sky ahead, holding a vertical formation.  The objects hovered, appearing to rotate from right to left.  No noise was detected during the 5-7 minutes observation period.  Visually, they were smaller than a dime held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they continued to walk slowly back home, still facing north, the craft slowly moved upwards into the fairly low cloud cover and subsequently out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this event, no pictures were taken.   Further investigation revealed that the immediate area contains a small lake and a nearby cemetery.<n>

It was so close to the ground &amp; the freeway &amp; it was all you could see it was so huge. I had a very funny feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. About that time I was getting ready to exit the freeway &amp; then because I was turning right couldn&#39;t see it as I was trying to drive and look through my windshield at the same time.  I couldnt make sense of it and then didn&#39;t think any more about it untill I saw on the TV that a UFO was sighted over Anaheim.   I have never forgotten the incident and allways wondered about what I saw because it was just to huge to be the Goodyear Blimp.Many people were on the freeway at that time but I don&#39;;t know how many saw this object.  Thank You<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  PD))<n>

It lit up the field below like a giant flash camera.  No sound.  No smoke.  Very quick.  That same night, saw another, but it curved off and seemed like it was 100s yards long in the sky.  Laser beam tests?  Atmospheric phenomenon?<n>
