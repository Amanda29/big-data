When I was 5 or 6 years old I was in our front yard just after sunset when I saw a round red glowing object that was traveling from east to west in the Northern sky. My Dad had an orchard across the road and the trees were about 15 ft. tall in rows about 40 feet apart. I was about 75 feet from the orchard. The object was a little lower then the tops of the trees. It took about 10 seconds to travel between the rows. The object appeared to be about the size of a softball and had a red glow like it was on fire. It didn&#39;t have a tail. I have always wondered what it was. Do you have anything on record for that time frame?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
