It wasn&#39;t dark outside but the sun had just went below the horizon.  As we proceeded toward the town of Alvarado we kept noticing that it was changing the side of the car it was on.  We said to one another &#34; Hey it&#39;s following us.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived in town the light was just on the other side of the highway ,and looked to be about fifty feet off the ground.  So we pulled into a church parking lot and decided to go that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started toward it, it remained just ahead of us for about two miles at that point it made a instant ninety degree turn and went straight up.  It was gone in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

At approximately 16:00 hours myself and two friends were on campus near a field shooting at gophers with bows and arrows.  One of my friends shot an arrow straight up in the sky and while we were watching the arrow go up we noticed a lot of bright, white colored shiny dots way up in the sky.  We counted at least thirty of them. They were in a cluster shape and were moving around.  Some appeared large and some very small.  They seemed like stars, they twinkled.  We also noticed a commercial airline jet flying overhead leaving a trail.  By comparing the jet to the objects it seemed as if the jet was flying through them, also some of the objects seemed way above the jet and the larger ones below the jet.  One of my friends went running back to the dorms to get his binoculars.  The sky was blue and cloudless with no wind.  The objects moved slowly to the Southwest.  I am interested in what you think these objects were and if any one else has seen them.  My friend said they were silver colored and round shaped, by the time I got to look through the binoculars they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/18/87 23:00|Lima|OH|Rectangle|5-8mins.|I saw a battleship size ufo that was outlined with lights but was transparent at the same time.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32557.html|3|ndxe198709| I saw a battleship size ufo that was outlined with lights but was transparent at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> around 11pm. my brother and I went out to feed our horses. we had gotten home really late. It was a clear sky with a full moon. You could see in the dark because the moon shined so bright. We were at the back of the barn when we heard a low pulsating engine sound . We felt a light vibration through the air. We noticed that the horses in the pasture were acting really nervous and would not calm down. So we started to look up in the sky to see what was making the sound. Off to our left (East) this HUGE slow moving ship was traveling Southward. This ship had to be at least a half mile long minimum. The only way to describe it : It looked as though it was some type of battleship or city. The outlines were in various colored lights but of colors not even imagineable. Even though you could see the outline of ship you could still see the stars on the other side of it .(Transparent) Even though it was slow the lights seemed to stream as if it was going really fast.It never stopped but continued at a slow rate. There&#39;s nothing that I am aware of that is that BIG and can travel that slow. After watching it for about 5-8 mins at least, we could still see this thing down by the Wapak area which is 20-25 miles from us. After it was around that area it went immediately straight up and was gone. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed and wish it will happen again sometime. Also about a year later we saw a huge bright red orb around the same location where the previous ship left. Noone ever believes me when I tell them, but we both saw it and we just stood in awe of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 12 feet or better from lower lights to the single upper light. Single light appeared to be about 3 to 4 times as large as the lower lights. The upper light was a white light where as the lower lights had a slight yellow or amber tint, not dark, however. The lower lights traveled from left to right. They cycled in a line or revolved and seemed to go faster as the craft increased in speed. When I observed it as it moved away it took about 8 - 10 seconds for the lights to make a revolution. It came from north to south traveling about 40 mph. It went south towards the south hill area towards the radio towers. Then I observed it going west when it became lost from view. I first observed it with the naked eye then with 7-21x35 power binoculars. I first saw it as it came into my line of sight above my head. It was about 100 yards away. This distance was easy to verify as I had an office building and telephone poles of known size to compare the craft to. The cycling lights were most impressive, giving me the errie feeling in that I have never seen anything like it before, this close, having seen unexplainable lights while living in Alaska many years ago. The next thing that was more impressive was how slow it was moving and still being able to remain airborne. But most impressiive was the total lack of noise usually associated with aircraft. Prior to the momennt I first noticed the aircraft, I was watching a fire truck on Freya St. They had about a dozen lights flashing. Red and white strobes. They were quite bright. There were no sirens or anything like that. They were just checking fire plugs. While watcing the truck the aforementioned craft appeared in my line of sight above me. It appeared to slow some as it to abserve the firetruck and its lights. At this time I noticed that the cycling of the lights was almost negligable, but seemed to increase as it moved away.

A rainstorm left the sky clear, and the glow was obvious against the cloudless horizon.  As we drove toward that location, we slowed and witnessed a &#34;craft&#34; hovering above the treetops. It was silent, yet clearly rotating behind a veil of &#34;orange brightness&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Turning directly toward it, the headlights swooped through the treeline, and exposed a mist of sparkle. Shining through this mist, the headlights raked the glowing object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a sudden compression or jolt of air,(a soundless &#34;poof&#34; best describes it), and the craft slowly began to glide away across the treetops.  Glowing cinders, much like tossing a log into a burning barrel would emit, rained down as it moved.  Gliding approx. 30 yds, it took off at a 45 degree angle upward with such incredible speed that a second or two it mixed with stars.  It suddenly burst a bright blue and disappeared from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within minutes a Highway Patrol appeared behind us.  I believe he was also witness to the event. Taking our names, he informed us that we did not see anything, and let us drive off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Arriving home, a minimum of 15 patrol cars were seen entering and sealing access to the roads.  As we exited the car, stepping into the driveway felt much like squirming out of molasses. It was a wierdness that lasted until morning when disbelief set in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Revisiting the scene in daylight revealed nothing other than the strangeness of an empty horse pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

9/15/87 21:00|Yankton|SD|Triangle|5-6  seconds|silent isosceles triangle shaped mirage-like UFO with no lights|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26512.html|6|ndxe198709| silent isosceles triangle shaped mirage-like UFO with no lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the exact date and time go, I cannot be certain.  It was definitely in the fall of 1987.  I was a junior in high school at that time and on one particular evening my astronomy class went to the observatory on the Yankton College campus.  That campus is now a federal prison.  That evening was very clear and I don&#39;t think there was much of a moon.  Our assignment was to look through the telescope and then write down on our sheet how many rings we could see around Saturn, moons around Jupiter, etc.  When I had finished my assignment I went back outside and stood with the other students on the hill on which the YC observatory is located.  There were maybe 10-12 of us there all talking about whatever when several of us just became suddenly quiet as an isosceles triangle shaped object in the sky to the west moved through our line of sight south to north.  It had no lights and made no sound.  Its only discernable feature was that it seemed to distort the sky behind it and the light of the stars it passed in front of in relation to us; kind of like heat waves rising off the pavement.  There were no additional colors.  Even though I can&#39;t describe the actual aircraft the shape of the visible distortion was definitely an isosceles triangle moving in the direction of the angle made by the two equal sides.  The base, or the back of the object in relation to its direction of movement, was a little longer than the two equal sides.  The translucent nature of the object makes it difficult to determine speed, size, or distance with accuracy.  The YC campus(Yankton Federal Prison) is not very big and is in a residential area.  From where we were standing on the hill the object didn&#39;t seem to be more than a few blocks away at an altitude of 200 feet, possibly lower.  At arms length it was aproximately 5-6 inches from top to bottom and 3.5 to 4 inches from front to back.  I did not get the impression that this was an extremely large aircraft.  When I caught site of the object I was facing southwest, and it moved! straigh t north until it was out of sight in five or six seconds.  Since it was night time and the object had no lights this probably wasn&#39;t a great distance, so it was most likely not moving incredibly fast.  Yankton is a smaller town so there aren&#39;t as many street lights as there are in bigger areas.  If this was not the case the object may have gone completely unseen.  Myself and possibly six or seven other people witnessed this event.  At this time I can only remember one or two who could corroborate this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though this happened fifteen years ago those  five or six seconds are burned into my memory like a movie clip that I can replay.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I did not see the actual craft, because I was too afraid to go up to the window directly. I viewed the lights from about 10 feet from the window. There were five lights in all, two giant white lights, and three orange ones in a horizontal line below it, in between the white lights. The lights appeared to be about 500-600 feet in the sky, and maybe 1000 feet from where I was. I live in a partially-wooded area and the object was completely unmoving and made no noise at all and was over these woods. My sister also saw the lights but given she was about 11 and me 14 at the time, we got scared as hell and ran downstairs. I wish I would have watched longer, but when I came back upstairs about 20 min. later the lights were gone. The best way I can describe it is as a giant Semi truck in the sky, just sitting there. I have seen maybe tens of thousands of planes at night, living about 15 miles from a major airport and in the line of the landing approach path, and I have never seen anything even remotely like this, ever. No way it was reflection either, because that would not explain the perfectly aligned orange lights that matched the white ones, and the windows were closed and the lights in my room were off. The white lights were very bright, almost like hi-beam headlights. It made no noise and did not move while I watched it. My sister and I are convinced it was not a plane. It happened over 10 years ago, but I have never forgotten it.<n>

When I did, I saw a cigar-shaped object (it appeared dark grey, to me) with three, evenly-spaced circular white lights appear in an opening in the clouds.  There was absolutely no sound, so I knew (intuitively) that it wasn’t an airplane.  The object did not appear to move while I was looking at it, and after 1 to 3 seconds, the clouds seemed to close in and cover up the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know, there were no other witnesses.  I was facing west as I entered the school, and the object appeared directly above the school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I worked at Runway Support and was out on the flight line with my binoculars and flare gun for a 4 hour shift at midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approx. 2 am when I saw what I thought was an aircraft coming in over the mountain top.  I had a radio that I then called the air tower with and no aircraft was coming in.  I told the tower what direction I was looking in and that was the last correspondence I had with him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was stationary and darted to the right very quickly and then dropped down to the bay and vanished.  I never saw it fly away in any direction.  It went right above the water.  I never saw any lights until I no longer saw the aircraft.  When it was out of sight I could see a brightness coming from the bay lighting the end of the runway.  I drove to the end of the runway and looked into the bay as the light started to dim and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to my commander the following day about what I saw and he said that they test all kind of things here but he usually has knowledge of the opporation before it takes place and he had not been notified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I walked to the kitchen of the house that I grew up in, which had a very large window that ran along the west wall. I proceeded to the fridge, and took out my sippy cup that was already full of milk. I shut the fridge door and turned around to go back to my room. As I did that, I took a deep drink from my cup and looked up, and out of the window, I saw a purple spiral hovering in the sky, slowly rotating. The spiral was made from a soft glow of purple light, that was unlike any light that I have ever seen, and nothing more. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it up to the sky. I took a good look at the object for about 3 seconds, and I knew that it was something very, very strange. I got scared and ran back to my room. My second cousin was on leave from the military at the time, and he just so happened to be staying with us and sharing my room. I woke him up and told him what I saw. He went to go and have a look for himself. I don&#39;t remember what he said it was, or if he said he saw it. I remember what I saw as if it were yesterday, and it was not normal. The light appeared to be self contained, as if it were &#34;bottled&#34;. There was no apparent source of light, and the light itself was not too bright, it was more of a soft glow, sort of like a neon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
