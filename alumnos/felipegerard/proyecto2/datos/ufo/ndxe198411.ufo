My condo, observation  point, is about 0.5 miles south-east of STEHS.  Objects appear to be bright stars or airplanes, as I live in the flight path of Du Page airport. Initially, I watched the objects for about 4-5 minutes.  Because the objects did not move and were very bright, relative to the stars in the sky, I took immediate notice.  I walked away from my observation point, my walk-in closet window, to determine if it was possible to observe event from another location.  To convince &#34;myself&#34; that something was really happening, I tried to observe the strange objects from other windows, my 1st level front porch, and from my 2nd level rear porch balcony. I was only able to observe the objects for a short period of time (5min.) from one alternate vantage point, my rear condo balcony.  Next, I returned to my! initial observation location, walk-in closet window, to notice that the two bright stars have moved lower in the sky, and to the horizon. The objects maintained the same relative displacement to each other.  I watched the objects for about 10min.  To my naked eye, the objects are small.  Also, I am not viewing the objects with binoculars or similar optic devices.  Next, I remained cog nascent of this event for about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 minutes, while hanging a shirt in my closet, I noticed that the object on the left had disappeared, and the object on the right is now  pulsing brightly in the red-blue-purple spectrum.  The object was also changing in physical size and shape.  As the object pulsed with a frequency of about 2-3 seconds it remained stationary for another 15 minutes and continued to pulse in colored lights until it vanished.  As a final note, I never observed any directional movement of the objects, only a pulsing of the object, as it increased-decreased in vo! lume by an order of 10.<n>

I do remember that either the next day or a few days after the sighting that a group of light planes flew over parts of Eastern New York in a triangular pattern in an  effort to explain the sighting to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone who had seen the triangular craft, and I have discovered there were literally hundreds, and then saw the planes flying in the formation the next evening would have to be a fool to believe they were one and the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 35 at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thought never goes away.

I was either still waking up or in a state of shock because it didn&#39;t really regiister as a &#34;UFO&#34; at first.  It was a huge &#34;V&#34; shaped or object with countless lights that alternated in color. It was moving very slow and was totally silent.  The enitre object seemed to pulsate in color except for the triangular tips and a large light in the center.  The tips and the large center light were orange or red.  As I watched this thing, two fast flying balls of green light flew up behind it from the west and just sort of  went into it. (I don&#39;t know how to explain it)  It then turned and headed south towards Berlin Heights.  As I got in my car I continuted to watch it and the clouds glowing because of it&#39;s lights.  It finally sunk in that what I saw was not made by man.  This thing was Gigantic.  I have told this to only a few people and I can tell they think I am nuts.  I really expected to see something in the paper or hear something on the radio.  After telling this story and being &#34;Politely&#34; laughed at, I can see why people are reluctant to report anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time may be approximate.  PD))<n>

I have told few people this story, and truthfully- it isn&#39;t for any other reason than, &#39;they just wouldn&#39;t BELIEVE me!&#34; But here is what happenâ€¦<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were hunting outside the town of Jasper , Fl on some leased land for a private hunting club. There were only 3 of us at the end of the day, and we were responsible for locking-up the main-gate to the entrance. The main road entrance runs perpendicular across a power-line with 200 yds wide of clearnce- very clear night, no obstructions of view, etc...  As I sat there listening to my Step-Dad and his Friend talk, I noticed a 3 light configuration moving in a circular pattern- but remaining in the same altitude -not moving up or down or side to side -just hovering... (cannot remember EXACT colors now) but it startled me enough to point it out to Wayne. This OBJECT was so close that I knew it should be making some sort of sound.!  And as a 16 year old kid, (at the time- 44 now) I realized  that Wayne and his friend were as curious and unsure of WHAT IT WAS as I was. In fact, enough that I begin to back up quit scared - to be honest! As I stepped backward toward the truck- intently watching this thing- it vanished.  It was at that moment I remember hearing Wayne and his friennd say, &#34;Why didn&#39;t it make any sound?&#34; And I looked to my right, at the same exact angle, but to the right-side this time, there it was AGAIN! Not making any sound, but visible lights rotating... I got so scared that I got into the truck and begged Wayne to get in also, and let&#39;s go!  It disappeared finally, and we left rather starteld. It must of lasted about 3-4 minutes total, and &#39;the thing that scared me the most&#39; (my Dad was a U.S.A.F. Captian/Pilot- I had seen many AIR-SHOWS, etc...) that this THING MADE NO SOUND AT ALL...NONE! It was the only time I saw anything that resembled a U.F.O., and after finding this WEB SITE- I f! igured you all could use all the &#39;TRUE AND ACCURATE SIGHTINGS&#39;! that co me forward. I never reported this until today, and my Step-Dad, Wayne, is still alive, and could verify this account. Hope this helps in some way!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/15/84 18:00|North Platte|NE|Other|5 minutes|UFO follows train tracks|11/28/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59315.html|6|ndxe198411| UFO follows train tracks<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading east on hi-way 30 towards Maxwell Ne. fifteen miles away.  I was taking my best friend home who lived south of the town.  There are railroad tracks that run perpendicular to the hi-way, and I usually did not like heading to Maxwell on that road as the trains always ran with their front light on (they only had one at that time) and I hated that cause they were always on high.  But it was early and still light out so I thought it would be fine if there was a train, as it would not blind me then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cloudy and grey, and it had been misting all day and was cold out.  I can not remember why we were making it an early day, but I think we had a test the next day for school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I started out of town we were just talking and I noticed that there was a train coming towards us and I immediately thought &#34;Crap, a train with it&#39;s light on. I hate that.&#34;  Then as we got a little closer to the &#34;train&#34; I noticed that it looked like a really tall train, as the light was twice as high as it should have been, but still did not think anything was strange about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as we got even closer I realized somthing was not right about it and saw that the light was high above the tracks and my friend stopped talking and I said to him &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  Moving very slowly along the tracks was a football shaped craft the the ends coming to a flat point.   The light was on the front pointing straight ahead and there was another I could not see at first pointing directly down onto the tracks.  It also had several small coloured lights at different areas on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had pulled over nad actually got out of the car and walked towards it trying to figure out what I was looking at.  My friend was freaking out and wanted me to get back in and drive away.  The car never quit running and I did not notice any electrical problems either. Good thing there was no traffic as I probably would have gotten run over! The object did not make any noise at all.  It was dead silent.  I stood there and watched it glide down the tracks with the light shineing down on it.  The size of it was about a train engine and a half long, it was a fairly big craft.  It just faded into the grey mist out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the cold rain sort of snapped me out of the daze I was in as I watched it and I got back in the car and started off towards my friend&#39;s home.  We did not say anything for a while and it was sort of like being in a dream.  When we did start talking it was like we were trying to make some sense of what we had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also mention that this was in sight of the airport which is just south of the hi-way and there are electrical lines that cross the tracks at several points so anyone flying an aircraft along them would have been very foolish and crashed doing so.  Also the Union Pacific does not check the lines that way either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting took only about five or six minutes even though it seemed like hours, but when I dropped him off and got home it was actually four hours later.  Maxwell is only fifteen minutes up and fifteen back.  We left town at around 18:30 hours and I did not get home till after midnight.  I still do not really know what to make of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day when we saw each other, he said to expect the Ne State Patrol to contact me cause his Mom called them after he told her what happened.  I was freaked by that cause I just knew that everyone would think we were nuts or high on something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They called the airport to see if there were any planes coming in at that time, and there were none and they saw nothing on their radar either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never discussed that event again for years till he asked me to recall the whole thing and I did.  Unknown to me he was recording me and he played the tape for a friend of his who said our story&#39;s were identical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this happened many years ago, but it is  still fresh in my memory just as the day it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The route we took was Highway 14, to Highway 21, to Highway 13 to Camrose.  The totasl trip would be only 1 hr at 60 mph.  It was night, and the evening was cold.  We left Edmonton at approx 10:oo PM, and at about 10:20 pm we exited #14 to travel S on #21.  We were driving our 1975 red chec 1/2 ton, no camper, open box.  We had our 1 year old daughter in a baby seat betwen the wife and I, I was driver.  We traveled at 60 mph (100 kmh).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we approached the RR crossing at Looma, AB, I noted a aircraft, I assumed to be a plane mid sky at my 11 o-clock.  I usually look at the night sky while driving.  about 5 minutes later, I noticed that the plane did not make any progress and pointed it out to my wife.  Her I watched as we travelled along #21, and we noticed that the aircraft was still at out 11 o-clock (left of our vehicle)  As we approached a small twon of Hay Lakes, I noticed that we were getting closer to the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, there is a two story farmhouse, that is situated just n/w of Hay Lakes.  It sits only 40 g=feet N of the highway.  We always drive by this house.  The highway curves to the right about 300 ft past the house.  As we we getting close to the house, we saw that the aircradt was very large, and hovering only 50 feet directly above this house.  Brights lights were on the side, but the lights were not round.  The whole side of the craft was lit up.  As we got closer, we actually drove under the craft, so I estimate the size to be about 100 feet in diametrer.  As we passed near and uder, the craft blocked out the stars, and I noticed that the bottom was not lit up, but I could see the shape to be a circle because it was black and blotted out a circle in the sky.  The sky was claer so the stars could be seen around the object. I slowed down and rolled down my driver side window, and all I heard was the sound of my vehicle tires on the pavement.  No sound came from the craft.  I should also advise that at this point we were only 90 feet below the craft.  I kept driving because all I could think about was my baby.  My wife yelled, &#34;stop the truck&#34;  but I didn&#39;t.  I kept my eyes on it by shifting my view to the side view mirror.  My wife looked back through the rear window of the truck cab.  I then noted an RCMP  (Royal Canadain Mounted Police) approach me from the S/B lane, I watched as his car passed under the craft,, and as funny as it sounds.  He did not stop.  He kept driving and were silent all the way home.  Hay lakes is nly 30 minutes from out home in Camrose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report this because of two reasons:  1.  At the time I was a City Police Officer and reporting this would kill my credibility as a crown witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  The RCMP officer driving the car I would have known, and no-one in the local detachment said anything, so I kept quit as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did tell a few close friends and my father.  But only after a few years.  My wife and I still bring this up from time to time.  I should have stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

If my memory serves me correctly, it was Thanksgiving night. We were playing behind the house on our uncle&#39;s two-acre property. I looked up for some reason and a fireball seemed to descend at a slight arc directly into my face. The fireball was changing with reds, oranges, and yellows moveing about and actually looked as if it was on-fire. From my prospective, it changed from the size of a golf ball to totally engulfing my whole line of sight. It only took about 2 seconds for it to descend to me and it was not a direct path, but instead slightly arcing. Startled, I looked at my cousin who also seemed surprised. We briefly discussed the occurrence with great excitement, as children do, and ran back to the house. I can&#39;t remember the exact reaction from any of our adult relatives, but I do recall that no notice was paid to our story. To this day, my cousin and I remember and occasionally discuss our experience. The hair on my neck stands up every time. I don&#39;;t know exactly what happened, but this two-second occurrence has solidified my belief in intelligent life beyond earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 11:00 the night before our wedding she and I were standing on a small dead end road far outside of the center of Edgartown, MA looking up and enjoying the beautiful night sky.  It was a very clear night so the sweeping streak of the Milky Way and billions of other stars were visible that night.  The ground was very dark because there was no moon in the sky at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A single very large black triangular shaped object creeped very slowly in over us blocking out the stars.  The object was completely silent and had no lights on it at all.  It appeared to be at a low altitude, maybe 100 ft or less, possibly at treetop level.  It was such a deep black that we could only discern its shape by the stars which were blocked out by it.  Its size was large enough to block out most of the sky over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both stunned as the point of its nose slowly wedged itself into our view but then a calm fell over both of us and we didn&#39;t utter a word.  We weren&#39;t quite sure of the duration of the event because neither of us could remember it leaving.  It was strange because at the time we both acknowledged that this had happened but we never told anyone in the wedding party nor discussed it much with each other after that.<n>

Just above trees in our backyard (100 feet) there was a single object similar in shape to the famous radio tower in Seattle. The lights were located on the lower part of the craft and were arranged in a circle. They were white and oval-shaped with pointed ends and came on in a wave fashion. Just before the craft left, the lights turned red and then shut off completely. I do not remember hearing any sound. But the craft was there one minute, and then was gone the next second.

It was a very bright clear night, perhaps even a full moon. It was in the early morning hours. I lived in a subdivision (Crossgates) on the north end of the lake looking from  600 Stonegate Drive.The lake was located just behind my house. I woke up suddenly, got up out of bed and looked out the sliding glass doors that went to our deck. Just above the old pine trees in our backyard (perhaps 100 feet tall) there was a single object floating stationary in the sky. It was similar in shape to the famous radio tower in Seattle. It had three distinct layers a small flat cylinder (more like a doughnut shape) on either end, with a larger more cylindrical shape in the middle. The lights were located on the lower part of the craft. The lights were arranged in a circle on the lower part of the craft with no lights in the center. They were oval-shaped with pointed ends. I remember seeing mostly white lights that came on in a circular pattern. Like a wave in a football game the lights would come on and off. Just before the craft left, the lights turned red all at once rather than in the circular pattern described before and then turned off completely before the craft suddenly took off. I do not remember hearing any sound. But the craft was there one minute, and then was gone the next second. The craft took off towards the south.<n>

It vaguely had the shape of a giant iol rig, but had no clearly discernible surface despite the arc-bright lights.  A deafening sound of an electric generator, at possibly 90 decibels, with extreme low bass wave undertones was heard, but no down drafts, wind, jet blast or discernable means of levitation (moving wind) was observ<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide craft, vaguely resembling an extremely brightly lit, vertically flying oil rig or wide-width broad cast tower, flew over our house at 364 Garret Circle, at 2:30 Am Nov 7, 1984, 6 miles west of Carrollton, Georgia. Initially the object rose up from a forest 100 yeards to the north of our house, and was spinning head over heels vertically in the air, making deafening rumbling and electrical generator sounds.  It was the deafening waves of sound and the bright lights that woke both me and my wife up.  I am a fairly prominent political scientist in my field, a two-time Fulbright scholar, a Ph.D. with long interests in astronomy, and my wife has a Masters in public administration.  I am a Scout leader, and a responsible college administrator now (1997).  My wife and I instantly woke up, flew to the front yard ard, and observed the craft cease spinning and it floated towards us 25 to 30 feet above the ground in a VERTICAL flying position.  You must imagine it is unreasonable to think that aerodynamics allow such a huge object to fly without wings, moving air, jet-blast, or any discernible means of propulsion, to fly vertically in position, but move horizontally at 1 to 2 miles an hour.  We watched for 10 to 12 minutes as the craft approached, passed over our pecan tree and house, clearing it by 8 to 10 feet, and floating south-southwest, it slowly disappeared over the horizon.  The craft was followed within about 100 ft by two approx 10 to 15 ft in diameter, red translucent and free-floating globes.  The large craft had immensely bright lights (as bright as an arc welders light), none of which were directional. The craft passed slowly over our front yard, from the forest across the street north, above our pecan tree, and our one story home, passing approximately 1 to 15 ft above the! house.  I could walk along with the craft across our yard slowly and keep up with it, until I hit our back fence line 70 yards behind the house.  I could easily see for several minutes the craft from no more than 20 feet below it.  As hard as I tried, I could not see past the bright lights to a surface of the craft.  This was extremely weird, since a street light illuminates the surface of it&#39;s pole, but these immensely bright lights would not illuminate the surface of the craft, which appeared as black mat invisible.  The lights were randomly distributed, with maybe 3 dozen lights, 5% red-colored.  I stress that the craft had NO WIND DRAFTS,  no down drafts, no jet stream or sound, no discernible flying mechanism -- just a 90 decibel level sound of electric whine as with a giant generator, and waves and waves of deep bass undertones.  The translucent globes had no discernible content inside, and were randomly floating behind the large craft, following it but not gaining on i! t, nor attached to each other or the large craft in any way.  They floated like directionally motivated soap bubbles, following the craft.  The craft was so near me I could have lobbed an apple upwards with a hand and hit it.  I recall being extremely intense about observing the environment, watching how the craft flew almost over our pecan tree, and cast moving shadows through it but did not disturb its branches in any way -- all to verify the physical reality of the observation.  My wife observed it with me, but for 1 minute moved into the house to flash lights from the porches at it to see if it would respond, to no avail.  She immediately came back out to observe it with me again as we moved to the backyard.  We kept confirming to each other we were awake verbally, but we agreed not to describe it to each other until we independently wrote a description up, with drawings -- without conversation -- and traded the descriptions to check each others observations.  The only dis! crepancy I can remember in our descriptions is that she thought there were a different number of red globes than I (I remember two, I think she recalled three, or one, but not two).  We were up discussing our reports to each other until one half hour later, we heard the drone of helicopter and airplan engines outside.  We went outside and coul clearly see that 1/2 mile to the east two black and low-flying military tyope helicopters, with forward looking light beams, were accompanying a low- and slow flying two engine plane.  They circled around our territory in a radius of about 1 mile, and criss-crossed once going from north to south and followed the trajectory of the crafts which had vanished.  We advertised in the Carrollton paper about a week later for other potential observers, but got no takers.  We interviewed neighbors, one of which was a pilot immediately to the north of us, but noone reported any perceptions or sightings.  We called the local sherrif&#39;s office, and th! e Carrollton police that morning to ask if anyone reported anything to them, and they said no reports were turned in.  At one point we gave an interview to someone who may have been connected to Mufon -- at least he was a friend of a friend who said he had connections with some reporting organization, but we never heard anything back from him.  We possibly could trace back who that person was, as he was a son of an elderly woman in our faith, who is now deceased.  We simply had NOONE to report the information to in those days of no internet or organized reporting networks.  I have read sporadically in the UFO literature, but have never run across a similar description.  I would be grateful to know of similar descriptions in a sighting.  The only ones that vaguely resemble ours are two reports in Alien Update by Tim Good by two UK couples in the early 1990s, but their sighting was of an orange colored rectangular (vertical) craft, and the description was not too close, or clear! ly written.  That night was slightly hazy if I remember correctly, with no winds.  We aver very curious to this day as to the purpose behind the military recon helicopters and plane.  I would like to request public anonymity, but I would talk to a researcher, as I am sure my wife would.  I attempted to use a camera, but I had no film in it at the time, to my regret. ((Name and number deleted)).  Sincere thanks.  Again, I WILL talk to a researcher, but I&#39;d prefer at this time that my name not be used, until I am convinced of the credentials of a researcher.<n>

We were actually riding on the public golf course (knowing we were not suppose to! We were about 10-11 yrs old) and ther was a back way out of the golf course. So after driving over a couple greens and tee boxes we deside to go the back way out that leads to a gravel road about 3/4 of a mile from the GC. We head out and down through this trail that at first is thick trees and then becomes an open plowed feild. We ran through this trail many times before. Well, just at the end of the trail, the tree line stops and the open feild begins and there is a jump or a dirt mound that we always liked to jump. We get up some speed and ramp this dirt mound and become airbourne! As soon as we land and look ahead my bud slamms the breaks and we both say at the same time &#34;What the hell is that!&#34;  The craft was about 50yrds in front of us and hoovering about 30 to 40 feet or treetop high. It seemed to be moving very slowly to the east away from us. (It has been 20 yrs but I still remember it well) I knew immediatly what it was and I told my bud to turn around and get the hell out of here, but he wanted to observe it for a minute and I said &#34;that is a UFO and the dam thing will take us up if we don&#39;t go&#34; and that scared him, so we tured around and boogied off back through the golf course. Nobody was playing golf that day cause it was wet and cold. Although, that day was very clear and the sun was just starting to set. The UFO looked like it had  a welding ark multiplied by 100 on the top and all colored lights like a rainbow dimmer than the top &#34;ark&#34; brightness. How I could tell it was round was because in the middle of it, this row of approx. 2&#39; tall by 1&#39; wide squares of orange lights would start at a point at us and go around to the otherside of the craft and then end up back at us, but moving constantly. I could hear a faint hum over the 3-wheeler at idle. It sounded like what a guardlight sounds like in your back yard. Besides the lights, the color of it, looked to be smooth stainless steel or some alloy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only 11 yrs old, but my mom had seen somthing a few years before and started researching the UFO thing and talking to people in the area that had seen things like UFO&#39;s. I was, and still am, up to date on all the latest Technology as far as Public &#34;need to know&#34; goes. I have 2 brothers, 1 in the USAF serving in Both gulf wars and knows a lot of stuff about a lot of things along these lines, and another that was in for 4 yrs and got out. I have worked at a top secret Gov. facility but I won&#39;t go into detail on that. I know this UFO was definitly a UFO. In a rual town near a rual road in a wheat feild looking like that!! I&#39;ve been waitng for somthing to look like it for 20 yrs but I have not.  There had been a lot of strange sightings around that area in the early 80&#39;s. If someone can explain what it was please do so. I&#39;m not sure if it took us up, but I&#39;m sure curious! I have a diviated septum if it means anything. My bud became one of my enemies later in life over a girl, so I don&#39;t know if I could talk to him about it, but I think we could.     I had another encounter in the exact same area about 10 yrs later, but I will save that one.    I have waited 20 yrs to tell this to the public!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
