2/20/67 19:30|Meriden|CT|Unknown|6 minutes|Light on a dimmer switch|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89817.html|1|ndxe196702| Light on a dimmer switch<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night in Feb.1967. I was outside just looking at stars when I noticed a small light going south to north at 7:30pm. Watched it stop in sky and was about 5,000 feet high.  Suddenly it got bigger ,the size if Jupiter ,maybe even brighter &amp; bigger.  Walked out to the middle of my yard &amp; stood underneath it looking up.  It then got dimmer but was not falling down it was going straight up &amp; getting dimmer like on a dimmer switch.<n>

I had long enough to say to myselt that it seemed to be faster than a satelite, but much slower than a meteor.  When it got directly North of me it made an instantaneous 90 degree turn to the North without changing velocity.  Then it accelerated of over the horizon (New Hampshire) in what seemed like an instant!  I was dumbfounded that an object could seem to make a right angle turn in the air (or space), which seemed to defy the physics I was learning in school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

AS IT CIRCLED FROM EAST TO WEST,  A LARGE AND VERY BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT CAME DIRECTLY POINTED SOUTHWARD.  THIS WAS WATCHED THROUGH BINOCULARS 10 POWER FOR APPROXIMATELY 35 MINUTES, BUT AFTER THE FIRST 5 TO 8 MINUTES YOU COULD ONLY OBSERVE THE BRILLIANT SPOTLIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFTER WATCHING FOR THE FIRST 3 MINUTES, I RAN INSIDE AND CALLED KLAMATH FALLS ARMY AIR FORCE AND NOTIFIED THEM OF THIS SHIP.   THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND A JET TO LOOK IT OVER.  APPROXIMATELY 16 MINUTES LATER A JET FLEW AT ABOUT 3,000 FEET OVERHEAD TOWARDS LAKEVIEW, OREGON, BUT BY THIS TIME THE SHIP WAS ABOUT 15 MILES DUE NORTH OF US BUT AT THAT ALTITUDE  I DON&#39;T SEE HOW THE PILOT COULD MISS THE SPOTLIGHT NORTH OF HIM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I NEVER HEARD FROM THE AIRBASE AFTER THAT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE ONLY WITNESSES WERE MS.

2/1/67 16:00|Martin|TN|Disk|Not sure, missing time|I saw a daylight disk in the afternoon followed by missing time, and seeing a small white humanoid. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68803.html|5|ndxe196702| I saw a daylight disk in the afternoon followed by missing time, and seeing a small white humanoid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my 2nd year of college at UT Martin, a friend and I were scouting the area south of Martin Tennessee for sites to take girls in the car.  We had just turned off of highway 45 going east onto a road that made a hard left turn shortly after turning onto it.  In front of us, before the left turn there was a huge (presumably) oak tree, and hovering over and behind it was a very large saucer shaped disc.  The diameter of the disk was approximately the same as the tree in front of it from our perspective, and I would estimate to be about the same as a saucer for a coffee cup held at arms length. We could see what appeared to be a row of windows around the perimeter.  One of us, I don&#39;t remember which, said &#34;wow, look at that&#34; and pointed to it. We watched it descend, and presumably land in the field behind the tree. Then I, who was driving, said &#34;lets go check it out&#34;.  It was afternoon, but still broad daylight at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember us is being on the other side of highway 45, back on a farm next to a creek.  My friend and I were looking around a small meadow on our side of the creek, and there were woods on the other side, and it was dark, although there was a full or near full moon, so we could still see pretty well.  We were both very apprehensive, but did not know why.  Then we suddenly saw a white figure standing beside one of the trees on the other side of the creek.  We looked at it, and it darted behind a tree. Curious, but also anxious, we crossed the creek to see what it was, but could never find it.  When we discussed what it might be we finally decided it was an albino bear cub, standing on its back legs in an upright position.  That sounds stupid today, but we could think of nothing else it could be.  Many many years later when I was walking through a bookstore I saw it on the cover of a book, and almost fainted. The book, which I bought, was named Communion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing was that at that point I did not remember the craft we saw earlier at all.  And we never mentioned the sighting of the craft or the &#34;being&#34; to each other after that time to each other.  Only after years did the memory of the entire event come back to me, and by then I had lost contact with the other fellow.  Also it was years before I realized that the two events were really the same event with a time between them that I still do not recall.  I have considered having a hypnotic regression done to try to find out what may have happened during the time I can&#39;t remember, but have not done so. I did take several people to that area in the following months because I was completely unnerved to be in that area and thought they would feel it as well, but no one I took there later had any strange feelings like I had when I went there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Decades later I dreamed of the event, and in the dream saw a huge flying saucer ascend from the field near the creek.  I however have no conscious memory of this, but still remember the dream quite vividly. Also neither of us had been drinking as we were both under 21 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/1/67 00:15|Fort Bliss|TX|Disk|5+ minutes|On an evening in February,1967 at 12;15am a friend and I were walking back to our billets from across the base at Ft. Bliss on a saturd|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14789.html|6|ndxe196702| On an evening in February,1967 at 12:15 am, a friend and I were walking back to our billets from across the base at Ft. Bliss on a Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were passing by the crypto infomation center for the Strategic Air command which is located underground in a highly secured area.  We looked up at the sky on a very clear night, when we noticed large cloud like puffs, that seemed to come from out of nowhere.  Then we saw a UFO that looked to be the shape of a disk/saucer.  It came out of the puffs and went directly over the crypto site and stopped abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was about 100-200 feet from us and about 100-200 feet above.  It then shot a beam of light of blue, red,orange, and bright white in the shape of rectangles with spaces between each light which followed in sequence and travelled slowly down and looked to be penetrating the concrete and metal surface.  Then the light came out in sequence at around a 45 degree angle rise up a to what seemed a fourth or fifth of the way up to the UFO and then disappear.  It did this for about 5 or 6 minutes but I&#39;m not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO then travelled back into the puffs and shot off like a rocket at an angle of 45-60 degrees and was gone.  The puffs were gone also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt very calm and different which I can not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual at some length, and we found him to be quite credible.  His recollection of the incident seemed quite clear.  We believe it to be a very good report.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NOTE:  The individual who submitted this report would very much like to establish contact with the other witness.  If anyone knows who the other witness might be, please contact our Center.  Thank you.  PD))<n>
