9/30/11 23:30|Hammock Beach|FL|Formation|4 seconds|silent invisible craft with visible lights in the shape of a flock of birds.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84250.html|1|ndxe201109| silent invisible craft with visible lights in the shape of a flock of birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the 6th floor of a condo looking at the stars when I saw what I thought were a flock of birds. As they got closer I saw they weren&#39;t birds but lights. It flew just above the building and about 700 feet out from the building and made no noise at all. It seemed to just glide by. I am without a doubt, 100% sure of what I saw. I can not say for sure though what it was. It made no noise, flew steady and solid and faster than a helicoptor yet slower than a plane. It looked invisible except for the light pattern that resembled a flock of birds or geese, sort of like a boomerang. I am just a regular person and am glad to say that after 42 years alive, I can say without hesitation, I have witnessed what many speculate to. I am an HVAC engineer at a resort hotel and wanted to share my experience with you. Sorry to be so long winded, but I am very much still excited. If you have any info on what it was,or if anyone else in palm coast saw it, can you please let! me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was my second time seeing these. I seen the same type of UFO last year above ym house in July of 2010 around the same time too!  I was looking back which was hard because I was trying to drive and seen 1 by 1 within seconds dissapearing into the sky.  These could not be a plane or anything they were soundless and hovered. the 3 objects could not be connected.  Me and my friends became very frightened because it was so unreal like nothing we have ever seen before.<n>
9/30/11 23:00|Vancouver|WA|Fireball|About 5 Mins long|Red Fireball like objects hovering over a field in Vancouver, WA|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84261.html|3|ndxe201109| Red Fireball like objects hovering over a field in Vancouver, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister, Cousin, and I were Driving down Fourth Plain on our way home from getting taco bell, and we were stopped at a light when I looked up and saw 3 things in the sky.  At first I thought that they were just stars, but then I noticed that they were to close to be stars, so I thought they were planes, but after looking at them for a few seconds I noticed that they were not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when my cousin told me that they were UFO’s and its not the first time that she has seen them.  It is her second time.  They were in a perfect line.  They were red and like a fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started to drive away we noticed that one shut up into the sky, then 2nd  seconds later the second one took off and then 2 seconds later the 3rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very outrageous experience.  I never in my life thought I would ever see a UFO. It was a great thing to see.<n>
9/30/11 23:00|Vancouver|WA|Light|2-4 minutes|Large reddish-pink lights slowly moving south.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84387.html|4|ndxe201109| At 11 PM on Friday Sept 30 2011 husband took the dog out back. he yelled at me to come quickly and look at the sky; in the east about 45 degrees from the horizon were about 7 to 8 or 9 (maybe there were more) large reddish-pink lights slowly moving south.  They seemed to be pulsating slightly. not helicopters. not planes!  They don’t seem right!  There is no sound! Balloons?  Not with that glow! What could move like that?   Each disappeared one by one at the front end.  There were a few wispy clouds behind them so we figured they had to be about 3 to 4 miles away and over East Vancouver.  They seemed to be sort of floating (but not bobbing) in a loose formation - a C shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran back to grab my cell phone and managed to take 4 shots.  the things were all gone after two to three minutes!  I mailed the photos to my email and looked at them on the computer. The photos on the computer were disappointing because the lights looked so tiny and the sky was so black. They just looked like stars. I had not thought of shooting video at the moment. I was able to lighten the entire photo to show them up. I sent a text with photos to two local news stations - no answer this weekend. I googled &#34;unusual sightings.&#34; I noticed that there are a few videos and photos that seem like hoaxes, but many more looked and sounded exactly like ours. Words used in the videos we found were exactly in our conversation: what are they? this is weird no sound red lights pinkish lights orange lights floating moving slow formation blinked out disappeared one by one pulsating<n>
9/30/11 22:45|Fort Mohave|AZ|Triangle|30 sec|Triangle shape with no lights, no sound, hovering behind a electrical storm following it.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84251.html|5|ndxe201109| Triangle shape with no lights, no sound, hovering behind a electrical storm following it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my 2nd object that i seen in my life time and i am 20 years of age,  It was around 10:30 pm as myself and my roommates walked out of our back porch, smoking a cig, and we walked out a little more to the yard cause there was a storm that passed by and my first roommate was looking up into the sky and asked what is that and then thats when i looked up into the night sky and see  a slow speed like a dark but lighter color then the black sky under the stars with no wind at all and there was this triangle shape object with round edges and no lights on it at all and made no sound i would say going about 35 mph and appx 100 feet up and the flight path going made a small curve heading towards Needles California, right behind the storm which was a electrical currents ,<n>
9/30/11 22:30|Port Arthur|TX|Light|15 seconds|Group of fast moving lights inthe night sky.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87462.html|6|ndxe201109| Group of fast moving lights inthe night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10:30 pm September 30th 2011, while relaxing under my carport admiring the night sky, I had focused on the typical passing airliner at high altitude with it&#39;s red and white lights moving slow in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly six oval shaped glowing amber lights in a very tight semi-delta formation appeared in my vision as if they had shot out of the clouds and just appeared moving fast in a southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My immediate thought was &#34;Cool, fighter jets!&#34; However there was absolutely no noise and no jets, just the glowing lights. If they were jets, they would have been flying low to be going that fast and making a lot of noise. A single fighter makes allot of noise flying over my area at even higher attitudes, also the airliner that I was first watching was at a much greater altitude and I could make out a faint sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of the lights first reminded me of the Phoenix lights, but much tighter however the last three of the lights were slightly out of a perfect delta formation, at least from my vantage point. That gave me the impression that I was seeing six individual objects or lights as oppose to a possible single object with six lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved very fast towards Galveston Texas. I watched until they were out of sight. The duration of the event was maybe 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unless I was witness to a squadron of classified visually and audibly stealth fighters, I am not yet convinced that I was viewing jets with their afterburners on as others have suggested.<n>
9/30/11 21:51|Copperas Cove|TX|Unknown|10 seconds|second sighting sfter minutes of filing a report|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84247.html|7|ndxe201109| second sighting sfter minutes of filing a report<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 30 sept 2011 at 2151 hrs after finishing the report I went outside and again Isaw it traveling from north to south. i had my phone but it could show anything.  Damn it was so fast and without sound.  nothing travels that fast. please tell me im not the only one who saw this.  twice no less.  I will not write again but will take notes if seen again.<n>
9/30/11 21:50|Searcy|AR|Diamond|2 minutes|Orange-reddish object not moving at fast rate of speed began to move at ENORMOUS one out of me and and I friends field of vision.|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87331.html|8|ndxe201109| Orange-reddish object not moving at fast rate of speed began to move at ENORMOUS one out of me and and I friends field of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and a friend of mine were on the balcony of his 2 two story complex in Searcy, AR, in conversation when he pointed to the sky and said, look bro there is a ufo.  I looked up and saw an object that looked to be on fire and an orange-reddish color hovering less than 200 feet in the air above us and moving south east at a steady clip no more than 30 miles an hour.  I looked at the object about 4 to 5 seconds as it moved past my field of vision, and I was as yet determine what it is I had saw.  We both ran out of his house and down the steps in which time it must have taken us about 8 seconds, by which time the craft or whatever it was I was seeing had begun to move at an ENORMOUS rate of speed.  It was not headed straight up into the heavens but had a trajectory similar to something which had a clear destination which made me believe it could have possibly been a satellite, but my friend says it came up out of a grove of trees and then started hovering, ! which I did not see but I trust him because we both saw the same thing for several seconds.  The rate of speed this object was traveling could be estimated by me a novice but somewhat educated man as 40,000 miles an hour.  It was going state to state in a matter of seconds, until it went over the horizon and left my field of vision.  If it was a satellite, it was the most sophisticated piece of technology I have yet seen.  It’s speed could be compared to when you see a Christmas movie with Santa Claus barreling across the sky on his way to deliver toys.  I being a skeptic eventually came to the conclusion that it was either a beautiful craft or a hologram in the air, and a hologram seemed unlikely.  Along with it definitely be of a pyrotechnical nature, it seemed to have some sort of diamond or rather a geographical shape similar to an 8-pointed object, something that looked highly sophisticated.<n>
9/30/11 21:48|Omaha|NE|Chevron|1 minute|Boomerang shape, color hard to describe like hard mist|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84248.html|9|ndxe201109| Boomerang shape, color hard to describe like hard mist<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was on the phone outside at approx 9:45 PM when spotted it above our house, he banged on the door for me to come out and pointed it out to me.  It was boomerang shaped, the color was very hard to decipher I would describe it as being like a hard shear curtain color, hard mist... very hard to describe.  It was moving very slow, and levitated in one place for about 5 seconds, moved to the right, then continued to move forward (which would be east from our home) then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/11 21:07|Copperas Cove|TX|Other|10 seconds|2 to 3 dozen white lights in an unorganized wing or boomerang formation moving from north to south with no sound|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84246.html|10|ndxe201109| 2 to 3 dozen white lights in an unorganized wing or boomerang formation moving from north to south with no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 30 SEPT 2011, approx 2107 hrs, I went outside my house at 212 Dewald St. Copperas Cove TX to smoke when I saw from the north heading south from a east side my porch two dozen to three dozen lights in the form of a wing or boomerang. I could not see the out line of a craft but only the white lights within that form traveling at a high rate of speed with absoluty no sound. I could not believe what I saw so, as it was passing by I ran inside to grab my phone to record it. It only took about two seconds but when I got outside it had passed so fast that I could not get my video online to record and the lights could no longer be seen as they faded very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be low. I see aircraft like the air force C5 land at Ft. Hood/Killeen international airport all the time since I am only a few miles from it and the large aircraft go so slow and make a great noise that it can not be mistaken for anything else. Furthermore the UFO In saw traveled without sound and west of that landing area and continued south until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work on ft hood as a civilian police officer and was off duty at the time. I have seen many aircraft from large military planes to civilian planes as well as many combat helicopters flying in formation over ft. hood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that I saw were so unorganized within the pattern of a huge wing or boomerang like shape that it could not have been a formation planes or helicopters to travel so many miles from the north to the south and out of sight in just 10 to 15 seconds without sound and not landing at the ft hood/ Killeen airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I have said, I have seen many aircraft both civilian and military in the area to include the largest of all.  Galaxy C5 aircraft and this is truly the first stunning UFO that I have ever seen as an adult.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/11 21:00|Bellevue|NE|Sphere|1 hour|Very unusual craft seen over Bellevue NE, headed for Offutt.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84263.html|11|ndxe201109| Very unusual craft seen over Bellevue NE, headed for Offutt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While hanging out with a couple of buddies I noticed some hovering very close to the ground approximately 5 miles north of us, at first we thought it off thinking it was a police helicopter.  A couple of minutes later I glanced back in that direction, saw that it was still in the same location, then i saw it drop several small objects that appeared to be blinking red. I pointed it out to my buddies and they saw it as well, so we decided to watch it.  Pretty soon we notice it getting closer until it passed us about 100 feet to the east, it was coasting about 200 feet in the air, very quiet emitting a very soft and low pitched noise, I&#39;d say it was moving about 75 miles per hour.  It look like a dark colored orb with three bright white lights (one on each side and one on the very front, it also had a green light which came on and looked like a laser but could only see it until it got about 20 feet away from the craft and it was changing direction and seem to be m! oving around the surface of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing us it turned east headed for Offutt air force base, we tryed to follow it all roads into the area of the base were closed, and we lost it.<n>

It started at about 8:30 and lasted for 15-20 minutes.  There were six of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen them more than once. I noticed an airplane passed above over it in the distance.<n>

9/30/11 20:10|Truth or Consequences|NM|Other|3 nights|3 Days of UFO Activity in Truth or Consequences, NM, 30 Sept. to 2 Oct., 2011|1/12/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/086/S86123.html|14|ndxe201109| 3 Days of UFO Activity in Truth or Consequences, NM, 30 Sept. to 2 Oct., 2011<n> <n><n> <n><n> NIGHT 1 (Friday, 30 Sept., 2011) Approximately 8:10 pm:  At approximately 8:10 pm, a string-like, rod-like, smoothly flowing, almost organic shaped (wing*) passed overhead, seemingly several hundred feet in the air, almost directly over my backyard.  It came from NNE and moved SSW, visible for approximately 3 seconds.  It came out of the darkness and disappeared back into the darkness- very stealthy!  Its length was approximately 20 full moons (if the full moon was directly overhead- that’s the size I mean).  It was illuminated as a white tendril (like an elongated “U”).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw a black and gray checkered bird-wing-like object pass in a short North to West corner sweep.  It appeared to the west of my yard, seeming to be directly above the ground a block or two away.  It was visible for approximately 2 seconds.  It seemed lower in the sky than the tendril object, maybe 100-200 feet high, and covered an area approximately 2-3 full moons.  If it was an owl’s wing (it was night), it would have to be, I’m guesstimating, at least 20 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw another tendril object.  It seemed to be about half the size of the first tendril object and a little lower in the sky than the first one.  It passed just slightly to the East of the first tendril’s position but along the same general trajectory.  It was visible for approximately 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw the last tendril, about 1/4 the size of the first, traveling even more eastward (nearly straight south), visible for approximately 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NIGHT 2 (Saturday, 1 Oct., 2011) Early Evening:  I saw another black and gray checkered object (like object 2 from Night 1).  It seemed slightly smaller than the first one (from the night before) but more or less the same and in the same part of the sky.  Like the first one, it seemed to pass above an area about 2 blocks to the west of my yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NIGHT 3 (Sunday, 2 Oct., 2011) Just Before Dark:  Far off to the east, well beyond Turtleback Mountain which is at least 1/4 mile away, I saw a huge flying wing, much like a boomerang shape, all black, silhouetted against the barely lit sky to the east.  It looked like it could have been several, even many miles away.  It appeared face-on and traveled approximately south to north, visible for approximately 3 seconds.  It looked to be possibly hundreds of feet wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/30/11 20:00|New Berlin|WI|Triangle|5 minutes|Red & white lights in shape of a triange in the sky|10/25/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84677.html|15|ndxe201109| Red &amp; white lights in shape of a triange in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was turning into the Target store parking lot in New Berlin, WI when I looked up over the trees and saw 4 lights in the shape of a triangle.  Three of the lights were red and one was white.  It hovered in the sky, and one of the lights disappeared for a few moments, then reappeared.  At first I thought it was radio towers but then realized that the closest radio towers were in the opposite direction. It was a very curious event.  No airplane behaves in such a manner as what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First time was back in Jan 11. about 7:30pm also.  Bright blue object.  Extremely bright blue.  First time I tried to get a neighbor to see also but no one was home. This time my neighbor came out and saw also. What is crazy is it is over a heavily populated area of West Knoxville.  I can&#39;t believe there isn&#39;t more response.  Object makes no noise.  Fly&#39;s in every direction quickly.  First time a spotlight shown down onto the ground from object but I did not notice it this time.  I have video from both nights also but from a cell phone so not very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very interesting. I would just like to know if anyone else saw this.  Is it a toy???  No plane can fly like this.<n>

The three objects were about the same elevation and in close proximity to one another.  The distance between the objects was about one and one half times their diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought these objects were part of some new construction I had not noticed before.  They looked somewhat like the distant view of the top of high mast stadium lighting.  Wanting to get a better look I placed my mail on the ground to mark the position where I was standing and noted the direction I was looking relative to the roof of a nearby house before going into a nearby storage building to get a pair of binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned less thn two minutes later the objects were gone.  Looking at the area where the objects had been I could see the tops of two metal towers supporting TVA high voltage transmissi! on lines.  No part of these towers has any circular shape and the cloudy skies rule out any reflections off the towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am quite certain of what I saw but I have no idea what these objects were.  I am filing this report in hopes someone else saw these objects and files a supporting report.<n>

I thought it might just be an airplane, with the wings casting the shadow on the middle of it, but I watched it while I drove for a few more seconds and it didn&#39;t change.  I pulled off the side of the road, and took two pictures with my phone, I looked back after taking the second and it was gone.  I assumed I would report it here and you guys would know if it was a plane like I originally thought or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When filmed with digital camera, an entire color spectrum appeared to display from the object, in a strobe sequence, which none of us could see with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later the object stopped all movement, and 5-10 minutes of still hovering occurred, followed by a falling star, and the appearance of other distant objects.  When studied these two new craft displayed not only a color sweep of red, green, white, and blue, but also formed a perfect triangle shape with the original object, almost as if creating the first object of notice, as some sort of elaborate light show..?   In the distance to the southeast, a jet aircraft with standard blinking white, red, and blue lights was visible. Moving from the west to a south-southeastern heading.~~  ~~~<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object observed by 3 young adults, after a event.<n>

The object was circle in shape.It had two shades of color to it, in the middle it was dark black looking, and on the out shell it was a lighter color.  Also in the middle of it was a smaller dot of some kind, circle in shape,like something a U.F.O would have on it, or on a spacecraft,from out of this world.  After the light went out on it, I pionted my camera in the direction of the said object, and took a photo of it.  The photo showed what I just discribe above.  I believe I have a real photo of a real U.F.O. This is my secound report of two different U.F.O observations,that I reported to this site, this year ,and with in the last four months.Duly noted.<n>

At least this is what we initially thought. We kept observing the Star because I mentioned it is so beautiful it looked like a diamond in the sky, because it would reflect some red, blue, green, white light.While observing the &#34;star&#34; it would dim and shine bright and dim again. This is whe we got suspicious and kept observing.  This &#34;star&#34; would move left and right and down and up, only that to notice one had to stay looking at it. I then thought of the probability of it being a satellite, but I kept wondering if satellites move in directions left to right and then down and up in less than fifteen minutes, as I observed. It seemed as if whatever it was it was trying to disguise itself as a Star. I was wondering if anyone else had observed anything like it in my Area. I live in northeast Puerto Rico, very close to the beach. I had come across a post ! in which a person described a sighting very similar to my experience and they were close to the ocean as well, I was wondering it this had any meaning of if it was just coincidential.<n>

While I was looking up this time (I was looking west) I saw 3 dim yellow dots (they looked like average stars) in the form of a slight obtuse triangle.  They were not blinking like strobe lights, they were solid dim lights.  These dots were in perfect form flying the exact same speed (which was about 3x as fast as airliners usually fly).  They flew NW until I could no longer see them due to trees and houses.  The whole encounter lasted 8-10 seconds and had heard no sounds of jets or planes, all was silent.<n>
9/29/11 21:20|St. Stephen|SC|Unknown|20 to 25 minutes|10 to 12 lights followed by jet fighters over Berkely County in South Carolina|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84236.html|26|ndxe201109| 10 to 12 lights followed by jet fighters over Berkely County in South Carolina<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are located just south of St. Stephen, SC, 29479, about 3 miles.  We are located about 30 miles northeast of Charleston, SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of September, 29, 2011 at around 9:20 in the evening, on a very clear night with no moon in the sky, my wife and I witnessed some events that seemed to correspond to each other.  As we looked from our driveway to the north, which would be towards St. Stephen, there was nothing in the sky.  As we turned to go inside I happened to turn back and saw about 10 to 12 blinking lights.  Their location was in the sky at a NNE direction about 45 degrees up.  They had the illumination somewhat brighter than a normal star.  We hurried to the fence, away from the main road so as not to be hampered in our viewing by any traffic that may come toward us on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched them in a group, a falling star was witnessed by both of us.  It was larger and slower than a regular slit of a glimpse a usual falling star gives you and had a long tail that was orange in color and much wider than a regular meteorite.  Its trajectory was about 90 degrees when we spotted it and went to about 30 degrees before it disappeared.  It was traveling from south to north.  Whatever fell through the sky seemed to dissect the blinking lights.   It was almost as if they were signaling for something to come in.  Then they broke apart in formation with about 8 heading towards the coast, which would be towards the east and four heading towards the west, above and to the north of Lake Moultrie which is towards our west.  We followed those lights because the other 8 would have been obstructed quickly from view because of a forest to the east of our viewing position.   After the four blinking lights heading towards Lake Moultrie went out of site, less than a mi! nute passed and we suddenly saw two Air Force jets at full throttle heading in the direction of the four that had just flown out of sight.  We definitely heard the two jets with afterburners at full thrust.  We never heard anything when it was just the 10 to 12 blinking lights in the sky.   The jets were coming from SSE which is the direction of Charleston’s Air Force base and flying rapidly towards the NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the jets went out of sight and sound, we looked back to the original spot in the sky where we had seen the original lights blinking, and we saw another falling star, exactly like the one I explained falling in exactly the same area we had seen the first one.   Immediately following that, I was looking off in a westerly direction towards Lake Moultrie when my wife exclaimed that she saw another falling star streaking towards where the four blinking lights had headed off towards Lake Moultrie.  That one was about 20 degrees in the sky heading from the north when she saw it towards the north- north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode lasted for a total of about twenty minutes ending between 9:40 to 9:45 pm, Eastern Standard Time.<n>

As we always do we went over to the driveway and looked up at the stars.  It was a clear night, so we were able to see many.  We were heading back inside when my husband turned around and said “look”.  When I looked to the right I saw between 10 to 12 lights blinking in the night sky a little above the trees.  I was amazed.  There was no sound of planes in the sky and they were not there just 5 seconds before.  We went up to the fence in the side yard to get a better look.  As 4 blinking objects went to the left we saw a “falling star” that did not seem like a usual falling star. It was slow and in the sky longer than others we have seen.  As the 4 blinking objects continued to the left we heard two Air Force jets booking it.  We looked and they were heading in the direction of where the 4 blinking objects went.  We waited for a little while and continued looking in the ! sky and we saw another falling star in the same area and path that the one took before.  We stayed out for a little while longer looking up at the sky to see if the Air force jets would go back over and I saw another falling star heading from right to left.  We stayed out for about another 10 minutes watching the sky before we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very clear. I stared at it through my windshield what seemed like a good 5 mins or so trying to figure out what it was. It certainly did not look like an airplane or anything else.  Then all of a sudden it started blinking really fast and disappeared.  Then I saw a smaller set of rapidly blinking lights directly next to it and then it just disappeared completely.  When I got to my friends I told her that I saw something crazy and didn&#39;t know if I was seeing things and she described it and said she had seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to two other people that night who were at different locations at the same time who said that they had seen it as well and described it the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It stayed in the same place for about 2 hours and it is still going on right now.  We got the telescope out and confirmed that it is defiantly not an airplane or any type of craft we have seen before.  Like I said before this is not the first time that we&#39;ve seen this it keeps coming back around the same area we&#39;ve seen it about 3 times now.  Our neighbors even came out of there houses to look at it so we are for sure not crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  Sirius??  PD))<n>

I was on my way in the house I just so happen to look up and saw what I thought was a high flying airplane. Well after about 1 min past this blinking light came from the east of me and I was about to go in the house when out of no-were another blinking light came from the west of the other light and they meet and in line of each other and I was like OMG these two planes are going to crash? I then ran to my door and called for one of my daughter&#39;s to come see she is fourteen years old and she came out and ask me what was I looking at and I said look at those two lights? She said I don&#39;t think those are airplanes? I said I know look how fast the lights are blinking? She said they look like UFO&#39;S I ask her how do you know what it look like? And she said I&#39;ve seen them on TV? And the one&#39;s I&#39;ve seen ! on TV look just like these? By then my 9yr old came outside and ask what&#39;s up there in the sky mom? I said it look like a UFO or airplane? And even my baby said mama look at those lights over there and it was another blinking light they were blinking off and on so fast it was so amazing to us. After about 7 or 8 min we all went in the house because they the lights went over behind the trees and we could not see them anymore. After I got in the house I wanted to see them again so I was getting ready for the bed and happen to look out my bedroon window and the same two lights that we saw at first was back out over the top of the trees that I can see from my bedroom window, I called my daughter to my window and we watch them for about 3min and they just blinked out. I hope that someone else saw what we saw, I&#39;m just glad I wasn&#39;t the only person that saw these lights. The fast flying lights were to far away for me to record it on my cell-phone, I was trying to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved slowly.  Perfectly formed.  Not moving fast.  Very visible.  Unlike anything I ever saw.  We just watched it track across the sky.  It felt very weird watching this as it was something I couldn&#39;t explain.  It was white in color, not silver or what I would ever think a UFO would look like.  It definitely was not a cloud.  Too perfectly formed and against a blue sky and in too much of a perfect pattern.  Then it just disappeared from sight. It didn&#39;t go behind a cloud, it just disappeared.  I felt I had to say something as it still leaves me with a strange feeling.  Thank you<n>

9/29/11 05:00|Long Beach|CA|Changing|at least six minutes|Big, extremely bright, bluish-white, silent light that changed shape in the sky over the ocean in Long Beach, CA.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84237.html|38|ndxe201109| Big, extremely bright, bluish-white, silent light that changed shape in the sky over the ocean in Long Beach, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something unusual in the sky while letting my dog out to urinate at 5:00 in the morning on September 29, 2011.  I was the only person in my house to see it see it, but I am reporting it in hopes that maybe someone else saw it too and can corroborate what I saw. Because I was a bit afraid of what I saw, I did take a picture. I just rushed my dog back in the house, locked my door, and got back in to bed close to my spouse. In retrospect I wish I would have taken a picture so that I would have some proof of what I saw, but the thing really creeped me out and I did not want to even look at it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live across the street from the beach. From my front yard, looking southwest, there was a big, bright light in the sky. The sky was very clear and the morning was very quiet.  The light I saw is the brightest thing I have ever seen, except for the sun. It was so bright and seemed to be bluish-white in color. It was brighter than the moon. I don’t think that it was as bright as the sun because it did not hurt my eyes to look at it. It wasn’t a glowing light and it wasn’t blurry, just clear and bright white light. The light did not move and distance or make any noise at all. The shape of the light was like a vertically-oriented oval. At one point the light shifted from being an oval shape to being a crescent shape and then back again to an oval or round shape. It appeared to be very large in the sky. From the ground it did not look as big as the moon, but it looked way bigger than stars or planes look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the light seems strange to me, I started trying to figure out what it was. I know that is was not the moon because it was too bright and didn’t have that glowing, reflective quality of the moon.  It also did not have any of the man-on-the- moon shapes on it.  It was just a solid bright light. I know it was not a helicopter because it did not make any noise or have to typical little lights that helicopters have. I know it was not a plane because it did not move or go anywhere.  I know it was not a street light because the lights in my neighborhood are orange colored and this was much higher. I know it was not a meteor because it did not move.  I know it was not a star because it was too big and because there is usually too much light pollution in Long Beach to really see starts clearly. I know it wasn’t a planet because it was too big.  I also know that I was not dreaming this because I stayed awake after putting my dog out.  I know it was not a blimp because it was vertic! ally oriented and did not move. I of course know it was not a bird because it was a bright light. I know it was not a flare because flares fall and leave a smoke trail that you can see in the dark.  I know it was not a firework, because it did not fall of make noise. And I know it was not a spotlight or lighthouse light because it was far too bright.  I know it was not from a boar because it was too high up in the sky.  I know it was not a light on a tall building because there are not any tall buildings over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe this was a piece of the NASA space shuttle still falling down? I don&#39;t know.<n>

A white ball type circle that would look like a star if it wasn&#39;t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched.. it stopped, then handed the binocular to my husband and he also saw the same ball/circle type of object continue moving East across the sky, at a very fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we didn&#39;t see it again. (this is my first time reporting, did not know about this site<n>

I was facing NNE looking at the star Cirus when a saw a round orange ball of light that lasted only a second.  I waited for a sound thinking it was an explosion, but there was no sound.  The ball of light was a little south and east of Cirus.  There were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Dad was working on edits, but she persisted, so I put on my sandals and headed out the front door with her. There was an airplane flying over in the Northeast, so I looked up. There, at about 70 degrees up in the north north east what caught my eye were two very bright objects, brighter than Venus and larger in apparent diameter, and with a bit more of a yellow white color to them, similar in color to incandescent car headlights or aircraft landing lights. They were moving slowly, significantly more slowly than an average satellite, and flying due north about the width of my thumbnail (at arms length) apart in direct line with each other, both equal brightness and one directly behind the other following the exact same course. My first thought was that it was as bright as an Iridium Flare, but the Iridium satellites do not fly in clo! se formation, they are distributed around the planet for good satellite phone reception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, what happened next pretty well cinched it.  They both dimmed down together, not at the same spot but at the same time, and then the dimmer &#34;satellites&#34; changed formation, with one moving off to the side and catching up with the other while moving from it&#39;s 6 o:clock position to it&#39;s 4 o:clock but keeping about the same relative distance.  So, obviously at least one of the two objects changed speed and direction, unless it was actually one LARGE object that changed orientation.  Either way, it wasn&#39;t normal!  I checked the time when I got back on the front porch and got some light on my watch and it was 9:20 PM MT Thursday, Sept. 28th, so it happened between 9:18 and 9:19 PM, observed from my front yard in Evergreen, CO. I came in and checked Heaven&#39;s Above, and there were NO Iridium satellites visible at all from this location this evening.  It is pretty early in the evening for a &#34;Satellite&#34; to go dark that high in the sky, the terminator (Earth&#39;s shadow) should still be farther east, (unless they were much lower and in the atmosphere) and they were still visible though much dimmer for another 30 seconds or so.  The only published satellites anywhere close to this time are these, and neither was in the proper direction, anywhere near high enough or bright enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Milstar     3 3.9 21:16:53 10° SW 21:21:33 28° SSW 21:21:33 28° SSW  NanoSail-D  4.2 21:20:46 10° NNW 21:21:18 14° NNW 21:21:18 14° NNW  It could be unacknowledged military surveillance craft flying in formation for stereo photos, or some unacknowledged craft in the atmosphere, but the way they changed orientation after being in perfect formation pretty much rules out conventional satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tis a mystery,<n>

I pulled over because I needed to vomit. My car was facing south. I was leaning out of my car when out of the corner of my eye I saw 8 green lights hovering over a house to the south of me. I turned off the lights on my car to watch the lights to find out what they were.  It was a large flat craft that appeared to be almost half the size of the mile wide field.It starting moving very slowly towards the northwest. It looked to be 40 or fifty ft off the ground. I rolled down my windows to see if I could hear anything but it was silent. I watched the craft makes its way towards the highway.  It started to fly over the highway.  A car drove underneath it. I backed up onto the road and starting driving towards it.  It picked up speed and disappeared into the distance.  I went home and called the national ufo reporting hotline who referred me to this website.<n>

With binoculars it appeared to be oval in shape, with green and red flashing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interior of the oval looked like it was charged with white electrical currents.  Other than it sort of vibrating and a bit of shape shifting movements, it appeared to be stationary, but it may have moved a bit north over the 15 minutes we watched it.  When I got home I reported it by leaving a message on the non emergency police line. No pics.<n>

We had a small fire burning, and I was constantly looking up at the sky because it was completely clear and we could see many stars.  Both of us believe in alien life, but I am especially interested in UFOlogy and was hoping I would see a &#34;smoking gun&#34; UFO while I looked at the sky. My companion is skeptical regarding UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 45 minutes to an hour of looking up at the sky, I noticed some moving lights above and slightly to the north of us.  I saw a series of between 5-8 white-yellow lights around most of the craft and a single, slowly blinking red light at the back of the craft. Not seeing any strobes or FAA navigation lights or recognizing it as an aircraft, we walked further out onto the beach to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say the craft was about the size of a golf ball at arm&#39;s length, maybe slightly bigger.  At first I assumed it was a commercial jet taking off, but there isn&#39;t an airport nearby, and the lighting on the craft was abnormal.  I didn&#39;t hear any aircraft noise, but we were next to the waves, which were loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft looked arrow-shaped, with three white-yellow lights forming a triangle at the top, then at least one or two lights forming a narrower cylinder like a fuselage, and two more white-yellow lights extending like an arrow at the back of the craft.  The blinking red light (the only observable blinking light on the craft) was centered between the two back white-yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew overhead slightly toward the northwest, and looked like a stereotypical &#34;flying saucer&#34; with a row of lights when we viewed it from the side.  As it flew further out to sea, it arced around to eventually travel southwest.  I watched the blinking red light as it disappeared out of sight over the ocean southwest of us.  It definitely appeared to be heading out to sea instead of along the coastline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t consider this my &#34;smoking gun&#34; UFO because it didn&#39;t appear to defy any laws of physics as we know them, but my companion and I both agree that what we saw was abnormal.  When we later went inside I checked the flight records for the nearest airport that supports aircraft of that size, but there was no flight path anywhere near us this evening.<n>

My uncle and I had stopped to do a little fishing. After we baited up and and cast in.  I had happenend to look up in the sky to see a particular bright light in the sky. It was traveling at about half the speed of a shooting star, moving from west to east. My uncle and myself have both witnessed this.  Finding it peculiar, we both dismissed it, But in less then twenty seconds afterward we had seen a similiar light follow in the exact flight path of the previous one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now by this time we both admitted to each other that we had just witnessed something beyond our explaination.  After a moment of dumbfoundedness, we happened to witness yet again another light. This time traveling perpendicular to the flight patterns of the first two.  This one coming from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this, we both witnessed an intense increase in air traffic following these sightings.  We witnessed a &#34;scramble&#34; of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two from the south, two from north west, and two from the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes the air craft all turned and headed west.<n>

A completely clear night.   All the buildings within at least 5 blocks are 2 stories or less.  There were no trees or buildings obstructing my view.  At approximately 10 O‘clock in the sky at a 40 degree angle above me I observed an ember colored object appearing about ½ the size of a full moon which was slowly traveling East to West.  I watched it as it approached towards me and I turned the corner heading due west so I could follow the object.  It kept the same pace as me directly parallel and 12 O’clock above me heading west for about 90 seconds or a little more than ½ the length of the city block as I slowly walked while staring at it.  At that point it changed velocity.  The direction was then WSW and I watched it for another 30 seconds as I continued walking to the end of the block and it got smaller till it disappeared at about 2 O&#39;clock.  It reminded me of a hot ash from a campfire! just fizzling out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared spherical but with what looked like an orange flame flickering around it.  It looked like it was flying very steady except the “flame” made it appear to jump around a bit, kind of like a small lighter only the light was bright orange/red like a fireplace ember.  There was no discernible noise from the object.  There was sparse local car traffic in the area and I could hear people talking a block away outside the local bar.   There were people coming or going from a yoga studio on the block as I passed by.  There was a large passenger airliner that passed in front of and just under it heading in a SE direction towards the local major airport.  There was a small prop plane passing overhead at 90 degrees but I was not paying much attention to it so I don’t remember its direction.  The entire sighting lasted between 2 and 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was located in the Southern sky. The object emitted a tinsel/foil-colored flash, almost as if to catch attention.  The object was witnessed by 12 year old nephew and husband. When flash was over, there were no visible lights on craft.  This happened in BROAD DAYLIGHT! Husband was in Air force and worked at airports and initially thought the flash was the reflection from a plane turning… But it was not turning…  And there were no wings. Then he thought it could be a Citation plane because of the color, but a Citation, after turning, would look like a “T”…Not an oval.  The object hovered for about 3 minutes, and then proceeded to take off toward the south, faster than anything possible of known technology. The object just appeared to shrink away into nothing faster than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object may have emitted something that would calm an individual as nephew and husband carried on as if nothing happened, and muscles felt extremely relaxed. It was only after an hour that the two realized they saw something extraordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Husband is extremely skeptical and still will not say, &#34;Extraterrestrial&#34;, but he will say that he now has witnessed an intelligently-controlled vehicle going faster than the sound barrier without creating a sonic boom or a need to protect individuals inside from excessive g-forces...And can travel at what he estimated to be thousands of miles within seconds!  He is shaken that he and our nephew felt the extreme muscle relaxation and almost indifference right after the object took off, only to feel the significance of the situation an hour or so after.<n>

It was approximately 12:30 PM when I noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it, and it never seemed to go anywhere.  Even though we&#39;d driven for miles, I could still see it up there, and it appeared to stay the same size.  At one point, I thought it may have had another circle in the center of it...but it could have been my eyes playing tricks on me, since I was watching it for so long.  My husband pulled off the interstate, at a Dairy Queen in New Mexico, and when we were in the parking lot, I pointed at it and said to him, &#34;See...it&#39;s still up there!&#34;  He said maybe it was a weather balloon, but I told him I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d be able to see a weather balloon for that many miles.  When we came out of the Dairy Queen, it was still up there in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued on our trip, and I continued to watch the object.  We passed through to Texas, and it was still up there.  I&#39;m not sure where we were in Texas, but I&#39;d guess that maybe we were 30-40 miles into Texas (still on Interstate 40), when it finally started to get a grey mist around it, and it disappeared.  It was approximately 2:30 PM when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had watched it for at least 2 hours, and  we had to have driven at least a hundred miles while I was watching it.   I did get video of it on my cell phone...although it&#39;s not a lot.  I had a hard time seeing it through the viewer because of the glare from the sun, I moved the camera around trying to make sure I captured an image of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know how to put it on the computer though, and would  love for an expert to do some imaging on it, and see if they can zoom in on it and see what exactly it is that I saw!<n>

My friend saw something in the sky and made a joke about the area being a no fly zone so we all looked up to see what it was.  It was far away and we all saw very bright blue and red lights on the object. It was just hovering and then it quickly went down diagonally to the left then went right.  We thought that was odd and then it just slowly dropped straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes of waiting for it to come back up we gave up.  Me and my roommate went to walk to the gas station (also the direction of where it went down at) and the others went inside.  On our way back from the gas station we saw a disc shaped object overhead flying past us.  At first we didn&#39;t hear anything but later as it was way past, almost hard to still see it, we heard it loud and clear and it seemed as it was right above us although nothing was in the sky except the disc and it was far past us by then. We assumed it broke the sound barrier…  When we got back we met up with one of the other people that went inside earlier.  As we were sitting at the table again I was staring at the sky and our of nowhere I saw the first bright light flying object again.  I pointed it out to them and this time it was a lot closer.  It was extremely bright with alternating green blue and red lights.  Sometimes you could see all of the lights at once and sometimes they were all one color.  It had a very strange flight pattern and was just hovering for 5-10 minutes and going in strange directions.  Eventually it slowly went down again just like the first thing we saw. As we were watching it our friend was coming back from the library and we pointed it out to him and turned a non believer into a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got one low quality picture of it when it was far away. I tried taking a video of it but my phone (which was at 40%) died.  I got a short video where you can see a light hovering and you can slightly see change of color in the lights.  But after about fifteen seconds of hovering it started taking off going diagonally up and to the right and my phone died and said I needed to connect to power.  Eventually I plugged my phone in and the battery was instantly back to 41% (assuming that was just an odd coincidence but my phone has never done that before… weird)  We waited for about a half hour to see it again but we never saw it come back up.  There was absolutely no possible it was a plane or helicopter… we couldn&#39;t relate it to anything we saw before.  We were in awe.<n>

9/27/11 21:00|Eugene|OR|Circle|10 minutes|Five fiery lights/dark circular objects seen by young couple in Eugene, OR.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84187.html|65|ndxe201109| Five fiery lights/dark circular objects seen by young couple in Eugene, OR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 8:50 p.m. on a Tuesday night, Tuesday the 27th of September 2011, when my fiancé and I saw what looked like a ball of fire coming from the north, moving across the sky.  The night was mostly overcast with slightly orange tinted clouds, the wind was gently blowing from the north, and the temperature was about 60-65 degrees.  We were on our way to the store, walking up and around a nearby hill, in a mostly residential neighborhood, when it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first thought it was just a brightly lighted plain or helicopter, but then noticed that the light seemed fire-like, red-orange-yellow, and slightly flickering.  There was no sound coming from it.  The next thing we noticed, for both my fiancé and I were watching at this point, was that the fire/light seemed to be focusing towards the back of the craft, and then went out completely, about the time it passed over-head, though a little to the right from where we were standing.  And because the clouds were somewhat bright from the light pollution of the city, we both saw that, after the light had faded, there remained a small, dark, circular object.  At a distance it looked as small as a pupil, between an eighth and a quarter inch.  But there was no mistaking its flawless shape and its smooth edges. It was a perfect circle, black to my eyes, at least in the darkness.  Still silent, it continued on southward until we lost sight of it in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazed, and a little frightened, we asked each other some typical questions, just to make sure we were both seeing the same thing as it was happening. “Could you see it?   Did you see its shape?  I can’t believe this!”  Then, about 30 seconds later, from the same direction, another one appeared, as silent as the first.  It looked the same; fiery, moving southward, and its light also slowly receded towards the rear of the craft, and then went out, again, revealing a dark, round object beneath the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both observed that the light went out about the same moment as the first, almost directly overhead of us, but to the right.  But unlike the first craft, which held a seemingly straight course, and remained dark, this one turned left and right in small, quick and smooth movements, and relit; just a flicker in the rear, fiery like before, only faint and small.  Then, the small light that reappeared seemed to move around the edge of the craft, in either direction, but never in a ful! l circle.  (I found this particularly strange, because I assume that a round craft would most likely spin to stay in flight, but the small light that reappeared did not.)  The light then seemed to go out again as the ship went further away into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost as soon as we lost sight of the second craft, a third appeared.  Again, it came from the north and made its way south, looking just like the first two, and making no sound.  This one acted more like the second craft though, turning slightly, this way and that, and relighting after about 5-10 seconds of darkness, during which it was revealed as another round, dark object beneath the clouds.  The light that reappeared on this craft was small like the other, and also seemed to move around the edge of the dark circle it was attached to, but not in full circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the third was even out of sight, the fourth appeared, just as the others had, and acted much like the second and third.   Each one was completely silent, all moving at what looked like the same speed, and in the same direction, taking about 25 seconds to cross from one edge of the sky to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, there was no more to be seen for what felt like 2-3 minutes, and we continued on to the store, watching the sky behind us. We were heading west.  After about 2 or 3 more minutes, we reached the store and went in.  The clock in the store said that it was almost 9:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming out, we looked again towards the direction of the sighting, and saw the fifth and final craft. At this point we were surrounded by a bit more tree growth, and further away, so we didn’t get a good look.  But we saw that it was plainly another light of the same color, moving in the same direction, and its light also seemed to extinguish, though we couldn’t see if it came back or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the first time either of us had seen anything like this, and as soon as we got home we start searching for the right people to talk to.<n>

I am a stargazier, so I looked up, as I do every night. I saw to the southwest of me, two huge glowing amber, orange orbs. The orbs were very low, not much higher than trees.  I was so shocked. The orbs were the same size, the same width apart.  They were flying together like the were on the back of a craft. I could not see a craft.  The orbs went behind a tree and I ran to the end of my yard, and watched the orbs gain speed and height, until they were out if sight.  This sighting could not be mistaken for any manmade craft that we have. Their was no sound at all.  The orbs did not shine any light on the trees.  One other weird thing.  Every dog in the neighborhood was going crazy.  My dog was running around in circles, completely out of control. Later that night I found out that other people reported seeing the orbs also.  Their were several planes and hhelocopers.  Chasing after the orbs.<n>

As I was sitting in traffic I noticed a small dot of light in the distance north of the freeway. I initially thought it was a helicopter spotlight, but as I watched it, the light appeared to be changing directions and moving in a way that no helicopter or plane could move, that I have ever seen anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, it looked like the dot of light would drop down and move forward and backward, go up and down – it was so weird. I would have to estimate that the dot of light had to be roughly 10 or so miles in the distance north of the freeway near the hills. The dot itself was like a light blue/white color. I would watch it approximately in 30 second intervals as I moved forward in traffic, about 3 or 4 times. When I looked up again, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Several small planes were making approaches from the north to land at Metropolitan Airport, two miles to the southwest.  While watching these planes, I noticed something about three times higher in the air.  It was the shape of a lightbulb, if the aluminum-wrapped lower base section were cut off.  It glowed gold-ish lime green.  It was moving from east to west very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went indoors and got my binoculars and watched the object through them.  A few times, it left its east-west course and veered in a northerly direction.  Then, it would go west for awhile, then, veer south before continuing westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought this might be a Mylar balloon, but it did not look like one.  Also, they tend to be highly reflective.  This, instead, seemed to be glowing from within, a greenish gold color, not shiny or reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I wondered if it were a bundle of helium balloons, but with the binoculars, I could not see any irregularity in the shape, or space between balloons where they would separate from one another.  It looked like one cohesive whole.  Its shape did not change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was overhead, it began moving in a more distinctly northerly direction, still going westward.  From this angle, it looked as if it had a red elongated vertical light in the very center of it, the shape of a candle wick.  This “wick” looked as if it extended about 2/3 of the height of the object.  It still glowed greenish gold around this long red central “wick.”  Also, when it got to the west of me, I thought perhaps it would not appear to be glowing (if its appearance were a matter of simply reflecting sunlight), since I would be on the side of the object that sunlight was not striking.  This was not the case, however, and the object did appear to be emitting the greenish gold color on the east side (away from the sun) as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for about 25 minutes.  There was quite a bit of air traffic to Metropolitan Airport (2 miles southwest) and to Denver International Airport, much further east.  The object was in fairly close proximity to two aircraft, so I am wondering if a pilot reported seeing it and could identify what it was.<n>

The FUO may stand still in the sky for a few moments (10-20 seconds), then rapidly dart erratically in any direction, very much like a humming bird or butterfly.  The flight of the FUO is extremely fast….a split second to cover a fair distance.  Judging from its motion and speed, I don’t think that it is an airplane, helicopter or balloon.  I have no binoculars or telescope to verify the exact nature of the object, only my natural vision.  On cloudy nights the object cannot be seen.  WHAT IS IT?

Because I live in the country, there are few lights outside.  These, however, were extremely bright and appeared to be spinning in a random pattern.  There were three lights that were all the same, but in different areas.  They were very close to the tree line, if not in it.  At that time, they were across the river from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched to see if they could be part of something else, but one of them started to rise up in the air.  At first, I wasn&#39;t sure if I could believe my eyes, but it kept going up, then started to come towards my house across the river.  It moved in a 90 degree angle, straight up, then straight out and appeared to do so very smoothly, almost like being on a  conveyer belt.  I lost track of the other two lights when the one started moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I grabbed my cell phone to try to video it, but was afraid that it was somehow aware of me, as it was coming straight toward my house.  Because I was nervous I held my phone at my stomach and tried to guess to where to find it to film it.  Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and not the smartest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I did, for about 1-2 full minutes watch the aircraft.  It came across the river and right over my garage which is directly outside my window.  My window was already up.  I had a fan running on a table below the window.  The fan is not loud, but the aircraft was so quiet that I turned off the fan to try to hear it, even as it was right in front of me.  I could barely hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was a huge triangular aircraft that was just cruising along.  I can&#39;t believe how big it was, how quiet it was, and how slow it was moving.  It had huge round lights underneath.  I could not see the top when it went by, and as it was coming toward me it was dark outside so I cannot say for sure, but it almost appeared to be just a solid triangular mass.  The bottom for sure, and the sides were clear to see.  I was probably no more than 30 feet from it.  I was stunned and didn&#39;t chase after it outside, but I wish I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she has reported the sighting quite accurately.  PD))<n>

It was approx. 15-20 ft above our 2 story roof and there were 2 bright, white, round, lights on the bottom in a row one in the front almost like headlights as well as one on each side but none on the back other than the on on the bottom in the rear. there were also 2 very small red lights on the right and left side and had what liiked like a fin or something attached o the craft&#39;s side which almost had me beliving it could have been a plane for a split second before realizing those were not the lights of any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.  There was also almost a haze of fogg around the craft, it was very cloudy skies but the ! craft was too low I think for the clouds to cause it.<n>

Two rear white lights, one green light<n> <n><n> <n><n> While heading northwest on East Maine Rd., 2.2 miles from the junction with Rte. 26 in Maine, I spotted a set of lights to the west, just above the tree line, and pulled over to take a better look.  With the lights on my vehicle off, as well as the engine no longer running, I could observe it better. The object was hovering about 25 feet off of the top of a large, long distance power line tower. Few clouds were in the distance, but the immediate sky above and around my location was clear, and sunset occurred at 6:54 that evening, approximately 20 minutes before first spotting the object, leaving residual light in the sky. I stood across the road from my vehicle, on the side closest to the object, and watched it hover for a little over 3 minutes. The object never moved, never made a noise, and it never disturbed any surrounding treetops or power lines, suspended less than 30 feet away. The triangle was isosceles, with a single white light at each of the two cl! osest vertices, and a slightly dimmer green light at the third. It was not a very large object, no more than 30 feet long from the tip with the green light to the flat side between the 2 white lights, and no more than 20 feet wide from white light to white light. After watching it for just over 3 minutes, before I could approach the base of the power line tower it was hovering above, it very slowly, and still with absolutely no noise, began traveling East. It picked of speed gradually from it’s hovering position to a rapid rate of speed just out of sight above the trees, a distance of a quarter mile. I stood on the side of the road, watching the direction where it had gone, for about 5 minutes before returning to my vehicle and continuing on to Rte. 26. After telling a close friend what I had seen, he recounted an event in 1977 where he spotted a similar object. It was a clear night about 2:00 am in Binghamton, NY. The object was identical in appearance, made no noise when ! moving, and hovered motionless over his home for several minut! es.<n>

I walked out on the front steps of our mobile home while holding her.  I then did a 360 degree turn to see if we could find the moon.  We saw nothing, not even stars.  As I faced my front door again (due SE) a blink in the sky caught my eye and I looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first there was only a white light that I assumed was a star.  Then I saw several red lights flash in a circle around the white light in sequence.  Within maybe 2-3 seconds between 7 and 11 more white lights reappeared and disappeared randomly on and off for at least 7 minutes.  Whilst that was going on, I focused once more on the initial (and significantly brighter) white light.  It started jerking in different directions ( not very far at all in any one direction) then randomly moving smoothly in another direction. Occasionally it would seem to &#34;throw off sparks&#34; in different directions or have a tail (like a comet but much shorter).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While all of this is going on my daughter says &#34;Mommy, see stars?&#34; and points at all of them. At this point the large grouping of lights fade out one by one in no specific order. She says &#34;Stars go bye-bye?&#34; I replied, &#34;Yes baby.&#34; At this point I know damn good and well we are not witnessing any natural bodies, nor are we looking at known military aircraft as I held a top-secret security status in the USAF. I look at the main light and now it seems to be getting closer then farther away growing larger and brighter as it gets closer and dimmer and smaller as it gets farther away, sometimes blinking out completely. It is still moving in many different directions at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed on the phone with my husband the entire time we were outside, describing every detail to him wondering his opinion since he was in the US Army and just recently got out. I started to get nervous so I took my daughter inside and we decided to look out the back door and see if we could see the moon but the sky was empty again. I then tucked her in her bed. My husband and I were curious as to whether they would come back so I stepped back onto the front steps and looked in the same spot the main light had been and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I went to turn my head away I saw what looked like many tiny strobe lights going off then the larger white light slowly reappeared and seemed to get closer as it did so. (At this point I got off the phone with my husband.) It then seemed as though the larger light was throwing off sparks again. The &#34;strobes&#34; slowed down and occasionally flashed in different spots and different distances from the main light. The main light disappeared and reappeared probably 5 or 6 times the got the largest and brightest it had been during this whole show. It was perfectly still for several seconds, then seemed to draw a complete perfect circle, then sat still again for a couple seconds. It then started to slowly fade away and the &#34;strobes&#34; started to flash again but seemed even smaller before and now there were several red ones mixed in. They faded from site at precisely  the same exact second the large light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for several moment waiting to see if they would come back but they didn&#39;t, so I came back in the house. After thinking about it for a few moments I decided I needed to report this sighting.<n>

Maybe it was just a meteor but it was the largest light in the sky, other than the sun, the moon or fireworks, that I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sunday (9/25/11) at approximately 11:40 P.M.  I was out on my porch and I saw a large light move across the sky.  I only saw it for about 2 seconds before it disappeared behind some nearby trees.  I watched to see it reappear on the other side of the trees, and saw it for an instant through the trees, but before it could reappear there was a flash in the sky.  The flash wasn&#39;t overly dramatic, but easily discernable and originated behind the trees where the light had been.   I&#39;m assuming it exploded or burned up or something at that time because it never did reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Phillips, Maine and from my location the light, which was a yellowish white, was moving from north to south in the western sky.  I would guess that it was about 30 to 35 degrees up from the horizon - so not too high in the sky.  The size of the light was the thing that caught my eye. It was large, I would estimate that it was larger than 1/3 and smaller than 1/2 the diameter of the moon.  Another way to describe it would be if I were to draw on a piece of paper how big an average meteor looked I would draw something maybe 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.  Compared to that this light would be closer to a full inch.  There was no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported this in an email to Nasa and also to Linda Molton Howe.  I also called the local sheriff’s department and was told mine was the only report and that they would contact me if they ever discovered what it was that I saw.  It’s been almost two weeks now and I haven’t heard anything back from anyone.  I apologize for not getting this to NUFORC sooner but I didn’t think of it until I heard NUFORC mentioned on a recording of Coast to Coast that I was listening to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this info is helpful, and if the light wasn&#39;t part of UARS then I would really like to know what it was.<n>

I live in Oregon and you rarely can see stars due to the high level of polution, so I just looked up at the prettiness as we were walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the east side of the property is the tree line.  There are 2 tall firs, about 35 feet from each other.  I happened to look strait up at the sky then let my vision fall towards the east and between these 2 large trees.  That’s when I saw this bright light moving towards the east.  First thought, a plane.  But it wasn’t moving in a prefect strait line, I used the trees as my reference.  So I said to my friend look at that.  He did.  That’s when I noticed just to the north of the relative position another bright light not moving.  Then that object started to head perpendicular to the first.  They came together perfectly, did not increase in brightness and quickly appeared to head straight up to space and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I imagine that it is possible for unknown maneuvers to be done.  This appeared as a docking event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.  I’m not interested in fame or fortune and I am a Lutheran.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was lying there staring at my friends computer screen it had a screen saver that was hard to take my eyes off of when i have been awake the whole time my friend was sleeping beside me.  Then the werid notion that i was not the only one awake and that i have been hearing a faint sound of something for awhile but never really relized it was there and it has been there for awhile, and as soon as this idea came into my head i look towards my window that was on the right of me.  My friend had put up blankets to keep the sun out, so i could not see anything.  But the very second i mean (very) second i relized and looked towards the window i heard something shoot straight up into the sky and i &#34;can&#34; remember the sound and how fast it! took off.  It was like it knew when i relized it was there and it just took off. And as soon as it did my eyes also caught the computers screen and it froze the second that this thing took off.  Ufo was the only explanation i could think of.   Then i lyed there scared cause i knew that it was out there by me for awhile i never listened close enough to hear the sound. I started questioning why my window, why me?  And i couldnt explan so i just lyed there confused and frightened.  Soon i believe i might have heard some things talking to one another outside my window, I can remember the sounds they were making.  I was very freaked out at this point scared that i was going to come face to face with a thing or things.  I believe i started to cry and turned and woke up my friend in tears grabbing him and telling him there was something outside and i believe that were, aliens.  The minute i woke him up our power went out for about 30 secs to a min. which seemed forever since i was already! terrified.  He said he believed me but i really dont think he ! really understood the fact that those events took place and it was very real. I tried to report the sighting but did not go threw with it, the roomates kinda got me to blow it off. I did tell many people about it.  I am back in IA and i have met a few people that also believe they have seen or witnessed for themselves ufo&#39;s or aliens.  I just want to talk to an expert and tell them my story in real details. This really happened i need someone to actually care for once, what i say is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S sorry i sumitted my story a few times.. im a little tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was on the morning of the 26 which was a Sunday when we had awoken early as usual and were setting on the back patio having our cup of coffee waiting for the sun to rise.  It was about 30 minutes before sunup when I happened to look into the Northern sky and noticed a bright white round object flying directly towards us at a very high rate of speed heading directly over the base in a Southerly direction, I then stood up so I could could see over the roof and noticed that the object came to a sudden dead stop and hovered in the sky almost directly over the base,  it then reversed course and flew back North at a high rate of speed and it came to another dead stop in the Northern sky about 4 miles North of the base, it hovered there for about 20 seconds and then it started to glow very bright just like a ligh! t bulb does when it is ready to burn out, it then shot straight up and disappeared in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Once it flew past the tree the light went off and it appeared clear.  It moved on west  into the distance. After reviewing the photo no object was seen.<n>

A few seconds later I noticed an object moving from (my) left to (my) right about 5,000 feet up around fast moving stratocumulus clouds.  It had no sound and no lights.  The moon made it easy to see the object but it was sort of translucent like glass so it blended in with the night sky and the clouds pretty well. It was moving pretty fast but not too fast to miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped like an arrowhead so it was similar to a triangle but it looked more like this: &gt;   I then lost it in the clouds and by the time it would have exited the clouds, it would have been too far away to spot.<n>

On Saturday, September 24, 2011 we had family arrive in town for their vacation.  That night we all went down to Downtown Disney to shop, eat, and have a good time.  Our evening was cut short by one of the worst lightning storms I have ever seen.  I have only lived in Florida just over a year but I am accustomed to Florida’s storms and how fast they can come on, so we hustled our group back to our cars expecting a bad thunderstorm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our group consisted of me 35, my husband 40, my Aunt 56, 2 female cousins 32 and 28, my 2 daughters 12 and 8, my cousins’ children 17, 13, 10, 8, 5 &amp; 5. We divided this group of 13 between a minivan and my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we leave, and are safely in our vehicles, we see a bolt of lightning in the distance that was so strong and bright that my husband and I joke, &#34;That’s some War of the Worlds lightning!&#34; referring to the sci-fi moving about extra-terrestrials starring Tom Cruise.  It did not rain on us though, just more lightning and wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin, who was driving the minivan, with my Aunt, and a bunch of the kids, decides she will follow us because she does not know the way back to our place and it will be easier for her.  We take the Champion’s Gate exit and turn onto Ronald Reagan Pkwy, as we are at the first light we see something hovering low in the air that is disc shaped with a domed top and some sort of panel type lights that are white and sort of blink in a rapid, circular/rotational, succession around the dome giving the feeling of animated movement (think carnival lights, but bright and not colorful and of course large, that is the only thing I can think of for the movement).  This object was so low and bright, completely still and something to look at, I immediately thought that this was some sort of attraction which is typical in Central Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yell to my husband and kids, and my cousin, &#34;What is that? A blimp?!  What is that?!”&#34;  We are all looking and cannot believe our eyes!  This thing was hovering, not tethered and no one was around. It became clear this was not an attraction of any sort.  I felt like I was going to throw up. I could not believe what we were seeing!  Instead of taking a pic on my cell phone (I could kick myself now) I hurriedly call the cell phone of my cousin who was in the minivan immediately behind us at the light. I scream into the phone, &#34;Oh my god!  Do you see…&#34;  and before I can get it out my Aunt yells back, &#34;What is that?!  Oh my gosh!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are all in an uproar in both vehicles, staring in disbelief and trying to come to grips with what we are seeing.  The object slowly hovers a short distance as we continue to stare and try to make sense of what we are seeing and burn it into our memory, then ZOOM the object moves (to the southwest)away faster than I have ever seen anything move. We proceed through the light trying to keep it in our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can see by the band of lights (which windows immediately struck me, not sure why) that this thing banked hard like a saucer of in the distance, because the band of lights appeared diagonal in the sky.  Next thing we know it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep in mind that this all happened within the time span of a red traffic signal, seconds or a minute at most and the few seconds after that it remained in our line of sight.  I know this sounds unbelievable. We called my other cousin and her husband, who live only 3 miles from where we were and less than a quarter mile from my home, and told them what we saw.  We were all freaking out! She and her husband immediately go out and scan the skies and tell us they see nothing but a few helicopters or planes (I’m sorry I don’t remember which she said) with search lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove home, about 1/8th mile from the sighting 2 police or sheriffs cars were parked on the side of the street facing out towards the street (taking a break or talking, I thought).  We wondered if they had seen anything.   Every one of us including the littlest experienced this together. We talked about it the rest of the night and how we will never forget this.  However, how do you convince yourself what you saw was real?  I know what I saw and  it was amazing and unexplainable, yet my mind keeps telling me I am crazy and I keep asking everyone are you sure we actually saw that?  Of course I know we did. It was so close and too real to deny it.  This happened to us, and I don’t know why but I feel like maybe I have gone a little insane or that something is wrong with us all.  How can we believe our own eyes?   I must admit that I am surprised by this reaction in myself, because I always said that I believe in UFO sightings but when I see one with my own eyes I cannot believe it.  Please tell me I am not crazy! 13 people don’t just see the same unexplained thing!   I searched for any UFO sightings in FL on the internet that night.  Found nothing specific.  This is not a hoax and I am not a flaky person (neither is my family). I cannot tell you if anyone besides my family in our 2 separate cars saw this at that intersection.  All of ours eyes were upward and with all of the freaking out I must say that I was not looking at much else.  Plus my husband was driving, and as he proceeded through the light and on the rest of our trip home, we all still continued to watch the sky and talk excitedly so I didn’t pay much attention to our other surroundings.  I wish one of us would have taken a picture and I wish I would have noticed if there was anyone else at that light who could confirm this.  We were for lack of a better word, stupefied.  As I stated earlier, there were 2 police troopers out there but we did not pull over; who wants to be laughed at and thought to be an idiot?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded and capable.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  We have encouraged her to urge the other witnesses to submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>

Up ahead over the tree line I saw what looked like a falling star, only it was a blue ball falling towards the ground in a zig-zag motion.  It fell out of my sight.  I went around an &#34;S&#34; curve in the road and then was heading east again up the hill.  After I rounded the curve the object was again in my site, directly up ahead.  As I drove closer (less than a mile from where I initially saw it) I could see it more clearly.  I could see that it was moving slowly approximately 500-1000ft in the air.  As I got to the top of the hill near the intersection of Cliff Rd and 12th Ave. S, the object was very close, to the north and almost directly above me.  I slowed down (there were no other cars around), I rolled my window down to get a better look.  The object had a bright white light, and also a green and red light depending on which way it faced.  At the top! of the hill I turned left onto 12th Ave S. and could still see the object to the west of me, still very close, moving very slowly or possibly stationary.  About a minute later I arrived at work and got another coworker to come outside.  We both watched the object in the same location for several minutes before going back inside.  There is an Xcel Energy plant directly below where I believe the object was hovering.  The object was moving very slowly and occasionally in a hovering circular motion.  There was no sound detected.  A third co-worker also saw the object on his way in at the same time.  We went back out about 15 minutes later and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my full faced helmet on during this time and was using a Casio Exilm-10 (6 MP)camera which has a 3 inch display screen so I did not notice the objects at that time.  Upon reviewing the photos that evening, I noticed the main round object in the shot between the mountains and additional smaller objects within the photo.  Three are to the right of the main object by the tree and two or possibly three others to the left of the center object.  The picture was taken along Route 7 just south of Estes Park, Colorado.   The geographic area below the objects is Rocky Mountain National Park so there are no roads or human development in that area.  The picture looks west and was taken at approximately 14:45 hours on September 24th.  I have an additional photo of the same shot which was zoomed out further but the sky is over exposed due to the automatic exposure setting of the camera.  I w! ill submit only the photo I’m speaking of above in addition to this post.  If you want the 2nd shot which does not show the objects, let me know and I will submit that as well.  This photo has not been adjusted or manipulated in any way.<n>

I live in North Las Vegas, NV in Aliante.  The skies are mostly cloudy outside with a slight breeze. The lights were circular and green, but not bright.  The lights were light enough that they almost blended in with the clouds.  There was no beam of light attached to suggest that the lights were coming from the ground like from a searchlight.  They literally came down from the cloud, hovered, then went back up into the cloud and disappeared.  The lights all together formed an oval shape, but I couldn&#39;t see an object associated with them.  It was almost as though they were free floating.<n>

So I did, and I saw 2 bright objects. They looked circular in shape, and look like they were just sitting there in the sky, noy moving, not flying, not blinking nothing. Just one bright light and another bright light. At first they sort of resembled stars, but way brighter. So I looked around it was pretty bright out when these two lights were in the sky, and there were absolutely no stars in the sky. But I still thought maybe they were stars or planets maybe glowing in the sky from the sun. I eventually watched these two objects until the sun started to set. This is where I could determine if these two objects were. As I saw this I realized this was unique, a maybe once in a lifetime chance to see something like this. So I grab my cellphone for my camera because my actual came! ra is broken, and I took two pictures along with a video. As the sun set, the darkness started to take over and eventually the first light would just dim away, as would the second. That is how I knew they were not stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it disappeared to the east it started shining from the sun, i think it was polished metallic metal. It seem to be powered by some type of levitation because of the way it was moving, it seem to be floating because it was moving very slow. Ive never seen anything like this before.<n>

They were almost directly overhead when I noticed four more diamond shapes approaching from the direction the three had previously come.  These four shapes caught up with the other three, and together they all moved in unison in a south-westerly direction.  It was really something to see.  I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only one to notice them.  They were so close: 500-1,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is actually the 4th time in the past 10 years I’ve seen this same Phenomenon, and each time I’ve seen this particular object, it radiates a bright green light, and seems to move from 0-1,000 MPH in a mere second.  On this particular evening, it was hovering in the sky just miles away from an incoming passenger Aircraft (due to the fact that Sky Harbor Airport is only a few miles away). When I noticed it, it was completely stopped in mid-air.  As I watched it for a few more seconds, it started flying south bound, radiated a very bright green light in full motion, and as the green light increased in brightness, the object sped to an unbelievable speed and was completely out of sight in mere seconds.  This is in-fact the 4th time I’ve seen this Phenomenon in my lifetime! in Arizona, and I’m very convinced that these are legitimate encounters I’ve had with Extra-Terrestrial Technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like a chance to explain my other encounters, but I thought since this was my most recent encounter (being only last night), I thought this would be a very good place to start.<n>

This was around 10:30 PM, and the location is at Shelby Township, 21 and Van Dyke to be exact.  I look in the sky and all I see is 2 glowing orbs flashing two distinct colors, orange and blue. These had to be at least 30,000 feet in the air, and they were moving so abnormal that’s when I realized they cannot be of human origin.  There was no way, one was moving vertically up and down continuously, the other was moving horizontally very rapidly, that’s the best I can describe it, bottom line is they were moving in a way no modern aircraft can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regret not pulling out my phone and recording, but I was honestly in shock, I did not know what the hell I was looking at, it was something I had never seen before in my life.  They kept doing these abnormal maneuvers for about 15 seconds, then suddenly they started elevating to a higher elevation. All of the sudden they zipped across the sky going north is such indescribable speed, literally zoomed out of our view so fast that it only took about 3 seconds.  This is what really got me thinking, I am not a person who has been neither interested nor cared about UFO’s but those aircrafts or whatever did I see where not of mankind.  Man-made aircraft cannot conduct such maneuvers in such a closed area, or travel at such velocity that’s why I decided to report this, hopefully someone else saw this in the area to show that I’m not losing my mind.

That was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued scanning the clouds, looking in the direction where the blinking light had been headed, when a large dark triangle amongst the clouds came caught my attention.  The lines were just too straight to be clouds, and it was a muted gray in color.  The triangle had no lights, and it didn’t move.  I guess it was trying to blend in with the clouds.

These objects were very close to us and we could hear no noise.  They flew by us and ascended up into the clouds. Now there could be an explanation for these being military aircraft do pass by us from time to time.  But it doesn’t explain hearing no noise and the bright fiery amber look.  If they were a headlight from a plane you would think after passing us the lights would have dimmed, which they did not.  The only for sure way to know would be to contact the Air-force base in Minneapolis and find out if there were a number of military aircraft in the Maple Grove a! rea at 9:30pm on the 21st of Sept.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I watched  it while standing outside the back of the truck then it suddenly stoped moving I was facing east.so.it stopped in the east and began to emit strange white sparks I carrie alot of stuff in my truck so I grabbed a pair of small binoculars and took a closer  look it was a perfect sphere chrome, it was my best guess about 6 feet diameter.  it was emitting a spiral of wat looked like white smoke look like a  chemtrail but spiraling behind it also sparks were coming from behind it aswell..I watched  it do this for a couple.o minutes then it became more iridescent or pearl like ! I guess and then it unfolded like watching a popcorn kernel pop into a pop corn in slow motion and then it became a sheet transparent and flew directly over my truck at low alattitude it flew in a waving pattern and was gone in seconds....I haven&#39;t been the Same since .<n>

It was mostly clear so I thought it was Polaris at first.  It was to my north.  But I saw the star at its usual position, 5-6 points up on the horizon and this was moving eastward less than 15 degrees southerly off due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped along with another car at 23rd St and US 23.  They were an older couple that said they first saw the light at the Boyd/Greenup County line.  It started above the hills across the river in Ohio and traveled in a straight line to the plant that provides coke for the AK Steel Mill.  It paused for less than 45 seconds then shot northerly at an incredible rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it stopped it had to be less then 300 yards away over the Ohio River and I got a good look at its pulsating violet/white light.

At first I thought it was a plane on fire that was crashing but then it started disapearing just as another line started forming in the opposite direction.  I noticed that the 2nd line looked more like a bunch of orange circle lights that were connecting and as soon as it would get about 5 to 7 circles in length long it started disapearing 1 circle at a time.  Then a third line started forming in yet another direction all of which seemed to start from close to the same spot but going off in different directions.  The last circle or 2 was a little bit off kilter so it didn&#39;t form an exactly straight line towards the end then it also followed suit and systematically started disapearing.  They all appeared to be near yet higher than a close by radio tower with a red light.  By the time the second light had started I called my husband on my cell and when he! looked out the window they were all gone &amp; didn&#39;t reappear.  I called my local police dept. about half an hour later to see if anyone else called in about it and he said no but there was a helicopter that had landed at the hospital (which is not near where I saw the lights).  There was no way this was a helicopter.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Where he lives there are a woods right in his back yard. So as I was less than a half mile away, I could see the trees that extended into his yard. I came to the last turn I needed to make and just happened to look up above the tree line. There was 15-20 reddish orange balls of light moving from south to north in a line, not a straight line but they were grouped together in a somewhat jagged line. They were all about as big as my nail on my pinky finger held out at arms length. They were all moving at the same slow but steady speed. I immediately called my friend whose house I was going to, I could see his house from where I was so I told him to get out in his front yard and look at this. As I was on the phone, a woman from another house came out, probably because she heard me yelling about it on the phone with my friend as I was very excite! d to see this. She immediately got on her phone as well and watched the strange objects. It was not but a minute later that these objects disappeared into the tree line and never came out. Two of my friends, including the one I called, seen exactly as I saw. I heard no specific sounds coming from them, but they did look close enough that they should be making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After staring at them for a few minutes, he opened the door and called myself and my cousin out to view said lights. As my cousin and I came out to view the object, a third light began to appear intermittently. We continued to stare for almost 45 minutes, only going back inside to quickly search for a number to call to report, for a video camera, and for our phones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, we called my aunt who was able to see it, a just under five miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon calling the UFO Reporting Center, we quickly received a call back directing us to contact our local news.  As my uncle and cousin attempted to contact somebody, I quickly ducked out to my garage to locate my telescope.  When I returned, my uncle informed me that one of the lights seemed to drop from the sky, at which time a new and different light began to appear to the right of the bottom light, with the same third light still blinking. Almost immediately after the light appeared to fall, the object began to sway back and forth, while dipping rapidly with low buzzing noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my uncle and I tried to use a flashlight as a backlight for my telescope to work, it seemed to stop working when pointed toward the object in the sky, yet it still worked when pointed in all other directions.  All cell phone cameras and my digital camcorder were also unable to pick up the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we finally gave up staring for the night, the object seemed to be standing still again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living in an area with a typically busy airspace, and having been here for over ten years, I feel quite confident in saying that this is definitely not one of the airplanes or helicopters that we are used to seeing over our house at night.<n>

The obvious red and blue flickering was noticeable compared to all the other stars.  At first we assumed it must be a plane transiting west to east.  After ten minutes of observation we determined the object appeared to be celestial, not sky based, as it appeared to be setting.  We obtained a mediun powered optic and upon mounting the optic on tripod, we saw the object more clearly.  It was a ring of light, with smaller colors of blue and red, seemingly spinning.  We had never seen anything like it, and immediately called an astronomer associate and asked him if he could locate the object. His location is approximately 12 miles northwest of us, and we assumed he would immediately locate the object and view it with greater magnification.  he could not locate it, leaving us to deduce! the object was not clestial, and must have been sky-based.  This was one of the most remarkable experiences either one of us has ever experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, as I proceeded up the highway, I noticed that the object had decended dramatically and was actually just above tree top level.  I though - what is wrong with this plane - why is it so low? Then, it stopped in mid air and just sat there. It was dark at the time - but it was not a helicopter. There were lights on what appeared to be the front, the middle and the back of whatever this was.There was also a haze or cloud like vapor around the object. No noise at all. There was no traffic coming in the opposite direction or behind me at the time. I had almost come to a complete stop looking at it. I then proceeded to drive and as I looked back - it was still there - not moving.<n>

I replied NO WAY, Airplanes don&#39;t turn like that they bank.. and they don&#39;t turn left and right and speed up and slow down, or have lights that bright, and besides, don&#39;t they blink? I really think We just saw a UFO. She laughed it off but I&#39;m pretty convinced it was something.. I&#39;m not saying little green men but I Am sure it wasn&#39;t an airplane or the space station... and not a star since we both say the same thing its not that we where getting dizzy looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to call the airport and ask if there was something wrong with a plane or something but that sounded stupid.... so I called 411 to see if there was anyplace to report this kind of thing and she suggested the police department and connected me... but I couldnt see it behind the couds and I wasnt about to tell a police officer I thought I saw a UFO. So i asked my girlfriend to look up on google who you call if you see an unidentified flying object and she got your hotline so i left a message this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean the whole experience probably was under 45 seconds.... It wasnt some long drawn out deal but it thought it might be important to tell somone I just wish i would have gotten it on video on my iphone, and still wish I had been able to talk to the airport and see if maybe some plane was flying manually in different directions or malfunctioning to explain the fluctuating speeds. Just thought I would tell SOMONE. So this is it I did and thats all I know and saw this morning.<n>
9/20/11 22:00|Moses Lake|WA|Light|1 hour plus|Bright light in night sky.  Had side to side, up and down and circular movement.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  ))|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84084.html|173|ndxe201109| I saw a black oval in the sky surrounded by a streaming light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was picking up my son from a baby sitter at around 3:20 am.  While i was waiting i looked up into the sky. I noticed a large stream of light drop at an left angle from where i was standing.  It was so unusual to me because it only started to shoot down halfway through the atmosphere, and the light was 10 times wider than any shooting star i&#39;ve ever witnessed.  As the object dropped closer toward me i began to panic and tried to open my car as quickly as possible to retrieve my phone which was completely dead. I did not attempt to turn on my car during the sighting for fear of attracting attention to myself although it seemed as if i were being pulled toward the object regardless.  I noticed as the object was dropping it had a tail behind it about 7-8 inches long but as it came closer to the surface the light seemed to collapse into it once it came close enough to drop lower than the treeline.  At the closest the object Seemed to be about 3-4 inches long and 2 wide so it looked like a huge black oval in the sky surrounded by a white light that looked the same color as clouds.  The white light showed through the center of the oval as well so it seemed like an object projected by light until it reached the tree line, then the light seemed to drop into the blackness and disappear all together. The other thing i remembered noticing was the lack of noise.  There was no sign the it ever hit the ground but i felt an overwhelming urgency to drive in the direction of where i had last seen it fall.  I felt as if it were less than 5 miles away, but i chose not to go because i needed to take my toddler home.  I have yet to get over the shock, and am still noticing unusual movement in the skies after 3 am.  I can try to send a drawing depicting what i saw, but i was never able to make out the object in full.  It did not seem to stop moving, and it feels like once it got close enough to see my mind wiped any other images than the black oval which in itself is amazing because i suppose it means the object was mo! ving faster than light itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I observed 4 green spheres(probably 20 feet in diameter) hovering over Bussy Break.  My unit went dead. My radio did not work.I observed the 4 spheres go up into the clouds and observed a flash of what appeared to be lightning and then they were gone.  Then my unit came back on except I had to start the engine again.  I told nobody of this. I thought this lasted for maybe 5 minutes.I found out that headquaters had been radioing me for 2 hours and were in the process of looking for me.  I advised them that I made a mistake and put a weak battery in my radio and it went dead.  I was not about to tell them what I saw.  I am a supervisor for crying out loud.  I don&#39;t know if theis was the exact date in September but I am sure of the time.<n>

It was not a rectangle but was like a wing with no tail or nose.  Like a butterfly wing shape but without the 3rd &amp; 4th wing   This appeared so fast.  It glided, but at an incredidble speed. It travelled straight across sky.  At the height i am guessing at would be towards upper atomosphere or satelite orbit height.  Size wise is hard.  From that distance it would have to be huge!  Satelites are dots, this had shape.  I would have to say that take mars in the night sky and place 8 to 10 side by side to roughly get its size for that distance.  But when you see satelite dots orbit the earth its self explainatory.  This shot straight across for 6 seconds which came from around the moon area flew over my head (area) and lost it in the clouds that were forming.  Having given guessed altitude, i could be wrong or right?  I did not pay enough attention to height.  It was silent so i figured it was higher than normal planes would fly.  Most amazing thing i have ever seen.<n>

When checking my surroundings for the ambulance to yield to it I saw a very large object (much, much larger than any airplane) with an upside down triangle light pattern fly from northeast to southwest in the general vicinity of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the NASA Glenn Research Center.  The object was only a few hundred feet from the ground and was out of my sight after roughly five seconds.<n>

At first it didn’t look like it was moving, as I kept driving north I tried to keep my eye on it, it was moving pretty fast though because by the time I got home which was about the equivalent of 2 city blocks it was already in the south end of the sky and appeared to be a little smaller than when I originally saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement it made was forward but in small increments up and then down, it never moved from side to side and it was way too large to be a plane, I would say it was about the size of a full moon quartered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got out of my car I immediately looked for it, at the same time I was getting out of my car my neighbors were getting into their car.  I brought it to their attention; I asked “what is that?” “Do you see that up there?”  I have seen the man only a few times as they just moved in a few weeks ago and I had never spoken to them before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they looked at me like if I was not all there, but then when they saw it also we were all in awe, and just watched it until it disappeared in the sky going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like nothing I have ever seen before and I had no doubt whatsoever this was a true UFO.  It was too large to be a plane and the movement was different. It didn’t have a haze around it nor did it have a “tail”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other strange lights in the sky, I was never really sure of what they were but they could always be explained away.  This one caught my eye because of the size and the color.  Very intense orange like a fire contained in a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say it left me feeling “invaded” somehow, not as safe as I had felt before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always believed we are not alone on this planet but I NEVER thought I would ever see something that would seal it for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it finally disappeared my neighbors thanked me for bringing it to their attention, I’m just glad I wasn’t the only one who saw it, I’m glad there were other witnesses.  I know no one would believe me if it was just me but the fact that there were 2 other people there and the fact that I didn’t know them prior, made me feel better about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n>

Objects were spherical in shape and stationary, not moving in either direction.  I went back in the house to get the phone to call a friend and one of the objects disappeared.  The other object sat in the sky for about 4 more minutes then slowly moved away.  The way it disappeared was odd though; the object turned right and slipped into a hole in the sky.  My cell phone didn&#39;t work at the time, so I could not take a picture.  As soon as I came inside my house, my phone turned back on.<n>

These lights, consisting of  red, green, blue, yellow, and white, were all compacted closely together with no visible spaces between them. These lights, consisting of about twenty to thirty in number, did not blink in any pattern but each seemed to be flashing on and off independently. This craft was very slowly rising in a west by north-west direction. I watched it for about five minutes. As I was almost convinced it was some kind of airplane the craft either suddenly turned off all of its lights or, without making any sudden or quick movement, vanished. There were no clouds that it could have escaped into. Since that incident I have spent several hours on the Internet researching any known aircraft that contains this same configuration of  lights and found nothing even remotely that the craft resembled. No sound could be heard from the craft. Even at the! hight the craft was an airplane at the same could have been heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called to my neighbor to come out and see them.  She noted they were moving really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they passed over and we lost sight of them they made no sound.  I live just north of Davis Monthan Air Force base so I wondered if they were testing somekind of silent jet.  My neighbor went back into her apartment upstairs from mine, but I remained outside.  Within a few minutes 3 more lights moveed quickly from the eastern sky toward the northwest section of the Catalina mountains before I lost sight of them.  Has anyone else reported this sighting?<n>

As we watched it we noticed it was actually moving, sort of hovering, very slowly. We observed it for up to two hours slowly making its way west. I mean it was inching forward. Every now and then a tiny red light flashed behind it. If I didn&#39;t know any better I&#39;d say it was a helicopter - we live under the flight path to our small, rural airport, but it moved so slowly and steadily that it didn&#39;t like a helicopter and we certainly didn&#39;t hear any helicopter sound. It was silent. After a few hours we went to sleep - it was till there. Would love to know what it was. We typically go for a quick soak every night and get used to seeing satellites and what not.

Right where it had taken off from we investigated the next mourning. They was a blueish, pool chalk looking dust on the ground in a huge circle. When we came back thru the area that afternoon it was as if the substance had never been there what-so-ever. The area is very mountainous.

My brother-in-law and I went outside to see what all the commotion was about and all the kids were pointing toward the mountain and the sky. As I looked in the direction of where they were pointing, I clearly saw a tiny, reddish/orangish, circular object slowly floating away from the half way point of the mountain and into the sky (with NO noise whatsoever). The object continued up until it hit about 1,500 feet (no way to really tell how high) and then nearly stopped and moved horizontal to the left about 200 feet. Then it STOPPED! And for about 4 seconds in twinkled almost like a star, and then POOF it was gone! STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST!!!  I then quizzed my son, 13 years old, about what he saw. He said that initially when he saw the light it was larger then when I saw it and it was ON the mountain&#39;s half way point, and in his words, &#34;Dad, I thought it was a campfire.&#34; He said, that the &#34;campfire&#34; just lifted off the mountain and started to float up. Again, STRANGE!  After we talked about it for about 30 minutes, my brother-in-law decided to call the police. They came to the home in about 15 minutes and we gave a full report...and they mentioned that no one else had called it in. It was funny because one of the officers was on his first day on the job!  To be clear, there are NO homes, structures, or any man made things at the half way point of this mountain...just pure mountain, and no trees...just shrub oak. There is no way that it was a plane, helicopter, balloon, model rocket, laser beam, etc...at least not by my observation. I don&#39;t believe in the traditional &#34;UFO&#34; concept, nor do I believe that creatures from other planets visit this earth in a &#34;UFO&#34; sort of way...but I have to admit, this was really weird, thus the post.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this object, please post something here so I don&#39;t think the twelve of us are going crazy! :-)<n>

She pulls into our driveway and watches these lights for a few minutes, not understanding what they could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She then runs into the house telling me to come outside.  As soon I get outside, I noticed 5 lights total, 4 red/orange lights forming a triangle, hovering and silent.  The 5th light was a separate object and moving just next to the triangular craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said 2 other objects flew off in the first few minutes before I got outside.  I think there were 4 craft total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess they were less than a mile away, to the southwest and approximately 500-2000 feet altitude.  If you held your hand up to the sky and made a V with your 2 fingers, that&#39;s about how big the triangular craft was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I noticed about the color of the lights is that technically they were not red/orange.  They were orange one second and red the next.  It would change between the 2 colors but I can see how people would just say reddish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife kept asking me over and over - &#34;Are these UFO&#39;s&#34; and after about 5 minutes, the 4 lights making up the triangular craft went into a bit a dance for about 2 seconds and formed into a single red and orange light now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there are 2 craft, 2 lights.  Before, it was 5 lights, 2 craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then both lights just started to move again and headed northwest.  In just another minute or 2 , they were gone.<n>

We drove up and parked our car on a hill and watched it for a good five minutes and it started drifting away. Our car was turned off completely and we were just watching it. When it drifts away we moved our car to see it and within less than a minute it moved again.  When it started moving more we went down route one and we saw it further in the distance. It seems to be headed toasted Boston.  Now when we had a clear view of it, it seemed to have a green glow and one large red light that kept flashing in the center.  There was air displacement that didn&#39;t seem to come from a gas engine.  Now I&#39;m not sure if this is man made or not or where it is now but this is what we saw.<n>

The sun had come up over the horizon and the sky was lit up with no clouds in that area of the sky.  Initially I thought the object looked too bright, to big, and oddly shaped to be any standard object found in the sky.  There were no other visible objects in the morning sky.  The object was approximately 30-40 arc-degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed a pair of binoculars to inspect further.  Using the binoculars I saw a tear dropped shaped object that was approximately 10-20 times the size of a planet when viewed through the same binoculars.  The tear drop was orientated with the largest part of the shape towards the zenith and the narrowest point of the shape towards the horizon.  The shape wasn’t a perfect tear drop.  Along right hand side from the mid-point to the bottom there was a slight inward notch on the form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a solid luminescent bluish white color with no interior features and fairly bright, possibly as bright as Venus maybe brighter.  Along the upper right edge of the shape the color was a little different being a very vibrant violet-blue in color, almost like light coming from a prism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for approximately 40 minutes in this state.  During that time it appeared to move a short distance through the sky as if it was in a fixed position (i.e. Earth’s rotation was moving it through the sky).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to rule out any planets being in the area so I went into the house to look up sky charts.  After looking at the star charts and ruling out the possibility of any planets being in that position I returned outside.  This was approximately 6:40am.  At that time the tear drop shaped object was gone and there were two other objects in that area.  My assumption is that the tear drop shaped object broke apart into these objects, but without seeing the transition I can’t say with certainty.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two new objects were approximately 3-4.5 arc-degrees apart from each other.  One was slightly below and to the left of the other.  The upper most object appeared to be a reddish orange object that changed shapes during the time that I observed.  It was approximately 1/5th the size of the original tear drop shaped object.  It brightness was significantly less than that of the tear dropped shaped object.  It kept changing shapes at one point it looked like Saturn with a ring around it, then it changed to a circle, then to half circle.  After that it appeared to rotate between circle, half circle, and an oval shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object appeared to be a cluster of small individual white orbs.  The orbs within the cluster moved around in a chaotic fashion.  Every once in a while an orb would shoot up towards the zenith from the cluster.  It would travel for about 10 seconds or so in a slow, straight, trajectory before it faded out.  I studied the orb cluster for several minutes watching this same activity repeat itself until the cluster could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then switched back to the reddish orange object.  I observed it for several more minutes.  It continued to cycle shapes, circular, oval, half circle, before I couldn’t see it anymore.  The event lasted till approximately 6:55am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent some time studying the daytime and nighttime sky, as an amateur astronomer.  My daytime profession is that of an engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn’t seem to move just hover in the same spot my husband called the Sheriffs Dept.  They went out to look and returned to say it was a hot air balloon and the morning sun was reflecting off it. But after watching it for about 40 min. we realized it was no hot air balloon.  It would have moved at least a little.  We tried to contact Fox news but it was too early to get anyone to check it out.  We finally gave up and went to bed when I woke it was gone.

It moved down and to the left and then back up, and then to the right. and then back to where it was and a airplane passed below the object and it stopped flickering and became still.  the object started moving again. an aircraft passed over the object and it did the same, but it was moving in between the passing of both airplanes. it is still in the sky and it is six eleven in the morning.  I am too tired to watch this but i have never seen anything like it before and i thought it was worth reporting.  the object kept acting like it wanted to move upward but it was also avoiding the exhaust from the airplanes.  I hope this helps somehow.  I am curious to what it was but i know that i have never seen anything like this be! fore and i look at the night sky on a regular basis. another interesting thing was that the treeline below seemed to light up on and off slower than lightning but close. but only as i was looking at the object. if i were to look at the tree line i would see nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 3 miles before the Macintosh exit we noticed a bright light just hovering over the road and off to the right of it.  As we got closer, we noticed there was no sound. And as we were almost under it we then noticed there were two other nights to it, making it a triangle shape.  Because I was driving I could no get a good look like they could.  So I turned on my flashers and pulled off of the road.   Once I did that.  And started getting out of my car to get a better look and a possible picture.  The “Lights” took off!

As I approached the city of Troy, I noticed a red pulsating (maybe &#34;flickering&#34; is a better word) light that appeared to be almost hovering over the interstate.  I first thought it was a light on a cell or other type of tower, but the closer I got I noticed it seemed to be moving slowly to the east.  I&#39;d estimate the altitude of the light to have been no more than a couple thousand feet as I drove under/by it.  There was no apparent noise associated with it, and I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a conventional aircraft or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recall, the weather that night/morning was fairly clear, with just enough haze to allow the red light to illuminate the haze around it with a dull red glow.  As I continued south, I continued to observe the light in my rearview mirrors until I eventually lost sight of it.  I&#39;m unsure if the light extinguished, if it left the area, or if I lost sight of it due to the terrain as I continued south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of my obersvation was probably 10-12 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a point to check the newspapers and TV news the next day in Dayton (about 20 south of Troy) to see if there was any mention of the light, but found none.  My thought was it was probably a Chinese lantern, but then I noticed the Sept 25 sighting in Dayton on the NUFORC data base that sounded almost exactly like what I&#39;d seen.<n>

They moved quickly, looked like strung up party lights, but the color was definitely different than an airplane.   There was a plane or chopper that pealed off from the yellow/orange lights and it was definitely a differnt color - much whiter.

There were about 6-9 lights, orange like the color of fire.  As we drove down the straight, they began to change from a rectangular formation to almost a candy cane formation, then to a &#34;V&#34; formation and began to move away from us.

There was some cloud cover and the lights appeared to be slowly heading north.  I attempted to use my IPod to photograph them but there was insufficient lighting.  The lights were low in the sky from my position and I had difficulty determining the distance. They gradually faded as if heading into the cloud cover.  There were no aircraft in the area.  Providence Airport is to the East of the sighting location.  The lights did not have green or white strobe lights as normal aircraft.

All of the sudden I saw three crafts in the sky flying together, with bright pulsating orange lights that seem to be flying in a zig zag pattern coming over some trees in the neiborhood and closer. When they got closer I realized that they were not airplaines and they were spinning thats why they seemed to be flying in a zig zag pattern, and then two more started coming over the tree line and I ran to get my boyfriend, and I was screaming &#34;OH MY GOD YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!!!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came out and was shocked thats when we were noticed that also they seemed to flying straight up at the same point in the sky and vanishing, instead of going straight out through the horizon.  Thats when my boyfriend decided to go grab his cell phone and try and get pictures if there was more, and boy was there,  They just kept coming.  I was counting them, and had some! point I reminded him that there was a video recorder on the phone.  On the photographs it just look liked orange sphere shaped specs, but to us we could see them clear as day.  On the video the craft seemed to be dancing around the sky and then vanishes.  At one point one of them was going a little slower than the other and it had like a diamond shape of lights under it.  The orange lights were so bright they kind of looked like flames. Later some regular planes came buy. I wondered if they had seen it too. I never believed in UFO&#39;s before untill last night. The experiance was life changing.<n>

It was nighttime.  There was no sound.  They were moving about the speed of a small plane.  One was leading and the other two were following and they were side by side.  The two in the back seemed to be very close to each other.  One of the orange bright lights in the back turned and went in the opposite direction.  The bright light started pulsating and then faded out.  The other one in the back started doing the same thing within a minute two (pulsating until the bright orange light faded out).  The one in the lead was very bright for a few more minutes and then it started pulsating and then faded out and we could no longer see any lights.<n>

They appeared very close and very bright.  It was very cloudy and you could not see a craft but the lights were so bright they shown through the clouds.  They were in a circle with two larger bright lights in the middle.  There were 5 smaller lights around the outside.  They were flashing.  At one point the  one light appeared to be moving in the eternity symbol position. I put my things in the car and grabed my cell phone.  By the time I aimed the cell phone it disappeared.  I have always been an extreme skeptic but this was real. I circled the neighborhood in about a mile radius to see if there were any advertisemnts that would use such high powered lights but found nothing.  It seemed to be about the size of half a football field, it is hard to judge. It was very large.  There was no sound at all.  The lights were white. I am still a skeptic but I cannot deny what my eyes s! aw.<n>

It immediately captured my interest because I thought it was flying extremely low.  I then considered a logical explanation; I thought it must be a helicopter?  However we don’t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it’s the law chasing somebody &amp; if that were the case, there would have been searchlights.  We are not close to the hospital district, downtown police helicopter landing strip, or airbases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered that maybe it was an airplane of some sort?  If it was, wouldn’t it be flashing?  In addition, don’t they have flashing white lights as well?   As it approached, I heard absolutely no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear; however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before.  The air was humid &amp; thick.  What I saw was moving at an extreme high rate of speed, faster than anything I&#39;ve seen.  I couldn’t take my eyes off it and I blinked a couple times, just in case my eyes were playing tricks on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path.  As it grew closer, I noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center.  This circle was not a sphere; it was more like a sheer curtain, flat, possibly a force field?  The circle was translucent &amp; it was glistening/shimmering opalecant colors (pink, blue, green crystal).  It was not twinkling like Christmas lights, no blink pattern at all, it was more iridescent like abalone shell, but again it was about 40% transparency.  There was also some sort of crystal beams or rays; I think 6, surrounding the opal circle.  They were shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. I simply couldn&#39;t take my eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized I had my Android mobile in my hand, so I hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get it started, by then; the object was straight above me. I tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, I just couldn&#39;t keep up.  I attempted 3 shots, about 8 seconds apart, unfortunately, I&#39;ve no flash &amp; the lens was on the full zoom out level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then was out of my view as it flew over the building.  I ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, I got to ground level and out of the breezeway.  However, my view was then blocked by the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I should have run to the street, but I didn&#39;t think of it, I was so amazed!  The event lasted about two minute’s total.  I felt no fear of the object; I know they didn’t notice me.  I gave up &amp; went upstairs &amp; into the apartment.  I looked to see what I might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness.  I went to sleep.  I woke up at 10am &amp; the first thing that went through my mind was the event.  I plan to upload the photos onto my computer &amp; see if I can find anything by resizing them.  I have started a drawing of the object in Adobe Photoshop.  To my knowledge, no one else witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will send a drawing of what I saw in a future report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lat: 32.65, Long: -97.40 (this is the info from the camera)<n>

Triangulation by means of google earth and their relative position to me while traveling put their position above the petrochemical harbor and storage facilities south of the pandan loop reservoir.

At that point my girlfriend was able to look up and see the same thing.  Then we saw it dip behind the mountains of Blue Diamond where we saw a puff of smoke from the impact.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have an off road vehicle so we never found the actual impact site.  We couldn&#39;t see the objects center around the bright lights.  But the object looked pretty big compared to the mountain range.  Which is weird considering the laws of physics would indicate a bigger impact than what we saw.<n>

About 45 degrees off of vertical, a glowing golden ball with rays coming off of it like a diamond glinting in the sun appears and begins to fly/hover straight up at a slow pace.  Shortly thereafter, a second golden ball appeared where the first one did, and it looked exactly the same as the first one. It flew down and kind of &#34;fishhooked&#34; up, then accelerated to make a pilot/wingman formation with the first gold ball (who had risen quite a bit by now).   After catching up to he first ball, both balls curved slowly toward the west and then faded out completely, in a pilot/wingman echelon formation.  They covered about 10 degrees of sky and the whole thing<n>

Warning lights came on for the tire monitor, traction control, air bag, and emission system.

I called a friend that lives almost 20 miles away and he and his girl could see the same thing, flashing every 10 seconds. to me it looked as if the light was curving.. so from what i saw it was making a half circle. my friend that i called said it looked as if it was coming straight twords him. while this was happening we saw a bright light ( brighter than anything else in the sky) that looked to be a plane.. yet it was bigger... it moved from the tree line ( miles away) up twords the green flashing light.. and i watched it move from one spot in the sky to another in a second. i&#39;ve watched air planes my hole life, and this thing moved fast it moved an area on the window i was looking out of of about 5 inchs in 1 second.. then slowed down to an almost normal speed. as i was w! atching this i told my girl friend to come look, and our friend that lives 20 miles away called and asked if i just saw the light move across the sky fast as shit. as i was telling him what i saw and confirmed we are looking at the same thing..  it just vanished.  gone and we never saw it again.. the flashing green light went on for a while.. and when we looked back around 10 ish to see if it was there still it was gone, BUT there were now numerous  human aircraft flying in the general area of the flashing light. we could tell the human craft from the unknown light because of the landing lights the human craft have.<n>

I began to stair at it too.  I staired at the fire like light for a few minutes it was moming so slow I couldnt tell if it was moving or I was just looking to hard.  I felt weird standing out in the open staring at the sky so I went in the gym and continued my work out.  I was pretty sure the news would let everyone know what it was but there does not seem to be any other report?  Now I&#39;m really curious?<n>

I asked my girlfriend, &#34;What is that?&#34;  We both stared at the red light for about 15-20 seconds trying to make sense of what we are seeing. I glanced back at my girlfriend to question the sighting as possibly a helicopter when it moved slowly east for 2-4 seconds.  It slightly flickered as if it was pulsing and disappeared into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light source was bright red and unnaturally large to be a star or planet.  Since living in the city, the light pollution tends to overpower most stars/planets, this one seemed to dominate the night sky.  I would approximate its distance at 500-700 feet in the air. No audible sound was heard.<n>

My mother saw the light briefly but was driving, and had to watch the road.  From the passenger side I watched the light slowly move across the sky, in a straight line trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lime green light slowly turned light blue in color.  In the middle of the now blue glowing light, a small pinpoint of red illuminated inside of it. A few seconds after the red appeared inside the blue glow it slowly shrank before fading away into itself.  The sighting only lasted about fifteen to twenty seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed it stopped and the tendrils changed shape...I know this will sound crazy but each tendril became a representation of the star ship Enterprise one large and one a third of the size of the right side.  These keep this shape a while and then they became a rectangle with  a sphere on top as it moved away it twisted and disappeared all the while the dark grey cloud remained stationary.  I notice a darker grey disc in the center that went horizontal and  the cloud started to shimmer that when I notice it was a saucer shape and in seconds the entire cloud disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I took my dogs out for their nightly walk.  Noticed a nice full moon, (I was viewing East of me) and saw “airplane” lights down to the left side of the moon,…took a double look to watch it fly in, but it didn’t move any closer.  There wasn’t any sound either so I thought it must be an unusually bright North Star night.  But it seemed too bright to be the North Star so I continued to look harder at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn’t sure if I was seeing one or two lights at that point.  Although my camera isn’t the best, I figured I’d try to get a picture “just in case” it really was a UFO.  Tried to get it on my cell phone but I’m not sure if I captured it.  Then I got three pictures on my still camera.  Came in the house and uploaded only to see squiggle lights.  I had it on 10x zoom without a steady hand.  I ran and grabbed my tripod and took more pictures using the 2 second delay to avoid shake.  Assuming this camera wouldn’t have the ability to capture anything anyway, doubled with the fact that mosquitoes were feasting upon me, I couldn’t stay out there.  Instead I amused myself by uploading the pictures anyway.  Nothing but blur until the last two shots.  When I zoom in on the picture using the picture viewer zoom, I wasn’t really expecting to see anything different but there appears to be a difference..?  This time there is a red ring on the light. I’m wondering if someone else could use a better zoom to check it.  not that it would likely matter anyway, but I’m following through.  It is now 12:14 am and I’m going to go see if it is still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, it is still there so it must be the North Star and some optical illusion occurred on the picture?  Should I forward you the picture anyway?<n>

Well, anyway watching the yankee game vs. Mariners on Sept 14, 2011 started at 10:00, after a while I decided to step outside to go to the outside bathroom and coming out of the bathroom I notice these strange orange lights glaring, just moving from one side to the other, at that point I called my wife and freind to come see and they also were amazed at what they had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights came and vanished I even took a quick video of it, but because it was night time you can only see the lights kinda, but im telling you what ever it was it was no weather balloon.<n>

This strange &#39;manta ray&#39; shaped craft appeared and just flew gracefully through the sky, from the North East to the South West.  I call it a manta ray shaped craft while it honestly looked like a manta ray was just soaring through the sky.  It was so peaceful, it glowed a faint pink and blue. Imagine the changing colors of the fish of the deep, it was exactly like those colors, and exactly like the pulsating motion.  The wings of the ship slightly appeared to be moving, and it left a faint light trail (Which we actually believed was just an illusion, while it traveled so fast). It was unbelievable, we couldn&#39;t believe how much it looked like a manta ray. It just soared so gracefully through the sky for a good 4 seconds.  It appeared to be far up in the atmosphere, based on its faint color, but it also seemed so huge.  We thought we were cra! zy at first, until we realized that we saw the same thing... we are just two college kids, no drugs were in our system... and we saw something in the sky that night, which still haunts us in a very mystical way today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was also listening to a scanner radio, as I had seen a USAF C-17 from March ARB circling overhead and was trying to pick up radio comms from March field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2030 hours I heard a dispatcher from the Riverside County Sheriff&#39;s Dept. calling their helicopter to investigate a report of a downed aircraft in the Lake Elsinore area. The dispatcher told the pilot that a motorist on the freeway had seen an orange object, apparently on fire and leaving a trail of fire, pass over their vehicle and crash behind a ridge, where it was now starting a brush fire, as the sky was starting to glow orange.  A ground unit was also sent to check the area. The pilot acknowledged and reported a 7 minute ETA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On arrival, the pilot checked the area and reported to dispatch that he could not locate any object or fire.  He added that he had used FLIR as well, and that he was not NVG equipped, and requested furt! her information. The dispatcher advised that there was a helicopter reported overdue from Hawthorne airport, but no other information.  She added that dispatch was receiving numerous reports of “meteors” in the same area as the alleged crash. The pilot and ground unit both reported that they could find no signs of a crash or fire and cleared the call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this in case you receive any reports from the Lake Elsinore area for this time frame.  I did not observe any meteor s while I was watching the sky that evening, and I was facing south towards the area of the reports.  The sky was fairly clear with a few high clouds.  There was thunderstorm activity to the northeast over the desert areas.<n>

Hood just after dusk, I myself notice what appeared to be 2 stars, bluish in color, about the same magnitude as one of the stars in orions belt moving in unison to eachother (one slightly higher in altitude than the other) from north to south. Also, as they moved south they also were climbing in altitude, so from my perspective they were traveling upward diagnally.. Keeping the same distance apart from eachother.  These lights were solid points of light.  I&#39;m an avid amature astronomer and right away I knew it was unusual so I told my girlfriend and my other good friend to look at what I was seeing.  We watched these lights ascend diagnally to the south for another 10 seconds and then these lights simultaneously faded out gradually until no longer visible. Again, they were blue solid points of light climbing diagnally one just above the other. These started about 20 degrees off the horison and ended at about 40 degr! ees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Stars were visible but there were a few wispy clouds here and there. I saw a very brief, bright green, distorted glow in the little bit of clouds that were in the sky that sort of reminded me of the northern lights. It went away after about 1 second. I brought the weird glow up to my mom immediately thereafter and that&#39;s when she stood up and faced south when all of the sudden not 5 seconds after the glow, it looked like a bright green comet shot out of the sky. It was traveling extremely fast and was extremely bright. It left a green trail and as it went on the trail became choppy like it was leaving bits of energy behind, but would quickly disappear. I would not be surprised if we weren&#39;t the only people that saw this. Anybody driving on the highway nearby would have surely seen it as well!<n>

I was driving parallel to and about 1 mile West of the runway at Henderson Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I am a pilot I always tend to scan the sky for aircraft.  I observed what appeared to be a small aircraft landing light moving from West to East and descending at about a 10 degree angle.  This made perfect sense since it was consistent with a small aircraft on a left base to Runway 35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time it was only a small bright white light.  I then noticed that it was traveling at a greater speed than a small aircraft normally would in the traffic pattern.  My thought was that it was a hotshot pilot in a high performance aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after I had that thought the white light grew to about 5 times it’s original size and turned a beautiful shade of green and yellow with a long tail of light trailing behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still descending at a 10 degree angle.  It then disappeared behind some foothills that are located about 5 miles South of the airport.  It was then apparent to me that I was a much greater distance from the light than I had originally thought.<n>

And they were in a panic. I asked if they thought it could be a meteor and they said no, it was moving too slow.  We didn&#39;t take the report too seriously until one of our deputies being dispatched to the area said he saw it too.  All of them said it was &#34;green&#34;.  Although the deputies could find nothing in the area, obviously something was in the sky!  Our main concern was a possible aircraft down, but again, nothing was found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please do not publish my name as my employer might not be too pleased, and since this is a very small town, it would not be too hard to figure out who reported it!<n>

It is quiet and fairly light-free in this semi-rural area in Arizona.  Looking towards the West, I see very low on the horizon three amber/yellow lights in a triangle formation.  One was on top, and the other two were below.  The angle was extreme in that the triangle was wide, with the top light not being too far above the bottom two lights.  Their motion was mostly in unison, but some fluttering appeared, showing that they were not attached in any way it seemed.  The lights stayed exactly where they were, not lessening in brightness nor changing color.  After about 10 seconds they appeared to be getting larger, and I assumed this meant they were moving closer. There was a very very slight up + down movement to the lights which could be described as a slight jolting.  And as I was staring at this, they disappeared before my eyes!  Gone.  No afterglow, no sign of them at all.  I moved! all around the area to see if I could see them, but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and texted a friend in NYC, saying &#34;I think I just saw a UFO&#34;.  He texted back, &#34;Don&#39;t go into the light...&#34; as a joke.  I returned, &#34;There were three lights.  Which to go into?&#34;.  The time of these texts and the texts themselves are retrievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have a TV, so found out the next morning at work that a &#34;meteor&#34; sighting was reported across the southwest.

I have never claimed to have seen a UFO in my life, nor have I ever thought I have.  These lights seemed...purposeful.  They never &#39;fell&#39; down, they never diverted from the triangle formation, and they remained at the same elevation (from my angle of view) and then just disappeared.  There was no waning of light, or a slow burnout of the colors, nor a downward motion - just Poof! gone.<n>

She arrived around 8:00pm.  Soon after her arrival my boyfriend went to bed, because he has to get up at 4:30 am for work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I stayed up chatting away about the latest news.  I fixed her a dinner plate of fried chicken and real mash potatoes with gravy.  As the evening went on my daughter got real tried and wanted to sleep.  I on the other hand, I was wide-awake from the excitement of her visit and not ready to go to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 11:30pm my daughter insisted I go to sleep and stop talking.  She had worked a full day at work and the train conductor gave her a bad time on the train about her bike.  Since I live in a one-bedroom apartment and my boyfriend was already asleep in the bedroom and my daughter was trying to sleep on the couch in the living room I went outside on my front patio to wine down a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The apartment complex where I live was real quite.  The night air was clean smelling and a bit crisp and refreshing.  I sat outside and my patio table with my little dog and cat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon was almost full if not full and there was a bright star near the moon.  Actually the moon and the star were the only two objects I saw in the sky.  I did not see any other stars and admired that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat at the patio table looking up I saw a bright round light come out from behind the moon and speed down fast toward the bright star in a matter of a few seconds (1 one thousand 2 one thousand and a half).  This bright round light stopped exactly halfway between the moon and the star.  It stayed there for about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it shot out from behind the moon to its position it was fast.  I could not believe anything could move so fast.  And when it stayed between the moon and the star for about five minutes I thought whatever it is, is surely trying to look like a star.  I knew it was not a star; because, when I first looked up at the moon and star it was not there and secondly, I saw it move fast from behind the moon to its present position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat there I watched it for about five minutes.  There was no way I was going to take my eyes off of it.  I was amazed.  I knew I was seeing an unexplained phenomenon, and it was amazing, and beyond understand. Still at the same time, I did understand what I was watching and knew there was nothing from earth that could move that fast.  And just as all these thought race threw my thoughts and my eyes fixed on the object it moved fast again toward earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, like the first time it moved real fast toward the earth.  In about two to three seconds it was close to the earth and went behind my building in the sky and I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just sat there going W0W!  I surely saw something-something.  Who would believe me? Who could I tell?  I didn’t want to wake anyone up, so I went about the evening focusing on my dog and cat that were sitting outside with me.  A few minutes later I decided to look up at the moon and star again, because, despite what I just saw the moon and star were magnificent in themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then from behind my apartment building the bight round light speeded across the sky in a liner fashion. WOW, I thought here we go again.  The bright light speeded across the sky as it had done before and stopped again. This time it was located under the moon closer to earth.  And again it remained there for sometime, about three minutes. And again I thought it was trying to appear like a star.  Just like the first time I knew it was not a star; because it was not there before and I saw it speed across the sky and stop at its present location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thoughts raced again for the second time.  Again I thought that the bright light was doing a real good job as acting like a star but wasn’t.  Its position in the sky seemed as though it was lining itself up to appear as a triangle. Anyone who just looked up would think it position was natural in nature.  On or about this time, a neighbor exited his father’s apartment across the way real quite, since everyone was sleeping.  It was at this time while the bight light was in stationed at its second location in the sky, that I quietly asked him to look at the sky to see what I see.  He did and pointed.  When I looked back up the light was still there and zipped across the sky in a liner fashion into the night mist beyond my vision. About the time my I asked the neighbor to look up at the sky to see what I see—my daughter complained about me making noise when I promised to be quiet so she could fall asleep.  I felt bad for asking the neighbor to look up at the sky, because, I w! as doing my best to be quiet and to respect her and others who were sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the bright light/object in the sky was gone it did not come back.  I waited for sometime and remained quiet while I did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 12:36am I went into my apartment and changed out of my PJ’s into street clothes and went for a bike ride.  I was more awake than ever and needed to somehow, someway get tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I road my bike to the Chevron and bought a beer, came home, and sat outside for an hour wishing the bright light in the sky would return.  It never did and soon thereafter I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning I slept in from being up so late.  When I turned on the local 11:00am news there was a story about a fireball seen the day before.  Since I caught the tell end of the news story I yelled out “I’m not crazy”. My daughter said to me that she heard me ask the neighbor to look up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the noon news came on the watched the entire story about the “fireball” seen in Arizona at 7:45pm the day before.  This event is not what I saw!  There are many differences than similarities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First and foremost, the bright light I saw happened between midnight and 12:15/20am.  Second, there was absolutely no orange flame tail!  The bright light round object that I saw moved fast in the sky then stopped for sometime, then moved again, the moved again, then stopped, and then zipped out of sight.  Furthermore, the object I saw pretended to be a star when it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above account of September 14, 2011, happened without a doubt and I am happy to report it in the hopes that others saw the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moreover, about four days before I had a dream about aliens that I think is important to note here.  I have since I could remember always noted my dreams and have done my best to remember them, and talk about them when I wake up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four day prior to the above event I had a dream about being at a huge library.  I love books. While at this library I had to go to another floor to find a book.  I went into an elevator to get to the other floor and ended up in floor to which I did not have access too.  When I exited the elevator I knew I should not be there and searched for another to get off the floor.  I found a man who was human, yet I knew he was an alien being.  I explained my situation to him and he picked up a rock.  With his eyes he wrote in the stone some crypt language how to get out of there.  It looked like:  ---?----- ------------------? ------------------  Because I didn’t understand his language, the alien/human look alike walked with me back to the elevator and placed the stone in the wall and the elevator took my back to the right floor of the library.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was so awesome about this dream was, when I woke up I remembered it all.   That is not always the case with all my dreams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a friend and we chat daily—on that day, like I do most days I told her my dream and went about our day as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my sighting on September 14, 2011, I told my friend that the sighting and the dream are to close for comfort.  I’m not spooked, but am informed, something out there is trying to contact me.  I am fascinated but I don’t like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In writing down my accounts I hope that there is some explanation now or in the future.  Unexplained knowledge today maybe helpful in the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am telling you about the dream of aliens—not to minimize the event on September 14, 2011, but to give you accurate account of recent events, which may or may not be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 0 Moon      *     Bright Round Light Object      *         Star      _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   0 Moon      *  Star     *  Bright Round Light Object<n>

I really did think we were under attack, I thought a nuke or something was targeted to the DC area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh thank God it wasn&#39;t that but now I am left wondering what WAS that?.

A bright light, about the size of a bright star moved quickly across the sky from west to east. I was driving east on Highway US 26. The object caught my eye when I noticed it through the front windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a satellite, only moving much, much faster, and brighter.  After moving almost towards the eastern horizon, the light stopped for a split second, then made a roughly 90 degree turn to the right, and sped off very fast to the south and disappeared from view on the southern horizon (or at least behind one of the many large rock features that are around the area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a full moon outside, and most of the visible stars in the sky were obscured by moonlight. The light was VERY bright, white in color with an almost slight green hue.  The sky at the time of the event was clear, although we did have some rain earlier in the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event took about 10 seconds (seemed much longer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am highly educated (Doctoral degree), and work in public service.  I was completely sober, and was wide awake and aware.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, I felt right after the sighting a &#34;butterflies in the stomach feeling,&#34; and felt a feeling akin to the object knew that I observed it. I can&#39;t explain the feeling in words that properly describe the emotional experience.  Again, very, very strange. I have never experienced anything like this before, and frankly, I found fascinating, exciting and disturbing.  Especially once I had some time to digest what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt compelled to make a report.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get a photo or video.  The experience simply happened to fast to get my phone out of my pocket... In the future, I am going to have my phone out and in the cup holder! -grin-<n>

Up until around 10:30pm (central time) I saw nothing, then BAM, it was there again, same time as last night, same place as last night, doing the same thing.  Charging video camera tonight to get footage tomorrow.  Not a star, willing to bet money on that.  I guess it could be a satellite, though most of the info I have read indicates that it will look like a very slow moving star.  This isn&#39;t the case, this thing hovers in one spot and spins in a circle.  Imagine someone pointing a flashlight at you, and spinning slowly with it.  You see the light bright, then slowly fade, then nothing, then slowly see it, then bright again.

Sept. 13th, 2011  Had casual conversation approx 2 other people one in front the other to my right. I looked up (to my left) an seen a blue object/aura/energy and I could only say it was moving relatively quickly/fast/covering ground.  No sound.  I do not know speeds  I do not know airplane speeds  I do not know shooting star speeds.  It had approx. 2 ½ seconds of movement and simply “went invisible/disappeared” where did it go.  It was heading in the direction to my left and kept a left path then just nothing. Invisible.  Like it was never there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 ½ seconds and it cut out.  If I was to say a shape I could say triangular that’s it. It was more of the light-mid color blue I seen radiating off of it.  The color I can describe accurately than anything else. If you look at the moon and relax your eyes you see a blue glow off of it.  It was a full moon that night, and that color (when you relax your eyes to the moon and see the blue coming off it) was the color of the aura/energy/object I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say it VANISHED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS FAR AS SIZE, that’s all relative I do not know. I couldn’t tell you the slightest bit.  It was there and if the person to my right had looked up at the same time he would of caught 2 seconds of it. That person would have seen it.  It was there. I just do not know what it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want the FBI HERE. I MERELY WANT AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I SEEN. BY COMPARED REPORTS FROM YOUR WEBSITE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TYPE OF POSTING ON SEPTEMBER 13th 2011 when I type in google. That’s all I want. If you could put it on a form or something that would be great, but when I type in google September 13 2011 sightings I WANT something to come up: because something was there, and it needs to be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We noticed an orange/yellow spot of light up ahead that grew in intensity then faded back, all within about 1.5 seconds.  We aren&#39;t certain whether the light disappeared behind the clouds, or if it faded to black. I can only guess the distance and altitude:  I&#39;m guessing between 50 and 100 miles away, and perhaps 1,000 to 10,000 feet altitude.  I plotted the course on google earth, and the path went through Lucerne Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid rocketeer, and I launch rockets at Lucerne dry lake with the club I belong to, but this didn&#39;t look like a rocket- it seemed to stay at the same altitude.

I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out to be something un-spectacular.<n>

While sitting on our back porch Tuesday night (9-13-11) around 9:00 to 9:30 pm .  I looked out in a southern direction to see 3 red lights traveling across the night sky.   All three looked the be the same size, altitude and equally spaced, but you could tell they were at different distances. Like traveling single file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took us a minute or so to realize these lights were something we had not ever seen this kind of a sight before.  Even though we  live close to the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, Google Maps has us at 2.09 miles.  We could not tell the distance or size even though the moon was very bright.  I ran inside to get our video camera and by the time I returned  only one of the lights could still be seen.   Oh well, I thought. Just as I put the camera down. T wo more of these red lights appeared from behind the trees just two doors down.  I grabbed the camera…Started recording what we were seeing.  They were very close together, much closer than the first three.  They moved slowly across the sky parallel with each other, then one  started to move in a vertical direction.  One on top of the other.  They stayed this way until I stopped recording.  In our research we found a man and his child recorded this same type red sphere in 2009 also from Greer, S.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does anyone have any idea what this was?<n>

There was a flashing light, completely stationary, in the sky at about 30 degrees above skyline, directly under Orions Belt.  It was flashing extremely rapidly and changing colors every flash with no discernible pattern. The colors it made where red, blue, and orange.  The flashes were very rapid, and seemingly random, although they always came very quickly.  We watched it for almost fifteen minutes and seeing no movement, went back into the tent and looked on the internet to see if anyone else had seen something like it.  We found several reports, some from as far back as 1998 of a quickly flashing object in the same place and most of the reports had the same colors as the one we saw.  We continued checking up on the object for about an hour, it never moved and it started getting dimmer by the end of the hour, eventually looking like a normal star and finally fading from the sky.<n>

(in initial report on phone, I said west, my mistake).  My fiance told me to look at the strange star.  I turned and initially believed it to be an aircraft, and told him so.  We watched it and realized it was not moving in any direction, but rather seemed to be hovering, and spinning.  Imagine someone facing you with a flashlight, then slowly turning away so you see less and less of the light, until it is completely facing away from you, and you see nothing.  Then coming back around and facing you.  It has been doing this for over half an hour now, and the only movement detecable besides the circle seems to be very slight vertical movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just sat down on a park bench behind a building when I saw a falling star (meteor) fall quite brightly, appearing between the building and a tree line to our  left.  I asked my wife if she saw the meteor but she was looking in another direction.  Five seconds after that I saw what appeared to be three diffused light-colored spots (very close together) flying in the exact course the meteor had taken.  This only lasted a second, again my wife did not see this new thing.  While it might have been a bird (or birds) I am curious about the shape and manner in which it flew, but mostly the direction -- right behind the ‘falling star’.  It seemed to have been at a greater distance than if it had been a bird, possibly a large object of some kind.

At about 9:15, it moved South East.  I noticed it just over 144th and Pacific area (For people familiar with the area) and if I was to explain what it seemed to look like....  It had a triangle like end  abiout 40 degree angle and a much more gradual triangle on the other end about 20 degrees.  I could not see any details on what it actually looked like as far as color because it was dark, but it had about 5-6 little white/yellow lights and one red light.  Besides the overall shape and complete lack of sound, it was the size of a large airplane and when I noticed it, it was too close not to make a sound.   The lights did not blink but did seem to turn off for a couple seconds and come back on which was also strange.  The most strange thing I noticed was the way it flew, it seemed to go side to side and up in down almost like a kite but still flew am! azingly fast.  Seemed to cross about 5-6 miles in about 30 seconds but didnt seem to move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It looked about 8-10 inches wide. My first impression was that it was a small plastic bag caught by the wind, but then I watched it maneuver for at least 5 minutes. It was not randomly drifting around in wind currents, but moving rapidly in straight lines, stopping, and changing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved North for several hundred yards while continuously ascending. After a minute or so, it turned and moved several hundred yards back South, still ascending, until it was almost overhead. Then it changed direction again, going straight up until it was no longer visible due to distance. This all happened in a bright blue sky with only a few very high clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, it looked almost like a flat circle, but at some points, it appeared  spherical. It stayed bright and visible at such a long distance that I wondered afterwards if it might have been emitting light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have no idea what this object was, but it was a shocking experience.<n>

I work the night shift and I was on one of my patrols through the building and was on the 3rd floor. I was looking out of one of the windows around 04:38am overlooking the parking lot (looking east) and I noticed something in the southeast that at first I thought was a really bright star (bright white light) but it was about 2-3 times brighter/bigger than the brightest star I usually see at night and it caught my attention because it was very out of place and because it was right around horizon level, just above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized it was too bright to be a star and I focused on it for a minute or two. Then I noticed that it began to very slowly move in a steady pace to the left. That’s when I knew it wasn’t a star and that it was actually right there hovering over the ground. I estimate that it was perhaps maybe only half a mile away and I’m not good at measuring height but if I had to guess: anywhere between 200-600 feet above the ground but it was lower than any aircraft would normally be at. As it moved it went behind the trees. I was waiting for it to clear that set of trees and thought I would see it appear again on the other end but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed the area it was hovering over was a bit to the south of the 108th &amp; Giles intersection.  There is a Kum &amp; Go gas station right there. And the area is pretty vacant as far as buildings is concerned (a view businesses in the area) but there are lots of large open fields between my building and that intersection (so not too many street lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching for another 10min. or so hoping to see it reappear but nothing. So since it didn’t reappear it left me to believe that it had landed. I had to get back to my desk and I walked away from the window at about 04:50am. It didn’t seem to behave the way a helicopter would. Why would a helicopter be perfectly stationary for about 1-2min. plus I don’t know how long it was there and stationary before I had noticed it and if it were a helicopter that landed you would think it would have picked up the people to be airlifted to a hospital if it was a medical helicopter? I believe police choppers don’t land either but use their search lights to point out the suspect to ground units. There were no search lights coming from this thing, it was just a bright shiny light that was stationary and then started to move and then seemed to vanish for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear any sound if there were any because our building is quite soundproof. The sky was clear and I did see the stars and if I remember correctly the moon was out too. There could be a conventional explanation for it I suppose but I don’t know what it was. It would be nice to find out if there were any helicopters flying that night over the city of La Vista.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. Since I didn&#39;t actualize see the white light land on the ground because the trees blocked my view i&#39;m not checking the box for &#34;The Object landed&#34; but it is still a possibility that it did. Afterall where else would it have gone?<n>

I pulled up with the jeep top down and say a diamond in the sky, then I noticed greenblighys flaking to each other like a laser light show!  Then I realized that there were vibrating objects going to and from the diamond shape.  And they reminded memos humming birds at a feeder or the way honey bees report back to the hive..  Jaw dropped I called my sister on my phone to wake up everyone and come out! And her and my mother came out and we tried to video the happenings but couldn&#39;t catch what we were seeing..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like they were building a spider web or something organized.  But were all shades of green so they seemed friendly..<n> <n><n> <n><n> And my sister and mom went back in I noticed an even bigger UPSIDEDOWN Piramid shape made from stars.  Until all the white objects turn into colorful spinning ones with green red and white lights (000) that shape. But at a glance they just seemed like white stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And another weird thing.  Out of nowhere it looked like a Mach jet (long tranglar) appeared and moved into the distance slowly. (came from big triangle area, not airplane, too large and different light pattern, Luke the ships that fly in transformers 3?)   Then the top diamond keeps moving but in place and looks like a kite on a string but remained stationary..   And I noticed a stream of new stars (possible ships) streachjng across the sky!!  That is when I had enough and wanted to get back in the house..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also managed to take a video   And only one moving object shows up on screen( but not to my naked eye)  Wow it was amazing and this is my second sighting..  But other locals seem to have had multiple sightings in the past!   I hope this helps!! I wish i had a better camera that can pick up the sky&#39;s more clearly..<n> <n><n> <n><n> And one more note: were in endless acres of farmland and that&#39;s what I think the interest was here.. Not people, the land.<n>

We both stepped outside and watched to our amazement 3 large  orange fireballs in a triangular formation, but didn’t seemed attached to each other since one lagged behind for a moment then caught up with the formation again and continued heading southeast over Hayes Ave going toward 19 Mile Rd  while slowly rising up toward the clouds then seem to disappear in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event seemed to take about 3-5 minutes.   My sister and I are in our late forty’s and were not under the influence of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Sterling Heights Police dept. the next day to ask if they got any calls about the night before and they said “no”, that it was probably a weather balloon from Selfridge Air Base that’s located about 10 mile east of us.  We both disagree because we saw it coming from the north and it was just over the tree tops slowly moving upward.<n>

It looked slightly smaller than a golf ball from where we were standing.  I told my son to look at it.  We were both stunned and we both started saying &#34;Wow... what is that ?&#34;  &#34;Oh... my god !&#34; etc.  I said, &#34;That is definitely a U.F.O.!&#34; and my son agreed, as we had never seen such a large orange/amber moving star-like object like this, in our lives !  It was coming toward us and I grabbed my son&#39;s arm and started backing up because it was very different, so I thought it could be dangerous.  We both just stared at it as it seemed to hover in one spot for a while, and then it began to arc ( take a curved path ) toward the East.  As we watched, it began to slowly shrink / dim out.  It looked as though it was getting smaller and less bright until it was just a dot without any light at all... and then it vanished.  We did not lose sight of it, it just disappeared !  Then my son yelled out that there was another one.  I looked around and seen the exact same thing, in the exact same area that we seen the first one.  Again...  It was slightly smaller than a golf ball, extremely bright... brilliant.  It looked like a huge orange/amber moving star, just like the first one did, and it also seemed to stop and hover, but this one moved slightly slower than the first one, but it did everything else the same. ( no blinking lights, did not blink, just brilliant ( flickering ? ) bright orange / amber light... like a huge star ).  It started to arc toward the East, and then started shrinking / dimming... until it looked like a dot in the sky, without any light... and then it! was gone.  Vanished !!!  Just like the first one did.  We waited to see if another one would appear, but did not see anything, so we ran home with our dog and told my husband what we had seen.  He asked us to show him where we had seen it ( all the while making fun of us ), so we ( my husband, son, dog and I )went back outside, and my husband noticed a star-like   ( slightly larger than a large star ) moving object, up in the sky, moving from West to East.  When he pointed it out to me, I told him it was the same color, but much, much smaller( farther away ).  My husband is a major skeptic ( engineer ), but he did take a picture with his cell phone camera ( yet to see the pic ).  He also did make the remark that the color was unusual, and he did not believe it was an airplane or a helicopter.  He also said he had never seen anything like it.  I told him that what he was seeing was sooooo much smaller( farther away ), that it was not as shocking as the first two that my son! and I had witnessed.  We ended up losing sight of this &#34;far a! way&#34; one , so my husband did not see it shrink / dim out and disappear, but at least he did see the orange / amber color of it.  We then took him to the exact spot that the first two appeared at.  We did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a very strange sighting that my son and I will never forget !!! If there is anyone else in the Canton, MI area that has also witnessed this /these U.F.O.s, please feel free to contact me.<n>

MI. Speed was that of slow moving helicopters. Altitude, 500 to 1500 ft.? Size? 8 to 10 stars. I was east bound on 16 mile rd at about Utica rd. when I first noticed them. Saw the first one as it moved out from behind the tree line on the south side of 16 mile. As I continued east more of them appeared. Perhaps as many as 7 by now. They were in a ragged line and as I drove on the front 4 took on a diamond like formation. By now I had gone several miles and chose to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. I was now directly underneath them. I got out of my car for a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or change in speed or direction. The entire line, still moving south to north slowly ascended at about a 45 degrees angle and eventually disappeared from view. I was surprised that I seemed to be the only one who pulled over to look. There was moderate traffic at the time and the seeming lack of interest by the other drivers was perplexing. Maybe, I thought, I had imagined the whole thing. At the next stoplight, much to my relief, I noticed the driver of the car next to me looking up in the sky in the direction of where I had seen these odd lights. He appeared to have the &#39;what the .... did I just see&#39; look on his face. I asked my wife, who was in a separate car not far behind me if she had seen anything and she confirmed what I had seen. Selfridge ANG base is located north and east of where these lights were heading and they probably passed right over it. I am going to call the base today and see what they have to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven’t heard anything on the news nor did I find any thing on the internet about these object so I am wondering if anyone, other than my wife and I and the one other driver, saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yeah, the entire event lasted maybe 5 minutes or so.<n>

They were filmed by two different HD video cameras on the second night.  The object rose from the South together and then split up one to the East one to the West and one to the north.  The first night at 12:37am there was a single object going from South to East over Detroit River area duration of 2 minutes total.  The next night a single object rose from the East and traveled North East going directly over head 9:10pm.  At 9:20 pm three objects appeared from the South and then a third followed behind those by a minute from the South.  These objects also passed almost directly over head but more West and at about 3/4 of the way to horizon they spilt up and one headed West one North and one East.  During this time they changed color from a red to yellow/orange and the shape of circle to diamond but also a notch square on part of dimond shape and seemed to pulsate.  They also! went from large to small.  They faded out as they gained distance from us.  These objects were video filmed in HD by two different cameras on the second night these objects at no time made any sound.  We are making discs of this event and also filmed a commerical aircraft going from South to West heading for our Detroit Metro Airport shortly after film of these UFOs were taken to compare.<n>

This is fairly hilly/mountainous terrain, and it was dark, so I assumed it was a light on a hilltop, or perhaps on a tower.  As I got close it became obvious the light was moving slowly from east to west.  I initially dismissed this as an optical illusion since there was no background other than dark night sky, but the road is pretty straight and the light clearly moved from the left to the right side of the road and got brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I alerted the rest of my family in the car, who also witnessed the object.  As we got closer we noticed that there was a blue light on one side and a green light on the other.  As we approached I saw what appeared to be a semi-circle of light with blue on the left and green on the right (from my perspective).  I could never make out any detail other than the lights.  I would estimate the object was less than 1000’ AGL.  I am a pilot with over 20 years of experience in military fighters.  The light configuration was unusual and did not conform to normal aircraft position lights (green/red on wingtips and white tail).<n>

I had been looking at the sky noticing the broken cloud cover on this moonless evening.   Suddenly, directly above us, two bright lights appeared in the clouds...sitting stationary directly overhead.  At first, I (we) thought that it was someone shining some very large spotlights into the sky.  However, I soon realized that this could not be possible because 1) the source and angle would mean that the lights would have to emminate from our current seated position 2) there was no light trail like you would normally see from a large industrial spotlight used to promote a business 3) the more I looked the more it was apparent that the light source was coming from above the clouds and shining through them, not up to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the two lights, which appeared to be about50 yards apart, began to move erratically.  They zigged and zagged, moved in circular and linear motions, and then one of the lights disappeared, only to reappear off in the distance, but remained about the same size.  That light then disappeared and reappered back over the top of us.  There was no sound associated with these lights, no smell, no disruption to anything on the ground.  This event lasted for about five minutes.  Then, just as quickly as they appeared, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to of been flying at a very fast speed, upwards into the atmosphere.  It was orange and when compared to the almost full moon last night, it looked like it was about 1/4 the size of the moon.  We weren&#39;t drinking or anything, we did not have any drugs in our system, never have. We both were freaked out by what we had both witnessed.  My sister believes that it was a shooting star from my description, but to me that sounds nothing like what it looked like..  It was too large and orange to be a shooting star.  And it was traveling upwards..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/12/11 04:38|La Vista|NE|Light|2-4 minutes|Observed: Bright white light, about 2-3 times brighter/bigger than the brightest star at night. stationary, then moved, then vanished|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83893.html|331|ndxe201109| The bright moving lights ranged from very low to where you would normally see a helicopter fly. The movements were very fast, back and fourth motion, and up and down.  They looked as if they were following our car but the were flying within a 5 mile radius in those directions, rather than moving away. we are observing them and used binoculars. they have a blue bright light in them can stay stationary and move rather quicky.  The blue light looks like it streaks down at times.It also looks like it has lights around it.   When looking without binoculars you can see a bright white light with a little dot, the light looks circular and some are brighter than others.  We have observed the same thing on many occasions but have never reported them.  I would say this has occured three times in the past two months. We got off interstate 81 at exit 23 and began seeing them, we can walk outside and still see a couple we live near Afton/chuckey, tn near the 11-E bypass.<n>

I had been doing the sound for all the bands and was leaving the park after my evening’s work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on to route 13 going south, from the facility. It was a bright moon lit night.  As I drove, I looked up to see the moon and was surprised to see3 orange lights that appeared to be large but from a great distance.  The three lights were in a perfect (upside down) triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that something could have been reflecting off the clouds, but quickly realized there were no clouds. At that point I didn’t know if the lights were from one object or separate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over and stopped my vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up toward the South East sky I noticed that the lights were moving in perfect unison toward the west..very slowly.  It was then that I realized I was witnessing something very unusual.  As I looked at each light I noticed that they were each more or less cylindrical but coming almost to a blunt end point at each end, and the ends appeared to shimmer.  Each light was distinctly orange with a tinge of yellow through it.  Again I emphasize that these lights formed a perfect inverted triangle, and I would guess that at the distance they were away, they could have be 20 to 50 miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, the lights, again in unison...stopped moving and were still for a good 30 seconds (my best guess).  Then one by one each light turned (separately) and as best as I could tell, faded very quickly from view which leads me to believe they were actually separate objects moving away from my sight at a great speed, as each of them was quite slow in their turn, but faded very quickly into nothing.  They didn’t just disappear, they faded very quickly... and again, one after the other but still maintaining the formation mentioned above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t realized how bright they had been until they were gone, because when they disappeared it was as though the sky reappeared into a bright moon lit and cloudless sky, from being in the background of these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately told my wife and a visiting friend about it when I arrived home (about 5 miles away) and the next day, I mentioned it to my partner at the Blue Grass festival and he said he saw them too but put it off to weather balloons or “Chinese Lanterns”...but this is impossible as per my description above.<n>

I turned around and we witnessed a bright orange/amber light which appeared to be no higher than a few hundred feet off the ground an no more than half a mile away coming towards us. The light was completely different than any normal aircraft light that I have seen. I watched the light for a few seconds and when it started moving parallel to the ground I ran into the house to grab my binoculars. While inside I could here my wife and her friends yelling outside for me to hurry back. Once I made it outside the object had moved lower in altitude behind a tree line from our vantage point. My wife and friends stated that while I was inside they watched the object/light move very quickly in a diagonal path down behind the tree line and it became very bright. I witnessed the light dim and proceed to ascend higher in the sk! y. The object moved from left to right a couple times but not to far in distance and then it appeared to dim out but was still barely visible to the naked eye. Looking though the binoculars I could see the object and it had not just dimmed but had moved alot further south in the sky in an instant and then completely disappeared. From what I could make out through the binoculars it had a very bright orange color light on the bottom that would increase and decrease in brightness. I could see a little bit of the structure above that was illuminated by the light and at first it looked like a hot air balloon with a teardrop shape. I figured it was a hot air balloon at first but the lack of noise, and radical movement of the light suggested otherwise. Also the sighting happened at around 11:30pm and I don’t think anyone would be floating around at that time above Olathe Kansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a mostly-clear night, if memory serves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking across the lake at the sky above Vedder Mountain and saw a shape that looked like a satellite, moving up and left from my point of view.  At first, I thought is was a satellite, or even a fighter jet. But it was moving WAY to fast to be both.  Suddenly, it made a sharp turn, to the right, too sharp for a jet or satellite, and disappeared.  The magnitude was about the same as that of a distant plane/very bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw, but it was definitely odd. And I&#39;ve seen satellites move, and they do not move like this. Or any type of plane.  My friend did not see the object, but was just as confused as I was when I told her after the object disappeared.<n>

There wasn&#39;t any noise coming from them to suggest they were some type of airplane.  The orange lights were much brighter then something you would typically see in the sky.  They all took a similar flight pattern but did not appear to be part of an aircraft formation.  Never in my life have I witnessed something like this before!<n>

While getting back in the car I noticed a bright blue light in the sky and called my brothers attention to it.  We both saw it and noticed it was like nothing we had ever seen before both in Color, Composition, and flight characteristics.  We then decided to follow the craft while recording it on my cell-phone.   We followed the craft into a neighborhood near the end of the community when we briefly lost it behind some houses.  I then decided to try and drive around the back to catch the craft and when back on the main road (Lantana Trail) the craft came back into view.  It was here at the intersection of Lantana Trail and Justin Road 407 where we captured some of the best footage of the craft wild maneuvers.  This object was larger than any star in the sky and moved with great speed and at times appeared to change shape and seemed to be surrounded by some sort of energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Link to video taken    http://youtu.be/5UJcOwH9_m0<n>

The object was a bright yellowish glowing gold color that became brighter and changed to a bright blue / white color that was bright enough to create a halo effect all around it.  The light continued north at a slow pace as I told my wife to come outside and take a look, then requested for her to get the video camera.  My 11 year old son ran inside and retrieved his i-pod as well to film it, which he did.  The object made no sound, had no blinking lights and looked like a tube shaped object at its core  as it chnaged back to a golden yellow then green/ blue bright light while still retaining the tube shape at its core.  Just as it began to brighten again, it just vanished in the sky at about 70&#39; above u! s.  Nothing was seen in front or behind it, no trail followed it, no sound whatsoever, there was no wind that night or clouds at the time we viewed this. I am a law enforcement ofc with over 19 years of experience, with numerous years spent working nights and have never seen anything like this before.  I know how to identify the differences between a planet, a star, a meteroite as well as a satelite. This was definitely not an airplane, jet or helicopter as it made no sound. I was able to tape it for 15 seconds and my son taped it for about 25 seconds.  The total duration of the sighting was for approximately 1 minute from the time it was first viewed until it just vanished in the sky.<n>

No sound, no strobes. Lights traveled in same direction for about a minute, then one light stopped, for about 3-5 seconds then faded. Second light continued on same direction then made a slight and constant change in direction to the NE by E, then stopped and held position for about 1 minute, then faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brief description of event:  I was walking inside my house past the sliding kitchen door.  I happened to look outside and notice two bright orange lights moving high in the sky.  I was very interested because: 1) they were bright orange lights 2) they were in a position in the sky not at all typical for aircraft in the area and they were traveling in a direction not at all typical for aircraft in Seattle airspace. These were traveling east, which is across the typical flight patterns for aircraft at all altitudes (which are almost all N-S patterns). I opened the screen door and went out onto the deck and I waited, listened and focused on the lights as they got closer. My first reaction was maybe low altitude satellites, then I thought maybe air planes at great distance (explaining why I couldn’t see any strobes yet) then I thought maybe military or helicopter because of the flight path and flight characteristics (the lights slightly changed course). Then when one light suddenly stopped and faded away my t! houghts changed instantly and all thoughts went to unexplained lights. The second light continued east and then stopped in the sky and appeared to remained stationary. I took two pictures with my blackberry (they are not very good) while I called continuously to my wife. The light remained stationary long enough for me to enter my house on three different occasions to call to my wife. It faded right as she came outside – she did not see any lights. That’s the event. I am very curious now about what I saw. Please keep my email address and name private and confidential. Thank you.<n>

We were both very interested because not only did these objects hover, but they had lights that were like nothing I&#39;ve seen on any sort of aircraft, evening landing lights for an airplane - which could have been possible being it&#39;s common to see commercial airplanes low with landing lights on. These lights were nothing like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first and largest (or perhaps closest to us) was hovering in place and we were able to see a definite shape that was cigar-like, but also slightly diamond shaped. It had lights blinking in a row, sort of like a carnival ride, which appeared to be going all the way around the object. The lights were a yellowish/whitish tint. It is hard to say how high the object was because we didn&#39;t know the size, but it seemed to be around the same level as commercial airplanes were flying at, and the city we were in is about 25 minutes from the airport, so that is a reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second was a little lower than the first and it was hard to see an actual shape - that one just appeared to be a light in the sky, also hovering. It&#39;s light(s) were the same yellow/white tint. The third was smaller, and hovered for maybe a few moments. It had more of a red light, and you could see a shape, which was also cigar-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were driving, trees blocked our view for a few moments and when we could see them again, the third and smallest one had started to head north away from the others. We were both in awe of what we were seeing. The road we were on is a very busy road, so we were wondering if anyone else was seeing what we were. Then we discussed what it could be, but nothing came to us, as we&#39;d never seen aircraft hover in the same spot before. We dismissed all the other possible explanations because this fit none of the descriptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the lights until we couldn&#39;t see them any more, since we were driving away from them. We would have liked to watch/video tape, but we had reservations for dinner, and we didn&#39;t want to be late. So we left the restaurant about an hour later, so around 9:30. We were driving on a freeway this time and again, we saw a hovering light, in about the same area we saw the triangular formation. We both assumed it was the largest one we&#39;d seen earlier, because we saw the object itself, dark against the night sky, still cigar shaped, only it&#39;s lights were now just on top, a white one and a red one and they flashed, two to the white, one to the red. As we were driving, we started to pass the object, so it was just hovering, not moving at all, which is one of the strangest things I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later, we were on the first road that we originally saw the hovering crafts. From this angle, we couldn&#39;t see it - it had moved about 2 miles southwest (estimated) from where we originally saw it. Suddenly, and to both of our surprise, we saw intense flashes in the sky.  Conveniently enough, trees skewed our full view.  The light looked white when it lit up the sky, but the source, from the slightest glance I saw seemed a soft red or yellow-orange, like of a star that isn&#39;t quite as hot as say a white one. That whole half of the sky lit up, and it came roughly from the direction the craft had been seen when we were driving on the freeway. To us, it looked like a grand finale of fireworks, only we heard no noise (which considering how close we would have had to be for those to be explained as fireworks, one would think there would be noise), we didn&#39;t know of any fireworks that could have happened that evening being it would be a really random place to have fir! eworks. Also, we didn&#39;t see any other fireworks around. My boyfriend sped up to see if we could get around the trees before the flashes stopped, but they lasted only about 20 seconds. I cannot say what it is that we saw. Our logical explanations are just not able to make sense of the flashing lights we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us were very startled - so, we drove to this spot a few blocks away where you can get a really good view of the rest of the city and some of the next city over. We stopped and looked across the sky and once again we saw the craft, now moving slowly rather that hovering. It was moving at about the speed of a helicopter, but it was in no one acting like one. It was steady, parallel to the ground and you could see it&#39;s shape against the sky - sort of cigar-shaped. I&#39;d say it was about 5 miles, at least, from us at that time. It moved north west and we watched until it disappeared over the horizon. Both of us were in awe and baffled at what we witnessed that night. We still have no logical explanation of what we saw.<n>

In clear skys my daughter captured an amazing photo of a UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sept 10th at 2:30 p.m. on a sunny, clear skied afternoon with very little cloud cover my daughter was sitting on the couch looking up through the skylight when she first noticed the object from far way.  She had asked her little Brother “What is that”?  As she pointed toward the object that was far away, small but approaching her Brother was too busy playing to look at the object. In a matter of seconds the object got bigger and bigger as it got closer and as it directly passed above her view in the skylight it was very large and she realized this was nothing she had ever seen before. She started yelling upstairs to my wife “What is that”?  My Wife thought the “thing” my daughter was franticly referring to was a bug and didn’t think too much of it and called from upstairs “no”. Knowing this was something out of the ordinary my Daughter then grabbed the camera off the kitchen counter ran to the front bay window and snapped a picture of the Unidentified Flying! Object.  She than became a little frightened and ran to get my Wife. She didn’t see where or how the object had left the area but when she returned a few minutes later the object was gone. My wife then looked at the picture and was amazed at what my Daughter’s picture had captured in the sky. We have included the picture she had taken from our window and we are working on sketches that we hope will show scale to help figure out the altitude, distance and size of the item. Any help you can offer in ways of an explanation would be greatly appreciated. Although we feel the picture speaks for itself!!<n>

It kept catching my attention because it was extremely bright and it seems as though there was a lot of activity of lights for a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I went and had gotten my Father to look at it and said that it was not normal and it couldn&#39;t be a star. He agreed. He then got the binoculars. We both looked threw the binoculars and seen that it is burst of lights flashing like a police cars in and around the area of the white light. The colors consist of Red,white,blue,and green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting part is that I hopped on the net and typed in red,blue,white,UFO and a mans sighting popped up and it was a sighting described exactly in the way I seen this UFO almost to a tee.

In the sighting described by this man from Alabama,  He goes on to say that he had called police and they went out to look. I&#39;m not going to do the same because I don&#39;t trust them or the government.

This location is one bay east of the KY State Park Marina on the east side bank before you enter the bay.  The shore line faces south.  There was little to no wind maybe 1 – 2 mph and what wind there was moving in West to East direction.  There was some heavy cloud cover at an estimated 10,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My rod tip were pointed in the air and I was watching it for a bite.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed and object moving at a fairly fast pace at about 11AM to me at approximately a 60 degree angle above me.  It was shaped like a football – round in shape and brown in color.  No lights or other distinguishing marks.  It was moving in a South to North path.  I observed the object for about 30 seconds from the 11 PM position to about the 2PM position where it disappeared beyond the tree line.  I first though it was a bird just hovering with its wings tucked in but it was too round and the bird would need to have extended its wings to fly or hover.  Most birds do not move in such a straight line and tend to circle.  I thought maybe a balloon or something similar but it was moving in the wrong direction for the wind and was moving way too fast for the wind that was there.  I know sometimes that wind shear is higher at higher elevations but the clouds were also not moving in ! the wind that is there.  The object was below the cloud cover and close enough to see it was not a recognizable airplane or similar.  There was no noise from it.  Boat traffic can be heavy and noisy on the lake but there was no boat traffic at this time on the lake and all was quiet.<n>

It was very bright and was reddish orange in color. It was a steady light it did not blink. I asked two people standing there what they thought it was and neither could explain it. We watched as the light traveled westward in the sky The light began to fade a little and it appeared to be going into the clouds. It was not a commercial jet or plane because those lights blink and this one did not. It seemed to enter the cloud and thus become blocked from our view. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s altitude but it was in the clouds so it was pretty high up there. I&#39;d only have to guess at it&#39;s size because I don&#39;t know how far away it was. It was also so bright (at first) that it could be quite small and very luminescent. In other words I couldn&#39;t tell it&#39;s shape just that it was very bright. It traveled into the cloud cover and again I&#39;d have to guess it&#39;s speed. I! t seemed to be almost stationary at first but as it went up ( I presume) and west into the cloud it seemed to go faster. Without a point of reference it&#39;s hard to distinguish speed and size and distance. When I got home some 40 minutes later the clouds had started to break up a bit. The moon is now visible but it is much further south in the sky to have been involved with this sighting. ( it was not the moon showing through the clouds). It was not Jupiter which is in the eastern sky. It is unidentified. I was working at the restaurant that night and did not have a single drop of alcohol.

She walks out to him and then starts yelling for me, so I of course run out to them.  But when I get out there the thing they had seen was gone.  They start describing it as three low flying lights, flying slowly over the garden and disappearing out of the blue. So of course I think it was a flight or something natural, but they keep on insisting that it was something else. When we get inside again my father sits down on the coats while I put my shoes on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then suddenly, my father jumps up from the coats and out in the garden while he yells, that it is there again.  My mother and I run after my father and out in the garden to see what it is.  And then I see it. It was a little light about 5 meters up in the sky.  The light flew very slowly and then it just stopped and then flew a little closer to us and then it stopped again! like it was looking at us.  There was no sound at all just a simple light very close to us.  My mother and I got really scared and my father did not know what to do, so he started to flute at it while it was slowly moving and then the light slowly went out.  We stood in the garden for a while after the light disappeared, but nothing more happened, so my mother drove me to my friend’s house.

We had no electricity through out the county what so ever.  My wife and kids were on the lap tops. I was just sitting there with them but we had the radio on to see when we can here the electricity would come back on. At 10:00 pm I decided to go outside to see if any of the surrounding housing areas lights had come out. It was very hot as well. I walked in the middle of the culdisak and looked down the street into the valley. As I was looking I glanced up into the sky. I seen an object that was really bright.  I mean real bright! It was green, white, and red bright lights all around it. It&#39;s shape was kind of a boomerang or something like that.  The only thing though again it was real bright. As I kept looking at it it was not moving. After about 20 seconds of still looking at it I sai! d to myself that is a UFO. I then seen it move from one area where I will call point A to another point where I will call point B It would go back and forth for around 3 different times to point A and B. It would stop at each location. I say it was around 15,000 ft in the sky. I base that on because an airplane is around 30,000 ft.  The movement to both points were not very fast it seemed like it was cruising. After 3 min or so I was still amazed.  I then ran to my neighbors house accross the street and banged on his door to see if he can comeout and witness what I was looking at. His house was the only one with generator on. But he did not answer.  The object was stil there just going back and forth. I then called a friend named Melinda to run outside of her house so she can see it. I called Melinda because she lived close by. But no Answer. I then called a friend of mine named Jarvis. He lives in South San Diego. He answered and I told him to run outside his house to see if ! he can see the object. He could not see it. I guess he was too! far sou th. After I got off the cell with him I then ran back into my house and yelled to my wife and kids to run outside.They ran outside and I told them to look into the sky. They all looked up and said what is that. I told them this is crazy but this is a UFO an Unidentified flying object! They looked at it and just kept looking at it. I was so excited of seeing it I do not remember how it left. I was tripping out! I will never forget how it looked. Bright green, white, and red lights all over. It was the size of maybe a 727. I also remember it took a dip into the valley and shot back up. Well after my kids and wife looked at it I then went to my front yard and called a few friends to tell them what I saw. They just were listening and asking me questions. After I got off the phone with them I then went back into the house and yelled not to loud but &#34;I wish I would have recordeed that&#34;. Well little did I know my son recorded it with his I phone and my daughter with her cell phone.! The video you will see on wwww.youtube.com is nothing you have ever saw or witnessed before. The beginning of the video is where I witnessed myself the most. You know looking right at the shape and everythng.

While hovering, object made no perceivable sound.  The object&#39;s movement&#39;s appeared erractic regarding flight course; despite this, its rapid movement in different directions appeared intelligent/ proactive, rather than reactive or a natural phenomenon.  The other witness stated that the object appeared &#34;spherical&#34; in shape, I could not recognize a constant shape to the object, which in my perception only appeared to be in constant fluctuation, regarding both shape and movement.

On Friday, September 9th, at approx 8:00 pm, my seven year old son and I were driving back to Portland,Oregon from Vancouver,Wa. When we were coming off I5 on to the 405 he said &#34;Dad what are those?&#34;. I looked over downtown and there were seven objects, fairly large.  There was another off in the distance, much larger over the hill. I told him they were probably planes or helicopters. He then said &#34;look there is another down by the river&#34;.  I looked down towards the St Johns bridge and there was one down there as well.  They all had a light in the middle and a blue and white light rotating around the circumference. I say circumference because we drove right under one on the 405 and it was approx 500 to 1000 feet up.  It was round, and large.  Other people were looking because I looked at the car next to us and they were looking up also. My son said &#34;Dad we need to call Rxxx Lxxxxxxx and Gxxxxx Nxxxx.&#34; LOL Any way, we came home and told my wife and then I started to look on YouTube to see if anyone saw what we did, there was one video a few hours later.  I continued to look on YouTube every few days.  Just the other day I found a new video on YouTube and I think it is what we saw. The video is apparently older, but it is taken from he St Johns bridge and looks very similar to what we saw. The video was taken during the day, we saw ours right at dusk. But they are similar. Any how, just thought you might be interested.<n>

It was always an orange fire color. In fact it looked almost as if it could have been on fire, with the way it pulsed and grew and dimmed with light.  It was moving slower than an airplane, and much to slow to be a shooting star.  There was no noise from light at all.  It was moving west then either dimmed out or turned south and moved away so quickly it seemed to go out.  That was just as another plain came into our area, as we are in the landing path of the Santa Barbara Airport.  It all took place with in a min-min and a half.<n>

I then noticed it looked oval (almost saucer-like, yet seemed a little fatter in the center and was very bright &#34;white&#34;).  The movement was clearly not like any aircraft that I have seen in the are.  I lost sight of it as I passed a stand of tall pine trees (maybe 5 seconds, and when I came back into a clearing, it was gone.

We were all sitting around talking, listening to music enjoying a chilly evening like we usually do.  We often sit on this driveway just to enjoy the outside air, and to lay on our backs and look at the stars at night.  We look for meteors and interestingly shaped clouds and such because we all tend to have a pretty decent repect for the beauty of nature and planet earth.  Some of us are artists or musicians, while others are simply just free spirits with open minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11pm central time, we were all still gathered in conversation and laughter when my sister said she saw the most beautifully bright shooting star, and we all moaned for we had missed it.  She said that she had never quite seen anything like that before, which got me thinking... was it an extraterrestrial vehicle?  I began to meditate deeply as I do everyday, except I was trying very hard to visualize what she had seen.  Before long I could feel something very different and began to see the most beautiful shapes and geometry in the backs of my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then around 11:20pm that we were all somewhat quiet and the music had stopped when a large, bright, amber in color, and extremely fast light shot out from far behind a tree in the front yard and sped in a very oblong arc across the sky first going higher and then lower again and disappeared into a cloud.  When it first appeared I stood up from the ground very quickly shouting &#34;Whoa!&#34;, trying to get a better look at it because it was moving very fast, and I didnt want to loose sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister then saw it too from my reaction and direction of gaze.  It looked to be about seven to eight-hundred feet high, the arc of travel spanned a local angle of approximatley thirty to fourty degrees, lasting somewhere between 3 to 5 seconds.  It was maybe 3 to 4 times the size of a star, 10 to 15 times brighter than any star in the sky, and about one tenth to one eighth the size of the moon.  It made absoloutley no noise whatsoever, and as it dissapeared into a relativley dark and ! unviewable cloud above the horizon it seemed to make the tiniest &#34;hole&#34; or impression where it had gone in.  I knew right away that it was too bright, lasted too long and far too low to be a meteor.  I estimate that it was traveling somewhere around eight or nine thousand miles per hour, and the intensity of the light never faded save for with distance and cloud interference.<n>

While socializing, I saw what I thought to be a really slow moving shooting star out of the corner of my eye. I said aloud to everyone there &#34;hey, I think I saw a shooting star!&#34; I didn&#39;t think about the fact that it was very cloudy out (and I was unable to see any stars when I looked up) but I saw this in my peripheral vision and wrote it off as a really bright shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About ten to fifteen minutes later, my brother and I were having a conversation about UFO&#39;s, strangely enough.  He was telling me how he saw a UFO while at work the previous day.  My brother is really into UFO&#39;s and has been talking about them a lot recently. I said to him &#34;yeah, yeah, real cool. I&#39;ll believe it when I see it with my own eyes.&#34; Literally five seconds later I saw a strange light move around from where the other shooting light had come from and I said &#34;whoa&#34; which made my brother look! up in the same direction as I was.  Above my friend&#39;s house and just below the clouds, we both saw a large yellowish orange concentrated ball make itself visible and move at a steady pace at about a 100 degree angle across the sky.  It was going much faster than an airplane and much slower than a shooting star. It was one solid light, not many small ones.  It was completely silent. When it got to the end of that stretch it disappeared into thin air.

At first, I thought it might be Venus or some bright star but the sky was way too bright, even at sunset.  We chatted a bit and we would occasionally glance up to look at the stationary object some more.  After about a min or two, the object simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for a description of the object, it was extremely bright and slightly elongated horizontally. (cigar shaped?)

This is now the 3rd time that multiple witnesses have seen this object.  It was a circular object that was orange in color. No flashing lights to indicate a commercial or private aircraft. no red or blue or white.  There was no sound to indicate the size of the craft or type of craft it may have been. Jet commercial etc..  The object moved across the sky going south coming from the north point in the sky.  It moved behind the trees and the object was no longer visable.  The other sightings were the same except for one thing, different points in the sky, but moving north to south.  We have never been able to capture a photo of it until tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange sighting we have all seen (at least 4 witnesses) was a light blue hue circular shape object about the size of a golf ball in the distance moving slowly from east to west with a gradual descent, then changed direction and and began to head south.  This sighting was a 15 second sighting before loosing sight in the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now if this had happened 1 time we would say must have not been what we thought. but now this is the 4th strange light unexplained object that does not in anyway appear to be a commercial,  private or any other aircraft that i have seen.

Having looked at a map I would approximate it was on the latitude between Elgin and Bastrop, TX.  The craft was an estimated 3 to 20 miles away (distances are hard to approximate). It consisted of 2 to 3 yellowish orange lights that moved in exact unity, so as to give the appearance of a single craft. Initially it was moving at a normal speed for a commercial aircraft.  (I assumed it was an airplane since I live north of Austin airport and regularly see airplanes at night.)  After 5 to 8 seconds of flying parallel to the horizon, it suddenly made a swooping descent, covering what I estimated to be at least 3,000 feet in less than 2 seconds, then disappe! aring behind the trees near horizon. My reaction was to think, &#34;Wow, that airplane is going down!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of thought when it disappeared, I realized it could not have been a standard plane for 2 reasons: 1) It was clearly going too fast, even for a downed aircraft, and 2) A standard aircraft doesn&#39;t spontaneously change speeds like that. The descent of the craft was not straight down but rather in an arc motion, appearing as if it was not a fall or trajectory but a controlled descent at a speed which was alarming enough to grab my attention. After it disappeared behind the trees, I did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days later I thought to look on the map (this is how I estimated the geographical area and direction) and made a connection that this was near or around the Texas wildfires in Bastrop area. At the time of witnessing the event, I made no connection between the UFO and the wildfires. After connecting the two, I thought it might be explained as an aerial firefighting craft. But then discarded this idea for two reasons: 1) Nothing was dropped by the craft, but rather the craft itself dropped, and 2) I called all the police departments in the area and was told there were no downed aircraft of any kind.<n>

It was moving slowly from right to left as I was facing it.  It seemed to be a large round fireball of a red and yellow color with a large red and yellow tail creating no sound.  I was able to see it for about 5 seconds before it disappeared behind some trees and a house.  I had never seen anything like it except in pictures.  All the falling/shooting stars I have seen have always been high in the sky, much smaller, and of a white or blue color.<n>

It was flat on bottom with a subtle curved dome top.  They were elegant lines along the length of it with a size of a few hundred feet based on my perception.  It had 6 white lights along the lateral axis that slowly alternated on an off. 5 red lights along the top &#39;dome&#39; shape that changed to white and green before a 90* turn to the south.  The object then slowly moved south and vanished. I walked about 300 yards towards where it was to see past a tree but it was not there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained outside for about an hour and fifteen minutes after with no luck of a second sighting. It made absolutely no noise, and hovered for about 2 minutes from when I first noticed it.  My first thought was a plane, but after watching for a few seconds I noticed the abnormal lights and the lack of movement. It was large and readily visible with the lights showing clearly as 6 indep! endent white, and 5 red. There was no mistake that this was not an airplane or helicopter. I can&#39;t possibly guess what to call it besides &#39;UFO&#39;<n>

I always look to the sky, because of my interest in the possibilty of  other lifeforms.  I looked up and saw this pattern of lights that I have never seen anywhere before.  I live right next to a miltary base, and near a few air traffic paths.  I have seen just about every aircraft that should be in the skies above me, this was NOT one of those!  It was a four sided craft I assume because it had 4 (flare red) red lights coming from it, and had another coming  from the bottom of it. It was a very intense red light too.  It was about 800-1000ft. from the ground, and floated North to South. I say floated, due to the speed it was moving.   It seemed way too slow for it to be airborne.  It went over the house and out of sight, so I ran through the house pulling my girlfriend outside to see it too.  We both stood on the front porch and watched it until it dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached a very light and whispy set of clouds, it’s lights started to strobe and flicker,.  Then, just before it entered the clouds, it paused. All the lights then went flickered,faded (still flickering) and then blacked out.  It made no noise at all, it was only visible.  I hear planes and choppers all the time where I live, this is NOT one of those, or were the lights that were on it.  I want to be very clear on this because I know what I saw is not something I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What an awesome feeling to witness something like this.<n>

To my right, which was very dark, I saw what I thought was a falling star so I looked to it quickly to view it.  My sister-in-law saw it too and at first thought we were going to see a falling star.  In the 2nd second and on, we focused our vision on it and instead of seeing it burn out, we saw it was a round ball of bright white light with a short, comet-like tail streaming behind it.  The tail was slightly shorter than what you see on a falling star and of the same white color as the round light that it trailed.  It flew across the sky traveling from north to south in a perfectly horozontal line, at an altitude lower than any airplane in our area and faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen.  It made no sound of any sort.  I am familiar with aircraft, helicopters and military aircraft and have been to several air shows and seen an assortment of aircraft fly but this was much faster and made no sound.  We watched it for about 3 seconds (plus the second that we saw it in our perifrial vision when we thought it was a falling star) then lost sight of it as it passed in front of my house.  We ran to the south side to watch it continue on but we never saw it again.  It looked just like the craft seen in the Lake Elsinor ufo video earlier this year and Lake Elsinor is not too far from here.  March Air Force Base is directly to the east of me, about 7 miles away and this is no like anything that flies from there, much, much faster that any plane I have ever seen, silent and didn&#39;t have the flashing aircraft lights.<n>

When we observed a ball of red light coming over the top of the neighboring house.  The object was approximately 5 miles away.  There was no noise.   It was the size of a thumb nail from our prospective. The craft itself was around the size of a large pickup truck from what I could observe. It was traveling north toward us, at a low rate of speed. Almost as if it were hovering.  The light on the object would dim really low then would become 10 times its size and be very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was red in color and the part of the object that you could see behind the light appeared to be glowing red, almost like hot metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it was around 2 miles away from us and there was still no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained hovering for around 1 minute and then proceeded to fly upward at such a high rate of speed that it was out of sight within 3-4 seconds. It went ! straight up and disappeared into the stars<n>

As we stepped out into the yard we noticed what appeared to be two satellites passing very high in the sky.  The first appeared very bright and travelled away from the direction of the moon as it went it dimmed as it should when it exceeded the reach of the suns light.  The second was flying perpendicular to the first. Rather than travel in the typical straight line it made a minor deviation in it flight path but still continued in the same general direction.  It appeared to first turn right then left again and still maintained its general course.  After discussing the satellites for a moment we started our walk travelling northwest down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked and talked about random things and revisited the satellite topic which prompted us to look up frequently. We walked about three blocks down the street and through a lit intersection. Just beyond the intersection the street turned dark again.  It was then that my wife said “Oh my god, check that out.” I followed her finger into the sky and immediately locked onto the object as it flew towards us from the north. It was a triangle of dim white lights with a slight blue hue, six of them arranged in an equilateral triangle. I would estimate its speed between 200-300 mph at an altitude of 500-600 ft. I track the craft as it flew directly over our heads north to south in the direction of the moon. As its path brought it closer to the moon its shape started to become visible. I covered the moon with my hand to continue viewing the craft, as I did the craft began to bank west. When it banked the last light on the left and the center light disappeared with the perspective cha! nge making the craft chevron shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did either of us hear any rotor noise of the sound of a jet craft. The moon light made brought out a solid blocky body surrounding the lights. I am an active duty Army Aviation Soldier with three combat tours and have seen almost every known aircraft including the B-2 spirit. This craft was unlike anything else I have ever seen. Absolutely silent, fast and I would estimate its width to be approx 100 yards based on the profile of a C-5 at roughly the same altitude. The conditions were clear, windless with a half moon.<n>

On the freeway, I was near to New Albany.  On my left, I would say in the sky West-SouthWest, I saw several bright, white lights that I at first thought could be an aircraft (a plane for instance).  Then I noticed that the plane did not move.  I then thought perhaps it did not seem to move (to my perception) because it was high in the sky.  But, after a short time, it still did not seem to move.  The all of a sudden, it quickly darted to the south, and then quickly disappeared from sight.  The several lights were very close together, which I thougt would be part of one craft.  About five minutes later I saw a second set of bright lights, but in the North-NorthWest area, stationary, and then simply cease (disappear).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared over some tree tops from the North East, traveled just about straight overhead, and blinked out in the South West sky approximately 35-45 degrees above the SW horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled at a constant speed, like a satellite or space station, and never wavered.  There was no contrail or smoke being emitted. No strobe or nav lights noticed and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color is what caught everyone’s attention. It was orange, and when it was overhead it did appear to be ever so lightly changing in intensity, as if it were on fire.  It was also obvious it was not an aircraft since at such an angle, and as it continued away from us, the landing lights would not have been so bright or visible at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I doubt if it was a bolide or space junk entering the atmosphere due to its constant speed and other characteristics. I have also witnessed bolides, meteors, satellites and space junk in the past due to one of my favorite pastimes, star gazing, for over 40 years.<n>

It was a clear night and nothing was out of the ordinary.  My wife was facing the back of the yard where our dogs usually go.  We have a small tree line that lines our neighborhood then leads to an open field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were out there maybe a minute or so before my wife noticed something strange above and slightly behind the tree line.  She called me over to her position for me to observe what she was seeing. We noticed very large, bright lights stationary behind the top the the trees.  The lights stayed in position for several minutes.  They would blink out in sequence and then reappear in the same manner, starting from the left light working its way to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something truly unexplainable.  Keep in mind we live less than a mile from the Baytown Municipal Airport.  We observe planes and helicopters coming and going all the time.  We have a very clear view of them considering how close we live.  The object we seen was silent and was no more than 200 feet away and maybe a 100 feet in the air and was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, once we saw it for a few moments we rushed our dogs back in the house.  Grabbed the keys and a camera to drive to where this field was behind our neighborhood.  We arrived in a matter of seconds and observed for quite some time without seeing it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it wasn&#39;t an aircraft coming or going to the airport.  It wasn&#39;t the moon, distant planets or any cell towers.  My wife is a total skeptic of the UFO and alien phenomena.  But this sighting has her scratching her head. We just thought we would report in case of similar sightings in the area.<n>

We used our 10x50 binoculars to get a better look &amp; discovered on each side of the main bright light were 3 or 4 tiny lights appearing to be some white &amp; some green.  The peculiar thing is, as daybreak began, it very slowy ascended upward rather than continue across the horizon in uniform with the rest of the stars &amp; by sun up, using the binoculars, you could still see it as a very small light much duller white light.<n>

The crafts were travelling in a linear fashion, heading from north to south before vanishing entirely.  The two craft were travelling in formation, at the exact same speed, and vanished from sight at precisely the same time.  At the point of vanishing, the lights simply disappeared from view.  There were no obstructions of sight during the event.  The craft were visible for approximately one minute before vanishing from sight.  The formation was one craft flying in front of the other, with both crafts flying very close to each other.  The craft were flying too close together to be civilian aircraft.  A possibility exists that the two craft were military aircraft.  There were no sounds heard from either craft before vanishing.  There were planes seen in the other parts of the night sky that remained in view! during the entirety of the event.<n>

I am an attorney, and the very last person that would make up something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside this evening with my mother and my sister (Northwest Oro Valley), and we all witnessed what was not a plane, nor helicopter, and the only way I can think to describe it would be to say a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hovering above the mountains, not even moving, then it went straight up into the sky (not horizontally as plane would fly, straight up), at a slow hovering pace, we noticed it first as two pulsing lights, it is really hard to explain.  Then it moved over the sky, right above us, and it was DEFINITELY not a plane.  I really do not know how to describe it, I have never seen anything like it.  It was triangular shaped and had a line of lights (I would say about 5), but they were not regular lights.  I really don&#39;t know how to describe it. Then it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Frankly, I am still in a state of shock and awe at this point.  I had my phone with me at the time, and at first we were just so shocked at what we were seeing.  Then I thought of my phone being in my hand, so I turned on the camcorder of my phone, and you can definitely see it.  It is not as clear as what we saw, because it is a video from a phone, but it definitely shows the hovering lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why I am even writing this.  I guess because in case other people call in that perhaps report that they saw it, I just wanted to say don&#39;t discard them as not being credible. We saw it too.   I would never in a million years make up something like this.<n>

A bright starlike light was moving away from us.  The light did not blink nor did it have any red marker lights like an aircraft, but the most unusual aspect of its movement was the fact that it was moving right to left as well as moving forward away from us.  The lateral deviations were slight but very distinctive and apparent to the naked eye.   The light was visible for 3 to 4 minutes before disappearing behind a stand of trees forming the horizon.<n>

My friend, his children, his wife, my children, and I were taking family pictures at Fort Flagler near the beach.  We had all the children climb up on a huge log and pose for a picture.  At the time my friend took the picture, there was nothing visible that we saw at the time in the sky. When I got back home later in the evening, I was going through the pictures and saw a very interesting object in the sky.  I think that it should be looked at much closer! From what I can tell this is not a bird, or a plane due to the lack of a tail wing.  This looks very symmetrical on both ends and has a protrusion on the top and bottom of the craft.  When the picture was taken, the camera was facing directly south west.  If this is something that is credible enough, I would like to have this photo analyzed.<n>

Then a bright white light in the shape of a ball with a trail streaked through the open sky and disappeared.  It was too large and close to be a shooting star.

I thought, that it may have been an aircraft of some sort, but then I realized that it did not have any blinking lights that airplanes normally do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continues watching this; I moved in the other direction and this light moved in that direction as well.  There is nothing but a light.  I watched this for 30 minutes before needing to come into my work to check on if anything happened since I had been outside.  I came in quick and grabbed my iPhone, but it just shows a small pinpoint light.  Nothing spectacular.  There were two airplanes that I did see.  Flying as they normally do, since I am in Mannheim and near Frankfurt.  I know the difference.

The basic direction was from WSW to ENE - horizontally, and fairly low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object consisted of a single, bright, white, continuously burning light. Size was indeterminate but it was rather large, much like a small meteor.  The speed would suggest a falling star or meteor and was out of sight as quickly as either, however, neither travel horizontally or as low as this object did.  It was far too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  I had the windows rolled up and the radio on, preventing me from hearing any sound associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the possibility that it may have been a street light reflection off the windshield. However, I turn this corner every single morning at approximately the same time and, not only have I never seen something like this before, there is no street light nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my 55 years I’ve never seen anything like this and the hour may be prohibitive for many others to have witnessed this object.  I would really like to know what it was that I saw and if anyone else had witnessed it.  If this object was one of our own aircraft then it is something that hasn’t been made public and very advanced.<n>

We ran to the park next to the house to get a better view.  The three of them were not ascending or descending, they were low, almost like an LED bright light, but blurry to see any object behind the light.  They disappeared and I have never seen anything like it.  I either saw six or three of the same at different times.  We heard no noise, and they were low enough we should of heard something.

While placing wood into my firebox, I noticed a weird reflection on the metal within seconds of hearing my friend yell.  I turned around and faced the southern sky and say 5 bright objects, 4 were blueish white in color, the other - larger one, was changing in color.  the like colored objects were moving in very sharp, tight formations, changing altitude and direction in unison - towards the brighter object.  All of them seemed to disappear either into or behind the brighter one, which began pulsating colors from blue to green to red to white to yellow and repeating.. it stayed very high in the sky moving quickly back and forth for a few minutes - before sharply dropping in altitude and emitting a very bright beam of light which lit up my entire neighborhood in extremely bright white light and spinning very fast increasing in color intensity and decreasing in altitude... sti! ll very high in the sky.  we stood there, frozen (it felt like minutes, couldnt have been more than 30sec) to me.. he said it felt surreal and empowering.

Some of theses lights shot towards the ground others around the main craft.  As the hours went on the craft moved father away with the lights continuing to shoot in, out, and around it. We believe the lights to be smaller crafts that were able to fly into the main craft.  The first person to sight the main craft says she saw the main craft have 5 or 6 windows.

We have seen it three times in the last week, and I saw it to the North 10 days ago. It appears to be a planet, but it moves it short streaks and arches. I understand Jupiter is in the east right now, but this thing wanders about impossibly.  We even when out driving in an attempt to explain it as a Chinese lantern or SOMETHING(!?), but our perspective didn&#39;t change despite miles traveled.  The last few times I saw it it would brighten and dim while moving about in the same general area, finally dimming completely out after a few minutes.  Tonight it has remained bright and relatively stationary, besides the now expected &#34;to and fro&#34;.  I am at a complete loss! I tried to capture its movement with a digital camera on a 64 second exposure, but it only came up looking like all the other stars, blurred at the same angle of rotation, but I can see it moving about with my naked eye!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyways, maybe my girlfriend is right, and there are somethings that should remain mysteries, but dammit, I&#39;m a scientist!!!<n>

I asked my brother to look and as he did it rapidly went from an equal level with my neighbors tree line straight up into the sky.  It stayed at this level for more than an hour and a half during which time it would just hover around the night sky moving to various different locations.  Every time before it would move the light, which appeared in many different shapes for lack of a better word, would grow amazingly bright and then begin to dim until it completely disappeared and then within five to ten minutes it would begin to brighten up in a completely new location. The light itself was incredibly bright and was steady, it didn&#39;t twinkle light a star and was very strong and brilliant white. The patterns and the way that this light moved were totally unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen before and whatever it was it would just hover about at ! the same elevation slowly moving and bouncing across the sky.  At the very beginning of this the light would grow out and create aura like rays spreading out in different directions and then almost instantaneously would just collapse into itself and then brighten back up which is what originally caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just after the Sagtikos Pkwy and coming to the top of the hill we saw just ahead of us and to the north, 3 disc or oval shape orange glowing lights in the sky. They seemed to be very low. I pulled to the side of the road and grabbed my camera I was able to take 2 photos before the objects swirled in unison and moved up and forward quickly and disappeared north and west. I turned the car around and headed up the ramp of the parkway toward the beach to try and see if we could see them again. Nothing, so I turned around and was coming back in the same exact direction approaching the top of the hill again when 2 more of them appeared and this time they seemed MUCH lower I noted again that they made no sound at all and that there was no flicker, like a flame but did appear to have a glowing ember type of quality to it but it seemed to be &#39;containe! d&#39; in the sphere. In other words it didn&#39;t seem to have a fire or flame quality, just a glow of red orange and bright yellow. These 2 discs went in a quick formation of up and down and zoomed to the right before quickly zipping to the north and west again and disappeared. We waited there for another 2 minutes before driving off and just then 1 more appeared directly in front of us just above the tree line and hovered and seemed to get bigger as if it it was coming straight down and toward us, then quickly went north and west in the same direction as the others and disappeared. Again, there was no sound from them. It was eery and unbelievable. I do not believe in such things but I cannot explain this. I reviewed the pictures with my husband when I got home and they are amazing and show the exact shape as well as a hazy silvery glow that appeared as the discs disappeared. I did not even think I caught the objects because I took the photos so fast, but they are astonishing. I ! hope someone else saw them and will report. I will have my eye! s up to the sky more often.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The noise sounded like someone throwing things around or hitting things and I could not determine whether or not it was from in my house or outside.  The noise persisted and I got a very strange feeling so I went downstairs and out on the deck to investigate more. My little brother said he did not hear anything, and as I was describing to him the strange feeling I had and noise I heard I looked out the window to my right.  The sky looked like it was flashing. I yelled to my brother to get up and come look and he replied that it was lightning, although it was only in one part of the sky (in the North East) directly out the second floor window we were looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we kept watching the strobe-lighted sky, a strange formation of red, blue and white lights rose from behind the trees. It grew bigger, may have been spherical and was obstructed from complete view. we watched i! t silently as it appeared to hover tree level directly at us, its lights blinking in a strange formation.  Seconds later it was gone.  There was now nothing where we were looking, just the normal night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what we saw, and my brother agrees it was very strange, although is skeptical (&#34;There MUST be some explanation&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am especially freaked out because I just discovered this website randomly the day before. I had a wierd feeling and it led me to this window and what I saw I can not forget or ignore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove to where I thought it was but there was nothing there.

As I was walking back to my house, I glanced over towards my neighbor’s house. I noticed a bright orange light about 25 degrees off the deck and at a distance of maybe 2 miles (hard to judge due to breaks in trees, highway, and open farm land).  It was southwest towards Sandusky/Norwalk.  I stood there watching it for a moment and it dimmed out to almost nothing then appeared bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab my telescope.  When I returned outside, I saw the light in the same place. I set my telescope up and upon looking through the spotter to make sure I was lined up right, I noticed that when the light dimmed, it appeared to break into 4 smaller lights (possible illusion due to spotter?)  I tried finding the light through my telescope but could not seem to locate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few more moments then decided to run inside and get my wife and brother-in-law. When we returned outside, the object had vanished.  As far as I am aware, I am the only one who saw it.  I am a Marine who spent 5 years on an airbase.  No aircraft that I know of has lights like this.<n>

I happened to look up and saw about 5 red glowing objects moving at a high rate of speed across the sky (from north to south).  They looked like glowing circles, but only the outside edge was glowing, the centers were black.  There were half was across the sky when I noticed them, and were gone in not much more than 5 seconds.  Size, speed and altitude are impossible to tell, being dark and the object being in the sky.  It did cross the sky very quickly but didn’t make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed them out to my wife, who was sitting next to me.  We both thought there were about 5 objects.  At first they seemed to be flying in a v shaped formation but by the time my wife saw them they weren’t.  She described the movement like a bunch of balloons twisting around each other.  They were traveling what seemed to be straight across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have yelled to everyone to look, but by the time I realized I didn’t know what I was looking at, they were gone.<n>

Had been watching the night sky as it was totally clear and filled with stars.  Watched what appeared to be a satellite in the eastern sky move slowly from north to south when a much bigger object, what appeared to be a fireball, came into view and moved along a similar path.  Then it stopped and seemed to release tiny blue objects that appeared to move toward and away from the fireball in a more or less up and down pattern.  This lasted about 10 minutes and then it all disappeared.  I have been backpacking in the Cascades for years and have never seen anything unusual in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved in a straight line from South to North until it was out of sight over the horizon.  It was basically a sphere, with a haze around it.  The color was beautiful shades of bright orange and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no stars in the sky, as it was overcast.  It was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I distinctly remember my daughter asking where the stars where that night and I explained to her that is was cloudy and there were no stars in sight.  We drove the few miles home and turned into our neighborhood.  I had the windows down as it was a pretty night.  I noticed a large group of people (approx 10 or so) standing outside pointing at something and saying things like &#34;Do you see that?, What is it?, Look at that thing!&#34;  I began looking out my window to make sure I wasn&#39;t about to hit something.  I could only see the houses on either side of myself.  As I turned right to go around the corner I had an unobstructed view out of my passenger window and I saw what was a bright orange glowing ball in the sky.  It appeared to be quite a ways away, but was very large and brightly illuminated.  It looked as if it was over the area of Hiwasse AR.  My first though was an airplane as XNA airpor! t is not that far away, but as I watched it I realized it was not moving.  Hovering in the air glowing bright orange, with no flashing lights that are the norm of an airplane.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  I see airplanes often, I have watched satellites move across the sky.  None of these things are even close to what I saw.  It was round glowing fire ball.  A bright orange that would change to more of a burnt orange and back.  It then suddenly disappeared.  It didn&#39;t dart away, just disappeared.  I was so shocked that it didn&#39;t cross my mind to pull out my phone and take a picture or video. I was caught up in watching it and trying not to lose visual.  I pulled into my driveway and ran out into the road trying to find it again and it no where in sight.  I then noticed my neighbor out in her yard watching it as well. She had stepped out to let her dog out and noticed it.  She said she had been watching it for several minutes.  It was a glowing orange ball and she! said at one point it would dart away and then shoot back and ! hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did this twice.  At one point the orange glow went away and a blue beam of light came from it. It then flipped back to the orange fire ball color.  She watched it until it disappeared.  I have searched the internet and the newspapers trying to find reports of this and have found none.  I know what I saw and it was nothing that I have ever seen.  Not a plane, not a satellite, not a hot air balloon, and not a sky lantern.  I am hoping by posting here that someone else will confirm what I and at least one other person that I spoke to saw.  What I saw does match some descriptions of others from July 4th of an orange glowing ball that were in nearby cities from where I saw this one.  Strange enough, lately there have been a lot of military aircraft flying over the area since.  My cousin used to be in the military and has noticed that we suddenly seem to have lots flying over, where we never have noticed them before.  I don&#39;t thing we are close to any forts and never noticed th! em before now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are involved in regular field research and gather photo&#39;s showing the activity in our County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking about half a block in front of the car, which was using its running lights so as not to  effect my pictures, I was taking pictures in sort of a panoramic effort, trying to cover as much of both sides of the road as possible.  Was using the flash, and shot 165 photo&#39;s on this road alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound besides my feet in the gravel, But at a certain point I began hearing noise of heavy movement in the tall brush to my right. It was on a area where there was both thick brush and fence.it was on a slope that ran up to a fence line  maybe my head height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking it could be a possum or racoons, or rabbit, I took  pictures in that direction  as a precaution, an off chance. I saw a shape moving I guessed  might be a big dog, its head though seemed  very thick, and there was a reflection on something light colored when the flash went off.  I was aware of it but continued since it had shown no aggression.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was moving along at a good pace figuring to inspect photo&#39;s later,  When I did I found two taken in that area, that showed a figure of some sort.  There was a light colored torso and I believe arm, and head.  This was in a spot of thick brush shoulder high, the next photo was only a bit later, and showed a muzzle and forehead of something looking around the base of a pole.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a thick jaw full of teeth, and a yellow eye with a slit pupil, and a green cast to the skin. I could see its position due to the flash&#39;s.  By the third shot it was gone, we finished our run and went home.<n>

Do that a lot to view the start anyway and just had a strange like feeling i was suppose to look up. There were no lights of any form i could see and there was no noise. The craft was not complete formed when i did look up and it just sort of materialized into a full form after about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to view the object and was in hopes of some contact with its crew if able and had a small laser pen light key chain in my pocket with keys. I made a few flashes at the craft which wasn&#39;t to me very high maybe 500 yard off ground. The craft is the same shape and appeared exactly as one before happened when I was in 7th grade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one then did not reflect sun light as it was in day light and it was only there maybe 2 minutes. This one made me think maybe they came back to communicate as it was exactly like my first sighting as a kid.  Wasn&#39;t lucky I guess!  The craft did not reflect the laser light or even show a beam from the light such as a metal object will do.  The only thing different about this sighting is that the time was much longer and to me it was only like a minute or two but when I went back into the house my wife asked what I was doing so long.  I said i just went outside to check the property and fence to be closed and didn&#39;t realize that ten minutes had elapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will assume i have had my second encounter with the same craft again now.  Sure wish I could get some form of contact with them.  Has to be a reason why i now have seen this twice in my life. Guess I will never know for sure the reason but then again I might be a lucky person one day and be taken to the craft someway and fly through space with whatever life form is piloting this craft.  They have to be very intelligent to develop such a craft for great distance travel.  I don&#39;t think i was abducted but I do think I was somehow being close to the craft and observed by the craft changed in respect to time dilation of some sort as It didn&#39;t feel like the length of time I watched the craft was that long.  But it happened.<n>

There was absolutely no sound, they abruptly changed direction and gained altitude and faded out.  I estimate the lights were about 1000 ft altitude before moving off.

I was driving the vehicle and had one passenger, a friend,in the front passenger seat.  It was twilight, and the sky was still somewhat light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in a heavily wooded area and all of a sudden to my left, quite high up in the sky, appeared a red ball of light. It looked like a red star, as it was at first, not moving.  Upon closer look, it appeared to be hovering. It then dropped what could have been one hundred feet (more or less, as I had no idea how far away it was).  At this point, my friend and I were intrigued and I pulled over to the side of the road.  Again it hovered, but this time it looked almost as if it was spinning very fast and I noticed a gold tone within the red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my car in drive and moved forward about 20 feet. The object appeared to be &#34;watching&#34; us! It moved as if following my car, and stopped when i did! I then REVERSED the car about 30 feet, and the object reversed direction, again moving WITH my car! It stopped and hovered when I stopped my car, and continued to follow when i moved my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes a car drove by from the opposite direction.  The object continued to hover, appearing to watch us.  Then another car drove by, and happened to be a relative of mine.  He pulled over to see what I was doing and say hello, and as I was keeping an eye on the object, it faded and vanished completely.  There was no noise of any kind the entire time of this happening, coming from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued home without any additional events of this type.  I should also mention, it was very hazy and humid but the sky was very clear.<n>

I watched it travel in a south easterly direction for approximately one minute at this time it vanished behind the tree line.

I was at the end of our drive way with one dog and had turned to look towards king about 3/4 mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do see military as well as civilian aircraft at night as well as the occassional space station and other satelites sightings but what happened next, I had never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several evenings before I was out with the dogs and had seen the space station go over,kind of just plowing along in all its shiney silvery radiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:22 pm sharp I saw a bright redish orange ball of light heading from west to east along county road QQ .The night was rather hazy with broken clouds through which stars could be seen.The ball of light seemed to be traveling about the same speed that the space station travels when it goes over and even the local foundry jet appears to be going about the same speed visually as its going to land but why reddish orange ? The ball of light got pretty close to my location when it made a turn and headed due south and as it did the color didnt change it stayed reddish orange .<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time from over a willow tree in my yard another ball identical to the first one came over the tree,then right over me also headed from West to East and as the other object was now headed South,the one that just went over me now turned slightly and headed I would say in a south south East direction and also never changed in color as it passed over head.Niether one of the red orange balls made any sound at all ! At one point two cars headed west and I thought they would stop and watch but continued on into king.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having been a photo interpreter in the USAF during the 1960&#39;s and having also been stationed at a fighter wing I have seen hundreds of jets taking off and landing and many after burner runs and believe me.a fighter makes alot of noise,especially when they some times would take off two abreast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldnt make out any particular shape other than they were round reddish orange balls of light and the size was very similar to when you see a jet with its landing lights on coming toward you from perhaps3/4 to 1/2 then 1/4 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It struck me that it almost seemed like the lead ball of light had a wing man traveling about 1/4 to 3/4 miles paralell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took a long time to finally get to sleep and I now see them in my mind constantly-Oh yes-I was shaking like a leaf and still am.Any clue as to what they were or where from is a mystery.<n>

I exited my home from the back door that faces South. I looked up and noticed a bright light that I thought was a star until it moved to the left then stopped also then it appeared to rotate clockwise. After staying in this position for a bit it appeared to grow smaller (as if moving directly away from us) but it did not change position in relation to the stationary object that we were comparing it to. The object then emitted a light (like light diffusing through a cloud) for a brief second (my husband also witnessed all this). The object also disappeared completely 4 times only to reappear visibly smaller. Also the whole time the object was blinking with a steady light both white and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 1:14am Pacific time on 09-02-2011 I was on the north side of the track facing east (approximately 38.621686,-121.452999 according to Google).  I had just finished my run, and was looking up to stretch my neck. I was looking at the sky and what I saw amazed me.  From out of nowhere appeared three white lights clustered closely together in the orientation of a triangle pointing upward from my perspective. In the span of about a second, perhaps a little bit less, the three lights, maintaining their position relative to each other, streaked across the sky from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights left a very bright streak of light across the sky.  Actually they left three distinct streaks, one from each light.  The streaks were very close together, and so they blended a bit, but I could still distinguish three separate streaks of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s difficult to gauge distance, especially since I am not sure how high up the object was in the sky. But it was close to the Big Dipper in my field of view, so I can say that it traveled about 2.5 to 3 times the width of the Big Dipper&#39;s cup.  It started about two cup widths to the south of the Big Dipper, and streaked north crossing the Big Dipper&#39;s cup then disappeared instantaneously.  The streaks remained in the sky just a fraction of a second longer, then also disappeared.  The three lights, and the streaks that trailed from them, where extremely bright; brighter than any star in the sky.  I would have taken this for some sort of shooting star, except that I could distinctly make out three points of light giving me the impression of thrusters, like those on the back of the Space Shuttle.  I would like to make clear that I could not see the shape of the craft, and I do not think that the triangular formation of lights represents the shape of the craft itself.  Rather I suspect that the triangular light formation represented the craft&#39;s propulsion component only. The shape of the rest of the craft is unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound, and it lasted just a second at the most. I continued to walk around the track for about five more minutes, but I saw nothing further of note in the sky, so I headed home. Once again, it&#39;s very hard for me to gauge size or elevation of the object, but the three lights occupied a space that would have fit in the circumference of a dime, or nickel perhaps, from my perspective. And if I had to guess, I&#39;d say it would have had to be up around 18,000ft a least. If I&#39;m right about the altitude, and I may not be, then the size of the object would have to be rather large to occupy the circumference of a dime. While the probability seems remote, since the phenomenon was so brief, I&#39;d be very curious to know if anyone else has had a similar sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relevant background: Student Pilot<n>

I went outside onto the patio and recorded several videos over the next couple of hours.  There were 3 witnesses with myself at the time that I began to film the object.  After comparing the videos, it is evident that the light moved in between the shooting of different clips, however I never actually witnessed it move. I didn&#39;t witness it do anything other than sit still and flash erratically, which was enough for me to shoot a few minutes of video and take a few still shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the pictures and videos I am more baffled than before. It sat stationary for so long that I eventually went inside and went to bed.  One person said that flashing blue and red lights are a sign of a satellite, but I have never seen this before from our patio and will be observing the sky to see if I see it again.<n>

I looked in my rearview mirror and seen close to a dozen round balls in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at them in my rearview and turning around in my seat for 60 seconds, before I concluded that they where a ufo.  Having been in the military and living outside a military base I first checked to see if it could be a known military aircraft.  However they where not moving.  They had the appearance of big really high Street lights.  They had the same orange glow as street lights.  They really confused me at first ,this is maybe a mile long road I&#39;ve drove on at least twice a day.  I was thinking maybe they just put in really high Street lights but when I thought with the bend in the road there&#39;s no need for anything that serious for a couple houses.  This all going on within 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now in my rearview a cars coming so I turn right at t! he stop sign and pull off to the side of the highway to look.  The SUV that was behind me at the stop sign also took a right and pulled off to the side in front of me.  They must of saw this strange sight too.  This is a very unusual sight for a small community with only two exits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there maybe another 3 minutes, didn&#39;t want my girlfriend get on my case. When I left the ball and the SUV where still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will always regret not communicating with that SUV.  Maybe they reported it also.<n>

Silent and erratic movements over northern Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening, My Wife and I were sitting outside in our backyard here in northern Texas, chatting and having a cup of coffee.  When we both noticed an oddly-colored light moving quickly across the sky. We are no strangers to the airport traffic flying over head each night, this was different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was a seemingly high-flying object heading north towards Lubbock (some 30 miles north of us). What struck us as odd was that there was NO sound, which in itself is very unusual. Here in the southern Plains,  We can hear aircraft from miles away.. The sound really travels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it wasn’t just the silence that caught our attention, the navigational lights that we always see were “off” as well… as in not there.  The only light we could see, was a very bright, burnt-orange color that seemed to be pulsing. Almost as if some sort of thrust or propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object head due-north for almost a minute, then it pulled a HARD bank to the left forming a 90 degree turn and flew due-west towards Nevada until it disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know an argument can be made that perhaps the angle did not allow me to see the nav lights. And that would be an understandable argument… if not for the fact that the object, having pulled a sharp 90 degree turn in the sky above my head, showed Me two sngels and still no lights. Together with the fact that I am ex-spec ops and very familiar with both aircraft, and what to look for. This is something I have never seen before.<n>

To the south of the highway I noticed 2 bright orange yellow lights in the nights sky.  I could see them the whole way down to highway to Neepawa.  They were too high in the sky to be farm lights or machinery in the field.  Very weird to see the lights the whole time I travelled along the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got to Neepawa you could not see the lights anymore due to the trees in town. I then travelled to the south end of town and I could still see the lights.  Very unusual.  No explanation. Creeped me out! I told my husband when I got home.  He said that during the day there were military aircraft flying over town.  Coincedence?  Who knows?  The lights did not appear to be flying at high speed.  And I have never seen a plane with such bright orange yellow lights.<n>

(I usually sit outside viewing for up to three hours and as long as five).  It seems important to me to state that I live in a flight path to the local international airport that is approximately one mile east of me.  Two objects in particular are of interest since both seem to be “planted” nightly in the same approximate area but appear to move  very slowly with the night sky and at times appear to be attempting to make corrections moving up slightly then re-positioning.  They are not satellites for they are two low to be confused with that technology.  One is a star- shaped object (definitely not a star) which flashes red and green light and rises behind the treeline of my backyard.  It can be seen with binoculars very distinctly.  The other is a very large brilliant white orb which rises to the east of my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have become aware that these star-shaped objects are “stationed” above my home and appear more brilliant in the night sky then stars and they too flash red and green which can be seen with the naked eye.  They have a tendency to “mimic” traditional starscapes like the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this came to my attention after experiencing a craft of some sort (one large white light with two red flashing lights on each side that caught my sudden attention in my dining room window.  Located below the tree line of the backyard, it vanished quickly and from that point on I have been diligent in searching the night sky.  I have also seen a ship appear from a brilliant white halo of light and vanish.  Both of these objects were what seemed no more than a “stones throw distance to my house”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations have included orbs that fly across the sky at great speeds and hide in distance, something that looked like a rocket(no wings).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that these discoveries seem outrageous but I can only state what I have witnessed. Also, in witnessing these events I have brought it to the attention of others both in the household  and not who are astonished that my small window of the universe is affected in this way and they are now included in those that believe because of the nature of these sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect celestial bodies, possibly twinkling stars.

This is right near the old salvation army building on Burnside and 2ND ave. I can get the exact date I seen this event because I got kicked out for climbing out on the roof at night, simply to use the wifi internet I could not pick up in my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was out on the roof I observed 9-11 brightly light orange spheres in the direction of the airport, from downtown. On the roof of the building, I could see the ground at a distance of apx 15 miles, and estimate the height of the flying objects to be apx 500-1500 feet above ground. The objects held a formation although they did not appear to be of one object.  They started to  slowly move independently of one another. I managed to observe these in flight for about 5-7 minutes.  There are two taller buildings that obscured the view, these orbs passed behind them and finally, I could no longer see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other objects in my view flying for apx 30 minutes after the sighting.  I simply gave up and went back inside shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a veteran of the armed forces, and my career in aviation, I feel particular to this event and would be willing to give a more detailed report, please contact me via email or phone and leave me a message.<n>

Myself, my wife, and my two children were excited to see a medium sized brightly lit sphere traveling directly overhead from Southeast Northwest for several seconds before disappearing behind a grove of trees.  As we were talking about the event I noticed a very, very bright object making it&#39;s way directly toward us. When I first spotted the object it was about a 1/2 mile away from where we were standing and seen through some trees.  The object was enormous in size and very, very bright and was at about a 30 degree angle until it passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving directly from the West to the East and it passed slightly to our left overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made NO sound and was about 8 to 10 thousand feet AGL and the size of a silver dollar and 10 times brighter than any star in the sky and Much, much lower than any commercial aircraft we have ever seen in this area.It was brighter on the outside edges than in the center of the craft, My wife said, &#34;It has got &#34;high-beams&#34; all around it&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on a mountain that surrounds a large city in SE Tennessee and within a 100 mile radius there are several nuclear power stations and several large hydroelectric stations under Tennessee Valley Authority. The direction this craft was moving would make it&#39;s path follow Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plants,Sequoya 1 and 2 Nuclear Reactors and Power Plants,Over Raccoon Mountain Subterranean Hydroelectric Facility, Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant and even on to Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a theory but these could be what draws these craft to this area as this is not the first time we have witnessed numerous craft. However, on this occasion, the size,brightness, and elevation were all astounding and out of the &#34;norm&#34;.  This craft was HUGE and LOW and moving without fear of being seen. I will be attempting to get a FOIA on the Radar Data as this thing HAD to be noticed by Someone&#39;s Radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 4 of us who saw this craft clearly.On a personal note,I have credentials and a life long career where integrity is a must. This sighting was extraordinary!<n>

I saw a cigar shaped ufo while on a hike with my children 20 years ago and have been watching the sky ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I once reported a ufo event witnessed by myself and strangers who all stopped our cars on a highway to watch what was going on.  I called the police and was directed to call the airforce and they took my information.  This event was about ten years ago.  My son and I were returning videos in the next town and driving home.  We saw a very bright green flash of light like a sudden explosion lasting about 15 seconds (or something hitting the atmosphere like a meteor, there was a loud boom).  I stopped the vehicle and pulled over.  I was concerned that there was some type of chemical explosion as there are old military facilities close by, and I was relatively new to the area.  An elderly gentleman in a Lincoln Town car pulled over and asked if we saw &#34;that&#34;.  We watched the sky as it glowed green along the horizon for a while and faded.  Soon a helicopter flew over and shined a very bright light on to us as we just watched.  It quickly went away.  The only other interesting par! t was three dim yellowish lights appeared in the direction behind us (over Ithaca, NY).  They just sat there high above the city about the same width apart (many miles apart) not moving (arranged in a straight line, not a triangle or other popularly reported shape) until they slowly just became smaller and blinked out...gone. So we went home where I called the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight, my dog was growling at a skunk or something so I looked out the screen door.  I saw one of the many bright points of light in the sky begin to move.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as it was subtle at first.  I thought maybe it was a satelite as we see them move regularly.  However, this one was different.  It was very very far away so I could only see a point of light.  It was above the lake in the direction of Cortland, NY.  I decided to report it as it&#39;s movements were clearly different than the usual.  It moved very slowly (almost undetectable if you weren&#39;t staring at it closely) in the direction toward Ithaca, NY.  Then, and here is where I became interested, it stopped and much quicker began to go the opposite direction (the direction it had just come from).  It did not turn, loop or stray from the line it had been in, it simply went backwards.  It did this for a short time to about the same place it had started (or as I had noticed it) and sudde! nly plummeted toward the ground so quickly that it blurred with a streak.  My logical brain said oh, see, it was a meteor until it stopped suddenly and shot back up to where it was before.  My logical brain does not think meteors do that.  I watched it for a very few minutes (maybe 7 all total).  It moved around slowly now toward Seneca Falls, NY.  It made an interesting loop like it was going back toward Ithaca but continued the loop back toward Seneca Falls and I lost sight of it from the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an almost identical event as the one I just described several years ago as I was out on my lawn watching the fireworks over the lake.  At that time, the point of light was larger and moved impossibly fast zipping around this way and that until it flew away straight up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not a popular topic among sane normal everyday working people.  So, I appreciate the opportunity to share this information. Thank you<n>

It was changing in shape and size slightly and then it was got small and remained orange/red.   At this time it moved around a little.  It was larger than the size of the brightest star.  It turned white.   My friend took two pictures of it with her phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time it shot out of the sky away from us and disappeared.  There were a lot of helicopters flying around.  She lives near an airport, but there were a lot more than normal.

It resembled the full moon in color when it’s just above the horizon.  I thought perhaps I was seeing a planet, but it was abnormally large for a planet and there were no clouds to suggest I was seeing a small part of the moon.  It almost seemed to be ‘twinkling’.  Then it split into two balls.  I continued to watch and it reformed into a single ball.  It split into three balls, then four.  One ball was slightly larger and above the newly formed balls, which were in a curved line below the larger ball.  I ran downstairs to see it from outside but it was obscured by the tree line, so I ran back up to the bedroom window.

In the middle of our conversation I looked up into the sky Due South East towards the city of Topeka as I&#39;m an avid skywatcher. The night sky was clear showcasing all the stars, milky way, and constellations. I seen an object that looked just like a star in the night sky with the exception that it was brighter than the rest of the stars out. The shape would have been round I guess since it looked exactly like a star in the night sky. The color it was emitting was a mix between white and yellow. I jokingly told my friend &#34;Is that a UFO?&#34;. He said he didn&#39;t know what it is, maybe a space station was the only answer he could come up with. Being an avid skywatcher I quickly went through my options. Falling stars and space debris follow a trajectory and I quickly checked that off the list. The object was moving fairly fast towards the southeast. Kansas has wide open sky&#39;s and airplanes you! can usually hear and see the blinking lights on them or the red and blues on the wing.  This had neither.  Plus with the object heading southeast of my position and away from us, you wouldn&#39;t be able to see the front headlights on an airplane. About a minute into the sighting the light emitting from the object dimmed  to a more circular ball of light that would be consistent with the stars at night.  A few seconds later the object just disappeared completely, just poof and it was gone. The sighting lasted anywhere from 1 1/2 minutes to 2. I watch the night sky almost everynight, and I know what planes look like. In Kansas you can see for miles and miles and the sky is wide open.  If this was a plane I would have still seen it moving.  I&#39;m open to suggestions of what this could be.<n>

I think it was a Sunday.  This is the first Watertown Exit when approaching the city from the south via Interstate 81.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about a half a mile outside of town and rounded the bend with the guardrails, before the straight shot to Washington St.  Upon rounding the bend there were 4 large lights in the sky above the city.  The lights themselves were circular with almost the same hue as a street light but you could tell they were significantly larger than a street light.  They were definitely at a distance and in the direction of Fort Drum.  Without knowing the size of the lights I cannot determine if they were over Watertown or much farther north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights formed a rectangular pattern. 2 on top. 2 on bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon rounding the corner all were fully visible. I probably looked at them for a good 5 seconds before asking my fiancee &#34;are you seeing this?&#34;.  She did as well see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, the top two lights began to fade out and then disappeared. Immediately following that, the bottom two lights completely disappeared with no fade at all.  It was extremely bizarre and slightly unsettling.  Even more bizarre was a news announcement the Friday before that the military would be testing Fighter Jets and to not be alarmed by the noise.  I can assure you these were not fighter jets. Unless they somehow could fly in a perfect box pattern miles apart and were outfitted with extremely large lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lived here 20 years.

It traveled slowly and steadily across the sky, and at one point intersected one of the airplanes that was traveling from S to N.  The plane was obscured from sight for a moment as the craft passed below it. I clearly heard the engines from the airplane as it passed overhead, but there was never a sound that came from the other craft.  It continued in it&#39;s southeasterly track until it was a distant light, yet still bright. Suddenly it became less and less bright, almost invisible for about fifteen seconds.  Then it became bright again, and slowly went off steadily to the southern horizon where I lost sight of it.  Very unusual and unexplainable.  Left me wondering.<n>

The place was packed with people and the parking lot full of cars. I have to say this was strange for day light hours with so many other people around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not looking for anything like this but watched it in amazement and to see it up close within 200 feet. It went from a shiny metallic when it first came down just feet away from the cars parked in the lot... to all black when it started to shifting back and forth over the parking lot at an incredible rate of speed... it started spinning and had white lights along the base between each of the crease on the bottom.  It traveled so fast that it seemed to morph or stretch when it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really jumped and stud up when I first seen it when it started to dash back and forth over the parking lot.  Would have been hard to see if your eyes were not already fixed on it.  My daughter said it was a flying bowl and she said that this object did not want to be seen because of how it darted back and forth.  It finally darted over us were we were sitting out of sight.  It was a couple of weeks ago..  I think it is weird and my 13 year old daughter is not afraid, and said it was just space people?   My feeling is that whatever I seen is still there... top of the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, have no idea what it was.  My daughter was awake, too, so I called her outside and pointed it out.  We watched it for about 5 minutes before I went inside to try to find a camera.  We&#39;re in the middle of moving and couldn&#39;t find one.  My daughter kept her eyes on it the entire time I was inside.  When I returned all but one of the lights had gone out or could otherwise no longer be seen.  We can still see that single light in the sky, sort of flashing or twinkling, but the hazy circle can&#39;t be seen now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went to the back to see what was causing him to behave this way. I opened the back door to see what was going on and at first I did not see anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then out of the corner of my eye I noticed movement at about the 10 o clock position. There was an object in the sky hovering pretty low I would say at the height of about a 7 story building. I would estimate that it was around 25 to 30 feet in length.  It was triangular in shape and had a faint glowing light of a light red/amber color in each corner of the object (3 lights total). It made no sound at all, it just seemed to be stuck there not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was becoming rather fearful at this strange sight, but my curiosity got the better of me and I stepped off my back deck/step to get a better look and just as I did this the object began to move.  It moved slowly at first still without making a sound then it started doing something really strange it seemed to vanish and then reappear at a different place, it did this for a short time (less than 10 seconds) then shot off at a very high speed to the north.  All the while it did not make a single sound. I was unable to see what color the object was but there were reflections of city lights on it so it was a shiny surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape as I said was triangular but not perfectly triangular it was like the points of the triangle were cut off.<n>
