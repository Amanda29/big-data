I lived three miles away to the east at the time. During this period there were about 100 sightings, but those of us that remember don&#39;t talk about it much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Airbase was still open and they would scramble Fighters to intercept. But it was always the same. When the jets closed to 2 miles the object would go up at high speed. The jets would circle a while then land. Then sometimes it would come back down to its spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was repeated on many nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Always the same type of object, that changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have other employees who may remember the events submit reports, as well.  PD))<n>
