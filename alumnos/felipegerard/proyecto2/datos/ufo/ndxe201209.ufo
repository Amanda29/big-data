I saw the he same thing as reported on U-Tube; a red object round pointed cone in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I think outside the box....scaning different city streets, &amp; looking upward into the sky. what i found is amazing, hard to believe,and scareful.  Using my I-Phone,I took pictures of the diffent locations  and the believed UFO ojects.  Some consit of translucent colors ouside (round aura shield) with the ojects inside. Some of the objects are red round with nipple-tip in the center, then followed by the translucent shield (as if the shield is following or proecting it.  Some objects have a red saucer shape with light purple 1/2 round shape ball on top of them covered by the translucent shield or eye shape on Border Steet.  The other objects are just too unexplainable to describe.  I have many pictures...but are also found all over other cities.  May I text them to You?   My husband&#39;s I-Phone 4s won&#39;t let him view the city sreets like mine does.<n>

I left his place around 9:30pm.  I hoped on the 605 freeway soutbound to get the 10 freeway east. Right when I entered the 10 freeway I noticed these three red lights forming a triangle.  I thought to my self what the heck is that my son immediately saw the lights too and was like, &#34;What&#39;s that, daddy?&#34;  &#34;I don&#39;t know,: I replied.  as we got closer to the lights I lowered my window to see if I could hear the propellers of a helicopter our the engines on a plane nope!  There was no noise coming from this lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to look at this red lights in amazement the two lights on the side moved forward and was no longer a triangle but a straight line.  As we passed the light I exited the freeway and was going to turn back so I could follow it and try to record it on my phone.  I exited the freeway and tried to make my way back I went over the 10 freeway on a bridge and could see the lights, the two lights on the side just dimmed away and the middle light was the only one left and was also dimming away.  I didn&#39;t want to follow it anymore so I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I turned the power off to the hot tub to locate the direction of the rumble which by now the vibration could be felt physically while in the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound seemed to come from all directions, North, then South, East and West.  I could see no outline of an aircraft in all directions.  The sound increased as it appeared to fly over, but again, nothing appeared against the night sky…although commercial airlines were easily spotted along with their exhaust and/or contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As It seemed to pass to the West, I stepped out of the hot tub onto an adjoining deck and noticed two red light, similar to the port wing light of an aircraft although these did not flash.  Now, what was amazing was the distance between these lights.  I called my wife to jump up and look, which she did and also saw the lights which by now were several miles away.  The distance between these lights at best estimate was 2000’—and no siloutte of an aircraft.  We watch the lights disappear through the horizon, but the noise, still a very low rumble continued for another 4 – 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our home is situated within the apporach patterns of FAFB and have seen and heard aircraft from tankers to stealth fighter but have NEVER heard an engine noise of that low frequency or decibal level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it.<n>

They were travelling much faster than a commercial airplane and were travelling at the exact same speed, some a few degrees higher than the other, but in a straight trajectory and parallel to the horizon.  I actually rubbed my eyes and kept staring in the same direction (due NE out over Lake Ontario between Oakville and Mississauga) waiting to see if more bright orange lights would appear.  After 30 seconds, another single light flew by and then that was it.  It was still daylight and the these orange lights were very bright - much brighter than a flare. For the record, this is the first time that I have witnessed any type of UFO and this event really shook me up, enough so that I have been searching the internet for the past few days to see if anyone else in the Oakville, Burlington, Mississauga ot! Toronto area also experienced what I saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was facing north with my head resting toward the sky, almost straight up. Visibility was unlimited with no clouds, light winds from the west and about 90&amp;#730;F. It was a very quiet day with very little air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking at the clear blue sky I saw a tiny white dot almost overhead about the size of a dull pencil tip at arms length. I looked at it for a bit more and grabbed a pair of binoculars I had nearby, it appeared to be &amp;quot;metallic&amp;quot; white in color, oval in shape with a dark coloration toward the bottom of the object.  It was traveling northeast toward Pasadena-Arcadia in between my location and the San Gabriel Mountains. It was moving slowly so I ran inside to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned I was able to take 1 photo of the object at about a 95-80&amp;#730; angle before the roof of the house blocked it! from view. I took about 10 min to track about 4 hand widths of sky and my crude estimate would be that it was at about 10,000 to 15,000ft in altitude.<n>

As it continued to move along pulsating it slowly shrank down in size.  Then it just completely Stopping in the Air and stayed Still in the same Location for about 7 Minutes as it was being viewed with no movement because one could see the Tree Branches to compare it with my Eyes to see if it was Moving.  If it was going across it would become out of view by the Tree Branches.  It was still in View just staying stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the Orange Pulsating Round Object began moving again and slowly Shrank down in Size and disappeared out of site completely.  In other words it Vanished.  There was no signs of any other Aircraft in the Air at the time which was surprising considering the Nashville Airport has Airplanes going in and out all hours of the day which here in Hendersonville many Fly near the House and make t! urns.  There was Nothing in the Sky other than the Round Orange Pulsating object.  The only thing I noticed while standing on the Deck was one of the Neighbors Dogs was Barking and Barking.  Other then that there seemed to be no one around outdoors to see the object in the area which was surprising.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have no idea what it was other than to say it looked rather ODD considering it was BRIGHT ORANGE and ROUND just PULSATING that is what threw me off because normally the Airplanes in the Area ARE NOT ORANGE GLOWING at all.

He saw an interesting light kind of flickering.  Curiosity peaked, he came inside and got out the telescope ( not very good one).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he looked through it he could see what look like a colorful sphere of electricity in continual motion but not changing location much.  He called me out of bed, me thrilled of course, and I took a look.  When I took a look it seemed to me that it was constantly changing colors but multiple colors at the same time.   All I can think that it reminds me of is those glass spheres that you put your hands on and when you touch the glass the electricity comes towards your fingers but in colors- red, blue, green etc. all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much background here.

9/30/12 00:30|London (UK/England)||Circle|3-5 minutes|An amass of orangey-red dots in formation travelling across the night's sky.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93231.html|18|ndxe201209| An amass of orangey-red dots in formation travelling across the night&#39;s sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my original submission to UK UFO sightings I put the 29/9/2012 but as it was 12:30am it was actually the 30/9/2012. My apologies but the story is still the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house is located on the top of a hill in a residential area and our garden faces northeast London.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about or around 12:30am my son was outside having a cigarette when he came rushing into the house demanding that my wife and myself come outside and see these lights in the sky.  My wife got up went I reluctantly took my time.  Apparently my wife along with my son witnessed dots in the horizon of the night sky that appeared to be multiple orangey-red dots in an imperfect triangle like shape.  By the time I got to see where they were pointing; just above the roof tops between a gap in the distant houses the shape had changed formation.   However the dots where still there spread out horizontally in a cluster that spanned across the rooftops of about four(4) or five(5) houses.  Some of dots momentarily disappeared then reappeared as they moved eastward across the sky. Just before the first cluster disappeared altogether another formation was moving up in the background travell! ing in the same direction.  Just as we&#39;ve all in life joked about an alien invasion we found ourselves making the same jokes.  However the formation looked impressive and purposeful. These specs of light did as I’ve read in other articles of other alleged sighting raise the apprehension of an alien armada travelling through the night sky. (I can\&#39;t believe I\&#39;m actually saying that but its the only rational thought that sprang to mind when we witnessed it) Astonished by what we were seeing. I ran in the house and went to the first floor window which overlooks the garden to see if I could see things any better and I could. I called out to my son in the garden through the window to come and take a look from my vantage point, he did. Shortly afterward my wife came to calling for our late teenage daughter to join us which she also did. From the window we all witnessed the cluster or orangey-red specs bobbing up and down slightly moving across the night sky in an eastward directi! on.  An estimation of the first cluster of specs of light we s! aw was a bout twenty(20)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second lot we saw was about  30-40. The following link shows a couple of images that is almost an exact duplicate of what we witnessed. If you look at the first image and consider it as attached to the second image that\&#39;s what we all saw and watched for about two(2) - three(3) minutes. The biggest mistake was mine by announcing that I  was going to jump in the car and head in the direction of he lights to try and get a better look. Everyone announced that they wanted to come too. Unfortunately as I stated we live on a hill and everywhere we went to try and see was below our house lever so we couldn&#39;t see up in the nights sky distance. By the time we did find a high vantage point there was nothing to be seen. We returned home and it was the same thing everything had gone. My son did try to video it on his iphone 4s but the specs were so small in the distant night sky it could not pick them up as the glare from the street lights at rooftop level obscured t! he specs. He deleted the video. Now I know everyone\&#39;s first sceptical opinion going to be \&#39;Chinese lanterns\&#39; but in order for a Chinese lantern to be seen as a spec the size of the first image some 2-3 miles away with the naked eye it would have to be at least the size if not greater than an hot air balloon on fire not a candle.  This is my honest account of what we saw on the night of the 29/09/2012 at about 12:30am make of it what you will but the story remains the same...we saw what we all saw. The image of multiple specs of orangey-red lights travelling eastward across the night sky before shortly disappearing with another cluster coming up behind them travelling in the same direction. And it looked exactly like the link images if you joined the first image with the second as a single photo. I\&#39;m not asking anyone to believe me but I just wanted to say what we saw.

They immediately froze absolutely no words or movement was made by them while this was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I almost was Frozen!  But I fought it.  The very first thing I saw was what appeared to be a firework above the tree level in all red-ish orange flares however these flares reversed direction and created this very large red-ish Mostly Orange Orb.  It did not fly in a straight line.  The glow was massive to the eye!  I felt like it was going to abduct us and panic was setting in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did my very best to stay calm and focused and pulled my Cellphone 8G Camera up and ready and took the video  But was unable to get it up in time for the beginning of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I asked the object to fly to my right...  And it did....  I asked it to do this because I did not feel like inviting the object was a good idea at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a link to the Video please ask me at ((e-address deleted))<n>
9/30/12 00:00|Delray Beach|FL|Circle|5 minutes|Circular round lights the color of a flame moving in the sky above Delray Beach, FL mid-night 12/29/12|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93197.html|20|ndxe201209| Circular round lights the color of a flame moving in the sky above Delray Beach, FL mid-night 12/29/12<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaving the movie theater in Delray Beach, Florida along U.S. highway 1 around mid-night on Sat. Sept. 29, 2012 when we notice a number of people in the parking lot looking up at the night sky and some were apparently attempting to video what the saw on their phone cameras.  When I looked up with my son, I could see about 6 small (although apparently distant) light orange (color of a lighter flame maybe slightly darker) colored round or sperical objects at an attitude of about 10-11 o&#39;clock looking West to East.  As there were Royal palm trees in the parking lot as well as light inh my vision was a time obstructed although I could hear other people saying the saw as many as eight or more lights.  Personally,  I only could see at most six lights at one point and at times as few as only two as the others were obstructed by palms, etc.  They did not move together in any sort of pattern but appeared rather to move in all different seemingly random directions! ...sometimes fast and at other times slow...sometimes closer together and at other times moving away from each other.  Saw a group of two at one point move off together but then split in radically different directions.  Considered maybe they could be jet afterburners at first (seen at a distance) but the irratic movement, time of night, and the more orange color just didn&#39;t seem to fit.  Objects appeared small but distant so I do not believe any accurate estimate of actual size can be given. As to speed...well that would depend on size and distance which I could not attempt to estimate but I would guess it was faster than a one engine plane at all times.  As our viewing locating was less than one mile from the Atlantic Ocean coast, the objects could have been traveling immediately above the coastline, in general. Due to the late hour, my son and I left the scene and when into Appleby&#39;s Restaurant so we did not spend more than five minutes viewing the event.  As far as I know! , the event continued as the objects were not moving in any on! e direct ion at any constant speed...other spectators continued to watch.  Did not see anything in the news or in response to internet search, so I decided to post and see if it would act as a catalyst for other people to report the event.<n>

It was a full moon with very few clouds. My friend who was fishing at the back of the boat said to me, &amp;quot;what is that?&amp;quot; When I looked back toward the marina we saw what looked like three fireballs in sort of a triangular formation flying at a slow speed. I would compare the speed to a fast moving helicopter. There was no sound coming from them and they were probably at a two o&#39;clock position from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved over the marina and out over the lake they spread out a little and each one moved staight up through the thin cloud layer and disappeared out of sight. Less than a minute later there were two more orange fireballs like the first three that came from the same direction over the marina and followed the first three though the cloud cover.  I thought it was over but maybe a minute later here comes one more ! single fireball flying over the marina and following the last five we had just seen.  They reminded me of the the fireballs that come out of a roman candle I use to shoot on the fourth of July years ago.  But these fireballs were pulsating and flying at a much lower speed with no sound.  They seemed to be in control and knew exactly what they were doing and where they were going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Coast to Coast AM radio a few nights earlier when I heard two of these were sighted in New London Ohio which is just twelve miles from my home in Ashland and I was just telling my co-worker about these orange fireballs before we left for this fishing trip.<n>

We were only about a hundred yards from our drive way when an orange spherical orbe of light i had time to see it because i was thoughtfully looking at the moon.  We live in the country so there isnt much light polution. When the orbe came in to view it was moving faster than any jet or normal aircraft i have ever seen in my life.  It was moving at such a speed that it cleared rear horizon to front horizon in no more than two seconds.  It had no dust trail or tail like a meteor does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am intrested in science of all kinds so i watch shows like ufo files and ect.  Not to mention the orb from my point of view the objects was about the size of a half dollar.  The encounter only lasted 2 seconds.  I would like to know if similar sightings have been reported.  Thank you.<n>

I was driving Northbound on Lewis coming up on Sterns on Saturday night at 10:10pm on 09/29/12.  I was stunned by 6 to 8 bright orange balls of light moving in formation over Lewis heading towards Smith.  I thought they were landing or coming down they were so close.  It was hard to tell if they were above or below the clouds since I couldn&#39;t just sit and watch.  Wasn&#39;t sure if they were meteors coming down at first but they were moving across the sky in formation so I don&#39;t think so. I lived a block away so went to get my camera and family to see.  We could barely see from our condo but we did see one of them through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so freaked out I was shaking.  This was definitely some sort of UFO&#39;s.  After I settled down I did some research on the internet and found this has been a very common phenomenon over the years all over the world.  Below is an image from the National UFO reporting center.  This is very close to what I saw moving down Lewis ave.  I didn&#39;t get to really watch closely as I was driving.  I turned west on Sterns to get home and grab my camera.  I was so shook up I was going to drive back but didn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the eeriest thing I&#39;ve ever seen and truly believe I just saw my first UFO ever.  I haven&#39;t heard anything on the news about it but cannot believe nobody else saw it.  I actually was sitting at the light at Lewis and Sterns, Stuck my head out the window and was looking South west trying to see them better than through the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Image did not copy.<n>

I jokingly said to her, &#34;Check it out, it&#39;s a UFO,&#34; but the longer I looked it just didn&#39;t seem like a plane.  It wasn&#39;t blinking, moving very slow, and she said, &#34;I think you&#39;re right, because that&#39;s no plane.&#34;   We were stuck at a red light and all of a sudden it disappeared right before our eyes.  It was the oddest thing, and the overpowering sense of fear that I felt.  I can&#39;t prove it was a UFO because as I mentioned we were in the car and I could not justify the direction of the wind or anything.  Maybe it was one of those Chinese lanterns, but I figured sending a report wouldn&#39;t hurt, maybe somebody else saw it.<n>

I have never witnessed anything personally, but all the reports of sightings everywhere has had me intrigued. My husband, my two daughters and I went to Springfield today, and on our trip in, I was telling them what interesting things I had learned in my recent research.  Again, on our way home our conversation again led to the topic of my research. Jokingly, my daughter pointed out the window of our truck, and said she had spotted a ufo. I made a joke also, and then we agreed that we wouldn’t make any more jokes, and that if we really ever see one, we would be able to know if the other was truthful or not? No sooner had we said that,  a very bright white sphere appeared on the north side.  Not in the sky, but next to us, about 100 feet away. It was gone almost as soon as it had appeared.  My husband yelled out “What the hell was that?”   None of us had an answer. We were st! unned. We certainly had not expected to see anything at all, and certainly not so close or low! We agreed that we had all seen the same thing, but had no explanation of what it could have been other than what we had been talking about. It looked to be about the size of a basketball from our view. It also appeared to leave a trail, like it was moving very fast.  What we saw, was not like what I have been reading about. The experience was very eerie.  This event happened while traveling west on Lynx Hollow Road, about 3 miles up Lynx Hollow Road, which is about 7 miles south of the town of Creswell.  It happened at approximately 9:45 pm. It was dark outside, and the area is very much a country setting.<n>

We thought it was a meteor until it broke into 4 separate pieces that continued to fall and had very long tails of light.  The four lights and their tails then disappeared after falling for about ten seconds.  We thought they were gone until they reappeared about ten seconds later in a perfect diagonal line in the shape of simple orbs. They continued to move from a diagonal to a straight line and back and forth for about 2-3 minutes until they had fallen so low we could no longer see them.  The light from each one was not consistent either, they would be lit for about five seconds, would flicker out and then would reappear.<n>

All the lights were off everywhere in the house uncluding bedroom.  As sat on my bed to pull covers on me, 3 bright orange lights appeared out of nowehere out of my window.  They were quite high up in the sky.  The 3 lights followed each other moving fast then suddenly disappeared.  The leader light was falling down from the sky as though wanted to land, lights flickered on and off.  I could see that there were fire lights as trying to land.  The whole duration lasted about 3mins.  I paused with confusion then went back to bed.  Was just about to pull covers over me again as another orange light appeared from no-where.  It flew in the same direction to catch up with the others.  This light lasted about 1and half minutes.  The light disappeared. Incredible but scary. When I saw the fourth light, an aeroplane was flying lower than it.  I could recognise the aeroplane but not the orange lights.  On the 2nd of September at the exact sam! e time in crawley, I had seen a single bright orange light,  Thought it was very unusual but then didn&#39;t think anything of it until I saw the above mentioned.<n>

9/29/12 20:30|Buffalo|NY|Unknown|3-5 minutes|6 orange reddish, flashing lights,  slowly coming off the horizon joining in formation|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93191.html|36|ndxe201209| 6 orange reddish, flashing lights,  slowly coming off the horizon joining in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night at about 8:30 p.m. is when the event took place. However let me start by saying  the original object I observed has been in the sky for months. I first spotted it in March, looks like a bright star, only its strobing and blinking different colors. I grabbed my friends cheap telescope,  got it in view, and once the object was in focus, I was shocked to see it was 4 lights in a straight line, evenly spaced(also nothing was flashing, as appose to out of focus). I was very surprised and exited, as I’m very into this type of thing, and always wanted to personally witness something. This got me very interested in this “star” , and anytime I’d be outside at night I’d look for it. As said, I’ve observed it for months now parked in the same spot moving across the sky with the rest of the stars, like nothing irregular(other than the strobing lights) and was there the whole time until yesterday.  Sorry for the little pre -story but I felt it was necessary  	So last night around 8:15 I started walking to my buddy’s house to hang out, and as always when I’m walking, I look for my star. I take a look at it in the gaps between trees and houses.  As I’m nearing my friends house I see there’s now 2 of the strobing stars next to each other.  This other one hasn’t been there any other time I look. As I get to another gap where I can see the objects again, I notice they are now spaced farther apart. I’m all worked up now, and go sprinting to my friends house, I really didn’t want to be the only one to see this.  My friend wasn’t home right then so I grabbed his neighbor to come out.  Now there were three of these lights, flashing and pulsating an orangish reddish glow, all in a misshapen triangle form, with another one of the lights drifting up from the horizon to join the other three.  Then there was a smaller triangular formation that looked almost identical in formation just smaller, slowly drift up from the horizon.  At this point it was! me, my friends neighbor, and his wife and daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then  my friend pulled in his house, and my other friend who lives up the street came down, and then we had my 2 friends, and my friends mom and sister come look. At this point is when the objects started slowly dissipating. The lower, smaller triangle formation all dimmed slowly until they were gone, then what was left was the larger triangle formation. However now they were equidistant from each other, in a symmetrical  triangle until they all slowly dimmed out. What I thought was interesting, was the fact that atleast the one light, I’ve observed for months, and the fact that last night I just watched this happen and now that light is gone, it‘s truly an awesome experience. A few details I forgot to put in, was that it was quite cloudy, and no stars we’re visible, these were the only visible lights in the sky. And the movement of the objects was all very slow, they slowly came up and they slowly disappeared. Hoping that others have seen this, maybe even got video, I! know my friends mom and nieghbor got a few pictures  towards the end of it all, but a video would really be nice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

O.K. when we first seen it, it moved in a long sweeping arcing motion coming in from the north west not changing in size or shape color or consistancy of the random flicker, it was between 1000 and 1500 feet.  we were watching this thing about 2/3 of the way through its arc, (now heading away toward the southwest),  my brother again motioned to the northwest, there was another, then another,  then my friend moitioned due west where we saw another one. the first 3 all followed the same track at the same speed and ! altitude,  the one in the west, that one was at the moving in tandom same apparent speed and altitude.  they were all identicle in size, shape, motion, heading, speed, altitude, and the flickering attitude.  we talked about it afterward, (the duration of this event was 8-10 minutes). there was no noise what so ever.  i contacted the ionia count sherrif today, 9/30/12, and asked if there were any reports of this type last evening, the dispatcher told me that they had no report of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

9/29/12 19:58|Seattle|WA|Light|3-4 minutes|[seattle] Chain of 8 equally spaced, fast moving constant orange lights over Cascades, Western Washington.|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93227.html|41|ndxe201209| [seattle] Chain of 8 equally spaced, fast moving constant orange lights over Cascades, Western Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My location was on Queen Anne, near Fremont Bridge facing east over Lake Union, Lake Washington and the Cascades.  Clear night, moon was approx 20deg up from horizon (google sky map &amp;quot;time travel&amp;quot; feature could give more accurate detail).  Was about to mount my motorcycle, stopped, took helmet off and stood in driveway.  First sighting was a fairly bright orange/somewhat red light passing visually just below the moon heading south.  I tried to rationalize the sight, looking for a &#39;tail&#39; of a comet, asteroid, blinking strobes of an airplane.  Nothing made sense, no modulation of light, no strobes, no other color lights and it was nearly as bright and big as the red &#39;strobes&#39; on the I5 bridge.  Speed was about a palm width every two seconds.. also strangely fast.  As soon as the light had traveled about 4 palm widths at arms length across the sky, another showed up on the same exact path, same speed, same brightness.  My view of where the lights had o! riginated from was obscured by a large apartment building across the street.   The original light continued on its path, followed by the other, quite a distance (maybe another four or five palm widths).  By this time, with the exact same spacing and speed, another light had appeared just left and below the moon.  There were three visible at this moment.   The original light became dim, flickered and within a palm width distance was gone.  I made a couple of phone calls, of which my neighbor answered and was walking down Dexter Ave and into the driveway at that moment.  He and I watched a remaining four or five, as a total of 8 lights traveled the same path, the same speed and with the same exact spacing across the sky, flickering and disappearing at the same exactly spot in the sky (except the last one).  The last light made a path, arcing visually &#39;higher&#39; than the others and flickered out at the same timing/distance as the others.   I wish I could have seen it from my bal! cony, as I&#39;m sure by the intensity of light, and how mathemati! cally sp aced and accurate they appeared, they would have created a chain of lights throughout the horizon.  I work in IT as a programmer, have been a military aircraft enthusiast since a very early age, and for whatever reason didn&#39;t think to use my phone for video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To note:  There were other aircraft in the sky throughout the sighting, commercial airliners and a small prop plane.  I could hear the prop plane clearly, but nothing else out of the ordinary.  Every airplane in the sky had distinct red/green/white strobes, and were of &#39;normal&#39; speed.  The flight path of commercial airliners normally fly west towards my apartment, then bank close enough that in most cases I can make out the branding/logo on the planes (in daylight).  After this sighting, throughout the night all of the commercial airliners were making their turns towards seatac much further away (east) than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After working all day, and nearing sunset, it was discovered that we were lacking a few supplies so my wife volunteered to run to the local big box store while my father-in-law and I stayed back to keep working.  My wife pulled out of the driveway sometime between 7:00 to 7:30 PM EST.  The day was a perfect autumn day: crisp temperatures, beautiful sunny skies with large fluffy clouds and as the evening progressed the clouds appeared ominously dark in contrast to the gorgeous sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still light enough to see, but the sun was definitely starting to set.  I happened to step back from working for a second to stretch my back and as I looked up above my head there was a large circular object.  The object appeared to be a bright orange sphere that looked almost like it was on fire.  It pulsated slightly and appeared to have energy waves around it.  At times there were even hints of yellowish-orange around the edges, and it almost seemed to faintly change shape.  At this point my Father-in-law was working with me.  My Mother-in-law and Brother-in-law had just come out of the house to see the progress on the steps.  Upon spotting the object I immediately alerted everyone.  They turned to see the object and the same question seemed to echo between us all, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  The &#34;Burning&#34; sphere was like a glowing orange ember from a bonfire, intensely bright and beautiful.  It seemed to be flying high in the sky, but then strangely it passed under the clouds which seemed to be somewhere around Cessna altitude range (5000 to 9000 ft.).  The object also appeared to be traveling fairly fast (about as fast as a military jet), and made absolutely no sound what-so-ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Brother-in-law made some comment that it was probably just one of those floating Chinese lanterns that had finally caught on fire, but as I said to him, &#34;There wasn’t a visible fire, it was just glowing an intense orange color, and Chinese lanterns don’t fly that fast!&#34;   I watched the object for about 10 minutes until it appeared to disappear.  We all talked about the sighting later trying to come up with what it possibly could be and agreed that<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was definitely glowing like an ember, it was not just a reflection from the sun; and it was moving very fast and without a sound.<n>

It seemed to be in the shape of a diamond.  We watched and parked quickly in a near-by parking lot to watch and they just disappeared, except for two lights that seemed to stay a while longer.  It appeared that they just suddenly went higher in the sky and went out of sight.  There was no sound.  I was able to count 11 lights, but there could have been more.  I called local TV station to see if anyone else saw them.  At that time they had not.  There were no strobe lights like a plane would have and no sound like a helicopter and they were much too high it appeared fot that.  We do not think they could possibly been 11 aircraft there and with no sound.....????<n>

My mother asked me about those rare lights and immediately I thought they were two helicopters, but then I searched for strobe lights and flashing aircraft lights and noticed they were two strange and silent orange (flair like) balls.  They were flying separate but fairly closed.  They traveled North West.  They were not high. At least, they seem about 600-800 feet high over ground level.  The first one, stopped and “waited for the other one” then disappeared. The next fireball reached the same area and disappeared.  We saw them at approximately 45 degree angle from the car.  We felt so excited, that I stopped the car in the middle of the highway, I open my sunroof and took my body out so I could see them clear.  We felt kind of euphoric. I was happy to see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in the grass within my backyard, peering into the clear blue sky at 5:00pm CST.  I haven&#39;t done this recently, however I&#39;ve decided to live through my twin toddlers eyes lately.  The Sun was obviously still up...  And I was mesmerized by a tiny jet leaving its line in the sky (40-50k ft most likely).   The jet happened to pass what appeared to be a star... Bright star at that... Directly above me in the sky.   I looked away, rubbed my eyes, and looked again.  It took only a moment to find it again.   Not moving at all too.  I know it wasn&#39;t moving because I raised my arm and pointed at it... Stationary on the ground.  It didn&#39;t move ... Then it drifted straight south... At about the speed of that airliner.  I&#39;ve seen satellites at night... But never during this bright daylight hour.   Anybody experience anything like this?<n>

Both confirmed the presence and neither had an explanation.  This is the 2nd time this month I have observed this craft.  Other time was on a late afternoon early in September or late August.<n>

My first thought was that it was a helicopter even though it seemed to have too many lights on it and they seemed to be the wrong colors.  They appeared to be flashing randomly and the altitude of the object was awfully low.   Then I noticed that I could not see any rotor blades and the tail section was missing.  I do not know how to explain this, but my mind was working very hard to make rotors and tail section visible, but that did not happen.  There was NO sound. On the rough sketch I said that it was periwinkle color, but it was a DARK periwinkle color.   The body was glassy-smooth and looked to be very highly polished.  It flew over the house directly above my window and the entire episode took place in less than two seconds.  I have no idea what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sizes that I have listed are only estimates.  The position of the lights on the flat plane may have been arranged in a slightly different pattern, otherwise the drawings give a good idea of the thing that I saw.<n>

Whatever it was made the neighbors dogs bark loudly.  Afterwards, I jumped up look out of the bathroom window to see if someone was trying to break in.  I have an alarm system so I wasn’t too worried.  However, since the dogs kept barking, I decided to call my son (in the next room) on his cell phone to see if he would get up and go with me to go investigate.  He didn’t answer the phone.  My flood lights were on so I figured maybe it was just a small animal that was roaming out back for food.  For precaution, I put the television on to wait for a while to see what would happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after 4 AM, I went ahead and turned off the television..  Shortly after, I was asleep when I heard another very loud sound on top of the roof followed by a sound like “chhhhhhhhhh” boom.  Within seconds green lights beamed through by bedroom ceiling.  There were about 3 to 4 green lights evenly spaced apart shining through each side of the ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instantly I knew what it was and what was going on.  I was spread out on my back and something beamed through me for what seemed to be a minute or two.  As I silently prayed and asked God to make sure I wasn’t taken from my babies and to please be allowed to touch my daughter at least one more time.  I felt like my right hand was allowed to be extended, but a figure appeared and touched my hand instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

When i was passing through a dark road, which i pass everyday for the past 6 years, i noticed something in the sky.  It looked like a spotlight, but boomerang shaped, it was going fast, like some kind of light was being projected in the sky.  The sky was cloudy, so it really looked like a light projection, either from bellow the clouds or above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it as i thought it was a reflex or something like that.  However after 50-100 meters i saw it again, this time going on the opposite direction (from right to left) with the pointy part of the boomerang always facing the direction the object/light was taking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to look at the sky to check exactly what it was. I didn&#39;t see it for a while, but then saw it again and again.  I saw it around 6 times, being the last one near a roundabout, aprox. 300-400 meters from when i saw it the first time.  Most of the times it was going from left to right but i saw it at least twice going from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was traveling extremely fast and going on both directions randomly.  The size of the object was like a big sized plane at the minimum altitude.  However i didn&#39;t hear any sound.<n>

I turn to my roommate and asked him What kind of planes look like that.  He couldn&#39;t recall any kind of plane that had four extremely bright white lights on the belly of the plane/craft.  The two of the white lights were on top then the other two lights were down lower making the shape of a rectangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it hover for a second when two bright red lights started flashing at us.  The UFO started flying away to the left when in the next second it was suddenly on the right side of the Sky where we watched it gain speed then change its course now flying straight up.  We watched it until we couldn&#39;t see the tiny red lights any more<n>

We noticed the sound of an airplane, the small kind that only one or two people can sit in.  We noticed a bright orange light moving very quickly over us in a straight line West to East.  At first we thought it was the plane we heard, but as it sped across the sky, we realized it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object had no blinking lights.  It was bright, like the size of Venus on an early spring morning, but orange in hue.  With a full moon tonight, the clouds were illuminated, and this object was flying beneath them.  It was out of sight within 15 seconds, miles and miles away, but we still heard that biplane somewhere, so we know that the object was something else entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was never obscured by houses or trees at any point. It either disappeared, or was simply so fast it was hundreds of miles away in mere seconds.  I am a very logical thinker, and I cannot imagine what, in my index of known objects, this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments after, a commercial plane flew in from another direction. It was blinking and went behind the clouds. The UFO was, without a doubt, not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I first observed them for approximately thirty seconds the first two were flying relatively close to one another but soon began to move slowly apart they were heading in a westerly direction.  The size of the objects were approximately three quarters the size of a full moon they also exhibited a weak light pulsing effect (glowing).  After the first thirty seconds of observation I ran inside and shouted to my parents, &#34;There&#39;s UFO&#39;s outside!  Come quick!  Come quick!?  My parents both rushed out to observe the rest of event. Within ten seconds of observation by all three of us my father noticed a third object of exactly the same description as the other two which was further behind the other two objects but heading in the same direction. The third object followed behind the other two and we observed them disappearin! g to the west in approximately two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional observations:  Sound: None Height Estimation From Ground: 1.5 KM Speed Estimation: 200 KM/H Additional Objects: A plane within the same general vicinity Other Witnesses: I talked with a person who lives down the street from me who also witnessed these objects from a different view point. His description of initial observation was that he saw all three flying in a triangular formation and they came from the South-East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background information of myself: I grew up in the area and have lived in Brampton my whole life, this is the second time in my life that I have observed UFO(s) in my area. First time was when I was Eighteen years old (Approximately twelve years ago) I have never reported this sighting. I&#39;m a fairly down to Earth kind of person who enjoys the outdoors (primarily fishing) I also am fairly computer savvy and enjoy creating fan based video game content.<n>

I thought that they were possibly meteors and we were sure they were going to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as we turned the car around a bend in the road and I reached for my camera phone, one of them changed direction and flew west.  It moved so fast we couldn&#39;t track it.  We looked for the other one but it had completely vanished.  The first one was just above the tree line when it changed direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just left my friend&#39;s daughter&#39;s house and as we were getting into the car, her 3year old grandson was babbling excitedly about  a  Christmas tree star and pointing up at the sky.  We had all laughed and told him that he must have seen an airplane.  It was only a few minutes after this that we had our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both very shaken by the experience and would like to know if anyone else saw this or can offer an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 year old teacher and mother of four sons and my friend is a disabled grandmother of eight.  We are at a loss to explain this as we regularly see all types of aircraft (including military) here.<n>

I saw four flying object that looked liked fire all moving quickly across the sky with no sound or noise that you would expect from a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were heading from West to East at the same speed and after several minutes they appeared to get smaller as if gaining altitude and then they disappeared one at a time.  The first two disappeared withing 5 seconds of one another and then about 30 seconds later the third vanished followed by the fourth only 10 seconds after that.<n>

It was about 9:30pm. I caught two of them on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Description: They were not lanterns, they were moving across the sky at a high rate of speed and they were clearly in the stratosphere.  They were bright orange and much larger than any airplane light or weather balloon.  They actually shimmered like balls of flame.  We could see them from the horizon as we turned the corner onto our street.   We watched for ten minutes as one by one they moved across the sky until they went past and then we couldn&#39;t see their light any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned off both our cars in the driveway so we could hear if their was any sound emanating from the objects and they were totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three teenagers across the street watching the same thing.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  They moved irregularly, but fast.  They did not glow of a normal light.  They were more like glowing embers with a red core that you could see more clearly as the orange/yellow would fade, until finally when they were just past &amp;quot;overhead&amp;quot;, they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Flagler Beach, FL<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walked outside a seen a large vertical triangle shape of flickering orange lights slowly flying by over the intercoastal waterway about 2000 ft up.  They went about 2 miles and then faded out.  Each light was about a couple hundred feet apart in a perfect vertical shape.  After they faded out another single one came by flying strait across the night sky at the same altitude and faded out around the same area.  Both sets of lights were moving kinda slow.  There were a few nimbus clouds in the back ground but no lightning.<n>

It was about the same color as the clouds that night.  I have no idea what is was...but it was such an incredible sight.  We could tell it was much higher than an airplane.  It was minimum 20 times the wingspan of a 747.  That&#39;s what was so shocking about it.  It seemed to be fuzzy around the edges...like a cloud...but unmistakably not a cloud. It was a giant wing shaped object...traveling a little slower than the typical passenger jets that fly over regularly. No lights at all...no sound. I found a couple picture on the internet that match it perfectly.<n>

I looked across Lake Shore Drive I spotted an elderly man staring up into the sky.  I looked up and saw 4 orange globes - three making a “v” shape and the fourth about an arms length in front of the point on the V.  I questioned out loud “What the hell is that?”   They were moving extremely slowly over Lake Shore Drive moving westbound so they were directly in front of my bus.  As I watched one of the three globes move in line and one stayed to my left making the appearance something resembling a whaling harpoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching as the globes began to close in on each other.  First one blinked out, then a second.  As I moved the bus around the corner heading north on LSD I noticed the third blinked out.  I had pulled out my cell phone to snap a picture of the globes then realized a passenger was still on the bus with me. As my employer does not approve of cells phones on the job and many passengers will report this I tucked it away into my pocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved the bus down the street about a block I asked the man whether or not he had seen four glowing orange globes and he immediately said “Yes!  What was that?”  I told him I was pretty sure I knew and he said “That was a ufo!  I live in upper state New York and have seen many lights in the sky but nothing that close!”  I told him I believed there were 4 ufos as they moved independently of each other in different directions.  There was no sound.  Just 4 beautiful orange globes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I let him off a block later and turned the bus around to go south on LSD back to Addison West I saw a young Oriental girl staring up into the sky watching the last of the orange globes which promptly disappeared before my eyes.<n>

It seemed to be made up of 10-11 smaller circular green lights, all of equal size and none blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object flew at a consistent speed and was too bright to be at a high altitude but was too quiet (silent) to be at a low altitude.   This motivated me to follow the object across the sky, expecting it to turn toward one of the airports nearby.  It didn&#39;t and instead decreased in speed, finally stopping directly &#34;under&#34; a distant, yellow-white star.  At this point my father-in-law and wife started viewing the object, as I had been narrating the trajectory to them as kind of a satire on UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; above the object changed to red. Not light red but fully red. This was NOT a star at all.   Soon thereafter a third object, much smaller or farther away, moved directly over the two objects, then frooze.  Then it was gone.  We got out binoclulars and were able to clearly see the multiple green lights on the original object.  The second object also could be seen going from red to white aver minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these objects slowly dipped below the horizon another set of 3 bright objects came into view and formed a triangle, then remained motionless, until also slipping out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For all of us, it was our first UFO experience.<n>

The orange streak was moving close to my direction, about SSE, perhaps 190 to 200 degrees on the compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was notable for several reasons. It was moving extremely fast. It was almost a pumpkin orange, not at all like the burst of light from a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appeared to be low, maybe several hundred yards above me, although this is my best guess, have no way to quantify that altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n>

On 28.9.2012 at approximately 20h05 the sky was clear and the nearly full moon high up on our right as seen from the balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A greenish-blue  several millimeter large oval moved with great speed more or less from NW to SW coming down at an angle of approximately 20 degrees.  After maybe 5 seconds it developed a small triangular red tail and disappeared more or less in the W and about 30 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time we spotted an unusually bright white star perpendicularly above us, moving fast to the N gradually becoming fainter and disappearing as if moving upward some 20 degrees to the left of the moon.  There were no sounds of an engine nor a sonic boom.  Both probably linked phenomena took approximately 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I saw this and one other person in the same location also confirmed to have seen it.<n>

We sit on our front porch at night and it really caught our eye.  We kept watching it and after about an hour, it started moving further West, at a very slow speed.  We watched it until we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today is October 1st, and I now see 4, possibly 5 of them.  They seem to appear right around 8:00 p.m, the first one leaves at about 9:10 p.m. and the others seem to slowly move West about 30 minutes later.  They are a beautiful sight through binoculars, wish we had a telescope to get a better look.  They are here as I type.  I really encourage you to check this out.  Our house faces WEST and we are in central Florida.  The different objects are aligned pretty far from each other, but in the same coordinates!!!<n>

As it turned, we noticed that one side had many lights and the other side did not.  If you live in a flight zone, which we do, (this was not in the flight zone) you see planes flying over relatively low).  That aircraft was flying even lower than that?&#34;  We could not hear any sound coming from the craft.  When I saw it, I immediately rolled down my window….<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made a sharp turn and began to move towards the East, towards Matlock Drive, so we pursued.. It did not turn like a commercial aircraft would, moving in a slow bank, it just turned on a dime and began moving in the other direction..  It continued toward the East so we pulled over in an area where we could continue watching.  It was then that we saw something unbelievable!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object continued moving away from us but still very visible, one of the lights on the aircraft shot straight up into the air, which turned out to be a smaller aircraft.  It was much smaller of course and it began to circle around in a large circle around the larger aircraft that it took off from.  As it was following the larger aircraft, the next unbelievable thing happened.  Another very large aircraft just like the first one we saw, appeared in the same airspace as the other two, coming from the Northwest and it caught up with the other two flying objects 2 very large objects and one small one.  They all 3 continued flying to the East..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, Saturday, September 29, 2012, I googled UFO sightings for Mansfield,  Texas and there is a video that interestingly dates September 29, 2010.  The object in this video looks very similar to the one we saw on the 28th, 2012, but the one we saw was much lower in flight..<n>

Morphed to oblong oval before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In our backyard, my girlfriend had noticed a bright helicopter light, probably 10-15 miles away. We often focus on these things, in hopes, to one day see a UFO for ourselves.  As the light moved closer towards us from the south east, the object took a shape.  To our astonishment, the object was pyramid shaped.  The light that was on the vehicle was set at the base of the pyramid.  This light did not have beam like qualities, but it seemed to be spotting.  The craft would stop, rotate the light around the body, stop the light to observe something, then continue on it&#39;s path.  We watched as the object moved closer and closer.  After about 2 minutes the object was probably 2 miles away from us at the most.  It was BIG!  There also seemed to be some kind of &amp;quot;Heat-wave&amp;quot; aura around it, like heat waves you see coming off of the hot streets in the summer.  There were no sounds that we could hear from the object.  At its closest point to us, estimating about 2 miles, the object turned towards the South west.  Before the craft disappeared behind the trees, it had sort of morphed into a more oval/oblong shape.  As soon as the thing had left our sight, we dashed for the car.  We traveled down I 635 in hopes to find the path of the object.  There was no trace of this object!  One thing to note: few seconds after this had left our sight, a large commercial like plane flew pretty low in the same direction as the ufo. We find this odd because there is no major airport to the sw of us.<n>

Then I next realized that it was a few miles in front of me now crossing the road I was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sped up and got to where it was just on the other side on the road Hovering above the tree tops on the left side of the road about a quarter of a mile off the main road (that I was on).  It was a strange shape like a triangular shape with lights on each corner and on light in the middle.  It hovered there for a solid minute, as I watched the lights in my rear view mirror I turned around and headed back towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned around and headed back towards the lights I noticed it went straight up as if it were hovering like a helicopter taking off and when I looked again it shot really fast across the road and it was gone.  Gone. I came to the clearing in the trees where a field was and you could see the open sky and land for miles and there was nothing.  The lights/object had completely vanished.<n>

It grew very loud, and many people thought it might be a tornado.  It faded, then came back even louder, almost as if circling the Island.  People on the north side of the Island report seeing a bright flash, some reported seeing strange airplane lights and jet lights, then the jet noises faded.  Several reported seeing airplane lights.  There was some severe weather 30 miles north, in DC, but it was mostly clear down here, so I don&#39;t think it was weather.  My theory: jet intercept of something approaching Washington, DC, and the flash were afterburners of the jets?<n>

This is a wide-open area with a great view of the night sky.  It was mostly cloudy with no stars visible.  Sunset was an hour before at 7:20 PM EDT.  As soon as we stopped, we noticed what we thought was a low flying helicopter approaching from north to south heading directly toward us with what appeared to be a bright deep orange light shining from it. It was close being only about 150 to 250 feet high (twice as high as a tall tree) and about 200 yards in front of us traveling very slow.  The closer it approached, the more we realized that it wasn’t normal.  For a moment we both thought it was a helicopter or a small plane that was on fire and about to crash. What we had first thought was a light turned out to be more of an intense deep orange glow that encompassed the entire roundish obje! ct and changed hues so that it resembled a fire.  It made no sound at all. It was a very quiet evening and we made a point to listen closely.  The object was definitely about the same size as a helicopter. I signaled at it for about 15 seconds with a flashlight until it was about 50 yards in front of us (alarmingly close), still at about 150-250 feet high.  It then made a sharp 90 degree turn and moved rapidly out of sight toward the east.   The whole event lasted about 90 seconds with about 85 seconds of approaching toward us and about 5 seconds moving quickly away from us. (Note: Although I am just now submitting this description, it was written the morning after the sighting.)<n>

It was immediately obvious that they were not aircraft as they seemed to hang up in the air, and the red/orange glow they gave off was very bright and luminous, making their distance close enough to rule out any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hung in the air and upon closer inspection I could see them moving across the sky in a relatively equidistant triangular pattern.   After about three minutes they seemed to get very far away or dim quickly (it was hard to tell) and winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is driving me crazy because I am skeptical about these things and my first instinct was that these were some type of weather balloons or chinese lanterns due to the appearance of them floating and being a fire-y red/orange but there was something very strange about them that I couldn&#39;t put my finger on that made me continue to watch until they disappeared.  Anyways, I&#39;m just very curious to see when the new batch of reports come out if anyone in my area saw these as well!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very loud, seemed to resonate  all thru the area and I found it very hard to pin-point...Lasted about 30 secs or so..I went a few blocks ahead and looked up in the eastern sky and saw FRESH CONTRAILS approx 50 degrees off the horizon, there were two of them and the more visable one was having the &amp;quot;EYELASHES FORM&amp;quot; from it and drop down, I looked again and the contrails seemed to arc from the south horizon out to east going along the Jersey Coast out to LONG ISLAND. It was also at an extremely high altitude  for me to see it.. The other smaller contrail hung there for a while but  faded out.The thicker contrail had the FALLING EYELASH Effect for about 15-20 mins after the tremendous roar..<n> <n><n> <n><n> IMO  this was  the AURORA  type craft coming or going from the area with an escort craft with it..it was partly cloudy y out, about 72 degrees in temp , Don&#39;t know if this would classify as a UFO sighting but the tremendous roar and wierd contrail would  make it  classification for the mystery noises all aroundnthe country...OUR AUROURA???  A UFO  going into orbit???? You decide...thanks........<n>

They would occasionally separate in small distances from one another, but only for brief periods before returning to very close proximity to one another.  All of the objects appeared to be the same size and shape, and all appeared to &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; in the same general direction.

A video was captured using a Nokia Lumia 900 cellular phone camera, howe! ver upon playback the objects are nearly indistinguishable from the sky, with the exception of the cluster/formation of objects - which still appear quite small to the eye on video.  These objects were first spotted as we were traveling on Camden Ave., toward the intersection of Camden Ave. and Marion St.  After stopping at the stop sign at this intersection, we made a left turn toward the &amp;quot;Poe&amp;quot; Bridge on Marion St. and stopped the vehicle before the bridge in a parking lot, near where a new church is being built.  We got out of the car and observed the craft for about 10 minutes, as they gradually moved toward US-33.  Observers of these objects are two males, both withholding graduate degrees in the field of psychology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

((sic.  A.M.)) my wife and I were driving home from the Portland airport on route 295 north.  About 15 minutes south of Augusta, Maine, we saw a huge blossoming, neon blue explosion, north, directly in front of us just over the horizon.  Three seconds later we saw another, a little farther to the east, toward the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was similar to the blue flames on a propane stove.  If you held your hand out straight in front of your face and spread your fingers, they were about that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have seen bolides (exploding meteors) before, and these were nothing like that.  The flash came from the ground up, brighter blue at the bottom, with no streak or trail in the sky to indicate anything fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rest of our trip home we did not see anything else unusual Just wanted to put this out to see if anyone else reports it.<n>

We were driving primarily north, and it seemed like the lights originated below the horizon.<n>

I was the only one to witness this first light and described it to my family, who promptly dismissed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, within minutes, another light appeared somewhat closer this time, which all four of us witnessed.  Within one second and immediately next to it, another light appeared at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, a THIRD light appeared and created a row of lights exactly the same, in a straight line.  At this point, we were witnessing 5 lights in the sky;  the 3 lights then extinguished, and the original 2 followed.  This all happened within 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just 2 or 3 minutes later, again, the lights appeared, this time in a different formation - a triangle.  They did not all appear at the same time, but within milliseconds of each other, glowed together and at once for about half a second, and then disappeared the same way (millisecond sequence extinguishing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to capture some of this on my iPhone video, which I realized was likely futile, but I did get a speck of light to show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We recognized that we are in close proximity to several military bases, and several minutes later we did hear faint sounds of jets flying overhead.  However, this light phenomenon was like nothing any of us had ever witnessed (and we are regular stargazers).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should also mention that the folks staying in the house beside us were also on their porch, and the three renters there also witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as the backgrounds of the observers, 2 are retired travelers, one is a lead scientist in the Research Triangle Area, and the other is a nationally recognized trauma consultant and author.<n>

Around 9:30 pm, two objects appeared in the sky very close to our house hovering just over the ocean.  I could not make out the exact shape of the objects, but both emitted a pattern of 4 large, circular, organish lights.  Each light lit up individually in a row on both crafts, and then all together.  Then the crafts disappeared, as well as the sound.  A few minutes later, the crafts reappeared about a half a mile south down the beach.  The crafts emitted the exact same pattern of lights, and then disappeard.  They reappeared one more time much futher south with the same light pattern.  This was the last time that we saw them.  Soon after, we saw 3 military jets come together (from different areas) in a triangle formation and flew off together towards the north.  We are all level headed and agree that it was certainly an abnormal sighting.  Unfortunately, w! e did not get any pictures or videos.  The crafts defied the laws of physics - there was no trajectory, no gravity seemed to be acting on it, and the sound disappeared when the crafts did.<n>

This is when I noticed 4 orange fireballs in the sky. the were moving together and I thought the were airplane lights as it was dark.  This was when I noticed more coming behind them from the same location that looked like they were all launching off in the far distance of north or northeast edmonton.  They would disappear at different intervals of time and would not follow the exact same vector other than from where they were come from. I was out front of my dads house and my friend and I told our girls to come out and look and they were shocked too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an engineering student at the U of Alberta and I got in trouble with another friend involving drugs and was in jail for the last 5.5 months and found your website on coast to coast as I was shocked to hear other people were seeing the same thing. I believe I was the first to see these things and I hope it he! lps to track their pattern from my submission to your files. They would be moving fast like an airplane and then just stop in the sky and disappear! I think when they launch they have a surge of visible light and when they are in mid air they conserve power and make them less detectable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Off to my right, hovering approximately over the south end of Kent Island, was a large triangular object.  I say large in that it was too large to be a helicopter.  The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp but could find no reports of a blimp in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, I will give a description of what both myself and my husband observed.  Initially three lights in a triangle pattern (white) with a blinking red light on top.  In watching it, it seemed to rearrange, or turn, so that at some times the lights appeared to be straight up and down in a line, with the red light disappearing altogether, sometimes the red light would appear to be on the bottom.  It hovered in nearly the same area for an extended period of time indicating that it could in no way be a fixed wing aircraft.  It may have remained in the area longer than what we observed as we left the area and it was still there.<n>

I live in a very rural area, very wooded and with no close neighbors.  The night was clear and many stars were visible as usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat outside for twenty minutes or so to watch the skies.  I should note that in the past few weeks, I have witnessed some odd objects in the sky above my house, and thus we were looking for such.  The lights we have seen lately are usually red in color, round or triangle shaped, and move too quickly to be stars.  My companion and I noticed a couple of these, but as they have become so common, we were not particularly entranced.  However, as we gazed to the East, we both saw a very large, VERY bright, green ball of light, which quickly shot above the tree line, in an Easterly direction.  Once behind the tree line, the forest seemed to light up with a greenish glow for a couple seconds, then become dark again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be close, though I cannot say for sure, as I was not sure the size or speed.  Shortly after, we both heard the whir of what sounded like helicopters, though we did not see any.  My cell phone battery also drained shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to this event, a few weeks ago, I tried to film one of the red lights in the sky with my cell phone camera.

She saw it appear, both saw it travel and vanish for about 65 secs.  The cloud cover was 100% and it was raining all day long and at this time also.  As I had my camera with me I took two photos which show clearly what looked like a red fireball.  I thought it might be Chinese lanterns, but doubt came into my mind because of the heavy rainfall at the time and the velocity of the ball.<n>
9/24/12 19:30|Plainfield|CT|Circle|15 minutes|Huge craft with red lights over tree tops circling area 3 times|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93053.html|144|ndxe201209| Huge craft with red lights over tree tops circling area 3 times<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 19:30 hours on September 24, 2012, my husband and I were sitting outside on our deck, relaxing and talking (as we always do after I get home from work).  The deck is situated on the north side of our home.  The night sky was between twilight and complete nightfall.  The street lights were on, which one of them is located on the curve of our street.  My back was facing this street light, my husband was talking to me and that is when he noticed something coming over tree top.  He said “what the hell is that?”  I then turned around and said “holy crap”.  My husband ran into the house to grab the camera.  The first thing I noticed was how huge the red lights were, but they were not blinding and the lights followed the curvature of the craft, but only, and I would say about ½ of the “round” shape.  I could not see the outline of the craft, but you could tell the shape because of the lights.  Also, there was also a row of white lights below the red o! nes (but not as many as the red or as big).  They were brilliant in color, but still did not blind us.  I also had noticed that there was absolutely no sound from this craft.  I took a couple of pictures, but my camera has a video capacity on it and had videoed about a minute and 22 seconds.  At this point in time, the craft had moved slowly in a wide curved motion (moving away from our point of view).  My video has only the “back” side of craft where the lights were blinking: Red (the dominate color) then changed to Blue.   But upon looking at the video footage, it seems that maybe there were two crafts, where the other one was much further away from “craft 1”, but I can only see the blue light.  There had been other aircrafts as well in the night sky that we all can recognize, and I know the difference between the two.  The craft had since disappeared into the distanced.  At that point in time, I had moved from my deck down to the end of my driveway – when it was gone, I ! turned around to go back to my deck to talk to my husband.  I ! had turn ed my head in the direction of where we had seen this craft and realized it was back in the same position where we originally had seen it (over the tree top).  I yelled at my husband and said “It’s back!  It’s back!” I also was amazed at how fast it was back because I literally turned around and walked a few steps before I looked over my shoulder.  I had since turned my camera off and tried to turn it back on so I could get a better video shot, but I could not.  This craft went around in a huge circumference three times and yet no sound at all.  You could hear the regular jets, but not this craft.  I tried taking pictures but the quality of my camera is not the best at night (old model).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked strange so I went into the bathroom and looked outside the window and noticed a circle shape with a prism like light coming from it with white being the body and green to red going upwards. I awake my husband and I grab the binoculars and opened the window. I was in amazement , the second I looked threw the lens, I seen what looked like the white circle was actually a lot of separate at least 1,000+ desperate lights all close together forming the circle shape I was seeing. Then all of a sudden one separated from the bunch then floated back and once again out and back. Then it finally moved away and started spreading out in a downward position like a triangle. Once again with the green and red. The multiple lights that where in the circle shape moved back and forth to and from the separated light.

We went to the front yard to watch them, and discovered that there were actually four, one having passed the house moments earlier. They were roughly circular, but obviously spherical, like a jellyfish lit from within by an orange/reddish light. My immediate thought was that they were paper lanterns, but as we watched for even two more seconds, several things became apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firstly, despite the lack of any noticeable wind at ground level, all four of the objects were moving at an eerily fast rate: they had each passed over the street facing our house and were at least a quarter mile away less than twenty seconds later. Secondly, each object, while grouped relatively close, moved at variable speeds and transcribed smooth arcs and lateral movements that brought them within feet of one another at times (excepting the fourth, which was the first to pass overhead). The glowing objects appeared to dim and wink out as they moved to the middle distance: the entire encounter having lasted no longer than two minutes. Our house is less than two miles from the Columbus airport, and at least one often-used flight plan brings aircraft directly over our house every twenty minutes or so, but these lights could in no way be associated with any airplane that I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While these lights were gathering other lights started to come fly over from another location and join this group of lights.  They all flew over from the same location and joined in the same location. This occurred until all the lights had faded into the sky. We saw at least 20 lights, if not more. They were pretty high up in the sky and didn&#39;t resemble any kind of aircraft we&#39;ve seen.<n>

I see a orange glowing orb moving from east to west heading towards this little bar called Sluggers.  My house is about 3/4 mile away from the bar (as the crow flies),Didnt think too much of it right away because My house is kinda near a flight path for Waukesha Cty Airport. Thoughht maybe it was a light for an airplane or whatever until it made a complete stop RIGHT OVER the top of the tree line.  It was a pretty quiet and dark night. The craft or &amp;quot;orb&amp;quot; hovered there for about 20 or so seconds and then a huge bright yellow/whiteish light emmited from the craft/orb. It was so bright that anyone looking in that dirrection couldnt have missed it. there was absolutly no noise or ground vibrations that you would nomally feel and hear from a low flying helicopter, and the tree tops remained motionless. the large bright light shined for quite some time and then shut off. as s! oon as that light turned off two more lights , i think they were red and white, started blinking. this may sound weird to most people but it was almost like this firey orange glowing orb turned into a helicopter. It was too dark out to see what it &amp;quot;morphed&amp;quot; into, but i think it was trying to mimic a regular aircraft or something...after this thing got done doing what ever it was doing, it continued to travel west with the two lights still blinking. that was by far the weirdest sight that ive ever seen. i will keep my eyes posted in the night sky everytime i go outside now. i couldnt believe i saw that. its something that ya here about from time to time but to experiance it was somethin else.  If anyone reading this and is from my area, please make a report of it so i can stop thinking that im loosing my mind  KEEP YOUR EYES TO THE SKY...THESE THINGS MAY LOOK LIKE YOUR EVERYDAY HELICOPTERS AFTER THEY GET DONE CHANGING THERE FORM. REMEMBER THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUND AND THEY TRAVEL QUITE SLOW<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am a VERY big skeptic when it comes to this type of thing. But what I saw last night cannot be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I had just picked my brother up from a driver education course at 9:00 pm.  We stopped at a Taco Bueno to get some food on our way home.   As we were driving East on highway 20, we were about four minutes from where it goes from four lanes to two lanes, when I saw two bluish spotlights shining down on the oncoming lanes of traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the same time I saw this, the spotlights rose into a horizontal position, shining on my car when they did.  As the spotlights raised up I saw the underbelly of what seemed to be a trapezoidal middle with two right triangle shaped wings that held the big blue/white spotlights. The wings seemed more like anchors for the spotlights than actual wings.  They were not long and slender like and airplane, but were fat, short, and stocky with the spotlight on the ends.  The underbelly had four or six sets of rectangular greenish yellow panels on the front end and back end.  These panels seemed almost like you could see into the aircraft through them, like they were a type of viewing panels.  I saw these things so very clearly because this aircraft was only about the height of a two or three story building.  This aircraft was also not in flight, it was merely hovering, but it did kind of sway as the spotlights rose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was in the passenger seat and saw the exact same thing I did.  My little brother was in the back seat and from his position he couldn’t really see it.  My friend reminded me to pay attention to driving as the aircraft seemed to be preparing to fly forward.  As we drove past it I could no longer see the craft and told my brother to try to get a look.  My brother caught a glimpse of the bluish lights, but he did not see any detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft made absolutely no noise.  We did not have the raidio on at all in the car and as soon as we saw it we didn’t say anything but hushed “are you seeing this?” and my brother’s quieted questions of what we were looking at.  If this thing had made a noise, like any craft that close to us would, we would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home I described this sighting to my mother, she sat down with us and we all explained in detail what happened. In the middle of my description, my mother gasped and covered her mouth. She quickly told me that as she was peeking out of the blinds, hoping to see our headlights (she was worried because us stopping to get food took longer than she expected), she saw something she had shrugged off as probably her imagination at the time. She saw a bluish spotlight shining up and then down our driveway and disappear. She didn’t see any cars before or after this light and she swore it was not any kind of headlight reflection or anything, it was like a light being shown from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my boyfriend who is an Intel analyst for the military and he assured me there is no aircraft in our military that is like the one I described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I welcome anyone who thinks they have a reasonable explanation, but so far I have found none.<n>

9/23/12 20:30|Erie|PA|Light|10 minutes|Two groups of bright red lights hovered and moved independently in all directions for about 10 minutes over Erie, PA.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93041.html|162|ndxe201209| Two groups of bright red lights hovered and moved independently in all directions for about 10 minutes over Erie, PA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out of a convenience store to my car a little before 8:30pm on September  23, and I noticed 3 very bright red lights in the sky, hovering in a triangle formation.  I couldn&#39;t figure out what they were; it was very cloudy, so I realized these couldn&#39;t be stars or planets because they were below the cloud cover.  As I continued to watch them, I noticed they were moving, flying up, down, left, right; and they moved independent of each other, so they were not connected to one aircraft.  As I watched the three red lights, a fourth one came flying from over the store into my field of vision very fast, then stopped on a dime near the other three and just hovered there next to them.  Then all 4 of them hovered, and would individually fly slowly to the left and down in my field of vision.  Then, 2 of them flew very, very close together, like they were almost touching, then separated again.  Then, one by one, they each appeared to flicker out--which prob! ably means they flew higher up into the cloud cover and out of my sight.  I watched this group for about 3 or 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there in my car a few more minutes, and sure enough, two more red lights flew from over the store into my field of vision, so they were flying from south to north.  I called my parents, who live a block away from the store, and they ran outside and saw these ones.  As I was talking to them on the phone, another one flew from south to north and joined these other two.  They hovered and flew subtly back and forth, independently, for several minutes.  Then, just like before, two of them flew so close together that they appeared to touch.  Then, they each flickered out, one by one, disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine, who lives 1 block north of the store, said that a group of people were standing in a parking lot across the street from his house, and they were pointing and shouting things about the sky.  He regrets not going outside to look for himself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if these events are related to these UFO&#39;s, but the Internet stopped working for several hours all over the east side of Erie, and a firefighter friend of mine reported that the power went out in half of the borough of Wesleyville, which is where I saw these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally witnessed these two groups of red UFO&#39;s for about 10 minutes total, but they were already in the sky when I came out of the store, so I don&#39;t know how long they were visible before I saw them.  I don&#39;t know if the second group of 3 UFO&#39;s were the same ones I saw minutes earlier (in the first group of 4), or if there were 7 different UFO&#39;s.

9/23/12 19:30|Atlanta|GA|Other|2-3 seconds|I was on Delta flight 1307 from Richmond to Atlanta.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane in a window seat.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93024.html|164|ndxe201209| I was on Delta flight 1307 from Richmond to Atlanta.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane in a window seat.  About seven minutes prior to landing I saw an object outside the plane.  It was moving at a good speed and passed under the wing.  It seemed close to the airplane but not close enough to hit the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a circular, aqua colored top that appeared hard and a light, silver colored, narrow cylinder coming out of the bottom of it.  In terms of size it was not larger than the wing of the plane.  I’ve Googled weather balloons and it was definitely not a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told the people beside me I saw something weird and they started joking around and making reference to the X-Files show.  I laughed out of nervousness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reluctantly asked the guy behind me when we landed if he happened to see anything odd from the plane and he said he said he saw it as well and that it freaked him out and that he was just going to pretend he didn’t see it.  He said he was ex military and it was definitely not a stealth probe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He agreed to go to the pilot afterwards with me.  We told the pilot and the flight attendant at the front of the plane what we saw.  The pilot said it was probably a balloon (which it was not) or a tower on the ground (which it was not) and that they would &#34;check it out.&#34;   The other witness and I were surprised that they didn’t ask for our names or info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me state that I have never believed in UFOs, etc. prior to this.  I don’t know if this is something being tested by our government or another country or if it was really other-worldly.  I can only describe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent, and objective in her description of the sighting.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))<n>

We were watching it for approximately 1 minute when it disappeared behind some cloud cover on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was too far away to be able to take a picture.  It only appeared slightly brighter than the light of a star and slightly weaker than a S.O.S. flair.<n>
9/23/12 19:10|Trion|GA|Sphere|approximately 1 minute|Bright, reflective object in the sky that suddenly disappeared over Trion, Georgia.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93031.html|166|ndxe201209| Bright, reflective object in the sky that suddenly disappeared over Trion, Georgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 23, I was driving on Hwy. 27 north, going through Trion, Georgia, county of Chattooga.  It was approximately 7:00 pm and while I was driving I noticed a rather large, bright object in the sky. It made me think of an extremely bright star that one would see at night, but this was just before sunset had started, it wasn&#39;t dark at all yet, and there weren&#39;t any other stars visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be reflecting light, it looked similar to the effect sun light has when reflected off of a mirror and because of this I had a hard time telling the exact shape of the object. By my best assumption, the object appeared to be round, circular, or spherically shaped, much like how a star looks. The object was larger than any plane I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What really made me think that this was something unusual, though, was that the object wasn&#39;t moving in any direction. It was perfectly still. I watched the object while driving, from the time I noticed it, for about one or two minutes. It suddenly disappeared. Instantly it was gone from the sky. Nothing blocked my view of the object from the time I noticed until it vanished. There was most definitely a bright, shiny, static object in the sky one moment and then there was nothing. Immediately after it disappeared, a jet came flying from an eastwardly direction at an alarming rate of speed and seemed to be flying a bit low. It appeared to be flying towards where the object had previously been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of these events make sense to me. It actually gave me goose bumps when the thing just disappeared. I am most curious to see if anyone else saw this, and if someone of authority might have a logical explanation of this event. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To whome it may concern, I am of sound mind. I am a twenty-six year old mother and wife. I am well educated and have been at my current job for six years. I have never before seen or reported anything such as this. I am an ordinary woman with an ordinary life. I only want an explanation of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving across the sky slowly.  The 3 of us that were upstairs at the time seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I ran downstairs to get others to see it and to grab the camera, it was gone.  It was seen for only 1 minute.  It took me 30 to 45 seconds to run down the stairs and for someone to go looking for it.  There were no lights on it.  There was no sound with it.<n>

They seemed to be coming from the north and were heading more or less southeast. Three sets of neighbors (6 total) were outside together and saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came in groups of 4 or five and were often in a diamond or triangular shape.  A few seemed alone.   As they moved to the southeast they got dimmer and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no audible noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers: all between 50 and 64, one tradesman, 3 business, teacher, 3 with college degrees, one w/ grad school<n>

They were flying one group after the other.  They started out very bright going east, then veered to the south and then they faded out.  There was no sound and they were flying at a fairly slow speed but not slow enough to be considered hoovering. They were all flying at a very simular altitude. This occurred at about 7:40 pm CST.  I do not know if there were more prior to me going outside.  The fireballs did not blink or flash.<n>

I saw three moving in formation.  All of them were definitely moving downward.  I saw an orange flame like thing on the back and a white orb on the front.  Not all had orbs. Just two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling West on US route 1 in Langhorne, Bucks County PA.  We saw the UFOs in the Western sky traveling south.  Viewing it from the horizon the lowest UFO was about sixty degrees above the horizon.  The second was about eighty degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third was about one-hundred degrees.   About 5 minutes later we saw about 10 or more fighter jets fly towards the objects, and yes I am sure they were fighter jets.  As we continued driving, at around 7:01 we saw a fourth UFO.  The fourth UFO seemed bigger than the others.  It was also kind of far behind the others.  The UFOs didn’t seem like they were moving very fast, but they were definitely moving. I don’t think I would have reported this if I only saw one.  I knew I HAD to report it after I saw all the fighter jets.<n>

It was dusk. I was traveling west bound on Route 1 in Langhorne, PA (Bucks County) and the objects were in the western sky traveling south.  The objects were approximately 10-15 miles away. There were three separate objects in a formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the objects was 60 degrees above the horizon, the second object was 80 degrees above the horizon and the third object was 100 degrees above the horizon.  Each object appeared as a bright white line with a bubble or half orb shape on the top followed by a pinkish orange flame.  The flame remained constant in shape and size on each object.  The objects were descending, all at the same trajectory, and seemed to be moving at a slow and steady pace.  I know what a comet looks like moving through the sky and these were not comets.  Also, there was an unusual high activity of aircraft in the sky.  There were approximately a dozen planes i! n the sky flying toward the objects.  The aircraft were faster and smaller than passenger jets and I assume that they were military or fighter jets.  One of the aircraft circled around and flew low over the highway and I could see that it was a fighter jet, probably an F-18.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued traveling on my intended route and got on the PA turnpike (Rt 276) heading West  and once on the PA turnpike, I identified a fourth object, similar in all regards to the other three but flying to the North and much higher than the others. I would lose sight of the objects among the tree line on the highway and once I got to the Jenkintown exit on the PA turnpike, I lost visibility of all objects and aircraft activity.<n>

There was rain in the vicinity- although not exactly where I was.  I saw a beautiful rainbow to the SE of my location, and went in to get my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures of the rainbow......and to the right of this rainbow you can clearly see the moon (although between clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After downloading the picture on my computer, there was a large, glowing object to the LEFT of the rainbow, which was not seen with the naked eye.  It can not &#34;be a reflection&#34;- as it was 7:00 pm- and the sun was setting on the horizon behind my home in the WEST.  This photo was taken and the object was DUE EAST of my location.   What is it??<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.  I can not e-mail the picure- but it is posted on the MUFON website.<n>

It looked like a cluster of stars in the daytime sky.  It was a very clear day without even a cloud in the sky.  We all watched this strange sight float from side to side and up and down.  It would disappear at times for a brief few seconds then reappear right around the same area with what looked like falling stars dropping from it at times.  While it changed in shape it never changed with any other colors.  It kept the appearance of a cluster of stars in the daytime sky.  Unfortunatly everyone was in shock and amazement at what we were all seeing and did not have enough time to get a video camera to capture any images.  Several of us tried to take a photo with our cellphones althou! gh our phone cameras could not capture the image of this unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all saw the same image and myself and neighbors range in age from the youngest being 20 years old to the oldest being 77 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nobody was under any mind altering substances and we are all hard working people with professional jobs ranging from the 20 year old being a McDonalds manager to the 77 year old being a retired college professor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a network and web design specialist. The 6 other neighbors all have respectable professions as well. We were all in utter amazement at the sight we saw and will never forget it.<n>

Sevral sightings this month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one object. It sorta looked like it was a triangle shaped object, it also had bright white lights.  The object was just holding still in one place for about two minutes at about 15,000 to 20,000 feet up.  Than the object slowly started moving backwards than it took off in a split second.  There was just my girlfriend &amp; I who observed the object.It was still dark out.<n>

An object that was reddish in color came from the South/Southwest and continued on a North/Northeasterly path at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be very large and appeared to be relatively low, maybe 2000-3000 feet and made no noise at all.  If I had to put a shape to the object I would tend to say it was triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that it was an airplane until I registered its speed and the fact that there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object covered a distance of 10-20 miles in approximately 3 seconds and continued out of sight.  It did not burn out but traveled at a constant speed and asthmas until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  He is a highly qualified witness.  The witness indicated to us that the object covered and arc of 160-180 degrees in the 2-4 seconds he observed it.  PD))<n>

I tried to scream his name for help because I saw 4 of the grey-looking aliens standing above me but could not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a little different then average greys.  Their eyes were emanating light.  As if it was some kind of contacts to see at night.  They were looking at each other. Communicating without words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One looked at me then they all turned and quickly the one closest to me stabbed my womenhood (for lack of better words) and it felt like the needle wand looking thing it held went all the way up to my spin.  The pain was as of an excruciating burn and I screamed in my head till I found I was unconscious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up at 4am.  So did my bf.

The craft had NO LIGHTS! This was by FAR the most interesting thing about my sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The craft was flying too fast and the sighting only lasted 6-10 seconds, I was too busy trying to focus my eyes on the craft so I could remember it and rule out a bird or airplane; there was no time to go grab my cell phone, and the picture would not have turned out anyway due to the color-matching of craft and sky.   Taking a picture MAY have been possible with decent equipment/night vision/quick reflexes but I don’t carry that stuff around just in case! Specific location of sighting: On the Northwest corner of Oak and Locust, looking East Witnesses:  From what I know, and please remember the time of night, I was the only person so see it.  It was a fluke by all accounts.  I was talking to my ‘date’ about my love of the sky and how beautiful the stars were.  When I looked up, within minutes of 0230 am, this is when I noticed it and my skin began to tingle!   After the 5 seconds of awe-struck staring, I quickly yelled, interrupting my dates talking to say there’s a UFO right there, but he thought I was kidding, so by the time I had pointed my finger at where the craft was, it either had disappeared or faded into the sky roughly 3-5 miles in front of us (I am no pro at judging distance but it was definitely close- as a side note, I would have attempted to take 380 East in an attempt to see if I could locate it again, but it was 0230 in the morning and I had to wake up at 5 am!  I didn’t think my excuse of following a UFO for being late would have gone over very well.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visual conditions: No cloud-cover what-so-ever, clear night, not many stars visible due to light pollution  Duration of sighting: 6-10 seconds of visual, from midpoint of the sky until craft faded or disappeared  Sound: None<n> <n><n> Direction of flight: almost EXACTLY from West to East, this can be judged because the highway 380 is almost a perfect West to East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape of craft: between a diamond, teardrop &amp; triangle Color of craft: black, blended almost completely into the dark night sky, but please remember there was quite a bit of noticeable light pollution, which enabled me to initially see the outline and then focus on what was happening. This is hard to judge because this craft almost appeared to be intentionally the same color as the night. If it had been darker out, I know it would not have been visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Height from ground: Approximately 500 feet (this is a guess, I am not too familiar with judging distances) – if you were to look up into the sky, the size would appear to resemble the size of 2 thumbs-widths and was not high enough to have been in clouds, had there been any. Wish I could describe this better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed: Roughly 3 times faster than a plane may be seen traveling at the same altitude Size: unknown, however, I would guess  around 150-200 feet long.<n>
9/23/12 02:22|Madison|CT|Light|5 minutes|7 Large bright lights over North Madison in cloudy, overcast  2:00 AM sky 9/23/2012|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93009.html|178|ndxe201209| 7 Large bright lights over North Madison in cloudy, overcast  2:00 AM sky 9/23/2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live surrounded by acres and acres of land trust in North Madison, CT.  I have a little ranch house set in the woods but the area around the house is clear of trees.  I have a dog who usually has to go out during the night.  Sometimes I let him out on the back lead and let him wander or I take him out front on leash for a quick pee.  He woke me up at 2:22am September 23, 2012 to go out.  I took him out the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He did his business but seemed like he wanted to do more, so I walked him a bit down the driveway.  When I had originally stepped out I looked up at the sky to see what the weather would be like the next morning.  It was overcast and cloudy, no black sky and absolutely no stars.  As I walked down the driveway I noticed several very bright, big lights in the sky.  They were situated over an area which is a state park called Chatfield Hollow in CT.  I thought it  was weird because if they were stars, first of all they were super big and bright and there was no black sky around them, just a hazy cloudy sky.  So my sleepy mind is trying to figure how these stars are shining through the clouds. Then I noticed a clearing in the trees that 3 of them are in  a perfect vertical line spaced evenly apart.  My first thought it was the 3 Sisters stars but then realized it couldn’t be them because the 3 Sisters are not so perfectly spaced or in such a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed to the left  a second set of 3 lights perfectly spaced in a straight vertical line running horizontal to the first set.  They stood motionless but were giving off a very bright glow.  Then I noticed a 7th light off to the left, almost like it was the sideways tip of a pyramid (for all 7 in  formation)   These lights were spaced out very far apart like several football field lengths. This 7th tip light was just as bright but had more of a redish glow.  I remember thinking Mars, maybe this was Mars.  This is what really scared me….about 7 seconds after I turned my face up to this 7th light and I am trying to figure it out, it got a little brighter for a second, like a quick pulse and then went out  But it wasn’t a quick switch off more like a quick pull back.  And my first thought was….”.Oh my God, they saw me seeing them….”  I quickly went back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say I did not sleep  most of the night.  About 10 minutes later I heard an airforce jet fly over coming from the area the lights were and over my house.  So I was wondering if someone else saw these and reported to the airforce.  I dozed off somewhere around 4:20 and 5:15.  My senses were so alert to all noises at this point. Normally it is so quite at night you can hear your own blood in your veins, but what woke me up was a low steady humming sound that lasted for about 10 minutes.  But I also noticed the crickets got louder if that makes sense.  I was thinking why are they so loud and was afraid to look out the window as I was sure I would see a UFO hovering over my house. This wan&#39;t a plan or helicopter as the sound was the same and steady and then gone. So I lay in bed literally frozen in fear and after ten minutes the  humming went away and the crickets sounds had diminished greatly.  About another 15 minutes passes and I hear the humming again but it is fa! ther away, it didn’t feel like it was right over my house and the crickets got louder.  I remember thinking o.k. now they are over my neighbor’shome,  who is down the road a bit. It then went away about 10 minutes later and the crickets quieted down.  A third time I heard the humming faintly, crickets got louder and then it went away.  Crickets got quieter.  I definitely could tell the difference in the sounds when the humming stopped.  (I do not have a furnace that could possibly have made this noise)  At about 5:45 I could finally breath and close my eyes to rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the really weird thing, my daughter who is 21, her bedroom window faces where the lights were and her bed is up against the window.  When she got up I didn’t mention anything to her.  I asked her how she slept.  She said she got up in the middle of the night and closed the curtains on her window.  She said she woke up in the middle  of the night with the weird feeling someone was watching her, “like some creepy guy”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was definitely something to these lights. I figured if they wanted to harm us they could do it anytime and there is nothing I can do about it, you can’t call the police.

No its not something normal we see in the sky, this is the first time i have ever witnessed an even as such.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a light in the sky over my left should.  I was sitting, facing north-east, so this was coming from the west.  It looked almost like a flare but there was no flicker.  It was bright orange.  I’m not sure of the distance, but it was underneath the cloud cover of the expected rain.  It was moving from the southwest to the northeast, across the bay towards the Ocean.  There was no sound.  It was traveling slower than an airliner or meteor, but faster than a flare or Chinese lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about two minutes until it disappeared over the ocean.  A couple minutes later, another one came by.  Then a couple minutes later, another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trying to film the third one with my phone, I caught a fourth one out of the corner of my eye.  My phone unfortunately isn’t quality enough to have captured the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of them looked the same, had no sound and traveled in the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m used to the planes taking off and landing at the airport next door, so I’m confident it was not any kind of aircraft I’ve ever seen before.<n>

One was smaller (further away) and one seemed larger and closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very red - round circles and appeared to be moving closer rapidly.  Not side to side or up/down. I thought they might be meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to grab a video camera but only captured a very short clip of one.  I went back inside to put the camera back, when I came out, one was gone, and the other seemed to be pulling away and then suddenly vanished.<n>

We noticed an Orange orb like ball over the ocean and high in the sky, we thought it was a meteor at first but it just stayed in the same spot for several seconds.  Then it started moving down the coast heading north, slowly at first and then very fast and was out of sight in a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither one of us was sure what we saw and had never seen anything like this before.  It did not appear to be natural looking the way it hung in the sky and then moved off so fast.<n>

I called for my husband to look at it then i noticed two more red pulsating lights to the right of the other light.The other two lights were smaller than the first light i seen.  I grabbed my phone and started recording.I watched the bigger of the three lights move very slow it would go up and down and side to side.  The two smaller lights one was moving up and down and side to side and the other one would do circles around the other small light, and it would go towards the other small light and then back and the whole time it looked like the lights were pulsating.I started taking pictures and on my phone.  When i would zoom in on the lights to take the picture the lights looked like a grey blob same thing while i was recording.  The weird thing that puzzled me was each picture i took of the lights they all showed up a diff! erent color and the only thing i seen was red pulsating lights.  I don&#39;t believe in this kinda stuff but i know what i saw and after that night i am a believer..<n>
9/22/12 23:18|Austinburg|OH|Unknown|Unknown|Eight to nine reddish-orange lights in night sky with seven stationary and two moving.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93003.html|184|ndxe201209| Eight to nine reddish-orange lights in night sky with seven stationary and two moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wow! This is the first time I’ve seen something I can’t rationalize away. Having worked in banking in the past, I followed my training when it comes to robbery and applied it in this case. To remember as much detail as possible and keep it to yourself until you can report it to the proper individuals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night I had to work overtime on second shift. I take the same route to and from home each time. I was traveling north on Route 45 and just past the intersection of Clay Street heading for Route 307 East, which is my turnoff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and to my left and saw strange lights in the night sky. They were at a diagonal to my left in an NNE-SSW configuration. Seven, if I remember correctly. Three in a&#34;“top&#34; row in a fairly uniform line, three in a bottom row not as straight to each other, on one more not quite in the middle at the end of the two lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I knew they weren’t stars even though they appeared to be stationary.. Same general shape, but they were too close and had a reddish-orange tint to them. When I was almost perpendicular to them I’d estimate that a baby aspirin held at arm’s length would cover each individual light. These lights did not flicker or pulse though occasionally one would dim or pass from view for a second due to spotty rain cloud cover. They also did not look to be lights on one larger individual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was still driving I had to continually keep looking in front of me for oncoming traffic, etc. I’m pretty darn sure I wasn’t the only one to witness this event as both the minivan in front of me and oncoming traffic had slowed considerably. (Also, once we’d both turned left onto Route 307 East, the minivan pulled over into a parking lot and the driver appeared to be dialing a call while looking up at the lights.) Before that turn, I then noticed another light of the exact same type in the same diagonal path further south and to my right, and right  of Route 45. But this one was moving! Then further behind it, yet another. They were on an intersect path with the stationary lights. I did not hear any sound, but that’s because I had the radio on and, unfortunately, the automatic window motors on my car died long ago so I couldn’t roll the windows down. Even so, if those had been military helicopters (which do fly over quite frequently) I’d have heard them. Nothing stealthy about the ones that fly over these parts and seven of them hovering in place would have woke the entire area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the heck I just saw…I don’t know, but a rational explanation I could believe in wouldn’t hurt my feelings any.<n>

I am looking forward and here appears this large dark object with two bright headlights flying above the trees, it then turned into three bright lights and as it floated by the back of it had blinking orange and white lights.  Two rows of three blinking lights. It made no sound at all!!  There is always helicopters and airplanes flying over my house but this thing I saw was nothing I have ever seen before.  I was a little freaked out but very cool.<n>

We turned back inland to come back to our camp fire at saw a brilliant orange star shape hovering high in the sky inland over the town of Cape Meares.  It was much larger than any star, and it did not sway or move. There was a light cloud cover,and we wondered if the moisture refracted the light as the star burst &amp;quot;arms&amp;quot; were very long and wispy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a couple minutes, and tried to get video on our iphone. The light suddenly shrunk to nothing while quickly drifting upwards.  We checked with a group down the beach from us, and they had seen the same thing.<n>

Almost in parallel sets of 2. Moving quicker than a plane, much brighter than stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:30 P.M in Waterdown, Ontario. My girlfriend and I spotted a cluster of 10-15 bright orange/yellow (more orange in color) orbs moving across the sky. They were moving faster than planes based on the fact of personal experience seeing air-planes moving through the sky. They were slightly less bright than the moon, but they were much, much brighter than stars. They were circular orbs in shape, but the strange thing was is that they were in a formation in sets of twos. Both orbs in the “sets” looked as if they were parallel with each other. While moving, the sets never gained distance nor height in proximity to their partners. The other sets were at different heights but from my standpoint they looked rather close to the other sets (Maybe a few hundred yards apart from their actual location.) They all moved at roughly the same speed. I am no physicist so i am unable to calculate the degree to which i was looking at the orbs. They looked much! lower to the ground than a normal air-plane though. I am not sure what other information you guys need but if you need any other information from me or this was not enough detail feel free to contact me via email or phone calls. From my standpoint, the aircraft moved about 30 feet (between the houses) within 60 seconds, possibly less. Perhaps your team could compute an apparent velocity regarding the information just given.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would appreciate being kept up to date with any other information regarding this. This is a serious reporting, i am a little freaked out myself and i would like an explanation. If you guys need anymore information or details feel free to contact me. My girlfriend will be submitting her version of this sighting within the next couple of days. I know what air-planes look like, as well as stars, the moon, shooting stars, northern lights, etc. These were distinct orbs moving fast. Something neither i nor my girlfriend have seen before. I hope this is enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have already contacted the hotline and spoke to an individual at your center. I was told to submit this report as soon as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location- We were facing 165 degrees South/Southeast from the coordinates (43degrees 20’45’’ N, 79degrees 52’59’’ W).<n>

As we got 1 mile or less from the intersection we where right under the lights it seemed,I would guess they were about 2 to 3 thousand feet high,they were white orb like in appearance.I remarked to my wife,&amp;quot;there must be two dozen there gonna get a lot of phone callls on these&amp;quot;referring to the police. They were very clear to see and basically right over the highway.  They were in a preety straight line and spread out about 1 to 1.5 miles.  As we merged on to 80 eastbound I put my window down and had to look back and up to see the last 5 or 6 lights as we drove away.  We couldn&#39;t wait for the 11:00 news to come on expecting them to be mentioned but nothing was mentioned anywhere.Highway was not extremely busy but there was other traffic people HAD TO SEE THEM.I wish my wife had pulled over so I could have got pics with my phone and watched longer.<n>

It was like any other night.  I had just picked up an order from the store and was on my to drop it off.  The location where I was going was maybe 2.5 miles from where I was at.  It was aprox. 9:50 pm and I had turned off a main road (busy with traffic on to a side street.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw an orange sphere shaped object in the sky.  It had interested me because of the shear size of the sphere.  (if you were to hold a penny as far out with your left hand it appeared to he that size ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m driving I am still looking at this object when I notice another of the same objects appeared. Now 2 sphere shaped glowing orange Ufos were in my sight by hey began a theater totter motion as one went up the other went down.  At this time I pulled to a stop sight from the side street I was on which was still only about 250 ft from the main road.  The spheres dimmed in color as I pulled ou! t my iPhone to capture about 40 seconds of video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After recording this I had called a friend to explain what was still before my eyes and I began to drive towards the objects.  The opposite direction of my delivery.  As I came to another stop light the objects dissipated into the sky.<n>

We were .9 of a mile from Carrollton Rd. He said &amp;quot;mom, what is that?&amp;quot; I looked to my right and saw 20-30 orangish-yellow balls of light moving up into the sky.  They were moving slowly up and then horizontally.  We stopped and watched for about 3 minutes. We then drove to Carrollton Rd. and turned left and watched from there.  They seemed to continue to move forward and up.  They seemed to dissapear as they went higher.  We could not tell how far away they were.  But they did appear to move with purpose. We had the windows open did not hear any sound at all.<n>

I was anticipating turning left, onto Metro Place North, and therefore looked to my left and noticed some red looking dots in the sky. I thought, ‘Wow, those look kind of odd. Must be helicopters?’   I then heard a three ‘thwump, thwump, thwumps’ of a helicopter blade that sounded every bit military.  These sounds however came from my right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my front windshield and up and over toward the direction of old downtown Dublin and saw no helicopter, nor heard nothing more of blades.  Looking back to my left these red dots were now close enough to have a visible shape. In this stage they were red and rectangular. Like the shape of a slightly shortened domino.   As the first one went by, the red color parted as a sliding glass door would at a department store.  This exposed a red translucent keg barrel shaped sphere. There was no red, only night sky all around this.  I noticed some black horizontals and a vertical line as it passed.  I went on to look at the others that opened in the same manner.  These however had orange translucent keg barrel shaped interiors.  The horizontal and the vertical lines appeared in shades of gray. The shades of orange would also vary.  As these passed more would stream in from the distance and follow in fashion continually moving eastward, and towards the end southeast and up. I would say 20 or so total over the course of a few minutes.  Dots, then rectangular, then opening, then closing, then moving on.  Two in particular came very close above the 10 or so story buildings.  They appeared to be maybe a 100 feet above the buildings.  I watched as these two orange keg barrel shaped things seemed to position themselves for something.  The one on the left stopped. It stayed stationary. The one on the right approached the one on the left more hurriedly than the speed at what the others had moved. It was like ! it got to close in error and started to become a darker orange! and red streaks developed in a couple places before it stopped moving. At the same time the one on the left was becoming a very pale, almost clear orange, to the point where I saw the top fray as if to release something and regain its form all in about a second or two’s time. At this same time the one on the right was beginning to regress or move back. This is the only time I saw one reverse direction. It started to return to a more medium or stable orange. This is when I saw something, I don’t know. The one that went pale all of a sudden had a panel on its left as I faced it. The panel turned, expanded in width or thickness, and outward as well. It then immediately contracted, turned back, rippled and looked like night sky again. Then a panel on the bottom followed suit. At this point it turned back to red, as they all had done as they moved on, then it jettisoned or repositioned upward to the left in the sky. Then was followed by the remaining ones. I could see the hydraulics to ! whatever I was witnessed. The design. The movements. The stages. The last one to pass, like the first, was also red. If I can add anything else to this I will.<n>

9/22/12 21:05|Napier (New Zealand)||Unknown|10  minutes|8 bright intense round lights, appearing in twos, following the exact same path at slightly different times with no noise.|11/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/094/S94146.html|195|ndxe201209| 8 bright intense round lights, appearing in twos, following the exact same path at slightly different times with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 22nd September 2012 at 2105, my husband and I were outside on the back porch having a smoke. Over to our right are the hills of Taradale.  My husband was looking that way when he said, &#34;What is that orange light?&#34;   I looked over and saw this incredible intense bright orange light moving fairly slowly towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and asked our boarder to come outside and have a look.  We both returned outside in time to see this orange light suddenly veer very sharply to the left and fly very quickly upwards where it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as that light had climbed upwards, two further bright orange lights followed the exact same path as the single light.  Then as before, as soon as these lights climbed, two more followed the same path.  As before, they climbed and two more followed the same path.  Finally, as these ones climbed, one more single bright orange light followed the same path before climbing and moving very fast away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were consistent; they did not flicker at all.  They were fairly close yet there was no noise at all.  The night was beautiful, very clear with no cloud.  The airport is not in the direction of the lights and as we live on the flight path, we know where the planes come in.  They come in directly over us or from the west to the east and at a low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were fairly low when the first came into sight but they were traveling from north to south before heading west.  I can hear planes very clearing when they come in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not flares, flares act in a totally different way, plus ((name deleted--husband)) knows what flares look like. Also, the sea is to the east of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not Chinese lanterns.  If they were, the lights would have been flickering even slightly.  Also, they all would have turned to the west at the same time if they wind had blown them.  These lights followed each other exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not weather balloons as we do not have them here in Napier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my camera and put it on video and aimed it at the lights. I looked at the screen but couldn’t see anything on it so I stopped filming.  It wasn’t until two weeks or so later when I downloaded photos onto the computer, I saw I had actually got one of the lights on video. Unfortunately, as I thought I wasn’t getting anything, there is not much film of it.  Still, it does show one orange light which looks nothing like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were sort of round and very large.  The way, in which they veered sharply, it was impossible for one of our aircraft to have made that turn, only a fighter plane could have turned that way.  Again, if they were fighter planes, the noise would have been heard but it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband called the police and was told other people had also reported the lights.  A few days later, the police called again and told us, the lights were not flares or lanterns and they had no idea what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is 45 and a digger and bobcat driver, very down to earth type of man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 47 and don’t work due to having Fibromyalgia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our boarder has since moved out.  At the time, he was a security guard.<n>

It was an ammorphose blob that grew upwards into the sky.  Hard to tell its size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it grew larger it expanded into hundreds of seperate lights.  They weren&#39;t in any formation, just moving upwards and spreading out.  A vehicle drove up to us and the gentlemen inside asked us if we&#39;re seeing this.  He said he thinks he&#39;s looking at his first ufo sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat watching them spread out overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suspect it was a release of lanterns, but puzzled because there&#39;s a burn ban here.

The door to my ham shack is facing east.  It was dark outside and the moon was low in the South West at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a reddish, orange glow in the sky above my garage.  The glow was located about 50 degrees off of the horizon in the northeast direction which is about 15 degrees north from my ham shack.  This glow seemed to be moving in a south east direction.  When I first noticed the glow, it was fairly large and when it disappeared it was about ¼ its original size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it move across the sky for about 3 to 5 minutes before it seem to completely disappear. About a minute before it disappeared, I ran to my house and alerted my wife who also witnessed it for about one minute before it disappeared.  When it disappeared it wasn’t due to it going over the horizon, it was like a switch was turned off and it disappeared about 30 degrees over the southeast horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow seemed to have a small tail on it and it appeared to be glowing.  This tail was more dominate while the glow was in the northeast sky than it was in the south east sky; it reminded me of a Chinese lantern.  I could not tell how high it was due to lack of clouds or anything else to gauge its distance from. I do remember that there was no sound at all from the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow seemed to moving in a straight line, there was no noticeable maneuvering from the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was raised on various USAF bases around the world for 18 years, and then served 16 years in the US Navy.  I have seen lots of aircraft in the sky at night but this type of glow I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is a skilled observer, and a very reliable witness.  PD))<n>

On the Petaluma side.  We pulled off the highway and stopped, facing in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Red Honda Civic in case anybody saw us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw 5 lights, in a generally straight line and roughly equidistant.  Slowly traveling east and ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were a light, muddy red color, 2-3x larger than a planet in the sky and noticeably twinkling.  Twinkling a bit too much for a lower altitude &amp;quot;light&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first noticed them, the furthest away and lowest light was at our right and just above the hills on the coast hills on the west side of the north Petaluma farmland, about 6 miles away, perhaps near and above the Two Rock Coast Guard station/Tracon Petaluma (707) 765-7000.  Maybe at 500-1000 ft above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The closest light to us was to our south, in front of us and higher than the one to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, 3 formed a loose group up high in front of us and winked out.  The other 2 traveled towards where the loose group was and winked out, one by one, in about the same area, at maybe 6000 to 10,000 ft.  They stayed about the same size, maybe a little larger as they traveled from our right, to right ahead of and above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first 3 disappeared and the other two started traveling in the same direction, 2-3 other new identical &#34;lights&#34; winked into existence low over the hills to our right, roughly equally spaced and followed the others to the same general area and winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to call Petaluma Coast Guard Tracen. Not open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t airplanes or helicopters - no red beacon or red/green nav lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved too quickly to be balloons and too slow for jets and who ever heard of jets forming a sloppy 3 unit group in 6 miles? No matter which direction these objects were traveling (it seemed that their direction varied slightly), their brightness remained consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surface winds were light and from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t high altitude objects with the setting sun reflecting on it, because we were on the wrong side of the object for a reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were to far away to hear if they made any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Literally, 300-500 people must have passed us on the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Accompanying is a Google Earth kmz file showing where we were stopped on the highway and aprox where we determined that the objects appeared to the west.<n>

We could tell without an eye aid that it was shaped funny and NOT round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home we used a small single lens device to look at the &amp;quot;LIGHT&amp;quot;... I could tell it was shaped like a diamond.

They then started to make sudden movements, one by one they would slowly (best described as) &amp;quot;stretch&amp;quot; to the left leaving a light trail  expanding slightly, into a vertical cylinder...then would dim almost completely out leaving a very tiny light.  One by one this happened until all four seemed to disappear, but then as soon as they dimmed they rapidly re-lit, repeating the same sequence until they dropped below the housing development in front of me!  The entire time they stayed in the square formation seemingly stationary yet slightly dropping towards the horizon....<n>

Appeared to be very high in the sky and remained in a relatively fixed position.  At first it appeared to be a thin line of reflected light but changed to more of a pinpoint after several minutes.  Wife also watched after the first two minutes and both of the couple watched the light hover high in the sky above Oakland for about 30 minutes.  During that time it moved position only slightly - drifting roughly north west.  Two other lights appeared and approached the first light during the time it was hovering and then gradually disappeared by apparently moving higher into the atmosphere out of sight of the couple.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, as wife did not see initial appearance of the light she was skeptical about the origin of the object in spite of the fact that it remained essentialy stationary high above the sky of the Oakland Zoo, suggesting theories of weather balloons, etc. as the origen of the light.  However, after watching the object appear as a shiny stationary dot for approximately 30 minutes she was startled to see the light thin to a white line and then disappear in a bright flash.  The entire event took place in a clear blue sky above a very active air space and normal planes with contrails passed far below these lights throughout the event.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object as well as its apparent ability to remain stationary high in the sky was extremely unusual.<n>

I saw an object, cigar or cucumber in shape, traveling in a South to Southeast direction passing over my house.  It appeared to be metallic, was shadowed on it&#39;s left (East-facing) side and was reddish/orange in color on it&#39;s right (West-facing) side which was illuminated by the afternoon sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made absolutely no noise, had no visible wings, left no evidence of a vapor or exhaust trail, had no lights or landing gear.  It resembled a fuselage of a passenger jet sans any type of wing fore, mid or aft and travelled at a constant altitude, velocity and direction.  It was obviously being propelled through the air, pointed/narrow end first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not easily tell the altitude of the object with no point of reference, but in comparison to the sun&#39;s disk, I would estimate it to have been approximately one half (1/2) of it&#39;s diameter.  There was a ceiling of clouds which did not obscure the object and it seemed to me to be well below them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s speed was impossible to judge based on the fact that I could not tell the objects altitude, but it passed from directly overhead through approximately 45° in roughly 6 seconds until it became obscured by the roof of my house.  At this point I ran inside to get to the South-facing bay window of my house to view the object along with my fiancee&#39;.  This took approximately 4 seconds, but as we reached the window, neither of us could see anything in the air whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Most of the sky was covered in tropical clouds; but there was one large section south and southeast of me which was mostly open blue sky (just a few small clouds).  This open area would be over the San Diego airport.  The clouds were moving southwest to northeast pretty fast.  I saw one round black object that was moving against the wind from north to south towards the San Diego airport.  This black object was not moving fast, but was clearly moving against the wind.  When I saw this object, it was not directly over me, but already southeast of me.  The black object was round and it appeared as a sphere.  At the time of the sighting, I could not tell how big it was; other than it was lar! ger than a weather balloon, but smaller than a commercial jet.  It was just below the few clouds that were in the open area.  These clouds were dipping a little, like it was raining up in the clouds, but the water was not hitting the ground.  The black object was traveling below the main part of the small clouds, but through the wispy part of the clouds that were dipping down.  This object, if it was a balloon or a floating object, would have been traveling with the clouds; but there was no doubt, none, the object was moving north to south against the wind.  This object was did not look like a disc, but more like it was round or a sphere.  I saw it for about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was round and black.  The black color did not reflect or shimmer; but maybe it was rotating.  I did not see it rotate, but there was a rhythmic change from solid black to something other than black.  It would be solid black most of the time, and then a reflective shimmer for a short time.  It was not like the reflective shimmer you see when there is an aluminum balloon floating by.  There are no words for it, but maybe half-way between simi-transparent and the aluminum reflective shimmer of a balloon.  I don’t know if that makes sense; but the object was a solid black round object for most of the time, but then for a short few seconds, it would almost become transparent.  And then back to black, a very solid black.  I should have timed the rhythmic change; but I did not think of doing that during the sighting.  There were no lights on this object and it did not make any sound.  After a minute, it was too far away to see.  I did not have a camera with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had that sighting yesterday afternoon in full sunlight.  I was not able to judge the size of the craft; but this morning, Sunday morning, a military transport jet flew by the same location at the same elevation, just below the clouds.  So now, since I just saw a jet about in the same location, the black object I saw yesterday would be the size of the tail wing section; but of course, filled in as a sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NOTE FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway it may be minor but I found one suspicious report in my own neighborhood or perhaps the reporter was just confused.<n> <n><n> San Diego, 9/22/2012 16:45.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness twice stated that the object that they witnessed  was &#34;South and Southeast&#34; of their location (In Mission Hills.) &#34;over the San Diego Airport&#34; ( Lindbergh Field?). That airport is SOUTHWEST of Mission Hills. Of course this could be a typo. They stated that the wind was from the southeast to general North, the exact opposite of the norm in this area but not unheard of. They further stated that this was one reason they were awed as the craft flew against the wind ( Eliminating balloons.). Well if the wind direction they described was accurate then aircraft landing at Lindbergh Field would in fact be landing in the direction of the craft sited. As this is unusual, likely the witness has rarely if ever seen aircraft in this pattern and mistook a final approach for an unknown object. I also note that the time, 16:45 is prime landing time at Lindbergh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

It was exactly 6:30 am on the clock in my car.   I noticed a very, very bright night kind of hovering over the sky above the house.   In perspective, it looked like it was right over the point in the attic of the house.   So I back up and as I back up, this light goes straight up vertically right over the house, moving higher into the sky.   I noticed….and stopped...<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped, it stopped.   Then I put the car back in drive and moved back into the driveway, the light followed and dropped back down, moving closer.   I did it again and the light followed each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I started thinking, maybe it is a police helicopter of something.  So I back out again and pulled out as I normally do, still seeing this light moving with me.   I went to the end of the drive and began to pull out on to the street.  Curiousity had a hold of me at this point so I put the car in park and got out again.   The light had moved over horizontally again as if it was following me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the time was now 6:50 am, which seemed was crazy,  time just flew, I did not realize I had spent so much time watching this bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I get back in the car, and drive away.    I drove 2 blocks over and 4 blocks up which took me to the stop sign at 23rd and F street.   I  put the car in park again and got out to see if I could see the light.   It was there, right above the street ,  definitely following me.   I wasn’t afraid or anything, I just kept thinking, what the heck is this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was getting back in the car and I saw a man going to his car….I kind of waved to him and I asked him if he could see this light…he kept saying no, but there is no way anyone could miss this light.   I told him to  follow the tree  line and look again.  He said no and got in his car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I got back in my car and proceeded to work.   I work off of 120th and Maple.   When I got to work, I glanced up quickly to see if I see anything and I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So a few minutes later, a coworker arrived, she had picked up breakfast and her hands were full, so I went to the door to help her gather her things.   The light was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked her if she could see it and she did.  She said she thought it was a black hawk helicopter  and did not seem too impressed, but by now, it was lighter outside and it did not look as spectacular  and of course she did not see it move across the sky as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no clue what this was but I asked it to make us treat each other well and the take care of the world better……………..oh and I also asked it to make me rich and skinny….just in case it was something out of the ordinary and could hear me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was making a noise that cannot be described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, all of the lights shut off, with 1 light remaining in the back of the object and it zoomed away.<n>

I ran out to my balcony because my sister told me to look out there and tell her what I saw, at this time I woke my roommate up because I saw a HUGE light just parallel from the radio tower (the one with the red blinking lights) off of Southern Drive.  As morning came closer it was apparent that there was smaller (or farther away…very faint) dots in a circle around it, perfectly spaced apart.  This big one would move up and then back down and because of the tower you could see it moving.  Then it would just sit there for 30-45 minutes, then move a few feet.  You could see flashes of lights coming from this object, like rays shooting out.  All of a sudden further to my right (going towards Buffalo) I saw flashing white and red lights in the sky (looked like lights that would be on top of a police car). It would get brighter and then get dimmer again. When it got bright you could see disk shape to it and at random I could see green lights go in a circular movement around the bottom of it. Then I noticed a bright red/white flashing object directly above my apartment building. The two smaller ones and the big one formed a HUGE triangle in the sky. I sat there and watched this from my balcony for hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 5:30 am the smaller ones were in the sky together to my right and they looked more orange.  All of a sudden I saw the sky around one light up with a flash. (Like something you would’ve seen on Independence Day) and then it was gone. Seconds later the same things happen to the other one. The whole time the bigger one was moving so slowly back into the sky, but was still brighter than the North Star. As the sun came up and all of the stars disappeared I could still see this object. I watched this object until about 7:10 am when it finally disappeared.<n>

The best way to describe it would be to say a long wiggly object, completely covered in white lights.  It was the length of about 3-4 aeroplanes from where we observed it, no sound but we&#39;d normally hear a plane at that distance, did not travel in a straight line and we viewed it for about 15 seconds from 2 separate rooms.<n>

But as it got closer i realised it wasnt that at all. It was like a fiery cluster. It was in our atmosphere so wasnt a meteor shower.  Flying slowly across the sky it lasted no more than 2 - 3 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted it on my facebook page and it was seen in Dunshaughlin, Navan, Kells and went on to Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. I have a picture of it that I was tagged in that was taken over the Wicklow Mountains! MORE REPORTS COMING IN THAT ITS BEEN SEEN NATIONWIDE OVER IRELAND!!!<n>

There were &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; coming off it and I was aware of a hissing/fizzing sound although not loud.(Other reports say no sound but I did hear this).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 balls that followed were white with green/ blue colors travelling behind in the path of the first ball equally spaced at approx 1.5 inches using the estimated thumb size at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A strong impression I got was that the first ball was burning up and the 2 behind were following but not &amp;quot;burning up&amp;quot;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them travel at a steady pace to the horizon which took about 2 minutes from 1st sight, then about 4 mins after that I was still outside and heard a distant low boom which made a neighbours chickens cluck and a dog bark, so they knew something was up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My inital thought was oh my it/they have crashed but there was no signs of fire/glow on the horizon and no reports the next day of a crash so I presume it was a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for me I am just a regular guy, 49 steady job etc with an interest in UFO&#39;s. This was the most awesome thing I have ever seen, it still can make my hair stand on end a couple weeks later!  By pure coincidence I was half way through watching Travis Walton &amp;quot;Fire in the Sky&amp;quot;!!!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An amazing night especially as my Mother passed away on the 12th Sept a week or so before and I was hoping for any &amp;quot;signs&amp;quot; she could give,well Im not saying it was her blazing across the sky or anything but what made me step outside to have a cigarette at that very moment?  There are a few videos on you tube of this incident as it passed over England however they seem to differ from what I saw in that they were of more objects and further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading.<n>

It was a fireball with a long bright tail travelling south west from a north easterly direction.  I raced outside and saw it slow down and change shape into a very large object with a series of lights at one end and another at the other end.  It was silent at all times and travelled slowly at roof top level down the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this to the local police.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was maybe 20 feet in length and 5 feet in height This object was traveling from civilian air space to over military airspace and made no sound at all. However, I did hear one out of place sound as this passed by. I heard what sounded like a hawk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was a hawk, it was big, fast and glowing. The glow was not a solid glow. In other words there was more than one light. Maybe about five lights from front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Paramount Blvd, I was distracted by a strange looking object in the air.  When I arived at the corner of Paramount and Market St.  In the city of North Long Beach Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best discription that I can give, is that it looked not much diffrent than the vessels portrayed in the movie INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Staring Will Smith.  But much smaller.  The ones in the movie that hovered over the cities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I pulled over to look and video this vessel with my cell phone.  It did not move but a little. it kind of bobbled very slightly.  I did not hear any sounds from this ship.  All I could pick up in my camara view is the lights flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not stay to see the outcome of the event.  Because I thought that I could get a better view from my up stairs window.  Since I lived about a half mile away.  Which would I figured would have put me in a direct line of site with the vessel.<n>

I pulled over to get a better look and to watch it as it was still traveling east.  As it got closer it appeared to have a see thru cylinder above the fireball, which made me think that it could be one of those big ballons. It finally passed over me,  I did not see no basket or the ballon part. My son and his girl friend were waiting for me to pick them up at the Palace Theater.  I was just seconds from there and when I arrived, he started to get in and I asked him to look up at it since it was slightly passed but overhead. He also said that it looked like it was on fire.  I told him to keep an eye on it while I was trying to get to a more rural setting so I could park and see it better.  He then informed me that it went into the clouds and all sight was lost. Rain had been predicted for Friday nite into Saturday so there were alot of clouds.I don&#39;t know if his girlfriend seen it.! It is now 16:28 9/22/12 I read the Buffalo News and no one report anything that may be able to explain what I seen.

As my friend &amp; I returned from our dinner &amp; went out on the deck facing the ocean, our neighbors on the deck next to us asked if we had seen the lights. They went on to explain that there were 7 orange glowing lights in a strange formation in the north sky and that they were there for a few minutes then faded away. We talked about it for a few minutes &amp; kept looking. My friend &amp; I sat on our deck &amp; in a few minutes our neighbors said that the lights were back again. We jumped up to look. There were 8 orange glowing round &amp; oval lights. My friend looked at them with binoculars &amp; said they were glowing from the inside out. They were moving slowly from ocean side to bay side &amp; very slow. They were not moving in the direction of the wind. They seemed to pulsate. They were! in the formation of 2 attached triangles larger triangle at top &amp; on right &amp; smaller attached triangle on left &amp; at bottom with 2 hanging from the bottom. I filmed them but they were far away &amp; my camera did not record them. They faded out in a matter of 2-3 minutes *At the same time on the ground a few miles down the beach was one area of white &amp; blue glowing, looked electrical &amp; pulsated.  At times it faded away &amp; returned &amp; at times there were bright flashes off to the sides - This happened over approx. 1 hr. After the orange formation faded out, we waited &amp; in approx. 20 minutes another object appeared only this one seemed to have 2 others glowing objects attached to it. They did the same thing that the others did &amp; faded out in approx 2-3 minutes. In another 15 - 20 minutes another appeared in the same area and this one seemed to have 3 other glowing objects attached to it.  It also did the same as the others and faded in approx 3 minutes. It seemed the before these obj! ects appeared in the sky - the electrical glowing on the groun! d would get brighter &amp; more active with more flashes. It was very strange.<n>

I&#39;m on Karpathos, which is a Greek island in the South Aegean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today September 21th at 20.55 local time (GMT+3)I saw a large white shining thing sailing over Pigadia, the main city of the island.  It flew quite low, my guess is 1200 to 1500 meters above ground and had the size of a jumbojet, if you saw it in that altitude.  It came in directly from southwest and had the shape of a french lily.  I know that that&#39;s the classic shape of a meteor, but I don&#39;t think it was a meteor. It was bright white and even if it moved very fast, it seemed to sail.  I instinctively prepared for an impact, because I thought it would crash at the promontory just north of Pigadia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it flew over the crest of the promontory, which has an altitude of 500 meter, something glowing red fell of it. This part must have fallen on the eastern side of Karpathos, whereas the main body must have crashed in the sea between Karpathos and Rhodes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also waited for a crash-noice, but heard nothing. Just before the red part fell off, the main body seemed to rotate 90 degrees and fly sideways.<n>

Valbuena saw 3 lights in the ski as I was traveling south in Palm Beach county, zip code 33401. The lights had been on the ski for about two minutes before I was able to pull over into a gas station where 4 civilians were looking at the ski too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direction of travel was south-west near the Palm Beach International airport. The speed was extremely slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights formed a triangle and the light in the front started to slowly disappear at around 20:29 hours. At 20:30 and 20:31 I was able to take a picture of the remaining two. The two remaining lights also started to disappear starting with the one that appears in the lower section of the pictures that I will submit via email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were cloudy skies, no rain, 79 degrees Fahrenheit and low to none wind speed.

IT WAS LIKE A FLOODLIGHT IN THE SKY THAT SWOOSHED FROM A TREE IN MY BACKYARD TO THE TOP OF MY HOUSE WHERE I WAS STANDING ON MY DECK.  IT WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  IT GAVE A BRIGHT CYLCINDER LIGHT AT ONE TIME.  IT WOULD BRIGHTEN IT’S LIGHTS, AND THEN IT WOULD CHANGE IT’S PATTERN, AND DIM THE LIGHTS.  IT DID THIS FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES.  AFTER MY HUSBAND PULLED IN THE DRIVEWAY WITH HIS HEADLIGHTS ON THIS OBJECT DIMMED ITS LIGHTS WENT IN THE SAME PATTERN.  AS I WANTED TO SHOW MY HUSBAND IT DIMMED IT LIGHTS AND SLOWLY WENT BACK OVER TO THE TREESIDE,  AND SHUTOFF LIKE A LIGHT-BULB?  THIS IS THE HONEST TRUTH!!!!

There was a small white light coming down from the sky and then it seemed to stop. As it stopped, it flashed (morphed) into a big, bright green oval-sphere. After about 2 seconds, it turned back into a tiny white light. We then heard a giant boom noise. It proceeded to move very quickly, and sharply to the left a little in one tiny motion and zoomed extremely fast down to what looked like towards the earth. We were driving on the road, and we could see it a little ways above the trees over the water. When it flew down, it looked like it went behind the trees that were behind the water. The green light that it omitted was so bright that it hurt our eyes a little even though we were far away from it. From where we were, it was close enough that when we seen and heard the boom, at that time! it was fairly low and obviously was already in our atmosphere. My daughter and I were scared and got very teary eyed. I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I would like to know what it was, even to know that there is some kind of simple explanation. I went to my mother&#39;s house directly afterwards and told her about it. When i left her house she called 911. When I got home and called her she told me that 911 had several calls about this sighting and wished to talked to me because they were very concerned. Also, when my daughter and I were driving to my mother&#39;s house right after the sighting, we noticed several cars pulled over. We assumed that they witnessed what we had as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving slowly and then turned abruptly, you could not hear anything, so it was in stealth mode or using some sort of quiet engine.  After turning it flew in the same direction and eventually the lights went out and we lost sight of it.  The craft itself looked metallic grey and the light in the apex was red while the other ones were regular light.  I could make out the V shape because there was nothing connecting the wings together which is why I found it odd in the first place.<n>

We live near an airport and see the planes on a regular basis.  They came, one after another from the north west.  We tried to get photos and by the time we got the camera, all but one was still in our view.  It did not appear on our camera.  They seemed to just flicker and dim and then disappear before our eyes.  Have checked the local news and no information forthcoming at this time.  There seemed to be a Low, humming sound during our viewing.  The four of us observing are all professionals with various college degrees living in an affluent neighborhood of coastal San Diego.<n>

They were moving real slow, and they kinda spread out but looked like they were still flying together.  The store was just down the road so I went in and did my business which lasted about 10-15 min.  On my way back into the neighborhood I noticed a lot of cars driving funny and I looked up and saw like 6 more lights. The people driving were following and watching these lights too.  I drove around the neighborhood and saw all sorts of people watching from their cars or standing in their driveway.  I stopped at a stop sign to get a better look and I noticed the lights looked like they were glowing or had a haze around them. at that stop sign I talked to this lady who was taking pictures of the lights and she said she had counted 17 of these lights.  It all lasted in under a hour.  Immediately came home and googled these orange lights and tons of stuff popped up (This site was the top link).  I watched the top 2 youtube video links that were given,and both videos were identical to what I had seen tonight.<n>

Its light was orange, and was larger than normal for an airplane.  The craft was flying slowly at a low altitude, so we initially thought it was a helicopter.  However, after two or three minutes, as it neared us, it appeared to be circular, approximately 25 ft in diameter with two lines of fire underneath, and as it passed silently overhead, I thought it was an FA-18 from Oceanna NAS that was in trouble.  It flew farther south for a couple of minutes when the fire appeared to flicker out as when you turn off the gas on a grill, and the craft, by then just a dot in the sky, accelerated away at high speed.  Almost immediately after the first craft passed by, a second identical craft flew over silently as the first had done.  This one flew south, then slightly southeast toward the ocean, and dropped down in altitude below the line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back to the house, and at about 8:00 p.m. my wife, daughter and I were on the deck when we saw a loose cluster of about ten identical craft coming from the north.  These flickered out one-by-one, and sped off in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:00 p.m. we saw a very precise formation of eight identical craft coming from the north. This formation was like a check mark with the check at the north end.  These were a precise distance from craft to craft, moving slowly as before, and at a similar altitude.  At one point, the lead craft suddenly reversed direction and flew to the rear of the formation.  This was an immediate reversal, not a maneuver.  One by one these craft flickered out and disappeared.<n>

No clouds were near to where I was watching this craft move.  It was moving straight across the sky at about the pace a jet would move &amp; was moving bay side towards the ocean.  I then saw it move in a circular motion &amp; then forward again. After moving forward for another 10-15 seconds it then backed up without turning &amp; then moved forward again.  This happened very fast.  Normally a jet will make a sound, this was silent. I was amazed at the motion &amp; at that point I realized this was not a plane or jet. I watched for another 20 seconds &amp; the object just vanished.  I kept looking waiting to see it again but it never returned.  There were no clouds for it to go behind. * that evening our neighbors, my friend &amp; I saw more in the sky - I am filing another event report for that.<n>

Like I said, the light was bright but the concentration of the light moved around the circumference of the circle in a pattern of four inner circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved to slow to be a plane but it also moved to fast to be any type of balloon. It couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter either.  THERE WAS NO SOUND AND IT WAS (excuse my language) ((obscenity deleted)) There was a meteor shower that night also.  It couldn&#39;t have been a meteor either because those fall between 25,000-150,000 mph.  The worst part is I tried explaining this to people but no one believed me.  They all said that it was a meteor because of the meteor shower we had had earlier. Or they said that it was a Chinese lantern or weather balloon.  We have a military base not to far off from Lenexa and people even said it could be one of their planes or some new technology they were testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had decided to follow it because it was &#34;hovering.&#34; Followed it through the twists and turns of the neighborhood.  I was speeding, going about 35 mph in a 25 mph zone. Not to safe seeing as I was hardly watching the road. It moved with precision and slowed considerably over some houses but never came to a full stop.  The streets of course wouldn&#39;t allow me to follow its every move but it was high enough to where I could keep it in sight and navigate to another street that would allow me to do the same.  After about 5 minutes of following it I lost it in the treeline and taller houses of the neighborhood I was in.  The whole time I followed it I expected to see it slow and then have massive acceleration until it disappeared into the night sky.  But no, it was just gone. Maybe it did do that and I just somehow missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about another 2-3 minutes of looking for it and making my way back onto the main road I gave up and decided I needed to do something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called 911 and they hadn&#39;t had any reports of a sighting which seemed extremely weird to me because I never saw the UFO appear and I followed it for 5 minutes in a residential area where people would most likely be outside trying to spot the last of the meteor shower even though it was &#34;over&#34; anyways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So probably about 10 minutes had passed since I first saw it, and in a suburb where many people were outside not long before.  The dispatcher I talked to told me to call the F.A.A. but didn&#39;t have the number.  I had some difficulty finding the number online with my phone.  The slow browser didn&#39;t help but I thought a number like that would be easy to find using Google.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I called and recanted the same story I had told the dispatcher, probably about 20-22 minutes after I first saw it.  The man seemed very angry and dismissive.  He kept saying that there were no planes over that area at the time and that there were no downed planes.  I kept saying that it wasn&#39;t a plane but he just kept saying the same thing until I got frustrated and hung up.  It was like he couldn&#39;t say U.F.O. or even call me crazy.  I just got the same sigh and the same response ranging from dull to angry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never talk about this to anyone anymore because I learned my lesson.  Everyone is going to think I am talking about an alien, but apparently people don&#39;t know the definition of a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always have believed that there are aliens (but was skeptical that travel to our planet was possible because there doesn&#39;t seem to be any proof made public) and since this night it has been strengthened.  But it might possibly be a man-made aircraft.  I try not to believe in something when there are no answers or proof, just like any religion.  But at this point it is almost hard not to believe, but I still need solid proof.  It would be awesome to meet a different intelligent life form, even if they were superior to us.  So much could be learned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am just posting this now is because I watched a movie on aliens and after watching it, I got to searching the web and I found this site and found a few sighting in and around my area.  I knew I had a story to tell and that this site seemed more legitimate than several of the like I had come across.  Also, I am glad to see that I am not the only one who has had a sighting in my area.<n>

The lights were about 20 to 25 feet long, made no noise, and appeared to be &#34;swirling&#34; with no space in between.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they shot off over my row of townhouses, leaving light trails that vanished in a couple seconds.  From the light trails, I knew I had seen one edge of a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was so disturbing I have thought about it every day for the last year.  I&#39;ve tried to tell family and friends, and have been laughed at, ridiculed, and asked if I was drinking.  I&#39;ve given up on telling anyone.  But, I know what I saw.<n>

It was 23:00 Indian standard time, date 20/09/2012 and most of the city was in slumber(as usual. It is a very small town of the indian state west bengal).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event: Sky was perfectly clear(no cloud anywhere) full of stars and no moon, as usual there was little city light. It was then I saw an circular, flattened object, size of a small coin(5 cent coin), colored yellowish(looked like if it was made from cheap plastic), flew from west to east through a perfect perpendicular(with earth) and in straight line. It was not emitting any light(like aircrafts do) nor It left a trail or haze. It flew faster than a bird but much slower than a meteor(again there was no trail). There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background info: Physician with MBBS degree(I don&#39;t drink, nor use any drug which may cause any impairment of perceptions).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister: Perusing pre-med.<n>

All of a sudden a bright ball of light appeared in the sky over the ocean.  It lasted a few seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the first disappeared another appeared about 200 yards away (the distance is a guess since it was so far away).  About 5 minutes went by and then we saw another bright light down the beach but this one was over the main land. T hat one was followed by about 10 more. All of these balls of light are bright orange in appearance.  The balls of light fizzled out after about 3-5 seconds each.  While sitting on the balcony filling out this form, it has just appeared 3 more times.<n>

9/20/12 20:35|Belington|WV|Cylinder|180 seconds|Silver streak. Imagine taking a pencil and drawing just a basic line in the sky. it was about an inch long from my perception of vision|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92920.html|274|ndxe201209| Silver streak. Imagine taking a pencil and drawing just a basic line in the sky. it was about an inch long from my perception of vision<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:30pm or 8:45pm, in Belington - West Virgina, my mother and I were driving to town and saw a silver streak in the sky. It was moderatly close to the surface of the planet.  Both my mother and I witnessed this object and at first, we thought it was sunlight reflecting off of an airplane because the sun had just sat behind the mounitans, and the steak was located in the west where the sun had just set. We quicly ruled that out because after closer observation, we realized it was steady with absoluately no movement in the sky.  As always, all it took was a split second to look away from it and it was gone.  It&#39;s like it knew we we&#39;re looking at it and was waiting for us to look away for it to disappear so it didn&#39;t vanish in front of our eyes and seem even more fishy.  This happens everytime I see something that I think could be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The actual streak:  The object we saw was simply as I said: A silver streak. It looked like a white line in the sky (like a hole in the sky but instead of a sphear, it was a streak, a line). There were no lights, flashing or steady that we could see because it was still daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusin of report: I consider myself quite educated in these things because it facinates me. I watch the programs on the History Channel all day like &amp;quot;The Universe - How the Earth was made - Ancient Aliens&amp;quot;. I have ruled out these possbile explanations after some research and thinking. I am also not a paranoid person. I don&#39;t think everything unusual I see is a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was not a star because it was much larger than any star that is located lightyearsaway from our planet. There were also no other stars visable in the sky at the time we saw this &amp;quot;silver streak&amp;quot;  -It was not a space-craft of any human airline or human military organization that the public is aware of because it was motionless and if it were a jet, it would have left a streak of propulsion and fuel in the sky behind its tale as all jets do. It did not leave such tail of propulsion. Also, there was a jet in the southern part of the sky we saw that was obviously a jet because It had a streak of propulsion. So we even had the chance to compare a normal jet to the object we saw and they were absolutely nothing alike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -It was not a satellite in earths orbit.  The naked human eye can simply not view the satellties we have in orbit with as much sunlight left in the sky as there was when we witnesses this object.<n>

We took several pictures of the scenery through out our road trip but just before Rogers Pass near Revelstoke BC Canada, I snapped these three photos in succession and as you can see by the traffic and surrounding vegetation, the object seemed to be the same distance from us at each interval. We were travelling at approximately 120kmh. None of us saw or heard this object while taking these photos. It wasn&#39;t until October 4, 2012 that I sat down to look at our trip and noticed this object. It seems to have a light beam emanating from one side of it and shaped like a double sectional, curved craft of some kind. Or it might be more than one craft flying together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/20/12 10:00|Maineville|OH|Cylinder|3 seconds|Silver Cylinder Shape with verticle rings around  - mostly likely normally transparent|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92929.html|280|ndxe201209| Silver Cylinder Shape with verticle rings around  - mostly likely normally transparent<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, September 20, 2012, I went on my patio to smoke a cigarette. I work from home and was taking a quick break.  While standing there I glimpsed a horizontal cylinder shape, silver, with 2-3 slender rings (attached) going around the cylinder shape (vertically) in sections. It was just a very quick glimpse and when I looked away and back again it was no longer there. There were no lights and it was so odd that it was just hovering there like a hummingbird.  It was pretty close, not at all as far as a plane but not real close, certainly in the sky.  Again, it was so fast and sort of like something you shouldn’t have noticed but it was or IS always there. I more or less blew this off as a possible mind trick or something.  I tend to be pretty practical and will rationalize anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, when I told my husband about it tonight when he came home from work, he really got excited about it. Now, the thing I dismissed as a mind trick became interesting.  I didn’t immediately think ‘UFO’ but more like a ‘Drone’.  I decided then to google images of ‘silver cylinders in the sky’ – no luck. Nothing came up like what I saw.  I then googled using a regular search.  Imagine my surprise when this site comes up with multiple sightings similar to my own!!  So…I had to share my experience, just in case, especially since there was a sighting close to my own a little over a month ago.<n>

It was larger than a star and had an almost artificial look to it- not like a star, but much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few minutes and then went in to get my iPad. I have a star chart program and wanted to know if it was a planet or something. When I came back out a minute later, it was just gone.<n>

This light did not flicker, send down spot light like beams or  move like a helicopter or airplane. There are also no radio towers where it was either. There was simply no way of explaining what in fact it was. It was North West of us. It was in the exact same place for at least an hour and we fell asleep.  Later my husband woke while it was still dark and discovered the light was gone.  We have always been skeptics when it came to this sorta thing at this point we are curious if indeed this was a UFO. There was only one light that we seen as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a disabled 52 year old and I am 42.  We do not use drugs, drink or party.  We are christian people and until now were not convinced that these things were real.<n>

Walked onto the balcony to see, and saw what I thought to be a firework falling, it was like a bright green fireball. It was silent, made no noise, and disapeared over the horizon. I live near an airport, so I don&#39;t believe that the UFO was the source of the noise that I heard at first. Quite frankly I am a little freaked out, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. I thought it looked like an asteroid, but it was a perfect circle, with only a short trail of light behind it. Definitely a UFO<n>

I then observed the following:  what I thought were two shooting stars…they were two distinct objects that appeared to be almost cloudy, wispy but oblong…they had no outstanding color but were appearing to be whitish or even having an orange hue…..the objects were travelling from a Western to Eastern direction and were parallel at one point…however, all of a sudden they both stopped mid-flight and did some sort of figure-eight swirls around each other, stopped, and then went Southward very rapidly and ultimately disappeared.  I didn’t think shooting stars did that…<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Also it was completely silent. No noise AT ALL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, Thank you for the interest, I&#39;m still very excited about what I saw about a block in a half from my home,i I was crawling in bed and looked out my bedroom window to the north, and behind a house there was this flickering orange light, like the house may have been on fire, which is what I originally thought, so bright it illuminated the sky all around that house. This sphere rose up past the profile of the house, and very clearly hovered there, If you can imagine a frozen, elevated, hovering, firework. As if it were shot off then froze. it was very clear. the orange lights were illuminating from the orange sphere itself, and in the center like  I said, a triangle, fiery orange as well, but clear through binoculars... Like an orange being held in the sky, with orange lights all around the outside, not like a ring, ALL OVER, like lightbulbs almost, not spinning....and i could see through to the center, the triangle..I even went oputside and stood on a lawn chair in the yard to get a better look.. Im seeing it clearly, then blackness. The binaculars are 16 x 32..188 ft, at 1000 yards. it was CLEAR<n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

9/19/12 22:00|Pittsburgh|PA|Circle|less than 5 minutes|Two orange lights in sky over Pittsburgh|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92940.html|290|ndxe201209| Two orange lights in sky over Pittsburgh<n> <n><n> <n><n> September 20, 2012  I live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA in the Borough of Castle Shannon, which is south of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 19, 2012, while talking on the phone in my sunroom, at around 10:00 p.m., I saw two, round, orange lights in the sky coming from the south east.  It looked so unusual because they were traveling so close to one another.  At first I thought it was a double reflection in the glass of my glass door.  This door is on the right side of my sunroom.  One light was following the other, moving at a slow steady pace.  The best I could describe them is two full moons, the size of which is when the moon is higher in the sky and not at the horizon.  These lights however were about as high as a low flying airplane going overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe they were two airplanes heading towards the airport since they were in the part of the sky of the air traffic pattern I see so often.   However, the two lights were moving towards the north, which would be the direction of downtown Pittsburgh and not the airport.  I opened the glass sliding door to possibly hear a jet engine, but there was no sound at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a lot of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly hung up the phone and grabbed my camera which was close by.  I then went to another sliding door which faces the backyard to take pictures.  By this time it was directly over my backyard at about a 65 degree angle.  I didn’t have any lights on in the room I was in, so I frantically thought I was snapping pictures when I realized I was in video mode and was turning my camera off and on.  I then turned on the outside light to see my camera settings and then started taking a video clip.  The two lights were starting to fade in the distance and they were now looking white and not orange with my naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went to my computer and started to search for any information I could find to see if anyone else saw this.  It was not reported in the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today I called KDKA, one of the local TV stations to see if anyone else reported seeing the two orange lights in the sky and they said no, I was the only one.  They would not be able to take me seriously unless they had more than one call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked a compass to see what the approximate directions the two lights traveling. To my best ability the lights I saw came from the southeast sky on the compass reading 27/150 traveling northwest on the compass reading 60/340.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know what exactly I saw that night.  It was really strange.<n>

I had just gotten onto 465 W from 69 S.  I watched a triangular shaped craft shoot southbound in the sky across 465. The craft moved much faster than an airplane, and even faster thatn jets I have seen in air shows.  It stopped abruptly in the sky over the north side of 465.  The craft stayed stationary for at least two minutes, until it left my field of vision (in a hurry to get home).  The craft had two white blue blinking lights, very similar to the light you see coming from a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft obviously was not an airplane, as it was too fast and the lights were blinking in an erratic pattern.  The two lights were not coordinated in their blinking.  I felt compelled to watch the blinking of lights, even though I was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes of watching I started to feel dizzy and disoriented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is being filed two days after the fact.  Typically I would not mention something like this. However I can&#39;t seem to get this strange blinking or the image of the craft out of my mind.<n>

I thought it odd that a plane was coming that low and from that direction.  As I watched I realized that it wasn’t moving like a plane coming towards me, but rather it was moving up and down and side to side.  The light was sometimes red and pulsated.  I got my binoculars to see if I could get a better look at it.  Finally I went inside and went to bed.  Around 3:30 am  a friend woke me up to ask if I saw the light in the sky out front. I was surprised to learn that it was still out there. I got dressed and went outside and sure enough it was still there. We watched for a few minutes when we saw it travel north and disappear.<n>

On the way,  I stopped to look up at the stars when the stars were suddenly blocked from view by something black flying over my head in the sky.  There were no lights on it whatsoever, and it flew silently - absolutely NO sound.  My mind struggled to figure out what I was seeing.  I was barely able to make out the triangular shape of it, and I wondered at first if it was a formation of geese. This craft flew SO smoothly and swiftly, gliding through the night air.  It was right overhead and couldn&#39;t have been anymore than 50 ft. above the large fruitless mulberry trees nearby. I&#39;m not good with measuring the sizes of things in my head, but this craft had to have been somewhere between 50 and 100 ft. across. I am still stunned by how black it was; I&#39;m surprised I was able to see it at all. I don&#39;t know what to make of this. I am still in awe.<n>

Several motionless low hanging lights would flicker red and green, and for a little while they were on the ground. Across the field, in the tree line, a flickering light. Then blinking white light, slowly rising from the trees. Once it reached a certain altitude, the whit light turned off and then there was a red and green light that came on and stayed on and then it slowly and noiselessly drifted over my house and off towards the North. After seeing this, I went inside and asked my mother if she would come look at this. We witnessed two more of the same thing.  These were  soundless craft of some sort.  It was technology that followed a certain protocol, because all in all three instances the craft followed the same procedure, only two went north and one went west.  It seemed like every dog in the area was barking last night and the Amish were out late and there was this constant sound of scraping metal. We did try and get video, but it&#39;s so crappy that it&#39;s not worth posting.  They&#39;ve been out here every night for over a week, but usually they are just stationary and then disappear. Last night was the most movement. I was anticipating contact, they were so close.<n>

The sky was clear, and the moon was bright in the sky.  About one minute after gazing, I saw two craft locked in a straight flight path from the south to the north.  They made no sound, and had absolutely no lights at all.  They were within 500 feet off the ground, and they flew in formation with one in front of the other.  Before they left my line of sight, the formation changed so that the rear craft sped up next to the right side of the front craft.  The moonlight in the sky was enough light to see the objects movement in the sky, even though they emitted no light at all.  By the time they went across my field of vision, they had changed the shape of formation from one in the front and one in the back, to the rear craft on the right, and the front craft to the left.  Total duration of the sighting was 15 seconds or less.  I walked to my friends house immediately after, and on the way I was stopped by a police officer who I explained my sighting to not even 5 minutes afterword.<n>

We were driving home from dinner on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. At approximately 9:00-9:15 p.m. we witnessed an event we have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend&#39;s recollection of the event is a little different than mine. That is why I want to include both of our reports as two different testimonials for the same event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is his report: &amp;quot;I am typing this report at 10.30 pm est September 18, 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfiend and I were driving home from dinner at about 9:00pm est. We live in Knoxville, TN in an area about 20 miles from McGee-Tyson Airport. We are used to seeing airplanes fly over our neighborhood all the time, and this sighting was absolutely not an airplane. It moved too fast in the sky and in a very strange manner. I am not sure what I witnessed was from another world or something the government may be doing, but it was definately something I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pitch black outside, and just as we were coming over a steep hill on our way home, I witnessed two distinctively bright lights that appeared to be changing colors from orange- to red- to green. They were very bright, brighter and larger than any other star or plane in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed lasted from about 5 to 8 seconds, it was very brief. However, I can say there was no avoiding seeing this because it was obvious something was happening that was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights moved higher in the sky in a coordinated effort, then crossed each other. First making arches in the sky, then creating an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; path in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights then came together, stopped and held their spots, then took off at opposite directions a speed I have never witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also a truck down the road from us that was stopped. We drove towards them, they rolled down their window and told us that they had witnessed the same thing. This was, by far, the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The “orbs” (as some people have been referring to them) were in the southeastern night sky.&amp;quot; In addition to my boyfriend&#39;s report above, I wanted to give my own testimonial for this event: We were coming home from dinner at around 9pm on September 18th. We were coming over a steep hill, and I could see in the sky, much much higher than the tallest trees, two very bright lights. They were circular &amp;quot;orbs&amp;quot;, I guess some people have been calling them. One was red-ish in color and the other was green-ish. They were very bright, much brighter and larger than any star. And they appeared to have a hazy ring around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I witnessed only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I know that it was not normal. It was not a star, an airplane, or any other &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; object or light you would expect to see in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were moving towards each other, like mirror images. Then they stopped, and separated apart, almost like they were repelled from each other, at a speed I have never witnessed. They moved so fast that you could not keep your eyes on them, then they were simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see the first part where the two lights created arch paths, then &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;ed over each other (as my boyfriend described) because I was looking out the other window, but I did witness the last part of the event, and I can stand with my boyfriend in saying that it was not normal, and something I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as this happened, I had a hard time recognizing what happened, I wasn&#39;t sure of what I saw, then my boyfriend asked me if I saw it. I immediately knew what he was talking about, and didn&#39;t know how to respond. My first response was to call 911 and report it, but we didn&#39;t end up doing that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a truck parked down the road of 2 people we have never met. We rolled down our window and they told us they had just witnessed the same event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically, I saw one bright red light, or &amp;quot;orb&amp;quot;, and one bright green light. They were large and moved at a speed I have never witnessed before, in the following pattern: First moving towards each other, in a coordinated effort: --&amp;gt;   --&amp;gt;   --&amp;gt;         O    O         &amp;lt;--   &amp;lt;--   &amp;lt;-- When they met, they stopped and held their position, then separated in opposite directions at a speed I have never seen. Exponentially faster than any other airplane: O   &amp;lt;----- &amp;lt;----- &amp;lt;----- &amp;lt;-----       -----&amp;gt; -----&amp;gt; -----&amp;gt; -----&amp;gt;   O Then they were simply gone, nowhere to be seen in the sky. Like I said, what I saw only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I do not doubt my boyfriend&#39;s testimonial at all. I believe that we saw the same thing, and I believe that he did see the lights first create arch paths in the sky, the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; over each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend works in sales, and I am a manager at a local company in Knoxville. We make good money. We are not religious, or spiritual, nor are we &amp;quot;UFO hunters&amp;quot;. We have nothing to hide, and we are not looking to be famous.

This time they were flashing with no sound at all behind them like last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I should point out they were flashing in some kind of sequence and then they would change the sequence they would flash. Then one light then another would flash.  Again in the same direction as last night (9/17/12) they went from SW to the North. It lasted the same amount of time 45-50 seconds at the same time as last night.  These lights were square and parallel to each other.  So when we saw them it was from their side then we could see the rear of the lights with no other lights on what so ever.<n>

I did speak to you on a previous occasion; I reported my first sighting back in 2011, on the 4th of July, about an orange sphere and then i saw it again this past 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly 1 year later, but again I was not timely with the report like I should have, which is why I’m filing a written report now.  The other sighting is from a picture I took back in September,  This picture was in no way, altered or modified in any way; I uploaded the picture directly from my cell phone onto my Facebook.   I just noticed this earlier today, on November 16th even though I took this picture back in September on the 18th.  I have emailed the photo to the desired email you provided,  i&#39;m looking forward to hearing back from you.<n>

Went back inside, then at 7:30 or so another one from same direction came in, I went to grab my camera and snapped some pics, but they didn&#39;t turn out that well. My son thinks maybe it was a blimp so I called the airport and asked it they knew of any blimps, and they didn&#39;t, and didn&#39;t know what it could be.<n>
9/18/12 06:35|Morral|OH|Light|5 minutes|Flashing lights and bright white light in bathroom with me.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92937.html|311|ndxe201209| Flashing lights and bright white light in bathroom with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> woke about 6:15 AM  was trying to go back to sleep, saw a flash of light, which I thought was lightning, then I saw another flash, but thought I have to go to bathroom, so got up open bedroom door, and this light was flashing in the window down the steps, thought I will go see what is flashing, but I have to go to bathroom first.  Went into bathroom and turned on light, sat on toilet, and I guess I have to say I felt a presense, so I looked up or tried to and there was the brightest light, like trying to look into the sun, blinding, but I wasnt scared and I was trying to pee, but I kept trying to look at this light and thinking what the hell, we dont have a light there, so I finished my business with my hand shielding my eyes i went to bathroom door, and turned around to see what this light was and it was gone.  Then I was scared because I thought I was dying or having a stroke or something, so I jumped back into my bed and layed there waiting to see if anyt! hing was going to happen, I was really scared but didnt know what to do, I kept thinking my grandkids will be getting up soon, but they dont get up till so 715.  I then got my cell phone and started looking up symptons of flashing lights, white orbs, and it said I could have a detached retina, or TIA, or start of a stroke, so I just layed there waiting, finally at 7:15 my daughter and grandkids got up.  I immediately told my daughter what happen, she asked if I was sure I was awake, I said yes, I always wakeup early, but then go to bathroom and back to bed. She and I are both nurses.  I am 60, so that is why I was afraid that something physical was wrong with me.  So at  8:00 I called my Dr. and went to see him, told him all that happen, but he found nothing wrong with me, and assured me, that he believed I saw something, but he did not know what.  I had no physical symptoms what so ever.  I am still shaken, but I can explain to myself why I wasn&#39;t afraid, during this event! , or why I didn&#39;t yell for my daughter, I do not know, but I k! now ther e was something in that bathroom with me, be it a ghost or UFO, I do not know, but it happened because I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looked up into the sky and saw a bright white flash. The light was in one position and was not moving in any direction from what I could tell. Within approximately 2 seconds of my eyes being dead on this object which looked much like a bright star. It flashed and before my eyes could readjust the light was gone. I waited around and searched the area and surrounding area (if you were looking dead up into the sky the object was near 2 o&#39;clock north.) I saw nothing but black night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Any ways it was around 1:30 am.  It was foggy out side because it had been lightly raining all day.  I was sitting looking out the window.  When I seen two flashes of light looked like lightning.  It lit up the sky but it was coming from down in our field.  I thought that was strange because we had had light rain no storms. In addition, it did not make any noise.  Then right after the two flashes of light, it started to go off.  The flashes were going off like a roll of firecrackers but no noise.  Just one right after another.  Super fast.  I ran to the window to see what was going on and to see what was out their.  Then it stopped.  Our dogs never barked.   Which they do when they hear any noise. I know that it was not a light from a helicopter.  It was flashing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I live near SHAW AFB, and they were doing night maneuvers however this ball of light suddenly appeared ....no trail coming from any aircraft, from the ground up or any beam associated with it.  This did not have any flashing lights, never moved or changed position or shape.  Next the intensity of the light, as though looking into a head light, shone directly on my face like a spot light and actually lit a path as such in my yard in front of me.  Thinking it could have been a helicopter with a spotlight however it never moved and again had no other flashing lights...suddenly it simply disappeared. No fading, no gradual dissipation , just gone.  I have lived here most of my life and having been raised in an Air Force family know what aircraft look like at night.  Also I spend many an hour on my patio &amp; deck and have never witnessed anything like this ever.  I kno! w what aircraft flares are, ball lightning, and this was not anything like that.  I have sought all possible realistic explanations and I have none.<n>

The night sky has been looking unusual for the past month. On Monday, September 17th 2012 at 9 pm, I saw a flying object or saucer in the night sky over my house. It lasted 2 minutes as it hovered, and then it went down the road to the right.  It was a circular object. I also read a book that a UFO was hurting someone&#39;s body. I don&#39;t want this to happen to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is very high technology and I don&#39;t understand how that was happening to him. It is very hard for me to live with that thought that that can happen to people.  Please if there is any way that you can shut the UFO down and move it over the glaciers, I would appreciate it.

9/17/12 21:00|Carmine|TX|Fireball|4 minutes|Large extremely bright star-like object moved steadily from zenith to northern horizon|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92967.html|320|ndxe201209| Large extremely bright star-like object moved steadily from zenith to northern horizon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday September 17 2012  A friend  and I were sitting on front porch (facing north) about 9 PM – the skies are very dark in the rural part of central Texas where we live (about 60 miles east of Austin and 100 miles west of Houston).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking straight at Polaris directly in front of us at 30 deg. elevation (our latitude), Cassiopeia was a bit higher than 3 o’clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright star-like object appeared just south (towards the zenith) of a line between Polaris and the central star of Cassiopeia (Gamma Cas).  It was much larger and brighter than Venus has been this summer, so it was easily the most brilliant object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was an airliner with its landing lights on.  We see these often from Houston airports and occasionally from Austin.  But the airliners are never this large or bright and they always have little blinking red and green lights also, which are especially noticeable in binoculars.  I looked at this object with a pair of inexpensive 8 x 40 wide field binoculars and could see no blinking red and green lights at all.  Airliners usually turn off the landing lights before they reach this point in our sky, so I’m sure this was not an airliner.  My friend was also sure of that.  He said, “That has to be a satellite or spaceship of some kind.”  The object moved steadily in a straight line just due east of north and crossed the (imaginary) line connecting Polaris with Gamma Cas at about the 20% mark measuring from Polaris.  I followed it the binoculars for a minute or so after my friend could no longer see it with the naked eye.  It continued to grow fainter as it neared the horizon, but the intrinsic brightness did not appear to vary, and I eventually couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a satellite in polar orbit – the speed was about right – but I’ve never seen a satellite (and I’ve observed many) that was this large and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time the object was observed was about three to four minutes.<n>

It was as if they were LED lights. They blinked with no other lights. We also heard what sounded like jet engines, but the sound was behind the flashing lights by about two seconds. The sound was quiet not the usual jet engines you normally hear.  We are right in the flight path of Sea Tac and McCord so we see a lot of plane traffic.  I have been an airplane watcher for over 35 years and have never seen anything like this.  We watched it fly from the SW to the North.  Again very strange square lights!<n>

This was around 8:30 pm. At first, I just simply ignored the sound.  But after five minutes, I decided to go outside. The sound was indeed that of a helicopter. However, as I looked up into the sky, I saw three lights blinking. The lights must have been about a few miles up in the sky, and equidistant apart (am not sure about the actual distance between each of the lights).  Then, another helicopter arrived, circling the area above. As I am typing now, I can still hear the sound of at least one helicopter. They are definitely investigating the blinking lights, which I no longer see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As he launched his bottle rocket off, something caught my eye.  I noticed an object flying what seemed to be a little to low for a normal airline plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it was slow moving and not shaped like an airline&#39;s aircraft and it had no exhaust trail and made no noise.  I pointed this object out to my brother and both of us were dumbfounded by this event.  Hat was most fascinating to me about this object is that it seemed to run an odd path in the sky and the atmosphere surrounding the object appeared distorted such as the heat waves you would see radiating off of hot pavement.  It didn&#39;t distort in a heat-wave type pattern though.  It was more of a pulsating visual as though it were bending light rays from its form of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be a dull metallic disk, with a smaller disk stacked on top of it, and it moved in a smooth elliptical path heading north before slowly, and gradually, decreasing in size until it finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It sort of wobbled a bit as it moved so it caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I deceided to monitor it just for a bit as it continued heading toward me.  It was moving slowly so I walked a bit (had to get to work), as I walked, I turned to walk East past the loading docks to where the construction sight is, and it turned to parallel my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still moving very slowly.  It was now past the trees and high enough up that I had full view of the object.  I never once noticed any sort of strobing lights to identify it as either a civilian or military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light stayed constent no matter what direction I was observing it from.  Anyway, as I walked, it gradually moved past me (second witness saw it at this point).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after it moved by me it started to ascend at about a 12 degree angle and rapidly moved away until it was just a pin point of light in the predawn sky.  It only took about five seconds for it to move this fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard any sound of jet engines or rotor wash from a helicoptor and like I said before, there was only ever a white orb like light with no aircraft strob lights.<n>

However this night it was over cast.  I was letting the dog out, and saw a round red light come from out of the marine layer.  I thought it was odd because it came downward and I wasn&#39;t hearing anything.  I looked up to my sons room and heard him talking to his friend online, I lit a cigarette, and turned back towards the craft. I noticed it was coming very fast towrds me; which is odd, and theres no sound. As I took a puff off my smoke, the think flashed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So out of curiosity I swung my cigarette back and forth and sure enough this craft flashed red and a dim white, then dropped like sparkler like sparks out of the bottom.  I called to my son and yelled for him to get his camera, but he didn&#39;t hear me. I have bad legs, so I hobbled into the house to get my phone because it has a camera on it and it was totally gone.  It looked like it was over the police station if I had to! judge its placement.

9/16/12 22:20|Charleston|WV|Unknown|15 minutes|Strange Set of 2 Lights In The Sky Located Off Campbells Creek Drive, Charleston WV|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92878.html|333|ndxe201209| Strange Set of 2 Lights In The Sky Located Off Campbells Creek Drive, Charleston WV<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:20pm on 9/16/12 I saw an object in the sky just to the east of Charleston WV.  I could not make out a shape of this as it was off in the distance but stationary.  I saw sequenced white lights blinking on and off around this object and every few seconds a red light would blink on / off to the left of the white lights.  I watched this for approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Then I noticed another identical set of lights doing the same thing further off to the east just above a tree line.  These lights were also stationary, not moving, just the blinking on and off.  Both objects were visible for duration of at least another 5 minutes or so.  I was out walking my dogs on this night as I watched these objects.   After the 5 minutes or so pasted the first set of lights that I had originally seen just disappeared.  I don’t know how else to explain it.  They didn’t fly off, or shoot up in the air, they just disappeared like whomever was operating the ! object had shut them off.  All during this time I truly was trying to figure out what I was actually seeing.  At first I thought it was a hovering helicopter looking for something.  When the second set appeared I was trying to remember if there was a tower nearby with a light on top for incoming or outgoing aircrafts to Yeager Airport in Charleston.  I assure you there was not.  First thing the next morning I drove down Campbell’s Creek Drive where I was standing when I saw these things and there was no tower above the hilltop where the second set of lights was seen.  After discussing this tonight with my husband I decided to report this to you.  This is the first time I had ever seen anything like this in my life and I am 43 years old!  When I came back inside that night from walking the dogs, the second object was still visible in the sky.  I had observed it all together for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  I heard nothing during this time, no engines or motors running.  ! It was very quite outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We just started a bond fire and watching the night sky.   Seeing shooting stars, satellites and aircraft in the night sky was the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both notice two brighter stars of the same brightness.  Holding my arm out they were the distance apart, as my two finger were spread apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When one of the lights, the one on the left.  Double in brightness and size.  Then dim to the original brightness and size.  The same light did it again, brighten and doubling in size then dim to the original brightness and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next the same light started to move to the left.  Moving  away from the other light. It travel about the same distance that they were apart.  Growing dimmer as it traveled until it disappaired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took about one minute to a minute and a half to happen..<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t say anything to each other as it was happening.  As soon as it disappeared we were both screaming “did you see that????”   We “did not” have any thing to drink or smoke   The next night was cloudy.  We could not tell if that other light was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wandering if that was the ISS being resupplied..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

On September 16th around 9 p.m. my darling wife and I were outside on the deck of our vacation rental.  My wife spotted three individual lights in the sky well above the horizon to the North.  At first I had my back to the objects.  When I turned around I saw three bright, orange lights.  They were lined up and spaced apart in vertical order.  When my wife first spotted the objects she thought they might have been lights from an airplane.  However, they began moving around.  Up, down, side to side and the speed was very impressive.  The objects did not appear to be floating.  I went inside to retrieve our camera.  While inside my wife said two of the lights moved around and then vanished.  However, I did manage to get video footage of the last light before it too, vanished.  The footage clearly shows the object moving around.  THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT WAS NOT CAUSED BY MOTION FROM THE CAMERA! .  I made sure of this by noting it while I filmed.  I&#39;m no expert but I find it hard to believe that any aircraft we have today could do what these lights did.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions or would like to see the footage?    Thank you....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Milford, Gulf Beach Clear, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Start: 8:08PM  First orange light appears, approaching rapidly above treetops @ 8 degree elevation, 295 degrees NW (above Milford&#39;s Fort Trumbull area).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed with 10X21 Olympus binoculars (field of view = 5 degrees), while intermittently aiming 110 lumen LED flashlight in strobe setting towards it (No obvious response to this signaling).<n> <n><n> <n><n> To naked eye, hazy orange glow with brighter core; occasional flickering of luminosity givering a spark-like appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximate altitude during approach: @ 500 ft, but seemed to be gradually rising.  Speed within the range of 75 - 95 mph, roughly estimated on the distance traveled divided by seconds observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparent size: 15 - 40 ft diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound, even though other, more distant aircraft were perfectly detectable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance of light through binoculars, prefocused at infinity, while being observed for a minimum of 60 seconds: 1. Very bright, concise ball of orange light 2. Surrounded by a faint yellowish halo 3. outlined by a reddish ring These create an impression of a lens which is positioned within the bottom of a tapering fan-shaped nimbus of hazy orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine a headlamp which has its short light beam funneled upwards instead of outwards, creating a funnel shape of softer light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During travel this fan-like beacon occasionally flutters or jitters from side-to-side, imparting a flame-like effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this device passed above at about a 25 degree angle, traveling to the SE, its light began to sputter and fade.  Anticipating the usual disappearance, I maintained a tight view, detecting the fact that the light&#39;s dimming was the result of its becoming obscured by a structure surrounding it.  Eventually the forepart of this device, from which the light was issuing, became totally hidden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there was still visible a vague, smokey oblong of light which continued traveling over Long Island Sound into the SE.  After moving over about 140 degrees or arc across the sky this blob of light became too faint to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End: 8:12 PM  Within 90 seconds after losing sight of the first object, the second orange light appeared slightly to the right of where the first one had flared up (@ 305 degrees NW).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This next UFO appeared to be heading directly towards me.  Again, I immediately (though nervously) began to strobe-signal it, while trying to maintain a steady view of it with binocs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Same altitude, speed, trajectory, lack of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> More pronounced was the stuttering variance of this orange light beam - almost like the jumpiness of a bad video feed or the breaking up of a noisy hologram.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously  this accounts for the seemingly &amp;quot;erratic&amp;quot; or wobbly flight pattern that many have commented on while watching these things pass by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Steadily tracking this UFO with the binocs as it duplicated the trajectory of the first one (or maybe repeated itself!), I watched as its orange glow gradually dimmed until it too was visible only as a ghostly blob sailing over the Sound into the SE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End: 8:17PM  (Unlike some previous sightings, this one was not followed by a subsequent pair of lights appearing from the opposite direction.  At least not within the next 90 minutes I remained watching).<n>

The object was a bright light, light blue in color, and much brighter than a star or planet appears in the night sky, maybe about twice the size of anything I have seen in the sky. I noticed it as I walked out in my backyard to have a smoke. The light appeared to be above the mountains in the SSW of the valley, which lead to Lake Tahoe, not sure how high. At first, I thought maybe it was Jupiter or another large planet, but my stargazer app showed Jupiter in the northeast sky and nothing significantly large or bright in the area where I was looking. After about a minute of admiring what I assumed was a strange bright star or planet, it began to move northward. It moved at a slow pace much slower than what I am use to seeing the average plain in the night sky move, also there were no flashing lights, and I could hear no noise, simply a brilliant light blue light floating across the sky. After it ! left my view from the back yard, which was obstructed by the roof of my house, I decided to go out front to see if it was still there and it was. The light appeared to still be traveling at the same rate of speed, but a few seconds after spotting the light in the front yard it stopped, this time hovering in the northeast sky. Exited that it might actually be a UFO, I ran in to grab a small “moongazer” telescope, set it up out front, and located the craft with a 20mm lens, but it still just looked like a light, so I tried a 12mm, 6mm, and 4mm lens in the telescope. Through the 4mm lens, I could see that it was emitting a bright blue glow, and had Blues, reds, oranges and other colors, which I could not quite make out, shimmering all around it, although it still looked like a ball of light. I am not too sure how long it stayed there because I went in to check on my daughter around 5:40 and when I came out to gather my telescope equipment the sun was rising. I could no longer ! tell if it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had noticed across the lake over by a large radio tower (near the town of Raymond), a strange whitish orange light. It was just moving slowly then it had climbed high. I thought that it was just a military jet. Then all of a sudden another one appeared by the radio tower. Thinking &amp;quot;ok its just another jet&amp;quot;. Then it started to dart left and right up and down and &amp;quot;wobble&amp;quot; in the sky. I was starting too get vary curious about the object. So I called my friend over too witness it too, and get his opinion on it. He said oh its a helicopter. Then he said no they can&#39;t do those kinds of maneuvers that quickly. We had just watched it for about 15 or so minutes, then it started to hover over the lake (100/200 feet)but had no noise, just a whitish orange light. So now we were getting spooked, so we quickly cleaned up our gear and moved back to the t! ruck were we watched it for another 15 or so minutes. Then we noticed it was coming closer and closer too our side of the lake. So we we&#39;re now getting out of there, seen enough of it, as we drove down Rt. 11 I had noticed that it was still moving slowly across the sky in the same direction as us, but in the distance. Above tree level. So he dropped me off at my house on Rt. 25 in Limington, it was still there. But off in the distance. He drove off, but I noticed from my bedroom window that it was still hovering (near or in the town of Standish). I was a bit freaked out, so I locked my window, closed the curtain around 04:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had thought I had seen little sparks of light every once in a while, but thought i was just tired.  I didn&#39;t think about it at first; but as this red light was slowly proceeding towards the West, in my direction very slowly, just below the clouds, I realized the light was not flashing like a normal plane, nor was it making any sound. I saw a segment on Destination Truth where they dared to flash a light at what they thought was a UFO and it responded back.  So I was smoke a cig and thought I would try so I took 3 quick puffs then 3 slow puffs off my cig, and the light,responded. I was shocked, it was a UFO, so I called up to my son who was watching TV in his room with his window open, I said &amp;quot;Shane get over here&amp;quot; SEVERAL times to no avail, when I turned &amp; looked at the object it was over in the direction of the police department which is maybe 1.5 miles north east of us, and saw the light make a couple flashes and then some sparkles came downward, the kind you see from a sparkler when a child just holds it. I wanted to get a picture; but have a disability and move very slowly so i SCREAMED &amp;quot;SHANE GET YOUR CAMERA, GO TO THE WINDOWN&amp;quot; but he didn&#39;t come so I went in the house to get my cell phone. When I came back it was gone.  It was no where. Not in the front, or other obstructed view areas. I have in the past had sightings; but for some reason this one really shook me up. maybe it was caught on a traffic light or business security camera?<n>

At that moment, I knew this was not an ordinary object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed everybody&#39;s attention to witness what I just saw.

9/15/12 22:00|Portland|OR|Circle||Large teal circle followed by helochopters hours later.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107488.html|353|ndxe201209| Large teal circle followed by helochopters hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over a year ago, I believe I saw a UFO.  However, due to that night&#39;s events and how tired I was, I could be mistaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night in question took place just after an article was released about US and Chinese naval ships dealing with USOs in the pacific off the coast of San Francisco.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to Clyde Lewis in Portland talk about the article and discuss various UFO sightings.  This is part of the reason I think what I saw may be wrong.  There is also the fact that near the beginning of my shift, I was working as a security guard at an apartment complex in Portland, there was some sort of big celebration taking place with giant search lights moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, I also hallucinate when I get very tired, however, I don’t recall be that tired during that particular night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the search lights started their thing as soon as it got dark.  They were white beams and would reflect off the clouds when they came across them.  Nothing spectacular about them and they were out after a few hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clyde Lewis’s show was still going for since time after they went dark.  His show was also still going when I saw a new green search light going across the sky.  At least I thought it was a search light as I watched it travel from the eastern horizon and disappear in to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What changed my mind into thinking it was a UFO is that it traveled in a straight line, never returned and was clearly traveling above the clouds since it would momentarily disappear when it passed by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thus, I am sure it was not the beam from a search light.  Also, the suspected UFO was moving very fast and seemed very large.  Also, its color was a solid bright teal.  So basically I think I saw a teal circle of light UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, had I just seen that light I could have written it off.  But, what happened a few hours later makes me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clyde’s show was over and I had switched to coast to coast.  So the occurrence happened sometime after midnight PST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this occurrence was the unusual appearance of 4, presumably black hawk, helicopters flying fairly low and over the same path the teal light took.  There was one difference though.  The 4 helicopters seemed to stop over the Willamette River for a couple minutes before separating.  One headed south.  Another north.  The third went North West and the final one stayed above the river for a few more minutes before continuing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There you go.  That’s my potential UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It ascended straight up and hovered around.  It wall wares to be moving very fast and vanished.<n>

This was observed in a boat on the intra-coastal waterway.  The orange balls of light were moving slowly in formation approximately 100 yards apart.  They turned slowly westward in un-uniformed pattern (not in a line).  We lost sight (lights were obscured by trees) while docking the boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour and a half earlier an orange column of light had been seen shining through storm clouds over the Gulf at the horizon.  The entire sky was dark except for this column of light.  This light was seen for at least 15 minutes, at which point we lost track as we continued fishing.  The column of light was observed by a crowd fishing on the Venice Inlet jetties, who were also pointing and commenting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/15/12 21:15|Jackson|MT|Oval|5 seconds+|Spacecraft entering Earth’s atmosphere.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95136.html|360|ndxe201209| Spacecraft entering Earth’s atmosphere    On September 15, 2012 at 9:35 PM, I witnessed an entry into Earth’s atmosphere of an unidentified spacecraft.  After having re-visited the site a couple of months after, I have revised my original account some.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were camping in the upper Big Hole Valley, 20 miles west of Jackson, Montana.  We were camped 1 mile upstream of Lower Minor Lake, 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  It is a remote area. Visibility was unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My account is:<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had retired for the evening to his camper and it was probably a half hour after total darkness.  I had been checking out the stars with my binoculars, I lowered them and was looking toward the North Star.  An extremely bright yellow light, many times larger than the Space Station and a hundred times brighter, exploded in the sky.  Out of this coalesced an oval, silvery, luminescent spacecraft. And that is what it was, a spacecraft.  This craft dropped out of the sky at, I estimate, a steep 75 degree angle, heading south, almost right above me.  The craft decelerated quickly and getting larger and easier to see what it was.  The position of the ship was perpendicular to the earth’s surface when it entered our atmosphere, keeping in this position until it very smoothly, automatically it seemed, rotated to a “right side up” position and leveled out, just as it disappeared in the darkness.  The spacecraft seemed like it was pulsating when it first appeared and it did go behind some sparse tall tree tops. No external lights were visible and it was totally silent.  The craft continued flying south, paralleling just to the east of the Bitterroot Mountains and the Montana/Idaho border.  Speed by then was probably in the hundreds of miles per hour.  This seemed like it happened very fast, but it must have been 5-6 seconds or more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my best view when I was looking at the top portion of the spacecraft as it was rotating level.  Around its perimeter, it was plated, armored, fit together in a definite angled radius of the ship’s oval shape.  In the center was a raised half circle section, shaped in a radius in front and open in the rear, much like a game horse shoe. It was very sleek looking and was totally silent.  The spacecraft’s size; when I hold my arm out, the space between my thumb and finger would be about 1 to 1 ½.  I have short arms.  Thinking about it on where I was, the mountains surrounding me being some miles away, I think when it was at its closest, it was 2-3 miles and making the calculations, I believe it would be 100-200 feet long, 40-60 feet wide and thin, although I am not sure how thick it was.  When the craft entered the earth’s atmosphere or appeared, I feel it was 25,000’ to 50,000’ in elevation, probably higher than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this was over, I immediately went to the cab of my truck and wrote down the time and what happened. I then went over to my friend’s camper and asked him if he had seen anything and with it being totally silent, he hadn’t.  I then elaborated what I had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On November 18th, I was able to stop back by, having to walk in this time of the year a mile in due to the snow to where we had camped and I saw the spacecraft.  It is one thing to have seen something and another to put it down on paper.  I wanted to go back to take some photos and get a better descriptive narrative in my own mind of what I saw.  The craft did come down higher than I originally thought, my original thought was 12,000’ to 15,000’.  It is still my biggest unknown.  Those who have seen the Space Station flying thru the sky, gleaming brightly due to the sun’s reflection on it’s silvery surface, then only to disappear when the reflection is lost, will know what I mean.  Knowing this, this craft had to still be in the suns rays when it appeared and it was dropping rapidly and decelerating.  I also lowered the space between my finger and my thumb when I held my arm out to gauge its size, I originally had down 1 ½” to 2” and 200’ to 400’ long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why did this alien craft choose this location to enter the earth’s atmosphere?  After reflecting on this for a bit, I think that with the upper Big Hole Valley, west of Jackson, Montana, being a very remote location, is why this area was chosen.   We were 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  Jackson residents would be able to see the initial explosion of re-entry, but only a silhouette after, if that, as they would be seeing the “dark side” of the disc, as I was seeing the lit up side where I was.  The residents in the Salmon, Idaho area would be farther away and possibly see the explosion and briefly a “falling star”, until it disappeared behind the mountains.  I feel that is why the craft comes in perpendicular to the earth’s surface.  Its visibility is limited to the people to the east, where it is most in view.  Just before the craft rotated level, it lost the suns rays and disappeared.  I suppose the area should be checked to see if there were any reports of sighting! s or such that night.  There were a few more people camped out in the area, but not close to us.  Most people would be in their camps or trailers that time of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an extraordinary event that I witnessed, especially the detail that I saw it in.  I do plan on having a drawing made up after I post this.<n>

It seemed to be egg shaped and maybe the size of a car.  Red flame(s) coming from the top and possibly whiteish flames from the bottom.   We went inside the house and we were telling (2) two of our buddies what we had just seen.

We noticed a few airplanes (blinking lights and /or sound).  Then we saw a line of orange lights, non-blinking (relative size as a bright planet from river surface)starting to move in the sky from the north to the south roughly parallel to the river.  They seemed to be flying in group formations:  one or two of them were in a tight formation perpendicular to each other, and the others in a line of sorts.   Clearly they were navigating and moving together.  As each one got to a certain point in the sky it seemed to just disappear (can&#39;t say that they just took off into the sky or not). We listened carefully for sound but there was none. In total there were probably about a dozen that crossed the sky over about 5-10 minutes.  They were round, bright, orange, very distinct, and very coordinated in their movements. We are educated, normal, and sane people an! d were affected by this enough to report it here.<n>

I was driving East on Griffin road near I-75. There were airplanes flying in the direction of the sighting.  I initially saw what appeared most similiar to me as a fireball falling but it was descending at much to slow of a rate to be a free falling object.  The object had a fire or glow to it with a tail pointing up and the object descended to the point just above or near the altitude of the incoming and outgoing planes at the airport.  The object then became stationary at that altitude and then proceeded to break up into 4 different objects.  Each of these 4 objects looked exactly alike.  They all looked like a fire ball with a tail pointing up or as if they were made of light with a tail pointing up.  As the 1 main object split into these 4 objects, th! e 4 objects spread out laterally and evenly across from each other at the same altitude and then 2 of the objects maintaining the same altitude dropped simultaneously or began descending down.  After they moved down slightly the other 2 object also descended mainting the same altitude with each other. so, now there are 4 craft still but 2 are below or at a lower altitude from the other 2 objects which were almost direclty above the other 2 objects.  The 4 objects then began descending further until i could no longer see them.  the objects definitley were not free falling.  The intial object split into 4 objects and the formation of them changed and the direction and rate of descent varied during my observation.  Very incredible sight to see.<n>

I saw a side view and duration was about 15 seconds. It was one flying object with five yellowish greenish glowing circles.  I couldnt tell how fast it was going but it looked as if it were flying and then it looked like it dropped.  But then it flew back up and I lost it in the clouds. And about three seconds later I saw a glow in the clouds. It was flying east towards the ocean. It had one single layer. But it had a tip it had a middle section and it had a back layer.  As it dropped and flew back up it looked as if the glowing circles turned into lines.  It was bigger than a plane.<n>

These objects were close in formation appearing as one object then as six. They separated in different directions now moving horizontally again, two just hovered switching places and the rest disappeared away from the two.  There were a few commercial aircraft in the sky going in different directions(FLL airport in area).  I saw the same thing a month prior to this but I thought they were meteors because the two I saw then moved in one direction and then disappeared.  Either way, judging by the size of the aircraft near the objects they had to be large with long flames. It is because of how they hovered and moved horizontally after their descent that I am reporting this.  These were not meteors. Two of us saw these and tried to call in it minutes after the sighting.<n>

The two sets of lights were EAST from our location. We were very confused and fascinated at first, uncertain of what we were seeing. My companioned asked, &amp;quot;Are those stars?&amp;quot; But I had mistaken them as lights of communication towers. However, we quickly both understood neither was correct, as:  -We were unable to see any stars due to light pollution from being near the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -There are no communication towers in that specific spot or at that specific elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -The set of lights nearest to us were found to be slowly moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two triangles, very large and very peculiar ih their shape and position in the sky. It was enough that we immediately knew we were not witnessing something normal. We have traversed Route 6 many times at night and never have seen these before. Both sets had three individual lights which flickered or twinkled like fire or a very bright star. The color of the lights was ORANGE-RED. We pulled over on the side of Route 6 and turned off our lights to get a better view after approximately two minutes of witnessing the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this point, the lights furthest from us (Figure B in my illustration) were either too distant/sunken behind the tree line to see, or had very peculiarly suddenly disappeared. Either way, we were unable to see Figure B any longer. Figure A (the nearer set), was drifting very slowly toward our location. NO SOUND was issued from the lights. I strained to see any more details, but was unable to. I was unable to see any visible lines or structure of any kind between or connecting the lights. I was unable to determine the make or nature of the lights, other than that they resembled fire of some kind, orange and flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunely, I am not equipped to determine how high the lights were, but am able to say they were below a thin and scattered/spotty cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One by one, they began to slowly fade. First the light nearest us, and then the two behind at the further end of the triangle. The lights dimmed very slowly and then went completely dark. We were unable to see anything again after that, and after waiting for a moment, once more turned on the vehicle&#39;s lights and resumed our drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I distinctly recall seeing a program on television a year before about triangular sets of lights a few years back in Tinsley Park, which is a few hours from this location. From the amateur footage and photographs I saw on the television, these lights matched them very well. I wanted to obtain a photograph or video footage as proof of the objects, but the triangles&#39; lights were not bright nor large enough for my phone to be able to capture among the surrounding darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No visible moon was present at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After pulling alongside the road, the remaining lights were visible for approximately 2-3 more minutes, making the total window of visibility at approximately 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were East of my location at about a 15 degree angle of elevation in a slightly curved line and the middle was made up of lights that formed triangles with one UFO that was in front. The lights were white with a yellow tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we pulled over, we saw an airplane banking and flying towards the UFOs.  The airplane had a red a blue light and was moving faster than a private or commercial plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later after we pulled over, they were moving West towards us and were then at a 45 degree angle of elevation.  While I was trying to get my phone out of my car to take a picture, my friend started to yell from the field, “Hurry up, they’re disappearing!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got to where he was in the field, the lights had disappeared. My friend told me that the light in the front had started to rise vertically but slowly, but then increased speed and was gone in an instant. The other lights in the line then disappeared the instant the lead UFO had flew up, according to him.<n>

We were setting up to get a look at the Andromeda Galaxy but clouds were blocking that portion of the sky.  We therefore occupied ourselves with identifying individual stars and constellations. Suddenly I noticed a light moving across the sky from high above, proceeding north to the horizon. It appeared to be very high in altitude and moving too rapidly for a conventional aircraft. The speed, however, was far too slow to be a meteor. We are familiar with aircraft as they are constantly descending into Newark and other New York airports.  The luminosity was that of an average to slightly below average star.  I observed it with the binoculars and there were no lights….just the “star” appearance. A s I watched it, it suddenly stopped!  Among the stars this was easy to see.  It then proceeded forward…..zigged and zagged.  Excited, I yelled to my granddaughters! , “We’ve got our first UFO!” We watched it move toward the northern horizon as it stopped….proceeded….suddenly changed directions and then disappeared over the horizon to the north. Nothing man made could have made these sudden and erratic moves.<n>

Parked all the way at the top we were having some cigarettes and just talking about life. From the get go we noticed that there were many animals out even though it wasn&#39;t a full moon.  At about 6:20 we noticed someone in a motorcycle drive up. He looked very mysterious and went past the point of no entrance. Like 10 minutes later he came back down and my friend and I both thought it was very suspicious. At about 6:30u friend said he was hearing something,  I had no idea what he was talking about. After a couple of cigarettes we decides it was time to leave since it was getting dark. When we got in the car we noticed a huge object in the sky on top of the hill in the direction of where the person in the motorcycle had gone. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was lookig at.  It wasn&#39;t far at all and it looked like a saucer. There were windows around it and it had really bright lights. After about 3 mi! nute it dissappeared as if it somehow knew that we saw it ( maybe because I turned my car on). I proceeded to driving towards it where the guy in theotorcy me had gone and the skies were clear.  There is no way something that big could have disappeared do fast. Without a doubt it wasn&#39;t any craft like the ones I&#39;ve seen before.<n>

The 3 shapes were in a triangle formation.  I have never seen anything like it and felt glad to have others think it was worth stopping to look at too!<n>

Almagre/Mt Baldy near Rosemont Reservoir in 8 miles west of Colorado Springs.  At 5:30am I woke up out of a dead sleep and opened up my tent flap to see a bright bright star.  I knew it couldnt be a star when it started getting closer and closer. Thought it might be a comet or asteroid but then it stopped.  The single bright light turned into three round lights and hovered close to an hour in one spot.  Then lights shone from both ends of the object and red fireballs or plumes were ejected on either side of the object.  The object then disappeared with the rising of the sun.  There was no sound to the object just red and white lights.<n>

It traveled across the sky quickly before stopping and bobbing up and down before disappearing (or moving so fast we couldn&#39;t see) and reappearing much lower in the sky.  There was a dim circumference of light around the amber light also.  It stopped and bobbed for a few minutes more before receding to the north.<n>

It was moving very fast and then made a sharp right turn without slowing and then came to a dead stop in the sky for about 2 seconds and then reversed course and went left in front of me and vanished. And by vanished I don’t mean flew behind the trees – it just winked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say if it had any shape other than that it was a very bright red ball of light.  It was a much bigger &#39;light&#39; than the pin point light of a star or the lights you see on an aircraft.  I would say it appeared to be the size of a pencil eraser if you held the pencil out at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to say how high up it was but it appeared to be pretty high.  It was well out in front of me when it did its turn right, stop, fly left maneuver, so I&#39;d guess it had to be just south of, or right over Shartlesville and visible to anyone traveling on RT78.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen plenty of &#39;shooting stars&#39; meteors and this was definitely not the same.  This thing was moving FAST, changed direction 90 deg without slowing down and then came to a complete standstill and then reversed direction just as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For what it&#39;s worth, I mentioned it to the guys I was hunting with that I thought I may have seen a ufo and before I could tell my story one of them said ‘was it a red light’?   He went on to say he thought he also saw a red light in the sky on his way to meet us, but figured he was imagining it, being a little groggy from just waking up.  He didn&#39;t elaborate any further.  I however was not the least bit groggy, having been up for over an hour and on my 3rd cup of coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I looked at it for like 15 minutes then I had to wake my wife and my oldest daughter, because I thought I was going crazy or something. I have never ever seen anything like it. And I was, until now not really a UFO believer.  We 3 looked at this “hovering, moving” star for 25 minutes. Then my wife suddenly saw a smaller “star” coming up from underneath the larger star. At this moment the larger one stopped.  Then the small one disappeared (at least we think so) into the bigger one. The large “star” then moved really fast, up and to the left and disappeared. We looked for another 5 minutes to see if something else happened.  But clouds were coming in so the sky vanished. I could have given my car away for a stargazer at that moment since It all happened far away to the east.  What the hell did we see!? I´m an RC helicopter wizard and even one of! my boys could not move like that for 45 minutes. :-) How the “star” moved was like nothing I´ve seen or can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

They were very close, almost touching, turning red, blue, white with flashes or pulses. They were stationary. They did not seem to move. I woke my boyfriend.  He saw and was also surprised. It almost seemed like the two lights merged, creating a cylinder shape. This had my eyes squinching, trying to make out the changing shapes.  After 20 minutes of watching this, the lights faded out and were gone, like someone just shut off a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was observing planets, but cannot be certain.

Other objects dirigible in shape with lights changing from red and green to blue and magenta in a pulsating fashion. 5 minutes later, first object begins landing process, as it gets closer to the ground, true shape is revealed to be a disk 25 feet in diameter, jet black in color, with cube shaped constructs on top of it. 3 minutes later, alien craft lands on the ground, with the 2 other objects orbiting above it. 2 minutes later, at 2:25 AM, I rushed across the highway to observe the craft up close.  At 2:30 AM, began to slowly move towards the craft, and one minute later, came into physical contact with the craft. Surface of the craft is smooth and metallic to the touch with no scratch marks or indentations on it.  No hieroglyphics or symbols on the surface as well. White light se! en beneath the craft. 2 other craft still seen orbiting above the main craft. After 12 minutes of studying the landed craft, the craft began making a humming noise, possibly signaling the start of the launch.  Craft lifts up 20 feet into the air, shining the two beams of light, operating them somewhat like searchlights.  Light beams move around in sweeping motion until one of the lights converges on me followed by the other.  Lights focused on me for 30 seconds, then turned off.  The main craft floats up to the 2 other craft and at 2:45 AM, all 3 craft fly off to the Northeast at a fast speed. Later returned to my apartment.<n>

We traveled west and as we got to around Cicero I (the driver) noticed a few odd lights in the sky to the left.  They were traveling to the east.  I told mom to look and joked that they were UFOs, but said they could be lanterns.  Then, more lights came and they were all moving in the same direction along the same path.  I thought that they moved too deliberately for me to think they were lanterns, so gave up on that idea.  They may have been coming from somewhere around Midway airport area, but I am not sure.  There are airplanes that fly near the area, but these objects were definitely not jets or planes; they were too numerous, slow and quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I asked mom if she’d mind if we pulled over to look.  She didn’t mind as she was pretty curious too.  We stopped the car and noticed that more and more lights kept moving on the path in the sky.  We noticed that they were round (oval or orb-shaped) and yellow-orange.  Sometimes the lights would pulsate and change color, but not in unison.  They did this individually, deepening into a primary red-colored glow and back to orange or yellow.  Sometimes they would fade out until you couldn’t see anymore light-- but only a gray round object floating in the sky.  The streetlights obstructed some of our vision so we could only see them as they traveled towards us and next to us; as they passed they faded into a light polluted area.  The unidentified lights were about low-cloud height, and could have been the size of a small car, I’m guessing-- I&#39;m not sure how my judgement of this kind of thing is.  We saw as few as 50 or as many as a hundred… it is hard to tell since I understan! d that excitement can obscure one’s judgment of numbers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take pictures, but my phone&#39;s camera couldn&#39;t zoom in well enough and the streetlights obstructed the camera&#39;s ability to take in other lights.<n>

Traveling in straight line from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard a few weeks ago about 10 pm and spotted a bright white light with a blinking white light.  My wife has seen the same thing 4 other times. It always appears in the same location, it comes from the south and flies north.  I am a commercial pilot and fly for a major airline. I live close to Houston Bush Intercontinental airport.  I know what an airplane looks like flying in the night sky and this was no airplane. It had no navigation or red beacon lights as all airplanes are required to have. When I first saw it I thought it was the International Space Station or a satellite (I have seen both from my backyard many times).  This was bigger, about the size of an aspirin.  Then I saw the flashing white light and thought it was an airplane but it had no red/green navigational lights.  I see airplanes flying at low and high altitude from my backyard and you can see the navigational lights and know that its an airplane.  This was totally different. Im w! ondering if it is some kind of spy drone.  It made no noise and it was difficult to judge the altitude but I would guess it was at least 50,000 ft. It was traveling in a straight line and about the speed of a satellite.  I lost sight of it as it flew over the horizon and behind the trees. We look for it almost every night.  My wife tried taking pictures but its too high in the sky to get a clear shot of it. I wish I had a camera with a high power telescopic lens.<n>

He wanted us to look up in the sky southeast. There were three lighted objects, rotating and changing in color. They were in a straight line formation, diagnal. Video footage shows them in a nearly triangular shape. We spotted them -- watched for almost a minute and one by one they disappeared.  Weather forecast reported clear skies!  Objects were chaning color, moving quickly in a straight line across the sky. Reportedly from the west to the east. Colors ranged from green, orange, red, white and yellow-ish. Last light seen seemed to leave a trail of orange sparks behind it. It was not an airplane. Flying too low and too close to each other. Def. not an airplane becuase of the space between each object and the formations in which the objects evolved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched hours of UFO youtube footage and have been able to identify similar objects in ohter videos, including footage from Illinois area in the last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SIGHT!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

These lights were not flying in any type of symmetrical formation but were following each other at varying distances.  It appeared as though there was a white light that was rotating in a counter clockwise motion and as it came around to the side we were viewing them from the red (main part) of the light would become diluted with the white light and appear orange.  When I first seen the lights there appeared to be three but as they flew towards me more kept appearing over the same ridge.  At first I thought they were helicopters but there was absolutely no sound of engines/motors.  All of the lights appeared over the same ridge and traveled to the area over Springdale Heights and slowly vanished.  These lights! were very visible and this whole episode lasted about 10 minutes.  I am very surprised that there were not any reports or stories in the local paper or on the TV news.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object flew slowly in a southwestern direction and crossed the big dipper from my vantage point.  It continued on a path like an airplane would and had no erratic movements.  However, I heard no noise of heli-engines or airplane sounds. It could not have been too high up, probably the average altitude of a plane landing in a few minutes.  I am not familiar with altitudes sorry.  Anyways, I first thought this was an owl flying and some lights were shining up into its wings as its shape was a chevron or V shape. The shape seemed to disappear and it looked like it was the same owl turning and flying and reappearing in the light. I was debating whether to take a picture or video the object as I was on the phone. As I kept watching this &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; I realized that it was not an owl and it was some flying craft.  It had a pattern of light that was changing and blinking and this i! s what gave the appearance of an owl flying into and out of light.  The light was a solid glowing orange similar to a 60w light bulb color. The whole craft was lit from end to end. Then the light would blink off and on 2-3 times and return to the full glow. Then when it was fully lit a dark line would move from the left to right &amp;quot;wing&amp;quot;.  Then the light would return to the blinking and then the left right.  It continued this same pattern until it flew out of my sight.  It was not a normal aircraft and I am not a paranormal or ufo type person. I dont drink or use drugs either.  The sky is very clear and I saw plenty of other aircraft in the sky during this same time period. All of them had the traditional strobes, red green blue etc.. It was not one of these. It was not a searchlight or anything similar to a police helicoptor.  That is about all I know, I went online to look and see if anyone else saw this tonight and found this site, so i wanted to report it.  I ho! pe someone else saw what I saw and can explain it. Thanks<n>

Around 7-10 crafts with red, blue and white lights moved over head slowly. All of the crafts appeared to have direction as if they are manned.  Most of these flew just below the tree line over a field near Namco.  All of the crafts moved in the same general direction over the field and then down behind the tree line.  Four of them appeared to fly in formation.  Each seemed to almost be within a stone’s throw distance but every single one created no sound.  It was completely quite as they flew over.  The white light on the craft appeared to be on the front of each. While they were going over head I shined an iPhone camera light on and off toward one. It turned and began heading in my general direction. I then immediately shut off the light and it returned to its course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Just before the incident Myself and one other were on a walk. Several solar powered outside lights were speratically turning on and off which we found strange.<n>

We were on final approach, gear and flaps down, lined up with the runway, landing from the south. I had a window seat, 8F, in a 737-400.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright orange orb came into view, as if it was hovering or floating, not more than a couple of hundred feet below our aircraft, possibly less than that.  We quickly passed overhead, and I lost sight of it as it went out of sight behind our plane.  It was orange, as bright as a crab pot buoy, a very vivid, intense orange. It appeared to be about 3-4 feet in diameter, but that was difficult to judge due to our relative speed in flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s possible it was a balloon, but it would have been at about 1,500&#39; altitude, and directly in the path of landing aircraft.  I was surprised to see more aircraft landing behind our plane, as the orb was so visible, and very close to the approach flightpath. I would have thought our pilots would have seen and reported it as a hazard to navigation, even if it was a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was just setting behind the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula at the time of the sighting, and I was looking out to the east.<n>

I caught view of two glowing or reflecting craft heading into the East.  They were at very high altitude moving very fast and the distance between the two changed as it appeared one of the craft accelerated. The two craft did not appear to be fighter jets and they left no contrails.  At first I thought they were seagulls, then I thought...two weather balloons.  After a longer look I felt that they were controlled craft. They disappeared behind cloud cover and did not reappear.  This is my second sighting in 30+ years of unusual craft and it was exciting to see.<n>

I’m sitting on my front porch. It’s raining and there is thick cloud coverage, enough to where you cant see anything maybe 150 to 200 feet in the sky.   As I’m sitting there, I quickly hear what sounds to be like a tornado siren starting up.  I thought to myself “Hmm, that’s weird?  This is not the weather conditions for a tornado?”  This sound had a very wobbling electronic frequency noise.  The sound was loud and started moving toward me from the East.  I got up from sitting down and walked into the street to see if I could see a plane or something, when I walked into the street, it sounded like there was something hovering right above me.  When I looked up, directly above me, there was a quick flash of a cluster of bright blue lightning.   The lightning was squiggly and looked to be contained in a circle.  I could feel whatever this was flying above me in a weird way.  It felt big and it was moving slowly, too slow to be a plane.  And I know what a jet turbine or any type of propeller sounds like.  It sounded like a subwoofer on a massive level, it was unexplainable.  As it passed over me, the frequency of this sound started to slow down as it got farther away like when you listen to a tuned guitar.  Almost at a state of resonance.  Now this sound is to the west of me.  It sounded like it stopped and was just hovering right above the clouds.  I was panicked and scared.  It seemed to hover to the west for a moment and then the frequency of this noise started to speed up just a little bit and sounded like it was moving away to the SW.  The noise got fainter and fainter until I heard no more.  I ran everything I could possibly think of that would make this sound through my head and left only one outcome, a U.F.O.  I immediately called the Hewitt PD to see if they were testing tornado sirens.  They said no.  So now I’m stuck with this unexplainable noise stuck and replaying over and over in my head.<n>

It was moving around in no particular motion that I noticed, its was moving in the same area back and forth-up and down in no order. Then we spotted two more of the same exact looking lights that were further apart. The first one was spotted in the north and then the second UFO we noticed was South West and then the third we saw was directly ahead above the lake facing in the East. They all moved very fast and had green and red lights and all seemed the same size and distance away, they were pretty far out. I tried to video it on my phone but it was too dark. My friend said he may have seen more like 6, but I know I saw 3 for sure. The one facing the East direction was directly in front of my car in the distance and we watched it and it shined this really bright light we described it as &amp;quot;high beams&amp;quot; I have never se! en anything like it in my life, the light flashed a really strong and bright white light for about 5 - 10 seconds. He went back after I left and saw one land across the lake but to far in the woods for him to go and investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around 9:30 Pm, my mother and I were sitting on the back porch smoking a cigarette, when we heard a plane flying over, we both noticed the speed at which it was flying, tremendously fast, from south to north.  Then she noticed a flashing light in the south-eastern sky.  She asked me if I could see it, and at first I barely could.  She claimed to see it blinking, but after the before mentioned plane passed by, we listened for this blinking light and it made no sound.  She went inside a pair of binoculars, and attempted to focus in on the object.  She watched it for a few minutes, commenting on how strange it was, and then she said it was making her nauseous.  I took the binoculars from her and focused in myself.  What I saw was very strange.  While it had no distinct shape, there was a central light that was primarily white, with red and green twinkling dots flicker! ing around it in no specific pattern.  It remained stationary, but tiny glowing orbs seemed to orbit the central light at an amazing speed.  I watched it through binoculars for a while, noticing the red and green lights appear in different spots, almost like flickering Christmas tree lights.  At one point the red light shown brightest and I got goosebumps, followed by a splitting headache.  I stopped watching shortly after this.  I then went back inside and went to bed at an unusually early hour in an attempt to alleviate my headache.  These strange lights have become common in the past few weeks.  We live in a very rural area, no streetlights or major highways, in fact, it is in an Amish Community located in-between Franklin Ky and Scottsville KY.  We&#39;re one of the only houses in the area with electricity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We suspect a date of September 13, 2012, and have amended the date above.

Tall evergreen trees lined both sides of the roadway (48deg 13min 31.73sec N;  122deg 29min 32.97sec W) and the partially lit object appeared to be positioned just above the tree tops ahead of them at an unknown distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UAP had one or two red lights on its front end, a green light above,  and a white light underneath.

Judging by the strobes There were at least two jets flying in a straigt line due south approximatley 1/4 mile apart at near or about 15,000 feet from sea level. They were maybe flying around 380-400mph or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hill field is an hours drive from here however, in my 30 plus years of living here I have never seen a commercial or military plane take this route or fly this low unless it was on the fourth of july for a fly over. Also the planes did not head back to the base they continued on a southerly course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just curious as to why they were flying where they were and why were there two of them. The activity is just a bit strange from what I had seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wonder if anybody knows what they were up to?<n>

We were sitting In the creek. I looked over to the inlet about a half a mile away.  I saw seven lights standing vertical and moving to the left . It was very strange.  I pointed it out to my friends and had originally thought it was a very odd plain. The lights were a yellow orange bright bright glowing color.  They then shut off completely. I decided to start filming at this point.  The lights came back on up over garden city s.c in front of the Gulf stream cafe for the locals. There were two initially very close almost attached, one light went out and one flickered out shortly after.  The lights then dissapeared and popped up far away.  They then shot back over the original location. 1 light came on and the second then off.  It then lite up 1 light all the way up to about 8 -10 lights and looked to have spun to the right in a circle.  On my large tv it looks amazing. After rotating the lights got smal! ler and formed a straight line of smaller lights and was gone . Search you tube video under ( Myrtle beach UFO 9/13/12 )<n>

I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and ran to the back of my truck with my cell phone and opened the camera app...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began taking photos, which I will include with this report, when the object turned approximately 100 degrees, which caused it to be parallel to the ground and climbing slightly at about a 15 degree angle when it suddenly slowed and seemed to be engulfed in fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to take photos and watched the object for about 5 more minutes, but had to leave to get to work on time. The object left a glowing trail behind it as it went, which remained until the Sun came over the horizon, about 50 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am guessing that the object was approximately twenty to fifty miles away and traveled about 20 miles to the NE on fire before it either disappeared or stopped... it did not explode...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, when I was looking at the photos, I noticed that a second bright white light was following the first... I did not notice this object when I was looking at the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a similar glowing trail when I watched a space shuttle launch from about 100 miles away, except that the glowing trail from the shuttle had a greenish-purple tint while this object&#39;s trail was white-ish-yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other guys on my job also took photos with their cell phones but not as many...<n>

I looked down to toss my butt, and as I looked up a blinding blue light was moving extremely fast across the southern sky over the city of Buffalo.  The light was blue on the outside and had a white core.  As soon as I saw it, it was gone. Vanished completely into the sky.  I was recently on a flight to Florida and I would estimate the altitude of the object to be under 5,000 feet.  There is an air port here in Buffalo, and for a minute I thought it was a plane crash, however there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Remained standing there waiting to see more for about five more minutes, and saw nothing.  The trail left by the object was remarkably short and moved with it, not like a comet or a meteor.<n>

At first I thought it was a star.  But I noticed that it changed to a Bright Orange as it stood still.  Then 2 other Bright Orange Objects moved close to the first Bright Object.  Then 3 more of the same Bright Orange Objects came and formed a V-Shape.  When The V was completely formed, it moves just a little.  Then it formed a circle.  When the circle was completed, each object one at a time moved off into a different direction until it disappeared.  The last object to move was the very first one I saw. None of the objects made a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw object that seemed very high up moving across sky.  Immediately assumed it was a satelite due to its seemingly unusually high altitude.  Then it started to jump around sporadically in all directions.  I watched for about a minute or two, then quickly went in hotel room to grab my camera.   After fully zooming, it took me about 20 seconds to get object in field of view, and when i did I recorded this movement for about 2 1/2 minjutes or so.  I yelled at my wife who was sleeping and told her to get up as I beleive I was seeing a UFO.  Just after she got to balcony significant cloud cover interfered with real time viewing.   I proceeded to download video onto my computer, and after several viewings I started to look for anything else in background that might be stationary, and fortunately located three stars that are much further away, of course, and they remain relatively stationary in video whikle thius object moves all over the screen, proving that the movement was not the resuklt of cmaera shake.<n>

I asked my room mate to come out and he saw them as well.  He wen&#39;t in to get a camera but they had begun to fade. He tried to take a picture but nothing good.  They were extremely bright to begin with and made no noise even as they got closer.  After about a minute as they got closer they started to get duller but I could still tell there was some kind of craft there.  We both are professionals and have never reported or seen anything like this before.<n>

Being on an island  as small as Cuttyhunk, there are so few lights, we have a  great view of the night sky.  There was  what I thought was a star but it was more sparkly than other stars. I didn&#39;t think much of it until it moved in a straight horizontal line. It didn&#39;t move very far but it very clearly moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was such an unusual thing to see, I thought perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me so I looked at other stars for about the same amount of time that I&#39;d been looking at the first one.  But nothing else moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and came back out with my dogs. I saw the &amp;quot;star&amp;quot;/object  and then took my dogs for a short walk. When i returned to my lawn i was looking at the object again when it  moved in a circular direction, counter clockwise, ending up where it had started.   I couldn&#39;t see what shape it was or any details about it as it appeared to be as far away as everything else when i look up at the night sky.  If someone can help me understand what this could have possibly been, I&#39;d appreciate it.  It&#39;s very unsettling to see what I saw and not have an explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other witnesses but I wish there had been.  I  would have liked to have had someone to talk to about it.<n>

Blink Duration is estimated to be about ONE-SIXTEENTH Second. No other colors were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Position of the object was in the Southeastern Quadrant, at an estimated elevation of approximately 30 to 40 Degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed for about 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observation time elapsed was sufficient to see the usual change in position of the nearby stars due to the Earths rotation.  The object did NOT move in unison with the stars.  The object ALSO did NOT move in relation to an object on the ground directly below it, which was used as a reference point specifically for the purpose of observing if any movement of the object occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was also observed by another person at this time, and also observed by that same person once this past weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal opinion is that the object was a high-intensity light source located in Geo-Stationary Orbit, which would account for the lack of noticeable movement. I suspect that the purpose of the Blink and its Period is a timing function for some sort of experiment.<n>

The object was moving far too slowly for a plane, or satellite and did not have the same light pattern or colors as a plane. Both my aunt and i concluded, It also appeared to have a strange &amp;quot;halo&amp;quot; or &amp;quot; aura&amp;quot; shape around it, which gave off a faint blue glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m certain the object moved from its location, as there is a wire suspended between two posts which is entirely stationary, so I was able to assess its position over the course of 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I go get my mom and we procede to watch it. It was a single light, smaller then a star and smaller then a plane light, but definitly in our atmosphere. It started out flashing every second, changing from green, blue, red, and white.  It was almost as if it was sending a morse-code signal because it changed, got small, flared up, changed, got small, flared up..and so on.  After 5 minutes, it just started to change from green, red, and white. Three intresting things happened.  It fell like the UFO I have seen before--straight down like it had lost control, then...BAM..stopping. It did this a couple times. Secondly, there were about three shooting stars in this short fifteen minute period. Third, it was as if a spotlight or a laser gun shot out diffrent colors, as well as the constant light. Somewhat like an Auro Borealuis light show because this happened ! in a cloud. It was staying pretty much consistant north/south wise, but was slowly cruising to the west. Another intresting thing was that there were three planes that could have also spotted the UFO, as it was in the general vicinity. After 15 minutes, we had to get to bed, so I&#39;m not sure how long it stayed here.<n>

At first it looked to me like a paper lantern, so I got the attention of my husband and his parents.  After watching it, we decided it was moving too fast to be a lantern.  We watched the light for about 30 seconds and the light extinguished, then a dull gray light appeared in its place and zoomed silently across the sky over the house, too high up to see a specific shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later, we spotted two more orange glowing objects coming from the same direction. We watched these larger lights as they approached much lower than the previous one, and they flickered out, revealing two gray disc-shaped objects.  They made a strange humming sound as they passed overhead, one moving faster, and then the other one pulling ahead, almost playfully. As the second pulled away, the first one stopped and hovered over the tree line for about 15 seconds and followed the other heading NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother-in-law called my sister-in-law who lives about 3 miles from us and told her about what we saw. When she stepped out onto her deck, she saw two of the glowing orange spheres, but they never got close enough for her to see the shape, although she did hear the hum.  She was on the phone with us while she was witnessing the objects.<n>

Some appeared suddenly in the shape of a triangle and different colored flickering lights.  Some appeared suddenly down low through the trees and vanished suddenly.   There were different size circles of light. Some appeared blue, some appeared reddish orange and some were white and then faded in and out. One was moving in a circular motion repeatedly.  Some would shoot down beams of light. It appeared to be several as if they were hovering and working together to create some type of formation.<n>

(first story..3 about months before 9-12-12) 10:30pm.  i was driving east on the 210 freeway.  as i approached the exit of santa anita ave. (stuck in traffic, moving very slow) there is a freeway wall (north side) and above the wall was a oval/roundish light,  Blue in color.  i noticed it as i moved slowly in traffic. this thing danced up and down and was doing loops in the sky. at this point i realized it wasnt a helicopter or any other kind of conventional craft.  as the freeway wall lowered and i moved forawrd.  i could see it take off and travel quickly to specific locations, then zoom back. it did appeared to fly around randomly. it was a fast object.  no helicopter could make these turns.  i could not see it much longer than 1-2 mins. in both sightings there were no other parts of the craft visible such as a helicopter tail or wings or anything else thet would prove to be some other kind of conv! entional air craft. just a solid blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Forward to 9-12-12 9:30 pm. same location.. no traffic this time.  i nothiced a red light just abvove the wall. and it moved up and down, sorta bobbing. in both cases maybe 20-30 feet above the freeway wall. i saw it as red this time, then it would fade to white. then after 3-4 seconds fade back to red.  it did not blink. but a very smooth fade from color to color.  i came back later after about 30 mins and i saw nothing. i go by this location everyday/night and theres nothing in the area right off the freeway like tall buildings or a crane, or power lines that would give off a light source.<n>

Too high for mountain tops but too low for any aircraft.  They were moving almost sideways to us as we traveled.  We finally stopped near an RV campground and got out.  There were lots of night clouds hovering low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed that the lights were part of 1 giant ship as big as a football field slowly moving. It was very low hovering over the campground but had NO SOUND.  Not aircraft or helicopters.  We shot some cell phone pics which came out bad but it looked like a few windows with human like shapes in them.  Then it disappeared without any notice or sound or movement.  No one at the campground seemed to know about it.<n>

I first thought they were C-17&#39;s or C-4&#39;s but they were moving too slow to be of those nor did they have any strobe lights! ALL military and non-military aircraft, HAVE to have strobe lights.  The crafts were located just above Borden Lake in Garrison, Minnesota traveling south east.  As far as the objects themselves go, I could not get a accurate discription on the shape of the crafts besides the lights on them, from what I could see they seemed to be cresent shaped. Once again, it was dark out and I could not get a accurate view on the shape of the hull of both craft.<n>

They were traveling south to north right over my residence as what seemed like individual fireballs moving at about the speed of an aircraft would. My home is in a flight path so I see small planes flying almost every night leaving at same time. But these were spaced about 20 seconds apart.  There&#39;s a street light in front of my house so I went to the rear of house to get a better view,also asking my wife and son to observe what I saw.  These objects made no sound. i mentioned this to a co-worker and he stated that there is an annual hot air balloon show but that doesn&#39;t start until Sept.20.Also didn&#39;t think  Hot air balloons would travel at night if not necessary.  Just curious if there were any other people watching the sky on that clear night.  Sincerely,Dan Shields<n>

I then took a left going behind the gas station back by tavern in the forest for a better look and saw what appeared to be about 10-15 lights in a slightly angled line, the lights seemed to fade in and out unlike that of an aircraft and then from right to left one at a time each light faded out.  This only lasted a matter of seconds but was long enough for another witness to pull up behind me to also view the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed it again when we were leaving and thought the airplane would have already landed.  This was still moving Long at a very slow pace and the same altitude.  It was a long string of lights moving very slowly and low in the sky, almost hovering but moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving I lost sight and tried to find it again to get video or pictures, but never found it again.  There were probably 15-20 lights, but not in a straight line.  Possibly could have been a chevron shape and the angle I was looking made it look closer together, so would make the odd shape I saw.  The lights were not white, they were like a golden orangey color and they did not! blink like an airplane. They were constant.<n>

I continued watching the object.  Over the next several minutes the object slowly started moving upward.  At this point I determined it was something I could not recognize.  It was close enough that if it was a jet I would have been able to see it.  It then turned from a metallic appearence into what can best be described as a solid jet stream.  The &#34;stream&#34; then split into two.  One of the two &#34;streams&#34; continued upwards while the other stream veared off for some distance and then veered back toward the other stream and joined it once again.

From my vantage point it appears to be somewhere above the fairgrounds or perhaps farther out of town. I have ruled out plane due to the fact that while observing it for an hour it barely moved.  Most fascinating is the spectacular light show this thing is giving off and is what first caught my attention. It pulsates with just about every color of the spectrum around the edges of the craft and the bottom portion looks as though it&#39;s erupting with fire. Last night the object was much closer and I was able to vaguely make out a shape that I can only describe as something out of battlestar galactica it appeared to be triangular, but not perfectly triangle. It&#39;s edges were rounded appearing almost like a boomer-ring! I was also able to hear a loud hum like noise emanating from the object even at a distance.  I awoke my Fiance the second night to verify what i was seeing and she was just as baffled and amazed as I. When trying to capture the object on video and picture the quality was very blurred so i quickly drew a quick concept of what I seen on a small white board I keep in my kitchen while it was fresh in my mind.<n>

It was a clear, open sky, with clear visibility of the stars. While looking directly up into the night sky, a perfect triangle of orange/red lights flew directly overhead at a high rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 500-1,000 ft. At first I thought it was a very low flying airplane, but it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. It wasn&#39;t solid, I could see the stars through it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three smaller lights in a similar equilateral triangle in the center of the formation (looking up). None of the lights were blinking, they were steadily lit. It moved in a North Easterly direction then changed trajectory to North, North East and changed formation slightly and the lights dimmed out slowly as they flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The initial shape of the objects were an equilateral triangle flying/pointing towards the NE, then changed slightly to a non-geometric shape; uncoordinated looking, but still flying together as they dimmed out. As they dimmed out I could see that the lights were definitely circular/orb-shaped. The initial brightness of the three outer lights was approximately -4, -5 magnitude, very similar to standard aircraft strobe lights, except these didn&#39;t strobe/rotate, and were a little dimmer. I have watched various airplanes fly since I was a young boy, love flying and have seen flight in night and daylight. I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing directly North towards a two-story building next door; the duration of the whole event was approximately nine to ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve also noticed light/white colored helicopters flying over the area starting around August 23, 2012. Usually flying alone, but sometimes two flying together in tandem at various hours, but usually between 9:00PM to 6:00AM when I am at work in the area. There was one hovering over Highway 99 near the intersection of West Casino Road approx 6:05 AM of the same morning; not sure if this is related, just reporting what I saw.<n>

At first I didn&#39;t pay too much attention since we are so close to Detroit metro airport. After watching for a couple seconds I quickly realized that these orbs of light were definitely not planes from the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I decided to get my wife so she could see them. She immediately knew these were not planes. From the time I went in the house to get her (just a matter of seconds) the orbs changed their flight from following each other in a vertical pattern to horizontal.  They made no noise, and flew in a very distinct pattern. I don&#39;t know what they were, I do know they weren&#39;t like anything I have ever seen in the air. My mother-in-law also witnessed this and was as baffled as my wife and I. I was able to watch them fly for probably 4-5 minutes before they were out of sight. I am hoping someone on here may be able to substantiate my! story, or possibly shed some light on what we may have witnessed.<n>

Excellent visbility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> House located in the Snoqualmie Ridge area at 953 feet AGL.  Reasonably clear view of night sky with some obstruction from house and green belt located to the East of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was on my patio watching the night sky.  Observed two jetliners on an approach to the Seattle TCA flying from east to west with navigation lights evident and able to clearly hear them pass over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:50 I observed two objects moving in tandem at a high rate of speed headed west to east in a slightly descending trajectory.  Unable to tell how far away they were but it appeared they were at an altitude much higher than the traffic pattern for the commercial jets.  They were illuminated but it appeared to be reflected light as there were no lights or beacons on the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first thought they were two meteorites that had broken apart and were going to burn up but as I observed them, they appeared to deviate from a straight course! and turned about twenty degrees to the south in tandem.  I lost sight of them as they went behind the green belt behind my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a private pilot and a pretty good judge of military hardware.  I did not see anything that would indicate that these were conventional military craft and I did not hear any sound as they passed.<n>
9/11/12 22:00|Coulee Dam|WA|Fireball|all night|Saw one Triangle and see "fireball Orbs" almost every night..|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92688.html|468|ndxe201209| saw one Triangle and see &amp;quot;fireball Orbs&amp;quot; almost every night..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have Seen Several UFO&#39;s in the Sky Starting in July till Today 9-11-12  On an occasion around the 3rd of July, Myself and My boyfriend were laying in our backyard watching the stars, I saw a very bright light bluish light, I told my boyfriend to look at what I was seeing, then he proceeded to look and recognized it was a bigger object than I was Seeing, there was two lower lights below it, making a shape of a triangle, to me it almost looked transparent as if it were trying to blend in with the sky, the lights were on the bottom of the craft that looked flat, the only way you could tell it was a triangle was the fact you could tell it had a light on the top of the craft but unable to see it but it illuminated the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we noticed it we laid there watching it for almost 2 hours, approx. 1hr and a Half. it was rotating slowly around and it seemed as if it were floating there, around 45 minutes after seeing it, it began to move slowly away, until all the lights dimmed out and as it just disappear, than 20 to 30 seconds later it seemed like the lights powered back up like a generator does when it turns lights back on, it began moving slowly away again until it reached another spot, and stayed there, this was around 12:30 am and lasted until we got tired and went inside because it just stayed there hovering, I think more like floating, it scared Me I thought we were being invaded because it just stayed there and it was so low in the sky, no sound. I’m not good with guessing on how high I thought it was but it appeared to be way lower than any plane in the air would fly, we live almost 3 blocks away from the Grand Coulee Dam, which is a no fly zone, so it definitely scared me seeing it so low! to the ground in a no fly zone, that was the first encounter I had seeing something, after that I purchased a pair of binoculars and have been constantly watching the sky since,  We have seen objects that appear to be having orange lights strobing around it, they don’t go all the way around it they go right until it hits a spot and goes back around left, something the light switch ways and start going from left around till they hit a point and back to the right, they move straight up into the sky. Or will stay there in the same place move really fast to a different part in the sky I go inside and they stay there. I’ll wait an hour or 2 and come back and they will be gone. Nowhere in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have witnessed a lot of the &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot; going very fast in the sky, with no sound whatsoever, one night we saw a helicopter chasing one, and it was trying to get away from it, moving in a zig zag, going up and down. We had 6 people with us that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t stop thinking about what these things can be, I’m freaked out about it so I finally search recent UFO sightings in WA state and found your page, and as I scrolled and read the sightings I finally feel like im not alone in this and what I’m seeing is real if they are sightings other places, I haven’t seen another triangle in the sky since the night I was saw one, That’s the one that scared me a lot, it was huge, I say it&#39;s the mother ship and maybe those fireball things are little aircrafts they take out and fly from it, whatever they are there&#39;s a lot of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard there were more crops circles found near Wilbur WA. and i live 26 miles from Wilbur , WA I went to the crop circles they found around the same area in 2009, until recently I heard there was more found, if it were a hoax, I don’t see people doing it in the same spot 2 times, that’s what gets me wondering..What are they? Who are they? And why around here?<n>

It appeared to be 5 miles north east of us (we were heading east/south east).  We noticed it when it appeared to be at 800 feet asl and climbing.  If had to guess, rate of speed it would be 150kts.  The light appeared to climb straight-vertical until extinguishing near 5000 feet (guesstimate).  ATC did not see aircraft on radar when inquired.  No trailing seen.  No blinking seen.  One solid orb.  Thank you  It is ok to contact me. Not requesting contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was getting out of my vehicle when I noticed a HUGE orange glowing ball coming from Lake Erie.  I hurried up and ran in the house to get my husband.  We both ran outside and were in awe at what we witnessed.  There were a total of 6 HUGE orange glowing balls that looked as if the end was on fire.  They came in pairs but they were not very close to each other.  There was no sound and they looked to be as big as a vehicle.  They were much lower than any aircraft I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called several other people in our community to go outside and witness this.  Several witnesses said that there were small “search” planes in the area and over Lake Erie very shortly afterwards.  We live only a few miles from Fermi Nuclear Plant.  This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought was these objects were on fire.  Then wondered if they were rockets or such entering the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as they flew past my trees, I lost visual contact but waited several minutes to see if I might hear a crash or explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live under a local flight path so have seen traditional airplanes at night.  Have seen many falling stars in this area as well.  Nothing like the fore-mentioned.<n>
9/11/12 20:40|St. Catharines (Canada)|ON|Egg|2+ hours|Several objects seen moving over north shores of Lake Ontario, over a 2 hour period.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92684.html|476|ndxe201209| Several objects seen moving over north shores of Lake Ontario, over a 2 hour period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I&#39;ve been sitting on the shores of Lake Ontario, from St.Catharines, close to Lock 1. I got here around 8:40PM, today, Sept 11th, 2012. As soon as I got here, I started noticing several objects in the sky. At first it was just 2, when looking north west towards Mississauga and Toronto. It is currently 10:10PM, but I still see them. I am with a friend, who is seeing exactly the same things I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By some odd luck, I brought my binoculars with me, so I was able to get a kind of look at them. They hover, several 100ft off the ground in the air, and sit for up to a few minutes at a time, then they slowly move away. Then one appears at the spot it was before, but they start off dim and get brighter over a period of a few seconds. They appeared to flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked with the binoculars, they emit a sort of yellowish light, as well as a reddish light that appears to spin around them. I can&#39;t tell the shape, but they look almost dome-like, like a bell, but I can&#39;t tell, as my bushnell&#39;s only have up to 15x.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared above Toronto several times, but just for no longer than 30 seconds. The 2 &#39;UFO&#39;s mostly shown up above what I think is Mississauga or Burlington direction. One appeared near Hamilton direction earlier on in my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is one posing as a &#39;star&#39;, staying present the whole time, between Hamilton/Mississauga, but high in the sky. Upon closer binocular view, it looked just like the rest, but had rotating green lights, as well. In the other direction, looking towards ajax area? I saw another object just like this, doing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 2 objects hover, so they cannot be planes.  They cannot be helicopters, because when they move, they cover ground much faster than a heli.  A heli does not explain the red and white light that rotates along it&#39;s whole body just a few times a second. Currently, they are hovering west of Toronto, what I&#39;ll call Mississauga/Oakville. One is hovering a bit away, but higher. The higher one vanishes, then the other got brighter, now it has vanished, too (10:28PM).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I am typing this from my phone, and the battery is dying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I finish this email, the 2 higher stationary objects are still in the sky. The Hamilton/Burlington one has moved slowly more towards Burlington/Oakville area. One of the moving objects has reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if you have heard of this before, or any possible explanation?  If anything, this kind of made me believe there might actually be aliens out there, or maybe craft that the government hasn&#39;t shown us.<n>

They were random in placement however in a fairly narrow viewing angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I was able to get my phone out and camera on it open they had disappeared.  I waited another 5-10 minutes to see if the lights would resume, however they did not.<n>

9/11/12 13:30|West Dennis|MA|Other|1 minute|Silver object seen hovering over marsh in West Dennis during daytime on 9-11-12|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92839.html|481|ndxe201209| Silver object seen hovering over marsh in West Dennis during daytime on 9-11-12<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tues., 9-11-12, at 1:30pm, I was taking my daily walk in the West Dennis Beach ( Cape Cod, MA ) parking lot. To the left  of the lot is the south facing Atlantic ocean and to my right is  Bass River and salt marshes where many will canoe, where Giant Blue Herons feed and Osprey&#39;s nest. It&#39;s not unusual to see birds that are quite large flying over the marshes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular day, the Mystic Seaport Aquarium was releasing a young seal that it had rehabbed after an injury into the Atlantic on my left. At least 50 people were there watching this, so all of their attention was focused onto the left hand side of the lot on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked past and noticed to my right, over the marsh, a very odd shaped, large object that I naturally assumed was a bird. It seemed to be just suspended up there, very slowly moving. The size was approx. the size of a dime held in my fingers with my arm extended at a 75 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I started to pay attention to it, I noticed that as it slowly moved, it reflected sunlight and appeared silver with a shape that made me positive it wasn&#39;t a bird. I have since looked up online for the shape and the exact match to what I saw was the 1947 Kenneth Arnold craft sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I saw that it started to speed up, so I was struggling to get my cell phone out of my pocket to take a picture, but it streaked out of sight in a flash before I could even turn it on.  I was the only one watching this because all others were watching the seal release.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This object made no sound, it was shiny with black spots spinning around the object like it was ready to take off.  It had two flap like tails hanging from bottom of the this object. Then after 20 mins it slowly lifted straight up into sky after being in one spot for 20 mins and disappeard.<n>

After she could see it for about half a minute  She ran off saying I have to go back to work!  I took most pictures from my old camera [11 pictures], as I had a problem with my new camera  Though have three other pictures taken and one short video clip taken on the new camera  This unknown object appeared about 5 -10 ,000 ft in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had size of a small plane  The white light was flashing on and off brightly on the object  I have downloaded 11 pictures and my friend mg has enhanced them splendidly  The sighting lasted about four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The structure does look disk like   I’m sure the pictures tell the story   Enjoy further photographic evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS Can’t wait to see the much bigger ones that fly above I’ve seen in the past *<n>

I noticed a white, spherical object moving from the north in a south-south-westerly trajectory at a steady rate of speed, constant altitude.  Would guess it was up at about 2,500/3,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> T + 30 seconds - object still visible, began making a slow turn to the west and then began to move back in my direction to the north/north east.  Noticed a slight haze around the object at this time. Continued to observe object, noticed it was slowly turning more to the east, speed constant.  Hazing only lasted a few seconds, repeated 2 or 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> T + 60 seconds - object suddenly moved straight up, covering about 1,000 feet (best guess) in roughly 2 seconds.  Object stayed in place for another few seconds, and then began slowly moving back in a south-south-westerly trajectory at this new altitude.  Watched object for another 30 seconds or so until I could no longer perceive it.<n>

It was still dark with a few scattered clouds. I was looking at the sky and saw a very bright object moving very fast and very high coming from the west heading north north-east.  I was wondering if it might be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked very bright white and was too high for me to discern any shape other than a ball of bright white light; it looked similar to Venus on a clear night but much bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the thought was going through my head as to whether it might be a satellite, the object suddenly stopped.  After about 2 seconds, it headed back South (towards my house) very slowly then stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I got very uncomfortable and went back inside the house with the dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was as if this object was making me aware that it definitely was not a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

At first i was trying to find a residence or camplight on any thing to get me off that mountain. the moon was a half moon, so it was providing light. and misleading light as i would soon discover. i would see what would appear to be a bright light , and i would hike to it only to find that it was a reflection i think of of a rock that seemed to reflect silverih once i got to it.  After this happened time and time again ,i came to an area of several formations of towering rocks that were lighting up. This is wear i first noticed the sphere  the triaigal with the docking smaller rectangel part.  I stood ther first looking at the sphere and it was positioned at ten o&amp;quot;clock apearing to be tipped on access 50% with a br! ight light on one end . how ever, i noticed that it was disguised to look as if you were looking at the night skyline. i had the opertunitty to notice the outer edge was cleare just as though it were a lighter shade of midnight blue. In size it would be the size of a hundred yards in cercumfrence. like i said one brightlight and other lights smaller in comparisson scatered all about to emulate the outer skyline , but held within the sphere. The larger craft was twice the size as to it perportion , it two had a bright light in two different locations yet it had lights  all over it, and an outline like the sphere. the detatching craft had multipel lights around its outer edge, and smaller lights throughout. the detatching craft looked as if it 20 yards across by 40 or 50 yards long.

Colors seem to change some green and redish colors primary color star white.  I feel this was a true UFO.  I also have video and have shown it only to family, and also showed it to a retired airline pilot and his wife, who has her private pilots license both could not identify.  Would like to show video to ufo community, to try and explain it to me.  Thank you for reading.<n>

We were all in our backyard talking and relaxing as we noticed the &#34;star-like&#34; object moving in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all  were keeping our eyes on it there was no sound.  It looked as if it was an ordinary star in the sky.  The night was clear and stars were visible.  It was a sphere shape and pulsing white light emitted from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first few minutes the pulsing started to get brighter. Then it started to move getting higher in the atmosphere and leaving altogether. Almost shooting with great speed out into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left us confused and baffled after witnessing this object&#39;s strange movements then leaving altogether without a sound. It only lasted for about 5 minutes.<n>

I watched it looking for flashing lights like a plane would have but it only had the orange color. So then I thought maybe it was a satelite but the color didn&#39;t make sence. Plus this thing was really high up in the sky.   So then suddenly it looked like it stopped and the light started to dim and then it was gone like in few seconds. It gave me the chills cause to me it was definitely a UFO. It was very exciting to see. I hope there is other reports about this.<n>

I took two pictures and a short 51 second video. In the second pic which was taken less than a second after the first I notice a second light next two it. I didn&#39;t see this with the naked eye due to the brightness.<n>

Then I braught my husband to take a look (skepticK wasnt exactly sure what it was.<n>

I thought it was a airplane or a helicopter.  It was distant, like a few cities away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was pulling into my house I noticed it much more brighter.  I live in Anaheim and this light had to be hoovering over Orange, Santa Ana area.   I kept staring at it because it was still so at first I thought it was a star but too red to be a star so then I thought it was a helicopter and red lights were on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I was getting off the car, still looking at it and I then seen something that looked like red flares dropping down from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed frozen looking at it and the first thought that came to me is that its some type of aircraft with a bomb or something.   I started shaking cause I was so scared but came in my house and told my 12 yr daughter to come outside with me, that I wanted her to see something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She rushed outside with me and it was no longer there.  I looked all around in the sky but there was nothing that looked like what I seen.  I would say that the duration since the time I noticed it and the last I saw it was about 3 minutes.<n>

After about 15 minutes, there was a light that came from the south horizon, near South Marina, hovering over the water moving faster than anything I have seen. The light stayed steady, it did not bob up and down like a boat would and it moved as fast an airplane.  It covered the distance of the full horizon from the Marina all the way to Malibu in just about two minutes possibly less. It was somewhat close to shore, made no sound at all and moved faster than any boat possible.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

They looked like chasing strobe lights forming a circle or even a cigar shape.  Then 3 fireballs formed one after the other creating a triangle.  We watched these flashing lights for almost an hour and in the distance where the ocean would meet the sky we saw 5 fireballs form in a straight line and then go out after about 10 seconds.   Then one fireball appeared by itself and then about 10 minutes later another appeared.  We followed the flashing lights with our eyes come from over the ocean inland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They moved slowly but the flashes were strobe like.<n>

The house is located on the other side of the road from the oceanfront homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, without a sound or any type of indication, 3 orange lights appeared in the sky in a large triangle formation.  The lights had the appearance of fire and glowed for about 7 seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle was parallel to the shore with it&#39;s &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; toward the West. This point was the first light to disappear; quickly followed by the trailing two which disappeared simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after this, about 8-10 craft appeared in the sky at varying intervals and numbers over the next hour. They were visible only by their erratically blinking white lights.  It was almost like they were communicating with each other using these lights.  They were back and forth all across the sky.  The orange fireballs did appear twice more in front of the house one at a time several minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so sudden and so strange that we&#39;ll be glued to our chairs every night for the next 4 days.<n>

They were all 4 orange and did not stay lit for more than 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial orange lights faded we witnessed white flickering lights that moved across the sky on the coast from north to south.  They did not have a consistent flicker (on/off) nor did they stay in the same formation very long.   The 3-4 orange orbs were either within the formation of the smaller flickering lights or just outside of the main formation.  This lasted about 20 minutes in total and then just stopped.   Some stopped to the south and then we saw 4-5 other lights back to the north about 15 minutes later.<n>

Tonight, I went out around 22:15 to smoke.  I noticed a plane in the very clear night sky. In my peripheral vision, I saw movement that I thought, initially, to be a shooting star. I looked in the direction of that movement, and saw nothing at first, until I notice movement again.  I kept looking at the area, and saw something moving in my direction.  As it got closer, I was able to, very clearly, see two dimly lit spheres moving at a very fast speed.  The spheres were flying very close to each other, roughly 50 feet next to each other, possibly closer.  The light coming from them was dark yellow to orange in color. I continued to follow the objects across the sky moving towards the aforementioned plane, which was now almost directly above me, but on a higher level in the sky than the spheres. I watched the spheres pass underneath the plane, a distance of about 2,000 to 3,000 fe! et, and zip over my house and out of sight. There was no sound associated with these objects, even at the speed they were moving. The spheres themselves were about 300 to 500 feet above me. The entire event lasted roughly 30 seconds.<n>

I put my supper in the microwave and decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette.  Upon doing so I noticed a light flash. I looked up and saw it traveling from north-east to south-west. thinking it was a plane i ignored it for a few moments. then i noticed it turn an head back north-east.  Thinking this was a hellicopter I watched to see what it was doing.  Then I noticed it turn a solid fire red.  Realizing this was not a plane or hellicopter i watched more closely.  As the object made its turn from north-east back to south-west it changed from a red ball to a blue green which at that time I could see almost a shape that looked like a boomerang.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pattern  continued for an hour and ten minutes.  Then the object flashed real bright white 7 or 8 times and then headed south flashing low white light till out of sight at 12:15 am<n>

It&#39;s not a star or satellite, apparently, because every few minutes it seems to randomly move about, sideways, back, up and down, in an erratic manner.  But essentially it is staying in the same location in the sky.  About a half hour before I noticed this, one of my dogs seemed highly agitated (unusual for her).  She&#39;s settled down now. I do live near an airport, but this object has been in the air for a long time now -- essentially hovering in place.... I just went back outside to check, and initially couldn&#39;t see the lights, then realized that it had traveled further north, and was now below the tree line from where we are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We sat down  last night and I noticed a bright flickering light in the north sky. I thought it was a star and pointed it out to my partner.  But then the flickering light started moving in a strange way. It went straight up and down very quickly.  It went in circles, then it moved sideways. We watched this for over an hour with binoculars.  I tried to film it but my camera could not reach that far in the dark. The light would stand still for a few minutes and then start moving again.  Through the binoculars that light looked red and green, and spiky (almost in the shape of an arrow).  Sometimes the light would get brighter, and sometimes point the other direction.  At times I noticed a haze coming off the light. The light was hoovering over a fire in the hills of White Salmon that recently burned and is still burning in BZ Corners.  Could this maybe be a plane! that is checking the area for hot spots with infra red? But then how does a plane make those radical movements?   I have never seen anything like it, I wonder what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a few little airplanes in the same airspace, but this did not &#39;scare&#39; the light away. I wonder if the airplanes saw the light too?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

Once we got close and I meen literally 40 to 50 feet under it I saw that the lights were attached to a black silhouette of a craft that when it passed by stars they would disappear behind the darkness of this craft, it was bigger than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky, once it reached crown point on 72nd all the lights disappeared at once and I could no longer see the silhouette either, but the thing is I&#39;m surprised that it wasn&#39;t on the news or anything, there were so many people out that night, we couldn&#39;t have been the only ones who saw this.<n>

It would get brighter and dimmer as it moved across the sky from left to right until it disappeared.  When we went back to my house, moments later, we looked out the window and saw it again.  This time, we got my dad to also see it. It did the same exact thing again and again until it disappeared and would re-appear in the same spot it started, like it was circling.  There was no noise we could hear, but we managed to get a video of it.<n>

The store is located less than one mile from my home. Her boyfriend stated, &amp;quot;Mr. X, I think we just saw a UFO.&amp;quot; I asked them what they saw and they described a large &amp;quot;orange glowing fireball&amp;quot; moving across the sky. My daughter said the light &amp;quot;fizzled out&amp;quot; after a while, but then it reappeared a second time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes into our conversation, at approximately 8:30 p.m., her boyfriend looked outside and and spotted the object again in the northwest sky. I told them to turn off all the interior lights and the television to eliminate as much light pollution as possible. We all had our smartphones in hand and I set mine to video mode. We moved outdoors on my balcony which has a west-facing view. My complex is set on a mountain ridge with each building higher in elevation than the next. So as I looked westward, I can clearly see over the top of the next building. The night sky was very clear with low humidity and cool temperatures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a glowing orange &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; of light moving steadily in the sky northwest of my location traveling southward. The light did not blink or pulsate. It was a steady glow. The color did not change, nor did the intensity of the light. The object was moving at a steady rate of speed which I would not characterize as particularly fast or slow. Somewhat like the speed a plane would fly on approach to land. The glowing light appeared to fade and disappear after about a minute or slightly more. It seemed that if the object was turning away from our vantage point, in a westward direction, it might account for the light disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to see the object on my smartphone but continued to film. Once the object disappeared, I asked my daughter to get her digital camera, which also shoots video, from her upstairs bedroom. She returned quickly with the camera. We discussed the fact that it might be related to heightened security as it was close to 9-11. We took note of several commercial airplanes with their blinking lights in the area and pointed out the obvious difference in appearance to the object we saw. We also spotted two satellites racing across the sky and noted how different they also appeared, merely a speck of white light traveling extremely quickly across the sky at a great distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the object reappeared in the same spot of origin as the first sighting, northwest of our vantage point, moving southward at a steady, but not overly fast rate of speed. My daughter and I both captured the object on digital video. I thought I was able to hear something from the object, but it turned out it was the local freeway which was clearly audible given the clear weather conditions. After the object disappeared a second time. We waited for a return which did not come. We went on with our evening discussing what we had just seen and watching the premier of NBC&#39;s The VOICE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both downloaded our videos to my home computer and watched the footage. She was able to zoom with her camera, but I was not with my smartphone. We both captured the same incident at the same time on two separate devices as evidenced by the same recorded audio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no detectable sound. If I were to approximate it&#39;s relative distance, I would approximate 3 - 4 miles or less at it&#39;s point of origin and at an altitude of around 1,500 feet. I would guess it traveled about 3 miles or so before the light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend came in around 9:40 p.m. and we detailed what had just occurred and showed her the videos. I found this website after searching to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice any other distinguishing features other than the color and intensity of the light. I did not notice any similarr objects at the same time. I am assuming the second object was merely the first object making a return pass, but it could have been a separate second object. No way to know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen anything remotely odd in the night sky.<n>

The young girl saw something in the sky visible to her only at first because of the house blocking our view. She pointed up and asked “What the heck is that?” Stepping into her view point, we both saw an extremely bright light moving as fast as a high altitude jet moving north to south. It seemed to have a central bright light similar to a yellow colored welding arc surrounded by a less bright disk or sphere. (more orange in color) The unique aspect of the orange sphere was that, unlike atmospheric glow, it was not hazy but had a distinct sharp edge to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no detectable wind at ground level and upper atmosphere winds had been west to east all day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I called my wife out of the house to see what we were seeing. Now,  it was directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I admit that my first interpretation of the object was most likely a Chinese Lantern. But the overall brightness of the object and its movement not correlated with the prevailing winds made me think otherwise. The central bright light looked less like a candle burning and more like a welding torch or magnesium burning. Very bright! I still had time to get my binoculars from the house and when focusing on the object it remained the same size as it appeared to the naked eye. Probably very distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor and her daughter are average people as my wife is. No special interest in UFO’s or astronomy. I have been an amateur astronomer since my teens and make a habit of observing the night sky every chance I get. I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this object in my life – I am 65 years old! bright<n>

Near the 295 Baltimore exit I just happened to look up and saw 3 orange round lights.  The 3 came together and became 1. Then the light started to fade out and would come back.  It did this 3 times and was gone.  My daughter sitting in the passenger seat saw all of this to. The whole incident took place in about 30 seconds.<n>

The pulses of (only) white light occurred about 10 to 12 seconds apart and lasted for about a second.  There was nothing visible at the site of the flash after each burst of light. The bright blue daylight sky was mostly clear with a only a few small clouds scattered out of my direct field of view.  The flashes caught my attention because they were so much brighter than the landing, strobe, and navigation lights of any other air traffic that was visible nearby at the time, or that I normally see during daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near an airport, and the Long Island Sound and am familiar with most of the air traffic that traverses the area. I assumed that the first flash might have been caused by a momentary reflection of the sun off an aircraft that wa! s changing direction. I dismissed that assumption after I observed the second flash continuing on the same heading. I expected that this aircraft was approaching me with an ultra bright strobe, and that it would become visible as the distance closed. It was not until the fourth flash, that I realized that the flashes were moving away and gaining altitude. After about 8 flashes, I lost sight of it. There was commercial air traffic approaching the local airport at a much lower altitude, and closer than the flashes I observed, yet all of the lighting on those aircraft seemed barely visible in comparison. I&#39;m not sure what I observed, but found it quite curious!<n>

Towards the west I saw a very bright object in the sky and it was flashing really bright white, red, blue and green light out from it, the object stayed in one place and at one point a jet leaving San Jose, Costa Rica flew towards the object but flew under it by quite a bit,  I did notice as the jet and the object were in the same part of the sky the objects lights where a much brighter and clearer colors than the jet that flew by and the object had a bright green and a bright blue light that would shine from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for at least 30 minutes and it never moved, I had a spotter scope that I was looking at it through and the colors coming off of it were so bright and clear, at some point the light coming from it got less bright and the clouds started to move in and I lost my references with it, but it did seem to move furt! her away from me after about 30 minutes. At one point while I was watching it a much smaller light moved across the sky from one side to the other in a straight line and consistent speed, could have been a satilite but it was not very bright I almost couldn&#39;t track it through my spotter scope.<n>

One of the &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot; went directly over our heads and we thought it could be a helicopter but it was moving sideways and had something coming off the side of it.  Plus, it wasn&#39;t making any noise.  This object and the other three lights then flew over towards Fond du Lac, then across the lake, and then back over towards the mouth of the river. When they were over the mouth of the river the 4 lights then came together to form what looked like one craft/entity with 4 red lights that were not flashing.  As they moved closer, the white flashing lights broke off from the one &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; and again went in different directions.  The last we saw the 4 flashing lights they were moving again towards Fond du Lac when they disappeared.  The lights kept separating and going off in differen! t directions to then come back to form what looked like one &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.  There were normal airplanes in the air around the same time that did not have the same light patterns as these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

I was having a convo on our balcony when something caught my attention. 3 very bright orange lighs were flashing at each other.  Then they starting going out.  I told my mom to turn her attention to the ocean night.  She saw the last one flash before it went out.  I then noticed the smaller white lifts strobing  betweeen the points. And another triangle appeared to my left ding the same. Almost like they were strobing to each other. Not at the same time.  The lights would strobe drone one point were the orange lights were to ge other or flag anywhere in between, then the triangle to the left moved away and slowly both lights died. Later as I called my boyfriend one lone orange flashing light reappeared then dissapprared.  We saw a plane about 30 mins later when still talking about it and not even close to what we&#39;d seen earlier. Id saw 3 football field across each in size. I don&#39;t know what I saw but I want! to see it again!<n>

The lights resembled that of an commercial airliner with the landing lights on.  While I observed the crafts I noticed that they were hovering. At that time I started to realize the this was a UFO.  They then started to move in a zig-zag pattern over a great distance in a matter of seconds.  Then as I&#39;m staring one of the crafts comes towards me at a very high rate of speed.  The craft then flies over the field next to me (by this time the bright lights was no longer emitted from the craft) moving very slowly with a flashing blue light on the bottom of the craft.  There was no sound.  The craft then disappeared behind the trees.  I will remember this for the rest of my life.<n>

We assumed it was a star or planet.  Last night we watched it move to the right faster than a star would move.  Then it moved back to the original position. Then it moved towards us and then it moved far away backwards at speed even planes cannot move. Then back towards us.  Then it stopped moving. We have no idea what it is now, but someone should look at it and explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our elevation is 700 ft., +41° 50&#39; 24.26&amp;quot;, -72° 22&#39; 31.59&amp;quot; (41.840073, -72.375441), and we have a large view of the sky. It looked like there were briefly some blue rays of light at one point but I am not sure of that.I am sure there is a good explanation, it would be really nice to know since I see it through my window while I&#39;m in bed. I did take photos of it with my Iphone.when you enlarge photo two other lights appear next to it one on each side.<n>

The sky was extremely clear and it looked like EVERY constellation was visible.  So as I scanned the night sky I started to look towards the horizon and that is when I focused on what looked like a small round ball of clear thick/heavy glass in the air, about twice the height of a normal street light from the ground.  I noticed that there were no street lights and no &amp;quot;outer&amp;quot; craft carrying the sphere (like a helicopter or something like that) the light just &amp;quot;went out&amp;quot;.  It was far too low to be a light from a craft or a shooting star.  It was literally so low you would have thought someone was on one of those utility trucks fixing a power line.  It made absolutely no noise, and was moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since I live close to an airport and I see airplanes all the time I knew it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it made no noise and it moved too fast.  Also it made absolutely no noise so I took out my cell phone camera because I was going to video it if I saw it again but it didn&#39;t.  This may be nothing but the way it moved looked like it had some destination.  My dad was an airforce pilot in the Canadian armed forces and when we were camping in Italy many years ago my mother told me he and she were sitting outside enjoying the night when they saw an actual ufo either crash or land and since my dad is a pilot he knew about airplanes.  Keep in mind this was maybe 40 years ago so I have always believed in them.   Anyway I would like to know if anyone else saw what I saw. I know what I saw was real!<n>

The siting did not last very long.  By the time I told my husband to look they had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It didn&#39;t look like airplane lights, and it was too high up in the atmosphere to be a helicopter.  The bright blue light was shining steadily, and it wasn&#39;t blinking.  There were times when it looked like it may have disappeared behind a cloud, but we weren&#39;t quite sure, because the visibility was quite clear out that night.  It was going in one direction, then it switched back to the other direction.  After a few seconds, it switched back to the other direction. It looked like it was &#39;floating&#39; floating down from the atmosphere.  We drove the beach to see if we could see it.  When we got there, we couldn&#39;t find it in the sky anymore.  Another family (a man and his son) had pulled over in their car behind us, and said they saw the same thing.  They said they saw the color red before it turned to the blue color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights were circular in shape and orange, and about 3 times larger than a star.   The lights were aligned roughly in a vertical formation and moved very slowly as they hovered in the sky.  A couple of the lights moved in a semi-circular motion.  Unlike an airplane or helicopter, which can be traced in the sky as they move out of view, these lights seemed to disappear from view. We watched the lights for about 10 minutes until they all disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in the description of the objects he and his wife witnessed.

9/9/12 20:00|Wilson|NC|Light|3 hours|Bright orb being chased by a jet along with several other crafts after that. very bright like the sun.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92602.html|543|ndxe201209| bright orb being chased by a jet along with several other crafts after that. very bright like the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a report of the craft I have seen flying over the area where I live.  I started to see things more and more as I started to look up more and more.  There are planes that fly above the house but I notice that there are a lot more things around than just a few planes flying over. Planes come from one area and keep on going in the same direction.  I have not seen but a few planes during the day and night but whatever the other things are, they are not planes.  Several times you will see a jet chase the other objects around the area and in circles until the object takes off and leaves the jet behind like its nothing at all.  A lot of times the other objects look like bright orbs that float in air. They set in a spot for a few hours then slowly move to another area.  They pass one another like playing chick but they stop side by side and then take back off again.  They come together in a circle then break off in different directions and fly out of s! ight then return a little later to do it again. Any time a plane passes by they follow it for awhile then drop back to where they were setting at to begin with.  Some look like a flying star but brighter, much brighter. There is a area back in the woods that are large sand pits where they lower down below the tree line and come back up several hours later. I have been back their but get a sick feeling when I do and hair stands up on my arms. I will not go back there anymore. They seem to be more and more over time and on clear nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a lot of other objects with red and white flashing light that fly around the area a lot but they are much slower and normal just fly out of sight then return to the other direction hours later. I caught one on my camera during the evening and it looks like a flying star but with a jet chaseing it. I mean the jets are so close to the tree tops when chaseing these things that you see leaves fly up and the tree tops lay over. The bright orbs like to stay over the several sand pits we have in the area. They fly in circles over them a few minutes before either lowering down or moveing to the next one. One other the other red and white lighted crafts did the same and we know it lowered all the way to the ground because it left a stream of smoke like a jet from the ground up when it landed and took off. But this was different from the bright orbs. Several times the bright orbs seem to come from every direction and that’s when they all come together in a circle and s! et for a few minutes. Some times for a hour or so before backing up to form a triangle. Once they form a triangle they look to be connected to one another as they start to spin in a circle as a triangle. They spin around in a circle and slowly move in another direction. When this happens it is like a stopping point for all of the other crafts. Each one comes from another direction to meet up with the brighter one that formed the triangle and after meeting them it returns to another area to do it again. I can see anywhere from 10 to 30 in one night some times. I saw several in just a hour. I burn large piles of tree limbs and they seem to come out from everywhere when that happens. My mother is scared to the point where she will not go outside at night. When you see 8 or 9 flying lights over your head just setting there not moveing to much it is weard. I just need to find out what they are. Some look to be a sphere with lots of light from red to a white strop to even a green! lazer light. But I have called several airports and they said! that th ey have no where near that many planes in the air at night. I have seen about 4 land in the fields and sand pits in the area. It lights up the woods like the sun itself.<n>

The object made no sound.  No severe weather occurred.  The object appeared to be intelligently controlled due to the motion and erratic pattern and the fact that the object moved up, straight and up into the clouds.  I had the feeling the object or UFO was trying to avoid being seen as it consistently maneuvered into the cloud formation.  This object was observed from a moving vehicle (Car), Sunday September 9, 2012  between the hours of 2:30 pm-3:00 pm, sunday September 9, 2012.<n>

It was changing shape/color from bright to dark.  Eventually it rose very high in the sky and was still visible as a faint dark dot.  The object was traveling in the opposite direction to the local wind  direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several witnesses watched the object including two people from the Canadian Coast Guard who were alking by our location.  Total time watched was around 10 minutes until it disappeared into the clouds. No air traffic or sound was  recorded on my iPod Touch.  Unfortunately, the object is so small the camera cannot show an image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My gut feeling is that the object was a helium balloon someone released.

As soon as this  bright light would disappear we could see tiny bright lights floating around right in front of our eyes. I thought I was imagining these tiny specs of floating light until the other 2 observers told me they saw them as well.  The sky seemed to be getting  a hint of a smokey color.

The object was so “clean” that it reflected the sun like a mirror.  It looked like it just came out of a “chrome shop”. I took many pictures which I am willing to share.  I used a 300mm lens and after looking at the pictures is when I realized that it had three components.  It left (disappeared) by slowly going up into the sky. It was amazing.<n>

This happened about 3 times.  I took my camera from my smart phone and found the object through the scope and took multiple pictures.

The sky was shrouded in cloud cover and no stars or moon were visible.  I was passing a stone quarry on the right side of the road (facing south) when I saw approximately 20 orange-colored lights in a vertical formation in the sky beyond the quarry area.  Geographically, the area below the lights is uninhabited; since all the land beyond the quarry is part of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s estate.  This property is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to see the orange lights intermittently as I drove (dense trees blocked my view), then I turned on to County Road 729/N.  Milton Road and pulled into a the school parking lot.  I saw 3-4 of the lights only by that time.  As I watched with another observer who had arrived there shortly before I had, there were 3 lights that moved slowly upwards and towards each other.  Then they faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other observer I spoke to stated he had made several attempts to photograph the lights on his phone, but though he could capture other lights nearby, there was no image when he tried to photograph the orange lights.  He stated he had also traveled east on Rte 250 and he had also seen the 20 orange lights in formation as I had seen them a few minutes earlier.  There were also 2 tour buses idling in the parking lot, but I did not check to see if the drivers were present or had witnessed the event<n>

When he arrived at home shortly after my son, husband and myself went to the back yard to investigate.  Shortly we saw one sphere slowly fly over from the ski hill in a west to easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next 10 minutes we watched another 5 orbs fly in the same direction, however no two followed the same flight path.  There was no noise from them, however we also observed 3 planes fly overhead, with their accompanying noise, but they flew at a much higher altitude then these mysterious bright spheres, and much faster.  These orbs seemed to just glide across the night sky.<n>

There were 8-10 lined up.  He didn&#39;t think they were moving at first, but as he stood still watching them, he could tell they were moving very slowly eastward.  There was no sound made by them. He watched them for about 5 minutes, when he came inside to get me so I could see them.  Only a minute had passed before I got outside, and the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flashing green, yellow, red, and blue lights.  Not sure what shape the object is.  It is definitely flashing very bright red, blue, green, and pretty sure yellow lights and just hovering.  Every so often it will circle a little or move back and forth and then just hover.  Moved from Lebanon area, North toward Hartsville but further past that area.  Possibly edge of Ky. Have a telescope on the object but unable to make it out other than very fast flashing red, blue, green, and looks like yellow lights that seem to be going in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was full with bright stars and no clouds were seen during this time.  I noticed a triangular formation of four bright orange lights traveling from the North to the South of the Fort Wayne Area.  Then we noticed one single orange light actually leading the formation and then two following the formation from the rear.  The lights appeared to be moving at a continuas speed with the four in the triangular formation staying in a perfect formation.  The first ofject, after watching all of them travel past us with absolutly no noise, faded out and was never seen again.  The four in the formation then began to fade out in the same area as the one.  The two from the rear also faded out at what appeared to the be the same area of the sky that the previous five disappeared!  The large orange fireball style of ligh! ting was very bright, moving at a constant speed but made no sound.  There was no strange activity prior to or after the observation of these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was approximately 2100.  I was traveling southbound at between 5 and 6 knots in a southerly breeze of 12 with a disturbed sea state.  Clear skies very little ambient light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was distracted by a flashing strobe type light from astern (North) looked back and discounted it as air traffic.  About five minutes later took another look and lights were much closer and well defined.  The strobes were flashing from my right to left (east to west) in the front of the craft.  Continued to monitor the craft as it neared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed over head I could determine that the flashes were distinct separate lights moving around the craft.   The lights were bright enough for me completely lose my night vision.  I could not make out any sound (please note that I was running a diesel engine at full throttle in building seas and breeze).  I would approximate the altitude around 2000 to 3000 ft.  Please note that I did not see any navigational lights or spots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued south, parallel to numerous commercial flights heading north prior to their east bound turn (out of Seatac).  It passed at least three jets heading north and if this was odd they could not have missed the lights.  I tracked the craft as it made an easterly turn over the shipping canal toward Lake Union.  At this point I thought it might have been a strange lighting configuration on a sea plane which would land on lake union.  Or a new lighting configuration on a plane heading for Boeing Field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My curiosity was piqued when the craft did not land in lake union or turn south to Boeing Field but instead turned north (probably over lake Washington) and continued that course until I lost it behind the rise (this is how I approximated the altitude)  I was about two miles off shore and to lose it behind the hill the angle would not allow for much height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange occurrence and thought if you got other reports this might help to substantiate them.  Times and heights are all approximated so use with a grain of salt.  But I hit the Shilshole dock at 2200 so speed and time are pretty close.<n>

I first noticed 6 bright orange lights when I glanced out of the driver’s side window of my van.  At first I thought it was simply a reflection and mentioned it to my wife.  When she looked she said…”that is no reflection!”  We both saw the phenomena…a series of 6 bright orange lights arranged in a pattern very similar to the Big Dipper constellation.    The pattern was only 10-15 degrees above the horizon and would be in a northwest direction from our observing position.  The pattern did not apppear to be in motion vertically or horizontally.  The lights were definitely not stars.  They were a definite orange in color and much brighter than stars.  Also, they were all of a seemingly identical brightness and size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to continue to travel east on the road to a spot about a mile farther where we knew we could get a clear view of the sky.  During our travel, we continued to glance at the formation and noted that the lghts started to move apart and disappear, one or two at a time.   They did not fade…they simply vanished as if moving away out of sight.  By the time we reached the area we intended to stop, all the lights were gone except for two, which left shortly thereafter.   When we stopped, we also noticed another vehicle perhaps 100 yards ahead of us also stopped.  We suspect that they may have seen the same phenomena and also stopped to observe.  This is simply conjecture on our part since they moved on shortly after we stopped and noticed the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my wife nor I have ever observed anything similar to this phenomena before.  We would be anxious to know if others in our area observed anything similar.  When we arrrived home last evening, I immediately wrote a note to a local television news room (WNYT Albany, NY) detailing our observation in hopes that if any others had observed, we might hear of  the matter on that station.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to be moving in a south eastern direction with one in front of the other almost as if it were a plane with one light on the front and one on the back. As we watched the trailing light appeared to move further to the east almost as if the craft was swinging its nose towards us and its tail away from us (and while the trailing light was making this move it started to dim as if its light were starting to become obscured by the body of the craft) till the trailing light could no longer be seen. As the single remaining light continued in the same direction it also started dimming till it also vanished. Total passage of time for this event was at the most 30 seconds. My wife works for an answering service and I work in a factory.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The movement pattern of the light was akin to the way a balloon moves through the air, floating with mild changes in altitude.  The light then changed from green to bright violet blue at which point it became markedly brighter and appeared to grow in size by about 50 percent.  It then shrunk back to it’s normal size then changed colors again to red and then to white and back to green.  The whole time the light was moving away from us and we lost sight of it as we exited to freeway.   However as we turned of the main road down our street we saw the light which had changed back to violet blue over the trees.  As we went down the hill to our house we lost sight of the light and did not see it again even though we went back up to the main road to see if it could be seen from there.  My ! mother and I had both independently witnessed similar lights on separate occasions during the week or so proceeding this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw 5-7 red-orange orbs in the sky flying in impossible formations. They were able to rapidly reorganize into different flying formations. I turned the car around and exited the highway. All four people in the car witnessed this, when I found a safe place to try and film I could not get around the trees and buildings to get a clear shot.  Another driver pulled their car over and witnessed the same thing,  I gave this driver my binoculars to try and see if he could see while I tried to capture on my iPhone.  These things were fast and I just couldn&#39;t catch them on my iPhone, I really tried. I cannot express how intense a feeling it is to see a real UFO and trying and get a good look.  The objects basically started to fade out one by one and then they were gone. I saw these same type of objects on May 6 in the bay area! .  I have no doubt something major is going on.  We were seeing is their glow, there has to be a solid surface, but the distance was too great to discern.  They were at around 20K feet by my estimate.  There is no way at these were planes or helicopters they move way to fast and change direction in impossible ways.<n>

As I sit at my computer I have a window directly to my left which gives me a view of a taller block (12 Storey), left of this block I get a good view of the horizon if I lean outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 19:55 I glanced out of my window and saw a gun-metal black craft with 3 spike-like protrusions, one on top and a spike either side.  There was no sound whatsoever from this object, I could hear the traffic and faint police sirens in the distance but no aircraft sounds. The craft&#39;s overall shape was a flattened Teardrop, with the curved portion at the rear.  At first I thought it was a toy, I could clearly see the shape of the craft and exactly where the spikes meet the body. The craft appeared quite large in the sky, about 2cm if I was to pretend to hold it with my fingers. I used to be heavily into model aircraft and kites when I was growing up, I do have an interest in aviation and I&#39;m not one to mistake everyday flying devices as something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly opened the window and leaned out. The craft travelled 8 o&#39;clock direction towards the tall block directly ahead and disappeared behind the building. I watched intently for it to emerge from the other side, after about 1 minute I could see it again, but its position had changed. It was MUCH further away, whereas before it appeared fairly close, now it was just about visible above the horizon to the left of the building. The craft appeared to stop in the distance, turn around (from facing right, to facing left), then lower vertically beneath my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for another few minutes after that to see if I could catch sight of it again, unfortunately that was the last of it. This has put me in a weird spot, I had no idea what to do with this. My mind literally cycled through everything I understood about things that fly the moment I laid eyes on it. It didn&#39;t fit, and that realisation actually startled me. I really needed to get this reported somewhere, thank you.<n>

I called for my Mother and her companion to come outside, which they did.  We stood in confusion and awe as we watched red-orange lights in the sky.  I would describe them as ‘lantern like’ and medium-slow moving.  They were silent and in a formation following one another closely.  There was one that lagged behind the others.  We were watching for them to come on the other side of a tree line, but, they didn’t.  They seemingly, disappeared.  The event lasted about ten minutes and the objects were low flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor down the street also saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional in project management with a Master’s degree.

Glowed and were about the size of a soccer ball but a little smaller.  It floated and danced about as high off the ground as really tall grasses or fireweeds grow during one event and when I saw the Orb it was close to the ground.  It made no noise.  It seemed to glow and flutter a little bit.  It made me feel uneasy but I was not scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The place was near Misty Lake in Wasilla, Alaska.  It was about the time it starts to get dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure about the time of day only to say it was not fully dark but it was dark enought to absoluteley identify what I saw.  It was seen by me, my daughter and her boyfriend at the time.<n>

Curious, because it was the wrong time of day when you typically would see this type of bird activity, and secondly, wondering what type of migratory bird it could be, I pulled into a parking lot to stop and get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now realized whatever I was seeing was definitely not birds.  The images kept appearing and disappearing, making it difficult for my son who was with me, to see them at first, but then he saw them too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The prominent shape seemed to be two large groups of small white objects, and they seemed to be moving, swirling almost in a rolling manner, but fairly stationary as a group,  before they would fade and disappear out of sight and then reappear at intervals that were about a minute or so apart.  As they faded in and out, it was apparent that the collective object was moving horizontally in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two groups overlapped slightly, with one higher and to the left of the other.  The images continued to disappear and reappear.  At one point, the shape was distinctly different, suggesting the outline of a semi-sphere or maybe the bottom section of a boat, with a curved and upward shape that also seemed to be formed from the same type of white objects, also swirling and moving.  As the images were far off in the distance, up in the sky, it was difficult to tell if the objects within the masses were moving, or if they were part of a larger object that was moving or rolling in the sky.  It was a bright sunny day, so it was difficult to tell if the objects were something white, or perhaps lights.   We continued to watch, for about 10 minutes before we saw a plane approaching the general vicinity of the object(s), and once the plane seemed to almost be to it, the object disappeared and we did not see it reappearing again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 50+ accountant, and my son is 15, and an honors student.<n>

We were looking up at the sky when a random Bright White light appeared out of nowhere, it traveled normal plane speed but was going down, then it sped up really fast, then it dispersed, but it looked like sparks came out of it, but the spark like objects all flew extremely fast in different directions. Then the main object that dispersed the &amp;quot;sparks&amp;quot; diappeared. We went inside and told my parents, but as I was going into the garage, I was looking straight up when something flew overhead at extremely fast speeds, leaving a streak of White light. Then we saw no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Adams reflection on lake<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting Takhlakh Lake near Mt. Adams in southern Washington and was inspired to take some photos of the lake from its eastern shore around 9 A.M. Around that time there were several people walking their dogs and a man painting the lake on the nearby shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking several pictures of the mountain, I felt compelled to photograph its reflection on the lake. When I returned home several days later, I noticed a dark chevron-shaped object in that photo (sumbitted to NUFORC).  It appears to be banked on its side and located above the treetops in front of the mountain. When magnified, the object appears to have two red areas located bilaterally near the front and a blue area just behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I took that particular photo there was no sound of aircraft. I had been looking at my camera’s LCD viewfinder from a distance and didn’t see anything flying. I was interested in visiting the Mt. Adams vicinity because I had heard it described as an energy vortex with elevated numbers of UFO sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Mystery solved!  The source of the report looked at other photos, and the object is a log, sticking out of the water, which created a very interesting mirrored-image, somewhat similar in appearance to a B-2 bomber.  Our gratitude to the source for his intrepid search for an explanation of the very interesting looking photo.  PD))<n>

Last night we witnessed 8 floating orbs in a T shape formation which must have been at least 4-5 football field lengths in total area hovering to the east over the Delaware River from our home.  The orbs hovered in the same formation for 3-4 hours but moved rapidly left to right, right to left, up and down sporadically and independently.  The orbs moved 1/2 mile closer at one point to where we were and then back to their original position, at least in perception based on the size of the orbs and positioning in the sky.  The orbs emanated bright white light mostly but sometimes flashed red, orange or green lights and did not appear hazy.<n>

The top light and the light on the left were both a bright Green and the other two lights were Bright White.  It seemed quiet largealmost the size of the moon.   I live in a rural area 1/2 hour east of Dryden Ontario.  It happened at Three AM I was taking my dog out side to go to do his business.  The object was sitting in the east, south east of the house high above the tree&#39;s and to the right of the moon, it was like a painting could see The object very clear, I was frightened and took my dog back into the house right away.  Not sure how long it was there before I went out or how long it stayed there.  Was a frighting sight for me.<n>

The light radiating from them was unlike that of a helicopter (our first suspicion).  It glowed like a ball of light, yet, you could still tell that it was an OBJECT.  You could also tell their position in the sky. THEY WERE NOT THAT FAR FROM US....maybe a mile away from us and a mere 500-700ft. from the ground. For these craft to be so close to the ground, they made no audible disturbances. (This would not be the case if they were government aircraft.)<n>

The flames died quickly and left a bright orb which kept moving same direction (north). This orb dimmed from a very bright round light to a smaller, star-sized light. I pointed the object out to a friend sitting next to me and he confirmed that he was seeing the bright object move north as well. It moved in such a perfectly straight line that I thought it must be a satellite in orbit.  As I was considering this possibility, it moved in semi-circle (east, south-east) and stopped dead in the sky. It stayed perfectly still and looked not unlike any of the stars in the sky but it was much brighter than any of the stars. It stayed there for approximately twenty minutes. I kept peering upwards to make sure it was still there and after the twenty minutes had gone by it had vanished entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There is a municipal airport on the north side of the city, so low-flying small aircraft are a very common sight.  If the light had been white, I wouldn&#39;t have given it a second look, assuming that it was just a small plane that had taken off from the airfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although its color seemed unusual, it behaved like other low-flying aircraft I&#39;ve seen at night, proceeding in a steady, straight line, moving north to south, right over the neighborhood I was passing through.  I stopped running and watched it, expecting to see wing lights blinking, that the orange light was just so much brighter that it obscured them.  Although the orange light seemed to very slightly pulse a few times, there were no other colored lights, nothing blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it silently pass overhead, turning myself around to face south, until it was obscured by nearby trees.  The entire &#39;sighting&#34; lasted approximately one minute.  I continued on my run.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 5 minutes later, as I still ran north, I saw another bright orange light, again coming from the north and moving south!  I stopped immediately to watch it, and it looked and behaved almost exactly as the first one I&#39;d seen.  It also seemed as though it could&#39;ve been a low-flying, single-engine airplane with orange headlights on.  It seemed to follow the exact same path as the first light, and also made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only difference this time was that, when it was directly overhead, the strength of the light started fading.  It dimmed very rapidly as it continued to move until I could no longer see it.  It reminded me of watching a satellite passing overhead on a clear night, as it moves in a perfectly straight line, and then slowly gets dimmer and dimmer until it is no longer visible.  Maybe the first light also did this, but I could not see it because of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a beautiful chilly night, with little to no breeze, and a crystal clear, cloudless sky full of stars: a perfect night for a run, and it turned out to be a very memorable run!<n>

It was off to the east and seemed to be coming towards me.  The light started turning colors (red, blue, white, green) and was very bright.  As it flew closer I could tell it was not an aircraft by the way it was moving.  It would fly north, come to a complete stop and go the opposite direction.  I ran inside to get my roommate so she could see it too.  When we got back outside the objest was directly overhead.  There were three round, yellow lights shaped like a triangle.  It had a beam of light coming out if it in a straight line that changed colors.  We watched the light for about another 2 minutes as it manouvered around the sky and changed shape and colors before it disappeared behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting on the patio of my ex girlfriend having a beer and catching up.  All of a sudden a orange ball appeared in the sky and travelled quickly from east to west so from Orleans Ontario to downtown Ottawa.  It was a bright orange color something I have never seen in my life.  The color wow ORANGE and orange that is easy on the eyes you know, warm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden boom just started dimming and out of sight.  At this point we are all like what was that then boom a second ball shows up, same trajectory but this time it did not fade like the previous one and just kind of disappeared from our view.  As soon as we saw the first one we immediately called my step kid to come see as well.  At this point my ex was filming it but she kept saying it’s so small on my phone screen we cannot even see it so stopped filming fairly quickly, considering nice short video, I also snapped pictures as well 3 of them.   All I can say is I saw what I saw and well never seen this before and my gut tells me that it was not technology that I have ever seen.  No noise at all….silent and the light wow amazing!  This is the first report I have ever filled cause well it’s the first time I have ever since this live and not on a video were 1/2 of the people say CGI lol.

I said no, there are no red or white flashing lights and they are to close and they are staying still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t stop due to crossing bridge at 70 MPH. Once on other side we turned around on overpass and went back.  As we approached I watched the lights disappear liked the turned off a switch.

I assume it was over Lake Ontario nased on its dostance.  It was so bright at first i thought a plane exploded, but didn&#39;t see actual fire.  It looked like it changed altitude and depth instantly.  Then just got fainter and more distant slowly.<n>

I looked down and drove another 50 feet and the craft was absolutely gone.It was a perfectly blue sky that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing on earth can float like that in a stationary position and then be gone completely from the sky within 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was with me I told her look look 4 times :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At first I thought weather ballon, or a blimp but the colors were a amazing and flashed over the whole globe by segments.  Very bright lights.<n>

It looked to be at an exrtreme high distance, to high for any jet or plane and did not look like a comment.  It moved organically at a very high speed in an &#34;S&#34; pattern.  We watched it travel across the sky until we could no longer see it<n>

I was facing a closed window in our room and the window has a brown shade over it.  However, I noticed a red ball of light on the inside that quickly passed through the shade and window and disappeared, either moving away or dissolving on the outside of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just read a ton about ball lightning, but I doubt ball lightning inspects people or their houses when people are sleeping. It sounds more like a monitoring tool of some sort.  I remembered watching UFO reports about balls of red light floating over houses and fields.  And I wonder if this is one of them.  Anyone else experience something like this?   I can only hope that if it is a monitoring tool, that we didn&#39;t show any reason for further interest in us!  Haven&#39;t been able to get back to sleep yet for the past hour and a half.<n>

It had flashing blue, red, white and green lights at the base of it an it was heading my direction fast. i&#39;m telling you i was scared for my life at that moment. i quickly put the fire out and ran into the bush. the object was hovering ove! r my truck with a huge rectangle shaped light its its base a very bright light. it must have bee about 2 or 3 hundred feet in the air. i was hiding in the bush behind a tree so it wouldnt see me. i was on my hands and knees sitting on my feet for at least 2hrs, my feet went numb but i didnt even notice. i also kept hearing weird noises behind me. heard bubbling water, crackling of branches and a sound which sounded like a hyena or something. i grabbed a sharp stick thinking i was gonna try kill whatever is trying to get me. it was very intense, i thought, i cant die like this. a flash of my kids popped in my head and i turned my fear into anger at that moment. but before i stood up, there was another one, exact same as the first it was like the first one was watching my truck and the second one was scanning the bush for me. i stood up by the tree and made a run for it because i figured for sure there was something behind me in the bush and i wasnt gonna let it get me. i ran! to the field at the end of the bush and looked back towards t! he truck and it had left, light was off and it started heading south, very slowly. there was a third one travelling beside it and i dint even notice it was there but didnt matter to me because they were both leaving. the second one had stopped over the bush and stayed there for at least 4,5 hrs. in that time i was looking around for more and saw a fourth one hovering, it was probably at least ten miles away. that one didnt move. in that same direction i saw the fifth one fly by th 4th one comming towards me, very fast with no sound at all coming from any of them. the 5th one just flew right be me headn south till it dissapeared. then i seen a 6th one coming from the same direction but also flew by me heading south till it was gone. by this time i was freezing and thought if they didnt do anything to me now they probably would have done it already. so i walked back to the truck and started another fire with the second object in plain sight. it stayed in that same spot until daylight ! came then it slowly started going up until it dissapeared. i found someone down the road and flagged them down and hge gacve me a boost and i got the heck out of there. i dont know what to make of it but i do have questions i know can never be answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just finished some school work (I’m a college student) and decided to sit down and relax for a bit before I went to bed. I was sitting in-front of my big picture window in my living room that faces the setting sun when I saw this incredibly bright solid green light that was round in shape and about 100 feet off the ground go flying above the tree line about two blocks down from my house. What was really strange is it made no noise and was moving at an incredible speed; it was moving so fast that it actually streaked across the sky. The size from my perspective looked like it was about the size of car. The speed that it moved at was faster than any plane or helicopter that we have around here. It’s a rural community and although we have an airport there isn’t that much traffic and the light was moving horizontally, and if it was a plane it would have ! been moving vertically (over my house) because the airport is on the other side of town behind my house. So it wasn’t a plane. I went outside to see if I could see the path that it followed but it was gone, it’s trajectory was an upward angle so it would be odd if was a meteor. I honestly cannot say for a fact what I saw but it was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen living around here.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two of the objects rose quickly in the sky to appear as the size of stars and had the intensity of stars but flashed multi-colored lights.  These two objects have remained in the same position for the past 30 minutes since, 11:45 PM, as I am typing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 4-5 flying objects flew by much closer in our line of vision, appeared cylindrical, flashing red, white, green lights but then seemed to grow smaller in size once directly in front of our line of vision, and directly underneath the two stationary UFOs, and maintained a smaller outward glow of either red or white light.  While witnessing these UFOs, the sky lit up brightly in flashes, but there was no lightning.  One note of surprise is that I witnessed an orange flash of light coming down from the sky, appearing as if it were 50-60 feet away from me and much like how a fountain firecracker would, while watching the UFOs.<n>

I look over an earth berm so my horizon is limited.  I have been an RN for 21 years and I am not prone to panic, I don&#39;t see UFO&#39;s every time I turn around.  I am 60 years old.  I am a trifle far sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the other two observers, one is ex Navy and the other has a Masters degree in communication.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in this home for 18 years and am very familiar with my piece of the night sky, both summer and winter.  I have never seen anything like this.   The same object appears in the Western sky each night at about 22:00.  I first noticed it Thursday (8/30) and have seen it every night since, except Monday, however, there were clouds in and out of the sky that night in my area.  The object hangs for about an hour is no longer visible to me at 23:00.  It approaches f! rom the South and appears the about 50-60 degrees above the horizon, over the hour, it heads North about 40 degrees and then heads West until it becomes too small to see easily, and then disappears.  The same pattern repeats every night.  It makes no noise at all. NONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has a bank of lights that flash red and green that are on the top and North/right side only, the South side of the object is bright white. The shape is oval(ish) but it curves inward on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can easily identify the planes that approach and leave the area, all are obvious and I can hear them.  This object is completely quiet.  An Osprey or a Harrier or any kind of heliocopter would make some sort of sound. Jets can&#39;t hang in the air like this does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, on Saturday last, 9/1, it was accompanied by streks of light that approached in one set of 3 lights, from South to North, two sets of 2 light came in, one set approached from the South to North, the other set of 2 approached from the North to South and there were several single streaks. Only one that I saw approached from top to bottom, which would have been East to West.  One streak, the last one I! saw, appeared from North to South and appeard to vere off halfway through.  All approched at the same angle, maybe a 15 or 20 degree angle, and all had the same length &amp;quot;jet trail.&amp;quot;  The light trails lasted a couple of seconds.  All were headed to the same location - which was about where the object was hanging in the sky.  The streaks started at about 23:30 on Saturday and continued through Saturday night and again on Sunday night. The last streak I saw was at 04:15 Sunday AM.  I saw none during the daylight hours. I saw eleven streaks total and have seen none since...I have never seen these types of lights in the sky.  Let me know if you find anything.  This has me stumped!<n>

I was traveling West on the 2222 and had just crossed over the 360 when I spotted the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft was at first was in the distance, flying very close to the hills, and I noticed it was an abnormal size and had strange lights for an airplane, it was also moving extremely slow.  As I continued on the 2222 the aircraft flew closer to the 2222 and I realized it was flying extremely low and the slow speed became more apparent.  It passed over my car and I observed it was a solid triangular shape with brilliant green and red lights along the outside of the triangle.  I cannot recall the exact pattern of the lights. What struck me the most odd, and why I am reporting this, is the triangle shape. It was a solid triangle, with no visible wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am guessing this might be some sort of military plane but I have never seen anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is that I am a 38-year-old professional Caucasian female who never believed they would be filling this kind of thing out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All 4 of us were looking up into the eastern sky and were watching a ball of fire come out of the sky.  I said it looked like a ball of fire and must be space trash. I have seen it before. Well not this time.  As we are watching I see that it is slowing down.  I pull out my phone and start taking pictures.  In them you will see the ball of fire then you will see in later shots not a ball of fire but an object clear in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object as it was slowing down was still on fire. I could see it really well.  It finally came to a complete stop and was just sitting there burning and then the fire went out.  All I was able to see was the object there in the sky.  After 15 seconds of it sitting there it went from a dead stop to an extreme speed away from us going in a south eastern direction.   The total even lasted 2 minutes.<n>

As the clouds passed, we could determine that the object was below the cloud altitude.  I assumed that it was some kind of weather balloon or man-made object just floating up there, but it never moved from the position that we originally spotted it. The next morning we saw the exact same thing happen.  Our vantage point was from the Mono Village campground, looking directly down the lake at about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Since we were on vacation, we did not stare at it until it disappeared, but we could not see it after about 10:00 in the morning. We looked at it several times for a couple of hours each day and using a tree limb as a vantage point---it never changed position on either day.  We attempted to take photographs, but they did not show up---Too far away??<n>

The sun rise was breaking through the clouds. I snapped three shots at different angles.  The UFO was not visible to the naked eye.  It appeared as the final product of the photo. I have seen many UFO’s in Caddo County over the last 9 years however reporting this one is essential because it came through my pasture fence to the ground twenty feet  paced from  the bench I was sitting on.  It is not a reflection of sunlight. This is totally separate from the sunlight and very large and easy to see detail in the photograph. It is a brilliant circular orange UFO with a bright yellow center horizontal and equilateral to the yellow are two additional orange circles. The top was orange raised and triangular.  A vapor of orange trailing behind created a glow.  This was the first photograph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the second photograph it was hitting the ground dispersing and the yellow center remained intact. In the third photo the UFO was no longer visible.<n>

I just happened to face north when I saw a large object flash. It was coming down at a very fast rate. For a second I thought it was an airplane because it seemed so large and we do live near the airport. I exclaimed to my friends to observe the object, I really thought it could be a plane crashing. By the time they turned to face the object, it had already disappeared behind one of the houses. I was scared, and they could tell I was scared. I don’t think anyone else saw it, someone said it could have been a shooting star. I think it was too large to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came by and went too fast for me to determine how far away it was. The object looked about the size of an airplane when it is closing in for landing. The flash I saw from it was white in color, but there seemed to be flames coming from behind it as it fell down, also white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard a crash or anything of the sort and part of the reason I got scared was because I was expecting some sort of noise. I was thinking it could have been a meteor or space junk, but I was unsure if those would make a noise since the object I saw seemed so close and large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bottom line is I don’t know what it was and was wondering if anyone else had seen it.<n>

I observed what appeared to be four-five lights in the SW sky.  The lights were a very bright yellow and appeared to have the shape of planes or were &#39;bird-like&#39; in shape. The moved around in a zig zag and spiraling motion, up and down, and then disappeared.  As quickly as those lights disappeared, another three - four lights appeared, moving in the same zig-zag spiraling up and down motion, then disappearing. Suddenly, there were about three more lights, repeating the same motion and movement. The objects made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly attempted to get another family member outside, but could only locate one person.  The family member saw nothing, but while he was standing there, another light flashed across the sky, but was much further away.  Family member did not see the one light, nor any of the other lights. Family member suggested a meteor shower, but the objects were shaped like planes(or birds), were bright yellow, did not flashe across the sky, and they were all the same shape and size. (I do not believe in UFOs, and before now, would have never thought of reporting to a site like this one. I have seen meteor showers before, and have never witnessed anything like this.)<n>

It was unusually bright and my first impression was that it was a &#34;Japanese lantern&#34; which consists of a candle and a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the house I realized that it was too high to be as bright an object as the one I was seeing.  It was at that point that the object began moving notherly at a much higher rate of speed.  Previously, it had seemed to be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved north, it seemed to have both red and blue blinking lights on either side of the object.  I lost sight of it over the house and had to run to the backyard to continue viewing.  When I got to the back of the house it was almost out of sight but I could still see all three lights; red, blue and brighter white until I lost sight over the treeline.<n>

It was the size of a garden landscape light seen from about 200ft away from 15ft above the water.  The light was glowing, flickering, bright as an incandescent flashlight. There was no obvious source from shore.  No boats moored. On the 8th I saw two lights about 10ft apart in the same area, same qualities, only difference was the color, more of an orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The bedroom is in the front corner of my house and faces West.  There are windows at the head (west) and my side (south) of the bed.  As I pull up the alarm app on my phone it freezes and shuts off.  I looked out of the window next to me when bright lights and an object that at first appeared to be a helicopter caught my attention traveling from the East no more than 100 ft above my neighbors house.  It appeared to be moving very slowly and had too many lights to be the type of helicopter that my town utilizes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I promptly jumped out of bed and ran out my front door to get a better look.  The first thing that made me uncomfortable was the dead silence. The aircraft made no sounds and continued traveling West.  It moved in a strange way around the trees and then appeared to sink lower suddenly over the highway 5 blocks down.  I waited to see if it wou! ld climb higher but it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Looking at the stars I noticed what looked like a satellite moving across the dark sky, when it began to fade out.  Thinking it was going in to the earths shadow I looked away and noticed a shadow moving across the sky. The object is hard to describe. Imagine a brick with rounded edges and protrusions sticking out on both ends.  It was a little darker than the sky. It glided over the top of the building and disappeared.  If you followed the angle back to where I saw the light dim out, it matched. I told my co workers what I had seen and was thinking about reporting this, but decided not to.  Two days later which was today, a co worker told me about a radio program she was listening to that described an object, like the one that I had seen.<n>

Timpanogos, UT 4 Sep 12<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I went camping Tues 4 Sep in what&#39;s known as the Alpine Loop in the Wasatch Mountains. About 8:30pm Mountain Time, as we started looking up to see the stars,  I noticed what I originally thought was a planet - in the NW sky about 45-55 degrees from horizon (I&#39;m no astronomer so I don&#39;t know how to describe the coordinates any better than that).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This &amp;quot;planet&amp;quot; flared suddenly and brightened and grew considerably - I would estimate at peak it appeared the size of 2-3 Venuses. Magnitude was what I&#39;d expect if Venus grew that large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flare turned a  pinkish color - to the point it looked like a &amp;quot;mini carnation&amp;quot; flower in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It faded to nothing within 5 seconds or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky condition was completely clear - esp. so as we were at an elevation of 7100 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wrote to a sky phenomenon web site - their best guess was an Iridium satellite flare; but none were visible in UT at that hour and date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has reported seeing this phenomenon - we know we both saw something - but it defies any description.<n>

Once I reached the bottom of the hill, I could see clearly across the Green River Valley, all the way to the West Hill, roughly 5-7 miles away. The sky was clear, crystal clear, and the moon had yet to rise above the eastern horizon( I was driving west.)  Sea-tac International Airport is located about 12 miles north of where I was looking, and it is very common to see the lights of planes taking off and landing at the airport, during all hours of the day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked across the valley, I noticed four lights, flying lower than the peak of West Hill. Three of the lights had blinking lights, and from my experience, appeared (and sounded) like helicopters. The 4th light, which they were following, about 200 yards behind, was an incredibly bright, unblinking white/blue light, about the size of a large sized pickup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The heli&#39;s followed the object, which remained in complete and clear field of view, for nearly 3o seconds, North along (what I would assume) highway 167.  Then, the object/light turned abruptly due east, and traveled for another 15-20 seconds, before fading away and completely disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was following, as closely as possible, and could hear the helicopters clearly, but no other noise could be heard from the object.  Once the light disappeared, the helicopters began to fly in a concentric circular pattern, slowly spiraling away from the last location of the light, until the 3 were flying completely around Auburn and South Kent.  Around the same time, I noticed an unusual amount of air traffic over Auburn. I watch the commercial airliners every day and night, and am quite familiar with the lights and flight patters of these aircraft. The unusual air traffic, though, did not have the same characteristics what-so-ever of the normal every day planes. There were no lights on the tail, not the normal ACL lights flashing on the underside or wingtips. The planes appeared to be darker in coolor, and not flying the normal pattern to land at Sea-Tac. The helicopters were present for about 2 hours after the light disappeared, then around 11pm, they all flew away, in! opposite directions<n>

At almost the same time I noticed my daughter also said momma what is that.  There were two large lights in the Skye, one nearly above us.  I can only discribe as orbs of light.  As I pulled out my phone to record they both shot off too the west in what seemed like a rapid speed to get such a distance so fast.  One moved away faster than the other behind a cloud an then came back towards the other.  As if waiting on the other to follow which it did.  This was early evening an still light outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything as this. I recorded almost two minutes of the lights, I even recorded an airplane fly past next just to see the difference myself. I&#39;m not sure what I seen, but I am positive it was no plane.  I heard no noise, an could see it first very well.  By the time I got my phone out it was quite a bit further away but still visible, I&#39;m amazed an cant believe what my daughter an!

Neighbors had been shooting fireworks in celebration of Labor Day holiday.  Time was 9:50pm.  Orange/amber orb appeared from nowhere approximately 200 ft. vertical above my backyard.  I live in a very populated neighborhood; however, lots of farmland surrounding area.  I first thought this was some sort of remnant from a firework and it appeared to be “on fire”.  It was moving very, very slowly from the southeast sky toward the northern sky.  It literally stopped overhead and hovered for approximately 1 minute and then continued on this northern direction, remaining perfectly horizontal to the ground at the same altitude it first approached.  As I watched it glide across the sky, totally without sound, I kept trying to process what this could be.  I even thought someone must have an awesome remote control toy, until it disappeared in the distance.  During its flight, it would get brighter, then dimmer but was absolutely NOT an airplane or h! elicopter and no other lights or colors----just the steady glowing orange/amber color.  I can only seem to describe it as what the sun against the night sky would look like, only much smaller form.  As I was trying to explain this, another one appeared in the exact location as the first and mimicked the flight pattern exactly as the first, just as the first was almost out of sight range.  I am not panicked about this….just extremely curious.  Another side note, temperatures outside 80 degrees and zero wind.  I am a very sane person…….this was VERY odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As it moved on the 4 lights became 3 and it looked more like a triangle. It was going North to South (which would have taken it over the Moline airport).  She ran in the house as soon as she first saw it, grabbed her camera and ran back out.  She snapped 3 pictures. I was about 30 seconds behind her and saw the triangle moving in the distance and then it just disappeared. We are a retired military (34 year aviation background)couple.<n>

One of the lights in the formation took a quick dive and the shoot straight back up again. At that point, I took out my I phone and proceeded to video the lights.

We live near Selfridge Air National Guard Base and as I was looking up in that direction I noticed a constant bright red light. I am in the military and am very familiar with military aircraft.  As I watched the light, I noticed it moving in my direction (northwest) and slowly turned back east.  The closer the craft came to me, the duller the light became until it completely disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I could make out the shape of the craft.  As the craft was almost over top of my wife and myself I could make out a disc shaped craft.  I watched this craft move across the sky for roughly a minute and a half until it disappeared. while watching this first craft I noticed a commercial jet flying east but the plane was far above the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft was gone I kept looking up towards the direction the craft came from and noticed a second bright red light.   watched this craft slowly head in the s! ame path as the first one doing everything the same down the to the dulling red light which disappeared at roughly the same point as the first craft.  At this point my wife said something and I looked at her and looked back up to where the light was and it was gone.  Neither craft made any noise.<n>

I stopped my coversation with my wife and pointed it out to her and she saw it and was amazed at the colors and its shape. I got up from my patio and walked to the northern corner of our back yard to get a clear look at this what appeared as an object moving on a level flight pattern from the east going west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the mean time my wife went inside our house to get our son&#39;s ages 26, and 25 and our one son&#39;s girl friend age 29. In the mean time I stood at in my place in my yard continuing to observe this very bright object that had what appeared as cone shaped or spikes shaped objects projecting out of the center of a cigar shaped center of which the entire object was completely illuminating a pulsating reddish orange aura.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came completley in front of me it appreared that the center of this object&#39;s center cigar shape had a line of white/blue/purplish glowing aura. I must stop here to explain that where we live we are in a flight line for Chicago Midway airport where on a daily basis we must see at least 30 or more commercial jets making their final approach into Midway and are approximately 5 - 6 thousand in altitude. Having seeing these daily for the 12 years we live here, I can differentiate the lights on commercial planes and how they change as they move and literaly pass over our house. This object never changed colors if anything as it moved directly pass me at 5-6 thousand feet in altitue, it clearly became more appearent this was no ordinary airchraft. As stated before, the entire object was totally illuminated and was larger than any plane I have seen in my life and as it passed I waited to hear the sound of jet engine or even possibely the sound of a propellar engine. What I hea! rd was nothing at all and at that time it was completely silent outside. As it moved westward away from me, it looked the same from the back as it did from the front, same colors, shapes, and pulsating aura. For the next few minuites as it began to disappear to the west I noticed all I could could make out of this was a bright red dot. At the time I witnessed this I would estimate that this object was traveling at the same or slightly faster speed of the airchraft that fly over our house daily on their final approach. (Maybe 200 mph).  But as it was at the point where it reached as far west of where  it turned to a red dot, it suddenly moved upward in altitude at a very fast speed and then it was no longer visable. Just at this time I noticed a commercial jet was comming out of the western sky perpandicular to this oject, and that is when the object shot upward out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 49 year old man whom I would decribe as someone who has has much experience with aircraft of many types, including military craft, and I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Irvine, California. (about 40 miles south of Los Angeles)  Approximately 4:45 pm, warm clear day, bright sunlight, sun was a bit off to the west, and there was no clouds. It is the afternoon, the sun is arcing towards the west, but still quite high in the summer afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ll try to present the experience without interpretation first, just as you would experience it, then save my interpretations for the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While doing the backstroke in my pool, I was looking up at the clear, bright blue sky. There were a few birds, and occasional passing airplanes in the sky. Nearly directly overhead, (just very slightly to the east, but still very substantially overhead), I saw a VERY bright light, fairly large, (compared to the apparent size of commercial aircraft at cruising altitude) or possibly a tight group of lights. It looked very, very bright, like the brightest of stars, only this was visible in the daytime. It also looked quite a bit bigger than any star you see at night. I only mention the word “star” here, to give at least some idea to the reader, as to what caught my eye. It looked stationary. That seemed odd to me, because all aircraft I know of have some motion. I wasn’t quite sure if it was moving or not, so I swam over to the edge of the pool, stood stationary myself, and placed the edge of the roof of my house in my sightline to the object, so as to better determine if it wa! s moving. Comparing it to the tiles of my roof, I could see that it was moving, but VERY slowly. There was no trail, and the lights stayed a brilliant white color. After a couple of minutes, I was so curious about it’s apparent odd size, extreme brightness, and lack of velocity, that I went inside (dripping wet!), and got my Tasco 10x-40x63 zoom binoculars. I tried to look at the object freehand without steadying the binoculars, but the image was too jerky. I tried using a table first, then a chair, but it was still too shaky. I found that the best way was to lie on the pool deck, and look almost straight up. Once I got situated, I again used the “zip focus” center wheel, and focused on the object first without any zoom at all, (no zoom gives a wider field of view, and makes it easier to initially locate an object in the sky). I could clearly see that it was not a single point of light, but rather, a dark tubular craft of some sort, with several extremely bright lights clos! e around it. It looked to be about 6 lights. I initially thoug! ht I was looking at a satellite, with solar panels reflecting the bright sunshine, and I wasn’t alarmed at all. If I tried zooming in all the way, it would get blurry, so I couldn’t zoom all the way. I could only zoom in about 2/3rd of maximum zoom, without it going out of focus. Even though my arms were fairly supported, the image was still somewhat shaky. I kept trying to brace myself better, to get a clear, more stationary image. At times, when I could hold steady, I was able to see the object fairly clearly, or as clear as possible. The lights were so extremely bright, that it made it hard to see the dark body of the craft. As best as I could make out, the body was a long, dark, and seemed to connect to the lights around it.  It looked as if a parking lot light standard had drifted up into the sky, with about 6 lights, connected by a dark body. During this time, the object was slowly but steadily moving across the sky, towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my wife and daughter to come outside and check it out. My wife tried looking through the binoculars, but was unable to locate it through the eyepieces. She’s unfamiliar with using them, and hard to teach. By this time, it had traversed from being directly overhead, (“0” degrees) to about 75 degrees, down towards the neighboring houses’ roofline. It was getting smaller, and farther away as time went by. I had already seen the best view of it that I was ever going to get, so I gave up following it across the sky, and went inside and searched the internet for coo-berating sightings. There are no coo-berating sightings so far. I called the Irvine Police Department, but they had no reports at all, even in a city of over 250,000. Nasa’s website did have a projected orbit path of the International Space Station, that showed it crossing southern California about 5 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interpretations-  At first, I thought it was a commercial jet aircraft, maybe at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. As we know, even though they may be doing over 500 mph, they appear to move very slowly across the sky, because their great height makes it hard to gauge their velocity. But this object wasn’t even moving fast enough to fit that model. It was either moving much slower than that, or it was “orbiting” at a much greater altitude. From the time I first sighted the object directly overhead, until the time I quit tracking it, it made about a 75 degree arc across the sky. A commercial jet aircraft, at typical altitude and cruising speed, would not take the 9 minutes or so that this object took to traverse that arc, and was visible for. A commercial jet does not fit this model for that, and others reasons, below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes, a shiny aluminum jet, especially like those used by American Airlines, can turn just right, and if the surfaces are angled right, you can catch a glint of the sun, making the aircraft appear very bright in the sky, even on a bright, sunny day. Only this craft had no typical wings, like you can see on 747s and the like, even at their typical cruising altitudes.  And, this craft was much, much brighter than that. I thought the lights were possibly solar panels, which may reflect the sunlight much better than shiny aluminum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was VERY bright. Just like a star, but you don’t see stars on bright sunny days. And there were several points of light around the dark bodied craft, so a star doesn’t fit the model.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living close to several airports, I am familiar with what a commercial aircraft looks like, flying at typical 35k-40k feet, 500+ mph. The observed velocity, brightness, apparent altitude, did not fit this model.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The International Space Station was actually my first guess. There are some aspects of the sighting that are congruous with the ISS. These are- A central body, and solar panels surrounding, that may reflect sunlight, and this object seemed to be following an orbit of sorts. And there are aspects of this sighting that are not congruous with the ISS, (and space junk, + dying satellites, for that matter) First off, in my internet investigation, I learned that satellites need to orbit at 17,500 miles per hour to fight gravity, and stay in orbit. This speed generates centrifugal force that combats gravity. If they slow down, their orbit decays. They also orbit at least 60 miles up, above most of the artmosphere. Some orbit at 100 miles up, or 400, or 1200 miles altitude. No satellites orbit within ten miles of the earth, because the atmosphere would burn them up at 17,500 mph, and the atmosphere would slow them down. As a decaying satellite orbit hits the atmosphere at 17,500 mph! , they get hot, and burn up on re-entry. In contrast, this sighting of mine was of an object moving excruciatingly slowly. This fact is completely inconsistent with space junk, the ISS, falling satellites, communications satellites, spy satellites, and it is also inconsistent with geo-synchronous satellites, that are in geo-synchronous orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, all satellites, regardless of whether they are geo-synchronous, or orbiting at 17,500 mph, are completely inconsistent with this sighting. This is because satellites orbit above the atmosphere, and are not visible in the daytime. When the sun lights up the atmosphere, you can’t see the light of stars, nor man-made orbiting satellites. The atmosphere is too bright to allow any viewing of objects like satellites, that orbit 60 miles up, or 400 miles up, and more. The first 10 miles of atmosphere are the thickest, and if you are going to see anything flying with the naked eye, or binoculars, it isn’t going to be outside the first ten miles of atmosphere. The only reason you can see the moon sometimes in the daytime, is because it is so extremely huge, that it allows your eye to perceive its’ presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is true, that if you know exactly where to look, you may see an “iridium flare” even in the daytime, where the light of the sun is briefly reflected towards your location, from a passing satellite. This is an extremely brief flash, (and a rather dim one at that), as it is moving at 17,500 mph. This fact is totally inconsistent with my sighting, that lasted about 9 minutes, and was extremely bright. An iridium flare is only visible for the time that the solar panels are angled so as to reflect the sun back to your eye. Because they are moving so fast, and because they don’t rotate to keep the sun focused on you, they only make a very brief, small, dim dash of light. Check ‘em out on YouTube. They aren’t much to look at, and are completely inconsistent with what I saw, which was an extremely bright, and continuous  cluster of lights, that moved extremely slowly, had a dark body, and took about 9 minutes to traverse a 75 degree arc across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On YouTube, you can see videos of the ISS passing overhead at nighttime. It streaks across the sky very rapidly. Not as fast as a “shooting star”, but much much faster than what I saw. The ISS also appears fairly dim. Somewhat like a small star. Even through my binoculars, the ISS would still look like a dot of light, and you wouldn’t be able to see the degree of detail that I saw, not at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What else could have a dark body, be surrounded with about 6 lights so bright, they rivaled the sun, make absolutely no noise, stay at the same brightness for 9 minutes, and take 9 minutes to traverse 75 degrees across the sky? Helicopters could arc across the sky like that, but they make a ton of noise, and this didn’t look anything like a helicopter at all, (nor a Harrier jump-jet, or even a group of weather balloons, nor a blimp) Even if you could attach lights as bright as stars on any of those crafts, they still wouldn’t look like what I saw. A group of balloons would not reflect the sun like what I saw. This object had lights so bright, they were like small suns in themselves. The reflection of the sun off of satellite solar panels is the closest earth-borne analogy to the brightness of light that I witnessed. But as stated earlier, satellites are completely incongruous because of altitude and speed, and the fact that you can’t see them in the daytime. But the sun/sola! r panel possibility is closest to explaining the brightness and sheer quantity of light emanating from this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, it looked like (closest analogy possible coming up right here), a parking lot light standard, (minus the pole, just the light cluster), that floats within the visible atmosphere, with no apparent means of motion, and a dark, central body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to wrap up, my sighting is inconsistent with the ISS, space junk, any known satellites, balloons, Harriers, commercial aircraft…I can’t think of anything made by mankind that fits all the criteria. It is definitely an unidentified flying object. Any ideas?<n>

When I zoomed in to the sea floor, the item had several symmetrical features that peaked my interest.  I made a close-up image capture of the item with Google&#39;s snapshot feature and emailed it to myself.  I knew right away that this was something significant due to it&#39;s totally unfamiliar shape and features.  Using my Corel Paint Shop Pro-Photo X-2 software I was able to adjust the satellite image and lighten and darken areas to get a more acceptable image.  I am including the original image I downloaded from Google Earth and the enhanced images so you can see that they are still the same image, just enhanced for clarity.  I will also include an image with the reflective surfaces highlighted in green due to some people having a hard time distinguishing the item from the sea floor.  I have reported this find to Earthfiles.com, MUFON, Ground-Zero, Coast to Coast and now NUFORC.  I am reporting this to as many places as I can and as quick as I can to make sure that the image and knowledge that it is still there is not hushed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After eliminating the water surface effect I was able to see that the craft had originally been perched on the edge of the plateau in the upper right of the image. It appears that the edge broke away and the craft then slid to the sea floor.  The halo effect around the craft is due to the displacement of the floor sand and sediment.  After many enhancements to the original image I can see that this craft is severely if not fatally damaged.  The Google Earth map for this area is the National Geological Survey map dated 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please contact me for the coordinates if you are interested in pursuing an investigation into this.<n>

It was 3:03 am.  I saw some flashing light that looked like firework balls- only they moved very fast- they would fade and almost disappear, then rush back into view again.  They would move out and away from each other- then merge together again- quickly.  They began merging and then would form a glowing ball of white light, which would grow in size. Then it would break apart and repeat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my phone, and recorded it.  My dogs were unusually silent- they stood still next to me.  Then the last time, it grew to be so bright and huge,  It almost like it knew I was watching or something.  I then clicked some photos instead of video- but when it merged and got brighter and bigger - it was like it was coming towards me.  So, I got scared and went back inside quickly. The video was not on my phone any longer. The pictures were still there though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We suddenly noticed  an orange , glowing, pulsating fireball object in the sky.  It was slowly moving soundlessly across the sky, about the height of a high flying helicopter.  After about 5 minutes it just vanished.  Then coming from the same direction that it originally came from, were two more identical flying objects.These also moved soundlessly ,slowly  and steadily across the night sky until they just vanished before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects appeared to be flaming and pulsating.  One person took a video with his cell phone. The object appeared differently when looking at the video, as the orange flaming colors were not there.  It appeared to be a circular white object on the video, but it still showed the PULSATION very clearly.  I took a picture with my cellphone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing of possible interest. Due to the full moon, we could see many chemtrails in the sky...and a few people in the group thought they saw pulsating white “stars” off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as a description of the observers, my friend and I are musicians, and the other four people were not friends , just fellow customers of the restaurant. We all saw the same thing.<n>

They appeared in sequence about 1-2 minutes apart, all beginning along the horizon &amp; traveling up to about the midpoint of the sky before disappearing.  There was mild cloud cover so we could not see exactly where the objects went.  They were yellow-orange in color, &amp; from our view point very large, comparatively perhaps 5x the size of Jupiter.  They were rather bright &amp; flickered like a candle flame, not a bright harsh electronic light that would be found on an aircraft. They seemed to be either very close &amp; very slow, or very distant &amp; very fast. There was no audible sound.  They moved in a somewhat random pattern &amp; variable speed, seeming to pause in their trajectory at points.  The objects left no trails in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live about a mile from a small commercial airport, but these objects neither originated from that direction, nor did they appear to land anywhere.  When we  lost sight of each one it was about halfway up the horizon.<n>

The sky was absolutely clear and this light seemed somewhat low, travelling at a speed slightly slower than an airplane.  It was travelling on a straight path, not wavering or descending.  There was no noise coming from it (we live in a quiet suburb). It only lasted maybe a minute then it just flickered out.  We weren&#39;t sure what we just witnessed so we continued on our walk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later as we were rounding the bend in our crescent I noticed the same kind of light again. It was travelling in the same direction but on a slightly different flight path this time.  This light lasted a bit longer because it didn&#39;t flicker out like the last one.  We watched this light until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Not sure what it was that we saw. Definitely not something floating since it had a definite flight path and had a ! steady speed.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Milford, CT,  Gulf Beach, Sunday,  09/02, 9:05PM   After the sighting reported to NUFORC for 08/18 at this location,(and pursuant to the 06/06/12 reports for Milford that share this locale and appearance of object) periodic visits resulted in no activity until this night.   At Gulf Beach 7:45PM, wind from west, then diminished ; broken cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First very bright orange-red spark-like light with orange nimbus emerged above treeline at 5 degrees N.  From elevation of 8 degrees it slowly and steadily rose straight up within cloudless area of sky.  This light initially gave the appearance of a slow-motion firework missile that was launched and primed to explode.  It was extremely bright and obviously propelled, not simply drifting.  Through 10x21 binoculars this light appeared fan-shaped (picture a deep U shape, wide at the top, with a small ball- shaped nucleus of brighter and deeper orange light resting at the bottom).  Overall impression was of a concise ball of light surrounded by a nimbus of hazier orange light.  I do not recall any fluctuation of the luminosity.   Slow ascent of this light continued for approximately 90 seconds.   Strobed a 110 lumen LED flashlight at this object during its ascent, with no response.  During last few seconds of ascent this light faded away until it was no longer visible in cloudles! s area of sky at 35 degree elevation.  Estimated distance from beach = 3,000 feet, which possibly positions it above marshland near a cemetary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 5 minutes of the first light’s fading away, another identical light rose above treeline at 355 degrees N.  Same appearance and gradual ascent straight up.  Likewise, viewed through binoculars and signalled with flashlight: same situation as previous until it similarly faded away at 35 degree elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting about 30 minutes for the chance of a repetition, packed up and ready to leave when, through the broken cloud cover to the ESE glimpsed a more distant but similarly colored light slowly ascending into the clouds.  Assuming that this might have been an error on my part, or a prosaic aircraft, I prepared to investigate a playing field about a mile to the north, from which chinese lantern/balloons could have been released.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within several minutes another bright orange light rose up behind the treeline in the exact same location that the previous light had been briefly noticed.  At 13 degrees elevation and 145 degrees SE  this light, identical to the pair that had just previously emerged from the north, slowly rose at what appeared to be the same distance from the beach (3,000 feet), which would place it out over Long Island Sound.  After about 105 seconds it too faded away in identical fashion.   No equipment used in this observation.  9:45PM was the end of this group of sightings.<n>

When I suddenly heard a series of very loud “popping” sounds, similar to the sound fireworks make, but with a more mechanical almost engine-like sound to them.  This sound sparked my curiosity, and I went into my back yard to see if I could see any fireworks going off, as this was the only logical explanation I could think of, even though this weekend is not one where fireworks are traditionally set off in Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no fireworks seen, which was surprising as from the volume of the strange mechanical popping sounds, they would have to have been nearby, and therefore in my eyesight.  While searching the sky for fireworks, I spotted a single bright orange solid glowing light travelling across the sky at a very fast rate.  Assuming it was a meteor, or a comet I continued to watch it fly across the night sky, expecting it to fall or burn out during the time I could see it.  The mysterious light did not fall or burn out, and appeared to be ascending into the sky just as it was getting out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When the third met the equal altitude as the others they all slowly rose up and faded away.  Note:  There was no noise of helicopter blades or any engines.I have a video on my cell phone of the event.<n>

It  followed a sound similar to a firework going off. We stepped outside assuming they were indeed fireworks but what we saw was something quite strange.  Three globe like lights moved at a moderate pace over our back yard. They were not very high in the air almost as if they were balloons that someone had just released.  However, there appeared to be a flame inside of the orb and it was surrounded by a reddish - orange globe. We watched it as it travelled past our home at which point we lost sight of the 3 objects.   Shortly there after, another object appeared, flying somewhat faster and higher but in the same direction.  This time we followed it to our front yard where we continued to watch it ascend into the sky when it quickly disappeared.   While writing this note, my husband than alerted me to another light floating in the air but at a much greater distance! . The object appeared to hover over the horizon, flickering like a ball of fire but not moving.  After several minutes, it finally moved to the south slowly out of our sight line.   My husband and I are both educated with graduate degrees in the healthcare industry, my parents are retired church going individuals and my two young children in early grade school are now very concerned about what they saw.   We are not looking to draw attention to ourselves. What we saw was not scary but rather inexplicable.  We have never seen anything like this we are just very curious to know what those lights might have been.<n>

We watched them for about five minutes until they went behind the clouds and disappeared, just about one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It traveled some,then disappeared. Then there were 3 flying in format, then disappeared. Then 5 objects ,then disappeared.  There objects kept appearing and disappearing.  There was no sound. i guess they could be helicopters as a logical explanation, but because they were so big, then disappearing and reappearing,then disappearing,then very high up in the sky, then low to the ground in seconds, they looked very odd. Tonight there was a full moon out. I wished there was not otherwise we may have called the cops. I swear on my fathers grave,every thing i say is true.<n>

He pulled over and exited his car to get a better look, the fireballs appeared to be hovering in the sky and coming together in formation.  A neighbor pulled his car behind my husband&#39;s vehicle, exited, and asked &amp;quot;What the hell is that?&amp;quot;  In complete awe my husband answered &amp;quot;I have no idea, never seen anything like it before!&amp;quot;   My husband got back into his vehicle drove the few yards to our parking lot, exited his vehicle a second time, looked up and could see only one of the red/orange fireballs remaining, as it headed off up into the sky in a Northwest direction.

It moved westerly over our house. The craft was several miles above the house. It almost looked like a spot light except it moved fast out of range for a spotlight as it kept moving west. It was an oval shape with a blue light in the center.  the outside of the oval had a frosty appearance and almost looked like a light flying under a light cloud cover but there were no clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing over our house the craft flew at warp speed into the horizon and was gone.  I have never seen anything move so fast. Everyone that sawit described exactly the same thing.  There was no red beacon light that is required on all aircraft.

When I looked up in the sky and saw six white lights in a semi-circle, with red lights on the top and the bottom. I was thinking it was a few lights too many for a plane but I didn&#39;t think much of it. I looked up again not more then 5-10 seconds later and it was gone. Between the extra lights and speed of which it disappeared made me think that &amp;quot;Hey maybe this isn&#39;t a conventional aircraft&amp;quot;<n>

The object was flying at a much lower altitude than any aircraft of that size normally would.  The object was making a sound that sounded like a fan buffeting air.  The noise was loud enough to be clearly heard, and grew louder as the object approached.  The object was shaped like a triangle, with a red light on the front tip and one white light on each back tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was directly in front of me it turned East, moving straight towards me as it lowered its altitude and its speed.  When it was less than a football field away from me it suddenly turned Southeast, quickly accelerating its speed and moving out of my field of vision.  Several black helicopters were seen in the area for the remainder of the night and the following day.<n>
9/2/12 01:20|Puerto Vallarta (Mexico)||Disk|40 minutes|Off the balcony of our hotel in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, my fiancé and myself observed 4 bright orange lights.  Others appeared, too.|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92901.html|714|ndxe201209| At approx. 0120 hrs on September 2, 2012, off the balcony of our hotel in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, my fiancé and myself observed four bright orange lights, at almost eye level, climbing out over the ocean approximately 3 to 5 miles from our location.  The objects did not appear to be in any sort of formation.  No noise of any sort was heard from these objects as the sound of the waves could be heard in the distance.  Our balcony faced almost due west.  These objects to my observance were heading approximately southwest 230 degrees.  Thunderstorms were in the area that evening with a great deal of lighting and precipitation.  At the time of observation of the objects the thunderstorms had dissipated and high thin overcast was observed at the time of appearance.  We observed the four bright orange objects slowly accelerate away at approximately 200-300 knots up into the high thin overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner than they disappeared, two more of the same objects appeared to be coming from the surface of the water and traveling the same flight path.  We watched them fly into the overcast. Then another appeared.  At the sighting of the fifth or sixth object, my fiancé stepped into the room and retrieved her binoculars.  I was able to observe the object as it too traveled roughly the same path.  I did mention to her that the objects appeared to have been coming from the ocean to then being airborne.  The description of the object in the binoculars was bright orange with the appearance of dark vertical lines encircled around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shoreline of our view curved in such a way that I can estimate our distance from the object to be 3-5 miles due to the fact that the farthest land mass was in my estimation to be 8 to 10 miles.  The objects again appeared to be closer to our half way point from that farthest land mass.  In about 35 to 40 minutes we observed a total of twelve of these bright orange objects all originating from the same location close to the shoreline and just above the water surface.  Movement of the objects was initially slow then accelerating to what I would say was about 300 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a captain of a major airline based in DFW  employed with them for almost 27 years.  I spent 10 years as a fighter pilot in the USAF.  What I described of my observance of these objects was based on my 37 years in aviation as a pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with this witness, and we conclude that he is an exceptionally qualified, and reliable, witness.

We thought maybe it was a air craft aiding the burn area..However, the fire was almost 99% contained..  As well as, this large light appeared to be changing colors..in a pattern..It went from red to blue to green to white..It continued turning these colors..  We got out some binoculars, to check it out.. We were on the Northeast side of Colorado Springs(bout 10-15miles away)  Once we got it into a more clearer focus, we could see that it seemed to have a disk- like shape..  Two of my boyfriends neighbors approached us with the same curiosity of this glowing object..  They too, had been watching this odd light..which was stationary the whole time we were watching it!! After bout 15mins or so of observing it, we started to walk back to my boyfriends house.  Then, my boyfriend&amp;I saw this red star-like! light in front of us, a few hundred feet in the air , appear out of nowhere!!  It traveled (quickly)up at a 90 degree angle, then moved erractically.and then disappeared!! 20 mins later we were leaving his house..and saw the strange light above the mountain range was gone!! Needless to say, in the passed 3months or so, I&#39;ve encountered about 8 or more different bizarre&amp;unexplainable sightings in the night sky!!! In a sense,all this slightly worries me because several of my friends have also had encounters frequently as well..!! In this case, the &amp;quot;unknown,&amp;quot; makes me a lil vexed!!! :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There was a bright light hovering about half a mile away. The light started to move towards us a pretty quick rate of speed. Then the light suddenly stopped in place for a second about a quarter mile away and started to descend. While descending the first time it started to flicker then disappeared behind some houses. After a brief moment it started to rise again. The second time it starts to descend it starts to flicker and about half way down the light turns off. We thought it had disappeared but my wife noticed the dark black shape of the object in front of a cloud. While descending we saw the dark black shape of the object move slightly right until it was out of sight again. We stood outside looking to see if it was to rise ! again but after almost an hour, with goose bumps all over we said good bye and they took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After making our purchase at the store we noticed another ufo on the other side of town that was also illuminating.  Employees of the grocery store and other pedestrians also observed this flying object.  On our walk home we noticed triangulations of illuminating lights and packs of them all over the sky.   There had to be 15-20 of them at least.  There were also low flying small airplanes underneath these ufo&#39;s that looked like they were either keeping tabs on them or surveying them. Never getting too close to these objects ofcourse. This has been going on alot recently in the skies of eugene and nobody seems to want to talk about it.<n>

There were flashing lights, Red, Green,  Blue, and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane flew between myself and the object. It is possible to have seen it as well.

We assumed that it was because of clouds so we kept watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes passed (approx. 5 min) and I noticed it again. This time it was about an inch to the right from where we first saw it. We watched it for little while longer until it disappeared again (approx. 10 min). I kept watching for it to reappear but my wife went on to bed. I then saw it reappear about 10 minutes later. This time it seemed to be further away and lower to the! horizon approximately ½ inch above a small set of trees. I kept watching until it disappeared again. I kept watch for about 30 minutes and it never reappeared.<n>

We got to our hotel around 7:30-8:00 pm we got settled in and then decided to go get something to eat. After we ate we walked back through the little carnival that was on Boardwalk on the beach and past a little bar that was supposed to start playing live music at 9pm.  I said to my husband what time is it he said 10:00, we laughed because we thought they didn’t play very long to have to already take a break. Any way we walked onto the beach and took a few pictures came back the band was playing so we stood on the wooden walk way directly behind the small bar a wooden walkway that leads to the beach really close to the Courtyard hotel. So it was probably around 10:30 – 10:45 I turned around to look out at the ocean and noticed a small orangeish light like thing floating around it seemed to float closer to us because it got a bit bigger.  It was floating slowly not fast at all.  A few ot! her people came up on the walk way looking up at it and commenting as to what it was. The light stayed floating and looked like it was floating away from us because it appeared to get smaller and smaller until it was just gone.  My husband said it looked like something flying that had been light on fire not flaming but like one big ember and it floated until it went out.  There was no one with any fires anywhere on the beach or in the area.  When it finally went out there were several people standing around where we were about 10 or 12.  Not sure what it was but I can’t find anything or any way to explain it. So I decided to look it up and found that several other people on the East coast have seen the same thing. I took two pictures of it if you want them<n>

Sky was very overcast with low cloud cover; only a handful of stars were visible directly above, no stars could be seen in the direction of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went northeast from north Windham to west Auburn, NH, in 40 seconds.  The light flickered and then faded out in 5 seconds; the distance travelled in this fade-out was very long.  One minute in total duration, no sound, no strobe/safety lights. It had no tail like a meteor and kept rising up and northeast, away from the Manchester Airport.  Three witnesses observed this object in a clear night sky.  The aura of the object revealed a concave disc outline when at its lowest altitude in Windham.  I called the FAA and no private or commercial planes were in that area at 10pm.<n>

I saw a bright light shining down thru the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I though it was a helicopter for our local hospital that transports patients from the community campus to their main campus. But this light was bright and shining down.  I then thought perhaps it was a police helicopter looking for someone but in our area, I have never seen that happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw the red lights, several of them.  I called for my husband that ran outside with me. We saw several triangles in formation.  The last light was red and appeared to be trailing behind the others that were in formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have to guess that there were 7 objects that each had a formation of three lights that were at the front of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because you are in shock when you see something like this, we stood there for a moment.  Then I ran in and got my Cannon camera and was able to capture at least one of the objects on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time took maybe 5 minutes, maybe a little longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were coming from the South and heading across the Lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another person in a nearby city also reported the same thing we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a video to share.<n>

We were sitting on the deck in our backyard. My wife first noticed the lights in the sky just above and to the left of our neighbors tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She pointed it out to the rest of us and we all looked up. We saw two orange lights about the size of a quarter . There was no noise, there were perfectly still. We observed them for about  one minute. Then a third orange light came from the south and joined the other two to form a triangle of lights. We watched the three of them for a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then moved in unison a little towards the east, stopped and remained for about a minute. Then the light at the top of the triangle started to move away and began to fade. The remaining two lights moved again to the left and remained there for another minute, and then a second one moved away and faded like the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another minute, the third light moved away and faded the same way as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest event we have ever witnessed. My son who was at a friend’s home in the same area also observed these light and managed to take a picture of two of them on his cell phone. He will keep this as evidence of our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

My 13 year old son pointed to the sky and said &amp;quot;what is that mom?!? Is that a UFO?!?&amp;quot;  I thought he was joking, but when I looked where he was pointing there was a triangular shaped very bright lighted, what looked to be like some sort of vehicle. At first I assumed it must be a helicopter or a plane, but there were no flashing red lights on it and it was flying much to low to be a plane. Plus it was a very bright blue and it seemed like the whole thing was lit up. I was still skeptical that it could possibly be wa UFO. But then it started to fly very strangely, like nothing I had ever in my 38 years before. It seemed to fly in a figure 8 pattern and then it dipped down below some trees in the distance, blocking our view. At this point I thought we had possibly witnessed a small airplane crash.  Suddenly it came back up from beneath the view of the trres and began to fly erratically again.  A few mi! nutes later it dipped below the trees and our view once again.  We kept watching for it to reappear, even walked around the corner of the neighborhood to see if we could see it again but it never reappeared.   Also, it was much to large to be some sort of remote control aircraft someone might use to fly for fun.  Unexplainable.<n>

We are around two blocks east of Sawmill Rd., so we were relatively close to this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was of a reddish orange tint which appeared to be sourced from the center of the craft and illuminating the rest of the object defining the shape, but not creating a “glow” beyond it&#39;s dimensions. The illumination could be be compared to a Chinese Lantern or a Christmas luminary. The light was not flickering, pulsating or blinking at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first noticed the object, it appeared to be 1 &amp; ½ times the size of a Cessna airplane, approx. 200 feet above the ground, and moving around 20 mph in a straight south to north path. Our view was unobstructed for approx. one minute before the object passed behind a large tree which completely blocked our view for approx. 2 minutes. We positioned ourselves from where we were originally at to get a better view for when the object reemerged from behind the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were able to see the object again, it was heading in a northwestern direction, had put more distance between us and itself, and had taken on more of a ball shape, and appeared to be smaller than when we first saw it. The color had also changed slightly taking on more of a red tint and was also pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to head in a northwest direction, it had picked up speed comparable to a small aircraft, and raised slightly in altitude. We then jumped in a car attempting to follow the object. Since we could only go West or North by road, we were only able to travel for a couple miles before we could no longer see it due to the distance between us and it, and the amount of large trees obstructing our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They turned just like the wings of a plane until they turned so much they were one ontop of the other then they seperated.  I watched one fly away at an angle and at the end of it you could see flares coming out just like a rocket taking off until it dissapeared into the sky<n>

Ran around the garage down the street, seen more coming at me from the East they got about 3 to 5 miles away and turned South, some were chasing each other, up and down, slow moving, some faster. Then more came and more clusters of 5 to 7 then 1 to 3 then 1 by 1 by them self’s all in the same pattern following each other. Took video and still photos with my phone. No noise, no red or green light like a plane. I’m a pilot, could not believe what I was seeing. Big balls of light amber only<n>

I was on the porch (open type) looking to see if there were any lightening storms that might be seen coming our way as I like to take photos of lightening.  It was cloudy but puffy clouds that had openings or space between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something made me look up and I saw something that looked like flat black metal coming very slowly cruising above the clouds.  I saw it for about 2 minutes as it came out of one cloud and into another.  I could not believe an airplane could fly that low and have absolutely no sound.  No sound at all and no lights unless they were on top of the ship but I didn&#39;t see any beams of light in the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i thought it must have been huge because I saw a large section of this ship and there was not one bolt or screw to be seen.  Yes it was low enough that I would have seen that. It dawned on me then what it probably was.  I looked out by hanging over the porch railing to see if I could see where it was going and what shape it was.  That was when I realized it was coming back towards me, from the other end of our long porch.  I thought to myself how could such a big ship turn around that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got very nervous and stepped away from the railing of the porch to the side of the house, waited about four minutes and looked again.  It was gone. I realized only later that duh an alien ship probably does not have any screws or bolts if their ships are of high technology like the experts say.  So it may not have been as big as I thought but it sure scared me.  I don&#39;t go out on the porch anymore if those puffy clouds with space between them are up above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dog was very nervous and panting and I thought she felt a lightening storm coming. After the ship disappeared, she eventually calmed down.  I also had my camera with me but I was so floored by what I saw initially and then becoming frightened,  I didn&#39;t take any photos and have been kicking myself about that since then.<n>

We noticed 3 very bright orange fiery orbs in a vertical line formation in the sky directly above us.  We then noticed four more orbs to the right of the three orbs.  It formed an arrow like shape pointing to the right.  We exited the freeway within 2 minutes and parked.  We looked in the sky and noticed only one orb left.  We video taped it as it was descending back up and then disappeared into the sky.  It happened in a matter of 3-5 minutes.<n>

It &#34;floated&#34; briskly horizontally across the sky.  This was definitely not a reflection, it was a self illuminated vibrant blue orb - not really a light because it was so defined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has left a strong impression on me because it was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We pulled over to the side of the road to observe. They appeared to be fireball like with red around them.  They were flying/moving  below  fairly  low cloud cover created by remnants of hurricane Issac.  No noise whatsoever was coming from these objects.  One fireball disappeared into the clouds and the other stopped, changed direction, then started moving  east. This fireball then disappeared into the clouds after it passed us.  As this one disappeared, 3 more appeared from behind us moving west, passed us, then disappeared up into the clouds.  They did not to appear to be moving very fast to us. We have never encountered or seen anything like this before. My grandson got very scared and we tried to put it off to him as airplanes.  There was another car going east  that stopped to observe also.  They got out of their car for a coupl! e of minutes but left before we could talk to them.<n>

That light remained constant for about 5 minutes when a solid light descended from sky to near the same area as the solid green light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white light began moving in different directions very erratically and at times making oblong circles.   I would say that it would travel within 15 degrees above, and below the solid green almost instantly.  Closest way to describe its behavior would be like someone trying to film an object in the sky with a shaky hand or a meteorite moving and stopping and changing directions hundreds of times.  Moved faster than I have ever seen something move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event ended when the erratic! light stopped and then shot down towards the horizon and green lights appeared to begin moving north easterly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire group of people within our dunes area were watching this.  I would suspect that anyone in the park who was looking in the sky would have seen this.  White Sands National Park stays open late on full moon nights which is why everyone was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have a high definition video camera but could not zoom in or out enough to cancel the glare of the moon directly to the left of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A reader called our attention to this report, which we apparently had not read carefully enough.  He points out that the White Sands National facility is in New Mexico, not Arizona, as first reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the Moon does not appear in the northern sky.  Its orbit around the Earth, which does not change its plane or direction, translates to the fact that it cannot appear in the northern sky.  PD))<n>

I noticed a light in the sky and originally thought it was a low-flying airplane.  The light coming from the craft was yellow and white in color and it actually kind of looked like I was seeing it on a foggy day because the light was hazy, but still bright enough to get my attention.  As I was looking at it, I realized it wasn&#39;t an airplane because it was kind of just hovering there.  So I concluded it was a helicopter.  But then it started to move smoothly to the left, then the right, then dip down on an angle and then then up. I was asking myself out loud: &amp;quot;what the hell is that?&amp;quot; over and over again.  As I was driving, just before I came to a line of trees, it turned.  I then was able to see the underside of it ... it was triangle in shape with lots of bright, bright white lights.  Then the trees got in the way.  When I finally passed through the trees, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both aircraft seperated in formation to begin areial manouvers of independent origin.  At first these manouvers seemed to be something that could only be achieved by a smaller remote control aircraft, tight and close quarter turns, loops and various synchronized aerobatics. As I was traveling at a rate of sixty-five miles an hour, I had to concentrate on driving while still trying to observe the aircrafts. Leaving the boundries of Rocklin and heading east towards Lincoln, I turned right onto Sterling Parkway and made the first right into a stripmall parking lot with a fairly unobstructed view to the southeast where I could observe the crafts. I watched as the aircraft which only appeared as ! a single color of white then turning to red was joined by a third craft now engaging ib the same acrobatic flight patterns as the other two.  Other observerers pulled into the stripmall parking areas but observed from different vantage points.  Another vehichle pulled up by my car and we observed the air-ballet together. We both noted that crafts each only had a single light that changed colors at intermitten intervals. ( Which were compared to other aircraft  that would randomly pass overhead  with traditional blinking red and white lights found on todays aircraft. We noted we did not know of anytype of aircraft that could make those sort of manouvers short of an Apache or AH-6 Littlebird yet even though they were at a guesstimated five miles or further away, no sounds were heard. After twenty minutes observing the crafts, they dropped below the horizon not to be seen again. After waiting a short period to see if they would return, they did not and the woman and her daughter! said they were returning to their home in Paradise to watch t! he late news to see of any reportings as I said I would also do. KCRA channel 3 news reported nothing of the sightings.<n>

I have thought about it frequently since it happened.  It occurred on a summer day in the evening. I was sitting on my balcony watching the sunset in western skies.  Something dark in the sky caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was a v-shaped craft slowly heading east.  It was about the size of a regular commercial airplane.  It wasn&#39;t very high at all and I was able to see it clearly. as it passed over my apartment I rushed inside to grab my binoculars and headed to my back balcony.  As I looked thru the binoculars the first thing I noticed was that a dark blue light traveled on the sides of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that it had a slow spin to it.  Which now when I reflect I find very strange.  You would think the craft being v shaped would fly with the nose pointing to the direction it&#39;s heading.  This was not the case making it not normal flight.  This craft was hovering and rotating slowly traveling from west to east.  One final detail is that this thing made absolutely no noise at all.  Being that low in altitude it should have made engine noise. I watched it heading north east until i lost sight of it.   live very close to ohare airport and see many planes at low altitudes.  This was not a plane nor a helicopter.  This craft was truly unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I couldn’t immediately see the source of the light because the frequency of the blinking was not regular.  Two to three seconds passed and then it blinked again.  The object had moved above 6-8 inches (measured from my extended arm).  The intensity and size of the light was about equal to the average star.  A few seconds later it blinked again, moving about the same distance, and in a straight line moving towards the North East.  This time the intensity of the light was greater, about equal to the light of Venus, which also gave the impression that it was larger or moving downward.  A few more seconds passed and the light blinked again, much fainter (fainter than the first blink), and the object had moved in a Northern direction (up from its previous direction), and the distance was about 2-3 inches (measured from my extended arm).  I followed that! trajectory, anticipating the next blink.  As I scanned the area about 5 seconds later, I saw a faint streak of light moving from the last location of the object (approximately) and moving in an Easterly direction (slightly south of east).  I scanned the sky for several more minutes but saw nothing else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The length of the entire incident was approximately 30 seconds.  And the object was located approximately 65 - 75 degrees above the horizon, as I was looking toward the North.  There was no sound.  There were no obstructions in my field of vision.  And it was a perfectly clear evening, and visibility was excellent.  I had the impression that the object was very far away.  The blinking of the light changed in intensity, and its blinking was an irregular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stepped out of my shop to observe and immediately after a flash of lightning i saw 10 black or dark objects in a triangle formation,4 on top,3 on next level,then 2 then 1. The objects disappeared quickly after the flash.  At first I attributed the objects to my eyes being affected by the flash but then 8 seconds later another flash of lightning occurred and the same formation appeared close to where the previous formation was sighted.  Both sightings were near the top of well-known lone mountain with flat terrain on all sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Just before it would have gone out of sight, it appeared to slow down, dim twice and then disappeared. The whole thing took about a minute. It never changed color but did seem to get brighter and change shape at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1 hour later my husband and I saw another one much farther north. Probably over the lake (Lake Erie). This one was amber colored  also, but it changed to red on and off. It was moving in the same direction as the first and at the same height and speed. There was no sound for either one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My cat was in the window and I went over to pet him.  I looked out of the window and saw three fireballs, all in a horizontal row.  They were as clear as can be, and quite low.  Then they just flew across the sky.  I went to the window on another wall and saw that they had gone over some trees in the distance.  But at first there were only two there.  I watched as one deliberately spaced itself on top of, but not touching, the other.  The next thing that happened was the third fireball zipped around the corner of the house, also, and then they were all together again, over the trees.  Of course, eventually, the trees made it harder to see them, but I could see enough to see that they were still there.  I actually got in my car to try to see where they went, but I was so excited, I took a few wrong turns.  Finally I saw one in a field off of highway 180, and it didn&#39;t appear to be as lit up.  I did not see ! the other two, so perhaps they had turned off all lights.  I did not have the nerve to try to walk to the one, and so I turned around, went home, and talked about it on Facebook.  I had never even heard of fireballs.  I had heard of metal saucers.  I looked on the internet, and sure enough, the fireballs existed, seemingly more in later years.  I really did not want to believe in UFO&#39;s, but after what I saw, I have no choice.<n>

I was located outside of the city,overlooking the river valley at a fairly high elevation and it appeared low above the water and was a substantial size given my distance to the river and its size. It was much larger then an aircraft and was silent and although changed altitude and directions many times they appeared smooth to be smooth transitions and rose at in increasing altitude and proceed up the river valley and towards our metro city<n>

Thought it was an airplane at first but the lights were moving very, very slow, almost hovering and were traveling in the direction of where my dad and I were, towards the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Guessing when we first spotted them they were about a mile out, and it took a long time to approach where we were.  We were outside sitting on a deck (uncovered) and the lights were not near the ground at all, but not quite airplane altitude - close enough to know they were not floating lanterns.  When they got very close they flew (high) overhead but it was quiet, and was not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up you could still see the stars in-between the pattern of the lights - no shadow like you would see with a low-flying plane at night.  It was very eerie - did not know what to make of it.  I have never seen anything so bizarre and fascinating in my life. Had I not seen that there was transparency between the lights and stars, I would have just thought it was military related since that area isn&#39;t too far away from the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Above Earths Surface Without Sound|9/24/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/092/S92366.html|766|ndxe201209| Bright Starlike Orbs Slowly Move down to 50-100FT. Above Earths Surface Without Sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were at the Westwind Drive-In, in Concord, CA, when as we were waiting to have our battery jumped, I had nothing better to do, but to look up at the aircraft that were coming in for a landing, or just taking off, as the drive in is located right next to the small airport, when I noticed two starlike objects that were just hoovering about 200 feet above the earths surface and heard no noise.  After getting my vehicle started, I left and entered Hwy. 4, as I got into the slow lane, one of the objects moved down to about 50 feet above the freeway and once again, I heard zero noise and it appeared triangular, with three points and was just one color and extremely bright, white light.  Then, as I began to move down the freeway, towards Brentwood, these two lights, moved back up to about 300 feet and began pulsing, and even having flashing red lights, my children were in the car with me and saw it too and began getting scared when we saw the triangular shape and heard no noise whatsoever!  These continued to travel down Hwy. 4, until one finally settled, hoovering at around 375 feet, at where appears to be downtown Bethel Island and the other, at about 150 feet above the old farm that is at the end of Sellers Avenue, near Iron House Elementary School. I have seen these things turn into a grey gassy orb as well, but these seem to just go back to being singularly bright and hoovering.  I guess besides wondering what these things are,  where they came from, and what they want with us, I guess I&#39;m just wondering why the United States Government isn&#39;t doing anything about this! I&#39;ve seen all sorts of videos on You Tube that have these exact things in them all over the world, the videos that are the most puzzling to me though are where NASA astronauts saw these things a long time ago and is being told by Houston to just ignore them.  Can these things hurt us?  This isn&#39;t my families first time seeing them and there really isn&#39;t anyone ! to call to report it to, with the exception of the local polic! e, who w ill more than likely think that you&#39;re some sort of nut.  I&#39;ve had four adults and one child in my family see them now, that have always believed that besides GOD, that we are alone and did not believe in any sort of aliens!  We now know that we are definitely not alone and are beginning to get worried, is anyone else?  I feel like I want to start some sort of chapter or something, but am not sure how much good that would do, it doesn&#39;t appear as though we would have any sort of defense against these things anyway, if they should become agressive at some point!<n>

I was texting my boyfriend at the time.  He has had many encounters with UFOs, with the biggest encounter, having his name written in sky on the beach with a witness.  He was begging me to pick him up all evening as he claimed he was expecting a visit and had done so by using his self discovered &#34;Reiki&#34; ability and self taught remote viewing principles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was explaining the weird sensation and the loss of power I stepped out my front door and as I looked down the street towards the beach I witnessed this huge disc shape craft at almost street level hovering a few feet higher than the Bicycle street sign one block away.  He asked me if it had the distinct smell of bumper cars and it did 100%.  You could hear this low deep hum in an in and out pattern as if it were rotating at a very rapid pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was illuminating a bright blue/purple glow.  I stood in awe.  He texted, &#34;TAKE A Photo before gathering myself to take the picture.  I still have if you would like to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have both, since then, taken more pictures and videos from the area of my first sighting.
