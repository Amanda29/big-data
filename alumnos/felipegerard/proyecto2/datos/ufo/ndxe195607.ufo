7/15/56 00:00|Yellowstone Park (near South entrance)|WY|Disk|60 sec|Three year old boy witnesses from back the seat of a car the approach of three flying disks.|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02335.html|2|ndxe195607| Summary : Three year old boy witnesses from back the seat of a car the approach of three flying disks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending this because I your site I found out that there was a UFO flap in 1956.  Until today I was unaware of this.In the summer of 1956 my parents and I lived in Wyoming.  They decided to go to Yellowstone and it was there that I saw what I am telling you now.  Even though I was three I recall much about the trip because Yellowstone was such a special place.  I think my parents were probably very impressed so it stuck in my mind.  Anyway we had spent the night parked along the road, not in a camp ground or in a cabin.  My mother recalled that it had been a very spooky night, very dark.  As we left the park the next day we traveled south along a narrow highway.  We were in a black Hudson, and I was laying in the back window-well (it was my favorite place to ride on long trips).  As I looked up at the sky and trees I saw three objects coming up from behind us about 100 feet above us.  They followed behind the car staying in between the trees that lined both sides of the road.  I remember I had seen them as we were coming around a curve.  They looked like metal painted orange with yellow rib!s on their undersides.  Each was a disk about 20 feet wide and on top was a dome with a large glass or window.  In each was a human like figure.  One disk pulled away while the other two closed in on the car dropping to about 30 feet altitude.  The disk nearest the car tilted downwards at an angle so that I could see the pilot clearly.  In my three year old memories I recall thinking of the pilot in the lead craft as a HELICOPTER PILOT wearing dark sun-glasses.  My family at that time was too poor to go to movies and we did not own a TV, so the only thing I could relate the objects to were helicopters.  I waved at the pilot and he held up his left hand palm facing me and waved his hand kind of slowly back and forth.  I jumped down into the back seat and leaned over to tell my parents that there were HELICOPTERS behind us.  They looked out the windows but the objects were gone.  All I recall is that they didn&#39;t really question me about it much and dropped it.  This memory alway!s stayed with me and was never forgotten.  I didn&#39;t dwell on it but every time I saw our Yellowstone pictures or recalled the trip I also recalled the 3 crafts.  However it wasn&#39;t until I was about 10 that it suddenly dawned on me (being older and wiser) THOSE WERE NOT HELICOPTERS!  DO you know it was not until last year (1996) that it suddenly dawned on me that those guys might not have been wearing sunglasses.  Last year I did a little study and began to notice that appearances of 3 saucers with the outlines I had seen also seemed to turn up in other areas.  But there is more to my story.  neither of my parents recalled the incident (which seems normal since at the time I had told them it was helicopters and hence it wouldn&#39;t have been something to stick in their memory for several years.  Note: in about 1989 my mother called me in a panic one day to tell me a dream she&#39;d had (my mother almost never recalled dreams and claimed she never dreamed).  She told me that she had dr!eamed that a UFO was over her house and that beings were coming into her bedroom and surrounding her.  But she said she woke up to hear a real noise over her house: it was a National Guard helicopter (there was a helicopter training base north of town: Norman Okla.).  What I wondered about was the connection of the helicopter noise to the intense UFO dream she was having.<n>

It was a perfect summer day, and I was with my mother outside the kitchen door of our home.  I was with two friends and we were discussing the subject of lunch with my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us looked up, pointed, and we all looked up over Lake Pocotopaug, into a cloudless sky.  We observed about six silver discs (flying saucers) flying in a loose formation. They were absolutely silent.  There were no obstructions in our view of them.  It was an amazing sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that age, I was not yet exposed to science fiction, and this was all new to me.  The craft floated (for lack of a better word) at a speed of perhaps several hundred miles an hour (relatively slow) towards us, then turned left out of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterward we all discussed what we saw, agreed we all saw the same thing, and then my mother, ((name deleted)), told all of us that we should not discuss what we saw.  At that age we obeyed, but I never got to query my Mom about the incident before she died.  It was such an important event in my life that I have always remembered it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 58 years old today, and I want to submit this report today, before my recollection is forever lost.  It also may be substantiated by other viewings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In respect to the craft themselves, the were saucer like with bubble tops.  It&#39;s almost embarrassing to report this as modern fiction has capitalized on this vision.  The craft were basically silver but with colors of red and blue.  I used to know where all the colors of red and blue were, but I have forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using my experience at the time, I used to say that the edges of the craft were wavy like the heat coming off a hot summer asphault(sp) road.  I now watch on TV theories of gravitation, etc. and see similar results.  All I can say is that for my craft, they were solid objects with fuzzy edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My good buddy at the time, Michael XXXXX, was with me, and I have no contact with him, nor do I know if he ever made a sighting report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was silvery in appearance, without any markings and did not display any join lines or riveting, as do conventional aircraft skins.  It appeared to have a fluted exhaust at the rear, with a long silvery contrail egressing from it. What appeared to be windows around the upper edge of the disc were all lighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving far slower than any aircraft should have been and was not &#34;spinning.&#34; It also was not making any noise at all.  The attitude of the craft was such that it appeared that it wanted to be seen, and seen it was because every car in that drive in was emptied and the occupants were standing, staring at the sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As suddenly as it had appeared, the contrail blinked completely out and all the windows darkened. It was visible for only seconds after that and quicker than the mind can imagine, it was gone. It didn&#39;t appear to speed away, it just vanished.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object approached Edmondton, Alberta Airports main hanger and flew over it low, slowly and silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a light plane pilot. At the time of this experience I was about 25 years old and I had about 150 hours of flying time. I was at this time also employed with an airline and had been for about two years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying my plane from Minnesota to Anchorage, Alaska. I landed at Edmondton, Alberta and cleared with the Royal Canadian Air Force, getting briefed and permission to fly their airspace via the ALCAN highway. Just after sundown on 12 July, 1956, I was lying under the wing of my plane, half inside a sleeping bag, watching a plane shooting takeoffs and landings. As the plane landed and taxied into the hanger, I saw a blinking light approaching just above the hanger. I thought what is this idiot doing out of the traffic pattern. I sat up in my sleeping bag and watched as it grew closer. It looked so very low and as it got over the hanger I saw that it was round and the lights were not blinking, but the object was wobbling back and forth and this gave the illusion of the lights blinking. There was no sound. When directly over the main hanger, it appeared to be huge. I would say a few hundred feet in diameter. It was impossible to actually judge the size for I could not tell the altitude even though it looked to be no more than 100 feet above the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shucked out of my sleeping bag and turned on the ignition in my plane to radio the control tower, but the radio was completely dead, not even static. I then took a rough compass bearing and watched and timed the object as it passed over us. It went about due west, blinking all of this time for 20 minutes when it made roughly a 90 degree right turn and accelerated and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to call the tower again on my radio, and I was able to get through to them, but then decided I had better not report this information or I might be held up from leaving for Alaska for several days, or maybe even be refused permission to continue my trip. So I said nothing. The next morning I took off for my next days destination, Calgary, AB.<n>
