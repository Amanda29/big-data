8/15/52 17:30|Prairie Grove|AR|Disk|00:20|Two observers saw silverish 30 foot disk maneuver above and below horizon at hover and supersonic speeds.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13103.html|2|ndxe195208| Two observers saw silverish 30 foot disk maneuver above and below horizon at hover and supersonic speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew slowly up Cove Creek Valley south of Prairie Grove, below the horizon as viewed from Skylight Mountain.  It maneuvered in random but controlled fashion, both above and below the horizon, into and out of a storm cloud.  It ranged in speed from a      stop hover to making a 5 mile circle in 5 seconds.  The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, solid, silverish white.  Most of the maneuvers were between the towns of Lincoln and Prairie Grove.  It eventually entered the storm cloud and did not re-emerge.  At that time I was 13 years old.   The other observer was a 45 year old World War II air combat veteran.  Since I have completed a Navy career aboard carriers and air stations.  Neither of ever saw an aircraft that could execute the moves this object did.<n>

Two rows of green windows with movement within the windows. Reported to a Wahashington DC address upon the advice of the tower at Randiolph AFB. Received and answer about one month later thanking me for the observation. Viewed a very bright light that lit up the hill as if were noon. Took off without a sense of acceleration at an extremely high speed after hovering for about 20 minutes. Made no sound. Mnay other details were reported in my 5-page letter to the address in Washington DC.

8/15/52|Peterborough (Canada)|ON|Disk||a dark object came down out of the dark cloud, leveled off and shot up through the cloud|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14894.html|4|ndxe195208| a dark object came down out of the dark cloud, leveled off and shot up through the cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> August,1952 Location: Fairly positive I was enroute from Toronto to Petersborough, Ontario, Canada, possibly heading northerly on route 115. Conditions: Daytime, low dark clouds, flat land on left side of highway leading to distant hill top of which seemed above the clouds. No sunlight visible. Window of car rolled down -no reflections possible. I was not wearing sun glasses. As I was gazing at this scenery a dark object came down out of the dark cloud, leveled off and shot up through the cloud. It&#39;s shape was of the inverted saucer on top of another saucer type. No rudder or wings visible and silent. I shouted to my friend who was from Petersborough, Canada to look. I don&#39;t think he saw it as he wore rather thick glasses and had never driven a car. I would judge the distance from us to the object with the hill in the background to be not more than one mile. I had been in and out of the marines twice. Had observed dive bombings along the western shore of the Red Sea and straffing and bombing in Korea, all these planed clearly had wings and rudders as well as very audible engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

8/1/52 21:30|Tampa|FL|Oval|2 hrs. 30 min.|Triangulation radar fix (USAF, civil, Navy).  I ordered intercept by SAC B-29.  B-29 tracked object. Central fire control system locked|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05082.html|5|ndxe195208| Triangulation radar fix (USAF, civil, Navy).  I ordered intercept by SAC B-29.  B-29 tracked object. Central fire control system locked on, armed itself, prepared to fire.  Object then left area at estimated 4,000 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time noted I was a S/Sgt. in SAC, 2nd AF, 6th Air Div. assigned as ((position deleted.)). Was &#34;volunteered&#34; to join a Captain as investigator of UFOs.  Capt. handled off-base sightings (they were more fun) and I was stuck with military cases. This occurred at MacDill AFB, Tampa. About 9:30 p.m. one night in Aug. 1952 I received a call from the Base Operations officer (a Lt. Col.)  He was a little miffed to be re- porting to an enlisted man but such are the curiosities of the military. The Captain was out of town. The Lt. Col reported that a UFO was cruising over the base at 40,000 feet, 400 knots.  This was serious; we had A-bombs at MacDill. I de- termined there was no civil traffic within 300 miles. The object was being radar tracked by MacDill, the Navy, and Tampa civil. I de- termined there was a B-29 (ours) on a downwind leg to land. He had 5 hours fuel left. I ordered the pilot to up his gear and take a look-see. At midnight the Pilot reported that he had tried to close with the object. He was at 20,000 feet; the object at 40,000. Of course, the B-29 was woefully slow but as he turned toward the UFO his central fire control system radar-locked on the target, armed itself, and prepared to fire.  At that moment the UFO changed course and left the area at an estimated 4,000 knots. Next morning the pilot reported to my office.  He was a full Colonel, a command pilot with 27,000 hours in the air. One of the top men in SAC.  He gave me his preliminary report and said he would send his waist scanner, a M/Sgt., down to supply details. The whole crew saw it....a bright white oval light. A hard radar target. Since I had no orders to the contrary, I printed the story in the base newspaper and offered it to the Tampa newspaper. Believe it or not they turned it down, refusing to print it because the M/Sgt was black!  A.P.  found out and was furious. Sent a man out to get the datails. Another oddity.  Just before the Colonel came to my office I received a TWX from the Pentagon. From a general. It said: &#34;Any of our people who see flying saucers have holes in their heads.&#34;  That Colonel yelled &#34;b((deleted))t&#34; in the loudests and most authoritative tone I&#39;ve ever heard. Eventually the Captain wrote a report of the more than 1,800 sightings we handled. A large number (more than 280) were absolute un- knowns. That report stated that &#34;In our opinion we have no option but to conclude that we are under surveillance by intelligent life of extraterresrial origin,&#34;  I also signed that report. I remember the Captain said: This report will never see the light of day.&#34;  He was right. For the record I served three years in USAF, later worked as a reporter/city editor, and spent 7 years with NBC-TV. I was a reporter/producer of news documentaries and won six national awards including three Emmys.  I&#39;m not a kook. Yet. -((Name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
