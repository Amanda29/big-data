I looked out my launddry room window and saw the most amazing thing i have ever seen . Hanging in the northern sky were a line of blood red brilliant lights. These weren&#39;t flares. It was reported by the radio announcer that these lights manuevered but I didn&#39;t see that. I did see small orbs of brilliant lights emerge from the larger spheres, the main bright lights were reminiscent of the phoenix lights. They formed a gentle arc in the northern sky and drifted slowly to the west. At no time did they descend (as flares would do). As they drifed west they began to wink out . One sphere stayed lit as it drifted out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the date of the event was 12/31/02; we have amended the date.  PD))<n>

They did not vary in distance from one another, nor did they move. The intensity of light would change on each independent of the other, and they faded out independent of one another. Saw something faint stream down as they began to fade. One reappeared independent of the others and continued 3-5 mins(?). Would have guessed that someone launched a New Years&#39; display, but how did they keep them equal distance apart???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this event.

One group, the upper, consisted of three lights at about 20 degrees above the horizon oriented in a vertical formation.  The lower group consisted of six lights more tightly grouped at about 15 degrees above the horizon.  The general location of all the lights was 70 degrees east of magnetic north.  All the lights were were moving slowly in random directions.  All the lights were identical in color and the color was orange-yellow.  The lights looked like bright stars in appearance.  Not as bright as some of the brighter planets on a clear night, but nearly so.  Also, all nine lights were identical in brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights twinkled in appearance as stars do, and they had no discernable shape other than a point of light.  I looked at the lights with a set of binoculars to try to determine a shape and found no change other than being slightly brighter in appearance with less twinkling.  Twice I saw other fainter lights dropping from the larger-brighter lights.  As the viewing period progressed the two groups of lights moved together as one group oriented somewhat vertically on the horizon.  One by one each light vanished toward the end of the viewing period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of these lights behaved like an aircraft or meteor.  They appeared to be hovering and moving up, down, and sideways in a random fashion.  All nine lights behaved independantly of one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses:  Three adults and four children.  All three adults are professed UFO skeptics.  Two of the adults have Bachelor of Science degrees.  One in Mechanical Engineering and the other in Chemistry.  The Mechanical Engineer has been and aviation enthusiast most of his life and is frequently viewing stars and aircraft in the skies.<n>

After watching the object for approximately 3 seconds, it abruptly changed direction (from my perspective, 25-30 degrees difference in heading) and appeared to accelerate.  It then appeared to change direction again, this time appearing to moving out and away from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer: student<n>

This object was like a quarter Moon, with the filled in portion of the Moon at the lower left side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white light and its movement was in a jerky fashion, or at least my visibility of it was jerky.  It was like a series of snapshots in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Always moving in the same direction, always the same altitude (just over the top of a ridge about 500 feet tall).  In comparison to trees, it eventually went behind the object must have been at least 25 feet high, maybe 50.

Three lights in diagnol form flashing in sequence(one light at a time, but rapid). It was obviously one structure and too big to be a plane or aircraft. I observed this ufo for about five to ten minutes(the whole time I observed this, it was statioinary, not moving at all,but hovering). I also observed two helicopters and an aircraft flying in very close proximity to this ufo. I lost track (or the plane and helicopters turned off their lights)of the helicopter and airplane. As I was watching the Ufo, I turned for a moment only to look right back up at the ufo, and it was gone. Imediatly after I noticed the Ufo gone the helicopters and airplane were right back flying where the Ufo was. I thought I saw the UFO reappear, but followed it in my car only to see a clear sky. I drove around franticly, looking for the UFO, but it was nowhere in sight.<n>

The object noiselessly covered a distance of 30 miles in a period of about 10 minutes, passing over the cities of Chandler, South Phoenix &amp; Scottsdale, AZ. It was moving parallel &amp; nearly directly above the Interstate 10 Freeway. The object was observed from the parking lot of the 3 observers place of employment. The object had an irregular flight path, constantly, if only slightly, changing altitude &amp; direction, but moving in a northerly direction. It was observed from a distance of roughly 1 to 3 miles. Due to the clear daylight conditions and close proximity of its observers, as well as the object&#39;s omnidirectional movements, it&#39;s shape was clearly discernable &amp; was not that of any aircraft known to the observers. There was no tail, wings, fuselage or propellers visible. As it maneuvered perpendicular to the earth, its underside was seen to be black. When horizontal, it appeared the have a highly reflective metal surface. There was an intermittent orange glow about it. When 1st sighted (at a distance of 3 to 5 miles, it had a diffused look, reminiscent of a gigantic piece of Saran Wrap, but quickly &amp; unexpectedly assumed a much smaller solid &amp; more circular appearance as it quickly moved closer to the initial observer. At its closest point, relative to the observers, its somewhat bell shaped outline became apparent.<n>

When I reviewed what I taped,I was astonded to see 4 or 5 rotating spheres traveling in a straight line withen the chem trail.<n>

I was driving west on Richmond Beach Road and turned right on Eighth Ave. NW heading north, toward Edmonds.  I&#39;m not sure if I was in the city of Shoreline or Edmonds at this point.  The street I was on has houses on both sides of the street and trees in the background.  There was no traffic that night, so the street was darker than normal.  As I was driving, I noticed some sort of light and looked up and saw a large ball of light, pinkish purple in color.  It was falling down to the ground, but very slowly.  I didn&#39;t know if I was seeing an odd sort of fireworks display or if it was an odd kind of flare.  Since I couldn&#39;t tell where the ball of light was going to land and the area I was driving in was fairly dark and without traffic, I turned around and drove home on a more travelled road.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The witness says, &#34;I kept driving very slowly and trying to see them above the trees, and three miles down the road I spotted a large flying triangle coming toward us a couple hundred feet up.&#34;  My girl friend saw it fly over our vehicle without any noise at all.  It had green, pink, and yellow flashing lights and flew from east to west.  I later talked to someone where I volunteer at the veterans clinic and her brother had seen it also.  Since, then I have had some strange mental images and missing minutes.  I also have a place on my stomach that the skin is very dry and nothing helps to get rid of it.  I have talked to my veterans counselor about the incident.  Thanks to ((three initials deleted)) and Peter Davenport  NUFORC<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just read the brief below, and I though of you since the location is near you. Do you have any additional information on the case or the person who  reported it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> No, and don&#39;t know how except the veteran&#39;s connection. Holden is where I had my ufo experience with the Pleiadians in 1988. One thing, on New Year&#39;s eve, it was snowing very badly, total 14 inches, just after that, so it had to be very overcast. However, pink could be red, white lights on planes can look yellow and that is an approach and takeoff zone from Bangor airport. Holden is southeast of<n> <n><n> Bangor. The wind was from the southeast and the planes take off into the wind and attain speed before they rise into the storm clouds so I think it is a plane and the rest is bullshit, but you never know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time of incident is unknown to us.

I was looking up into the sky when I noticed a very small circular speck up above the clouds.  It seemed to be above the path of normal airplane traffic.  It emitted a bright white light, different from a star though.  there were maybe two or three of them.  They seemed to be moving in logical order and much quicker than the clouds below and the stars.  one would move away from the other two then they would move away also then they would all reconvene in the same location.  When I say the same location I mean that the exact same spot  that they left from.  this continued for around 15-30 minutes.  When we got on the golf cart to go home we were able to amintain visual contact with them until they faded from our sight.  they were very small shaped circles almost more like little dots than spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Light appeared to be rotating or exhibiting a strobe-effect.  Light sped up slightly, turned to the northwest and sped up again.  At that point it was blocked from our view by the house to the north of us.  My husband observed the light for two or three minutes before he told me about it.  At first, it appeared to be about 1/2 to 1 mile away; we opened the door and could not hear any sound.  The sky condition at the time was overcast with low clouds.  It had been raining a few minutes earlier.  Did not observe any stars at that time.  During the sighting, I had time to get my camera with telephoto lens; by the time I got back to the door, the light had moved farther north and I was unable to see any structure.  At first, I would compare the brightness and size to a brakelight at about 500 feet; the brightness did not change, it just got farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live close to the east-west flight path for Lemoore Naval Air Station and also along the flight path for Fresno-Yosemite International Airport.  Neither of us have ever observed anything similar to this, though we have seen other unidentified lights.  We are familiar with satellites and access the Heavens Above website to see what is flying over; did not check tonight due to the storm and cloudiness.<n>

I witnessed a bright white light moving passed other stars.  It was just as big as another star.  The only difference is that it did not flicker like a star.  I was the first to witness this, then my brother and finally my dad.  I lost contact when i got my dad to see it.  They say it zig zagged and was changing colors to a brilliant green and pink.  I didnt see it after i got my dad outside, but they both saw it.  We left because it was too cold.  This was witnessed when i stepped outside my porch to look at the stars looking for ufo&#39;s.  I should have at least taped this, but i guess i was too excited at the time...<n>

It was there in the sky for approximately 5 minutes, and moving but it left no trail. The injection of the fire kind of thing vanished gradually in +/- 30 sec to a black dot. And the sky was clear as if it was never there.  Surprisingly the light or the fire was so bright that it was noticable even at 2:00 in the afternoon. We managed to get a couple of pictures of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hallo Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your reply. But I am almost sure that it is not a jet trail and hence some more clarification would be appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason is that I have been in India near a Military base and have seen lots of jet trails and that&#39;s why I am so sure of the fact that it cannot be a jet trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen the jet trails from lots of aircrafts and am a regular watcher of Wings. So I would really appreciate some more explanation if you could provide so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also as I mentioned it vanished from the air in less than a minute which is quite unlikely for a jet trail since they persist for a longer duration because of the density differences of the water which is<n> <n><n> ejected out and the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks and regards  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

At first I noticed one white dot in the sky, and assumed it was just a lost balloon. However the object did not visibly move for a few minutes. When I looked again, about 3-5 minutes later, I noticed that two other objects of the same size were moving north towards the first one, which had moved slightly south from its original position. The three objets continued towards each other, and within 3-5 minutes eventully formed a triangle, still almost directly above me. Twice during this episode I asked my friend to look at the objects. He did see them the first time, but because of the branches in the tree, could not see them the second time. About 2 or 3 minutes later (the parade was distracting me!) when I looked up again, the three objects had straight-lined themselves, facing in a southwesterly direction, but still moving in a southerly direction, but the movement was almost imperceptable. I could only track the change using a couple of branches for positioning. A couple of minutes later, I could no longer find any of the objects.  During this time, thre were no clouds visible in the sky. I did see a couple of aircraft, including a 727 and an ATR pass overhead, which helped somewhat to better estimate that these objects were extremely high in the sky. Their size from where I stood was not much more than pinpoints. I have to say that I do not follow these sightings, and don&#39;t fully believe in little green men. NO, I am not a Raelian! I do not know who to contact to find out what it was I saw. Could they have been Predator drones practicing maneouvers? I believe they were much too high for small weather balloons, given that I could see them. The aircraft I saw, flew almost directly underneath the objects.<n>

It was very dark out, an overcast of thin clouds with about a 1500 foot ceiling based on the commerical airliners landing at Salt Lake International airport at the south end of the Great Salt Lake.  As I took out my car keys from my jacket, I happened to look up to the north end of the valley and saw several aircraft on final descent to the airport. As I was watching them for a moment, I also noticed what appeared to be three lights (white, red, and another white) horizontal to each other skipping between the landing aircaft.  The unidentified lights traveled from the north end of the valley to what appeared to the the airport in about 10 seconds or less and I estimate the distance to be about 30 miles or so in that 10 seconds.  It did not fly in an straight line, but seemed to hop skip a little above and below as it traveled horizontally.  I think the pilots making their approach may have seen this event as it seemed to be in their line-of-sight.<n>

Since we live in a big city here, I&#39;m absolutely facinated by the dark country skies to which every star in the sky can be seen, so as usual I was looking up at the stars through the front windshield and passenger window while my husband was driving. I immediately became aware when I saw the red flashing lights out of the corner of my eye.  You know those Christmas lights they call &#34;chasers&#34; that you can set the speed of the flashing by a remote near the plug-in?  That&#39;s what these lights looked like, very fast and rotating around the the circular perimeter, it was hard to miss.  With my mouth wide open in complete awe, I grabbed my husbands arm and said &#34;LOOK at that!&#34; What direction in the sky were they sighted? We were traveling North, and the lights were moving from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you use any binoculars or use eyeglasses to view them? No sir, I don&#39;t wear glasses and we didn&#39;t have any binoculars unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How were the lights strobing like quick short flashes, random around the circular perimeter? They were flashing rapidly (red)in a rotating fashion (like the lights were chasing each other) around the circular perimeter. I&#39;m not sure if my eyes weren&#39;t just getting blurry from staring so long at these things, but I thought I might have seen them change colors once or twice, to the color of white, very quickly as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you stop and get out of your vehicle to watch at all? Unfortunately no.  I wanted to but there were 16 inches of snow on the ground (there were no place to pull over because of the snow drifts from the plows)and it was 9 degrees out that night, and we were late getting to our next destination.  We just drove very slowly observing them from the windshield of our mini-van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you seen any ufos before this sighting? Yes, but these two were very different from the other time.  The first time was about 1993 in Kokomo, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I were getting some groceries out of the trunk of her car (sometime around 9PM I suppose, it was over 10 years ago) when a triangular object with 3 big red lights on each point of the triangle (the lights weren&#39;t flashing) passed low in the sky right over our heads.  It was about the size of a football field and moved silently. It was made out of some kind of black metal and had some kind of groovy patterns on the underside. It flew just above the trees and was so low that we could see these patterns. I don&#39;t remember much about being 15, but I&#39;ll never forget that.  It was my curiousity in researching if anyone else had any similar experiences with both of these types of craft that led me to your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you tell anybody you visited about the sighting? No. We were travelling with our roomate and her 5yr old son at the time to visit my husbands grandmother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roomate and her son were asleep in the backseat of the van, and I didn&#39;t want to scare them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did they tell you if they have seen or heard about any ufos in their area in the past several years? My husband&#39;s grandfather used to watch them from the front porch of the same house we were staying at when my husband was about 10yrs old (he&#39;s 24 now).  Oddly, every Tuesday or Wednesday (it was one day a week at relatively the same time at night, around 9PM) it would appear in the same place in the sky.  The front door of the house faces to the east and the craft could be seen from just above the trees.  He passed away in 1995, and has been known to watch this thing once a week for years while he was alive. I heard this directly from my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are you or your husband from Missouri? I&#39;m originally from Indiana, and my husband and I live in Virginia Beach due to him being stationed here in the Navy.  He&#39;s from Nebraska. My husbands family is from Missouri though, and his grandmother still lives there, whom we were staying with for the holidays.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more thing to add....  They were stationary when I first noticed them, then they began circling around each other very rapidly while moving from east to west and west to east again across the sky...sort of like they were playing or dancing. There were no other aircraft in the sky, and it was around midnight at the time.  There were no other cars on the road at the time either. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes, then they began to dim, or maybe get farther up into the sky so that they appeared to be dimmer I&#39;m not sure, but then they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank you for sharing your similar story with me.  I&#39;m glad there is someone out there who saw the same thing and I know Im not crazy now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never shared either of these experiences with anyone else, besides my mother and my husband out of fear that they would think I&#39;d lost it.  But I know in my heart these were not aircraft I was seeing, planes and jets just don&#39;t move like that.  It helps to know that people like you are out there investigating, and bringing some comfort to those like me, in knowing we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There IS something going on out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take care, name withheld<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

What we saw, moving extremely fast almost due south, over the Phoenix Mountain Perserve, Squaw Peak area, was 9 very bright lights, shaped in the form of a chevron.  There were 4 on each side and one in the very front.  These lights were extremely bright, white.  The UFO was only visible for about 5 seconds, and then was blocked by Squaw Peak.<n>

It was there till we got to the end of the road and then it just vanished. On our way back home it was no where in the sky. My children were with me at the time and all of us saw the light.<n>

My estimate for distance from me would be about one air mile. At this distance the size of the bank of lights was about one finger(horizontally). I couldnt make out a shape behind the lights but it did have a kind of rectangular shadow behind the lights. I was out there for ten minutes and it stayed in the same place.. the lights kept changing colors and occasionally some would go dar then light back up again and start changing colors. I finally came inside because I got cold and next time I went out about 11:45p.m.  It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in 6 months that I have seen this same type object.<n>

It changed the intencity of its light, first from bright white with slight beams ,then all of a sudden it goes very dim ,then its size goes smaller then it vanishes then reapears again emmiting extreamily bright light. There were 4 other smaller circles surrounding the bigger and brighter one they just change direction they follow it.I called my brother, mom, dad,sister to take a look to see im not imagining things they also saw it,we then called our neighbours who also saw it.The bright object then moved in seconds from east of the sky to west which i know no plane can move and turn at that speed and altatude ,it started moving up and down sort of hovering .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came closer downwards from the sky towards the mind dump it was a gold mine before.It moved even closer towards the mine .It hovered over the mine for 2 hours moving slighty but remaing very bright we could not make out any shape or material of the object the light it was emmiting was too bright.I got tired of watching it and left.Im not sure but i feel mayby this thing or whatever has  telepathic abillities because i felt the urge too look in its direction.Iv seen this object many times before always around 12am or 3am in the morning and always the same place.I am not lying or making up stories i have other witnesses.Somthing weird is going on people see things but its never mentioned on the news or papers.I did photograph it but they didnt show up everthing in the photo was blank even the trees and mountain didnt show up on the camera film its too weird but the other photos came out fine on the same reel.<n>

It seemed very high in the sky and it was just a white light. It could well have been a shooting star although I have never seen or heard of one that makes a 90 degree turn. It seemed like as it came down right before the turn it stopped, just for a split second but it happened very fast. My husband was driving and was watching the road not the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought about it and couldn&#39;t figure why such a light would come from that area as it was an area facing northerly.  So I got up and looked.  There was no sunlight at that hour, besides it was coming from the wrong direction.  The  UFO light was in the ESE, I believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Couldn&#39;t tell shape of craft because of lights it was emitting.  It looked like a white blob as if moon in fog, but it was standing still.  However, when got out binoculars it had three squares straight in front emitting bright lights as if from a panel.  There were very strong, bright beams coming from each side.  It stayed still.  The crescent moon passed my view and moved past me as if in front and below the object. I got up because the light beam coming between slats in my partially opened blind hit me and woke me up.  Coming from such an unusal area (edge of neighbors roof facing north)I couldn&#39;t figure it out so got up and viewed in a ESE angle from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to bed and got up several minutes later and it was gone.  It seemed as if it were trying to attract attention by being so bright and still.<n>

I had recently seen this object a few nights before, however due to Sky Harbor International Airport and the traffic pattern for the aircraft, I thought it was just another airplane.  This object didn&#39;t seem to move when looking at it from the distance where I was, however, when looking at the object through my telescope I noticed that the object would not stay stationary.  The object had Blue (Possibly Green) and Red lights, which you would believe to be the position lights on an airplane.  While watching the object it would move from side to side, normally if an aircraft turns the light on the wingtips would alternate to the other side.  This object did not.  There wasn&#39;t (at least from what I could see) any anti-collision or strobe lights on it, just the Blue and Red.  Luke Air Force Base is close to my home and other lights have been seen in the distance, South - Southwest of the airbase.  I have videoed some lights in the AZ sky however I was told that these lights are flares from the Air Force.  As for the lights seen, recently, I have seen it before.  Again, may be just another aircraft in the Phoenix sky.<n>

They did not flash and were white in color. There were 3 lights in a perfectly straight line tilted about 30 degrees to the right. It looked like a smaller version of Orion&#39;s Belt, about 3/4 the size. The far left &amp; far right lights were slightly brighter than the center light. My 17 year old son was sitting in the front seat also and he saw the same thing. After about 10 seconds the lights faded out suddenly. There weren&#39;t any clouds in the sky. We do a lot of stargazing and I&#39;ve never seen a constellation like this in the northwest. The lights were too far apart to be an airplane. Maybe satellites tumbling at EXACTLY the same time ? Anybody else see this ? There&#39;s probably a good explanation.<n>

I assumed it was part of a radio/communications tower, but it grew brighter as I approached it. There are few curves to this road so I was really interested in what I was approaching. I got to about 1 mi. of this light when it suddenly shot upwards at an increadible speed at a 45 degree angle away from me eastward.

Fiery object emits fire like objects that float down to ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On December 24, 2002 I pulled up to one of my friends house, him and another friend said they were going up to the construction site of a new hospital where my friend worked as the night secuirty guard. (Only person at the site at night) The security guard had called terrified, babbling, and literally crying that a UFO was hovering over his office(the guard is 6&#39;2 and weighes around 200 lbs.)  I immideately drove to his work located about a mile and a half from where I was at.  On the way up I saw an orange light in the sky but thought that it probably was just a airplane and didn&#39;t notice when it must have disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got up to the hospital the security guard was still hysterical and was trying to tell us what it looked like and what it was doing.  We kind of joked with him for about ten minutes when we all went into his office that was located in a modular next to the hospital.  I called my father who is the chief of one of the fire departments in town and asked him if he would call dispatch and see if anyone had reported anything.  One of my other friends called his girlfriend on the office phone.  The guard sat down in his chair and said to me I was looking out this window when I first saw it, as the security guard pointed out the window to show me where, he said, &#34;Oh my god there it is again&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked out the window I saw an orange light that was bright orange.  It was somewhere around six hundred feet off the ground and about a mile away.  I could not pick out a shape of the object only that it was emmiting a light that looked like fire and that it was coming closer.  I immediately called my dad who lives up on a hill about the same distance away and told him that I didn&#39;t know what this thing was and for him to try to see it from his advantage.  Then the UFO started emitting little tracer fire balls that looked like they were floating down (swaying back and forth).  It must have dropped around 8 of these.  I then became frantic when my friends started screaming in terror as this object is slowly coming towards us.  My parents immediately hung up on me when they heard my friends screaming to come to where we were at.  At this time I felt that it was time to leave so we ran to the cars.  As we were running a car came over the horizon and the UFO dissappeared like turning off a light bulb in a dark room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friends of ours and my parents and grandfather arrived shortly and we stayed there for a while but it never came back.  The security guard said that when saw the UFO the first time a car stopped alongside the highway to watch.  But never heard any other reports.  Would love to know if anyone has seen anything similar in the North eastern California, South eastern Oregon, or North west Nevada area.  swanpig_33@hotmail.com<n>

I could not believe I was actually seeing a UFO. I rushed downstairs with my camera and binoculars and got some of the staff at the hotel reception to come outside and view this UFO. They came out and saw what I was on about, a &#39;star&#39; moving around seemingly randomly but definatley with amazing speed and at crazy angles - almost &#39;dancing&#39; in the sky but then after about 5 minutes of looking around the sky I said &#39;hold on - there are 12 of these things up there&#39;. The hotel staff and myself watched these objects moving around the sky for the next two hours, some of them moving in perfect formation with the others until the sun started coming up. I took many photos of these things which must have been moving at phenemonal speeds; you can clearly see that the stars are stationary in these photos but the ufos are moving so quickly that they have left light streaks on the image in the time it took the for the camera to take the picture whilst the stars are totally stationary. These &#39;lights&#39; seemed to be under intelligent control. They almost seemed to be putting on &#39;as show&#39; for us!  This was just the beginning of a series of amazing observations over the next 4 nights which did not just consist of light streaks in the sky, the other stuff is even more incredible. I would really love somebody to examine the images that I have;I have waited this long to see if I could find any images similar to the ones I have and I still have not seem anything similar to the images that I have. I hope that through this organisation my images can be investigated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m sure (we both are) that it wasn&#39;t a plane, the light was really brite, and it was the only light you could see in the object, my last sight was the object moving into the sea  across the sky.I tryed to find somebody else on the net who have seen it, but´till now we both are the only ones.<n>

These two lights seemed to play tag, one passing the other in a seemingly perfectcircle. We observed this phenomenon for about 20 minutes as we were travelling.  A CalTrans flagger and a bystander that we passed were also engrossed in the lights as we passed them.  I thought that it was a search light on clouds, but I could see no beam, and there were only spotty clouds.  The lights seemed to be amorphous.<n>

Moved to my left while rising until it reached the lower level of clouds, then it moved to the right and eventually stopped moving or gaining altitude at approx. 65 degree angle from horizon.  Eventually, the clouds covered it. Also, there were no lights or any other markings visible on the craft which seemed about a mile away.  To my eye, at that distance, it looked about the same size as a street sign from 60 yards away. No helicopter or jet sounds heard.<n>

My attention was instantly drawn to a brightly lit object travelling toward the NE at about the speed of a private plane, approximately over the Houston Ship Channel, about 2 miles away. It had just passed a yard light slightly above my neighbors house, and, I watched as it travelled the full length of the roof ridgeline (about 150 feet distant, and, possibly 50 feet of roof). Casually wondering why I was looking into what might have been a Landing Light, if the craft were travelling toward me, I was startled to see it make a 180 degree Que-ball turn, without dimenishing its speed. It retraced its flight path back to the point where I originally noticed it, made another Que-ball turn, and, continued on its original path, but, descending below the ridgeline and out of sight at about the point where it made the initial turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was simply a large, bright light, larger than a pinpoint, with red and blue lights flashing around the perimeter, yet, the light always seemed to be pointed straight at me, indicating that it was radiating in all directions, as opposed to being a beam that pointed toward the line of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen lights in the Sky that seemed to be shining directly at me, while travelling in directions at physical odds with Landing Lights. The first time was in Dec. of 1999, multiple objects over Ellington Field and Baybrook Mall, in Clear Lake City, Texas. Disappeared up I-45, around downtown Houston, and, apparently switching to I-10 West, toward San Antonio.<n>

As we were approaching the grade into the mountains I spotted a craft heading for our truck.  I yelled out &#34; Dude, dude, dude a ufo!!!!!  and pulled over immediatly.  It was a spherus shaped craft with red, blue, green, and white lights.  They were not many small lights but larger lights which covered the craft.  It appeared to be tracking down the side of hwy 8 going east and rotating forward as if it was rolling through the air.  It was the size of a 16 x 16 sphere.  There was absolutelu no sound, noise or any sounds related to the craft as it passed us at about a 200 to 300 foot distance.  We both watched it as it disapeared to the east.<n>

We watched this object move from left to right and it looked like it was gliding not flying.  We both first thought that it was a helicopter or something but then it statrted to move away and come back in a motion that we knew it wasnt a regular air craft.  My boyfriend is skeptic about it.  He is assuring himself that it was a really bright star and he clouds were making the object to appear to move.  I watched the object for 3 hours and finally  as the daylight came this object slowly went away.  I watched it move farther and farther with a small trail of light behind it.  As daylight came I made him look over in the same spot and see that it was not a tower and that there is no way possible fot it to have been a really bright star like he wants to make himself believe.  I know what I saw!<n>

Object appeared over trees coming at me from the east, raesembling in shape, size, speed and apparent altitude a v-formation of geese, with I estimate four lights on each side, each light considerably larger/brighter than an average star. The object appeared at about 30 degrees above the horizon, approached to nearly overhead while slowly turning -- apparently banking -- left, or south. As it did so the lights slowly faded and  disappeared. There is often air traffic in the sky -- we are in the approach patterns for Baltimore-Washington International and Reagan National airports -- but there were no other aircraft in the sky at the time that I recall. Unlike aircraft this object displayed no blinking navigation lights and made no sound whatsoever. Difficult to estimate altitude, but I would guess about 800 feet or more. At no time was anything other than the lights visible. I am an experienced observer, a military journalist; I am familiar with al! l kinds of aircraft. This report was delayed by skepticism, but it defies conventional explanation.<n>

I called the Walnut Creek police department and asked if they knew about these low flying objects and they were very abrupt on the phone and said &#34;no&#34;! They did not want me asking questions it seemed. I am still perplexed as there were many, many of them and when I returned home, I took my husband outside in our backyard and he could not believe it.

When we first noticed the &#34;cloud,&#34; it looked to be only a hundred meters off the ground and less than one hundred fifty meters from our position, in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped the car and got out of the vehicle to take a photo of whatever the black object was and by the time I snapped the photo (twelve seconds after our initial look at the thing) the black anomaly was approximately four hundred meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then re-entered the car and looked to see where this black object had gone. It was nowhere to be seen! (Only six seconds had elapsed since I had taken the photo.) It really didn&#39;t look like a real cloud, at all. It looked more like a beginner&#39;s attempt at making a digital cloud. It moved toward the Northeast, even though the direction a nearby flag was blowing indicated that the surface wind was moving in a straight West to East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was also the direction a line of upper (white) clouds were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides the small, black, cloud-like formation there were no other clouds in the sky except for the line of clouds that occupied an elevated height. The black mystery object was the only one of its kind in the sky. There were no planes or weather balloons or helicopters in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was near to its time of setting. Other than the above-mentioned clouds, the sky was blue. I&#39;m not sure what else to tell you about this incident except that my wife had seen a nearly identical small, black, cloud-like formation just the day before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still haven&#39;t gotten the film developed.

Approximately 7:30 PM. East hill of Kent, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just been on the phone with my girlfriend ( approx 7:15 ) who was driving north on 405 near Renton and she had told me of three lights she saw in sky which she thought was peculiar. Moments later I&#39;d left my apartment and was walking to the laundry room with my laundry. The skies were very clear. I heard a sound which was like a high pitch whirr mixed with a low resonating hum...I thought the sound was coming from the laundry room. Just then I watched a large black triangle gliding above the trees just to the east of me and maybe a 1000 ft up or so. It was as big or bigger than a 747 but moving half as fast as one that close might be moving. It was only a couple blocks to the east but still pretty much overhead and I clearly saw the dome shaped white lights on each corner and a red light in the middle. The red light may have been rotating or maybe a smokey half dome shape was over it rotating. I could tell the sound was coming from it but was weird, kind of resonating. Not a very loud sound either, and not one I&#39;ve heard before. I watched it gliding north behind the trees and staying smooth and steady. As it moved away I could discern the thickness of the craft. Gliding overhead took about 5 or 6 seconds I&#39;d guess, but I continued to watch it through the trees for maybe 20 seconds. After putting my laundry in, I went back to my car and drove around up on the hill a little but it was gone from sight by then. I don&#39;t see how hundreds of people didn&#39;t see that. I believe the triangle was equilateral in shape. I observed many airplanes after that, not even the same. The white lights on the corners were steady and bright, but not necessarily &#34;unearthly&#34;. The object didn&#39;t seem to be affected by gravity, I had no impression it had weight. I attached a photoshop rendering of what I saw against the type of night sky that evening. I also attached a map showing it&#39;s approximate location and direction. My girlfriend&#39;s sighting put the lights north of my location about ten minutes earlier, yet I saw the objec! t headin g north towards her location. Either it had gone south and turned around or there may have been more than one out that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the evening, the freeway had been blocked by police activity (south of this location in Federal Way) involving a car chase and then the search for two suspects which had escaped on foot. By this time of the evening, the search had just been called off, the suspects had escaped. This might be relevant to the assumption that the black triangle is a surveillance craft.<n>

Where they form is to the S-SW and were formed as they usually do across the sky but when approaching the convergence of the Westerly&amp; Southerly winds{cause of weather pattern} the funnels pointed downward, when they reached the converging point an oval light would jet down toward the ground, this happened several times so I began retracing from N-S and was amazed to see these ovals hiding themselves in the funnels near where most of them form, when a funnel appeared to be dispersing the oval would come to the end of the tube/funnel and wait for small dark clouds to get near and then would hide behind them, I saw at least 50 do this, they are about the size of a gymnasium maybe even larger. Once I got an idea of what is happening I began to notice the clouds they hide behind if losing their funnel had distinct shapes, ! I was al most unsure if I could stand it all, some clouds had the shape of a flying V and bigger than the ovals and others triangular and yet some were chevron shaped, I saw 20+ of these. When I began looking thru my binoculars I could see ver faint red/range blue and green dots covring the chevron shaped objects and last Sept. there were hundreds of the red/orange going into the sky, up then as if dancing then across the horizon with equal distance between, they appeared to be the same or similar dots, as well last Sept. the red dots appeared to be fighting with something to resemble a red dragon almost like a phoenix but not quite, the battle happened almost overhead but at once the stars seemingly exploded{may have been the &#34;starlike&#34; objects here now but I was&#39;nt paying that much attention then} after a heavy fog covered most of the sky but left open the place from where they came from the ground, after 9/11/01 and this madness going on we contacted the Sheriffs Dept who responded with 4 deputies, most of the red balls were gone but 2 graciously appeared above a dead pine just as the deputies were writing me off as a &#34;Knut&#34;, they had little to say about and I jokingly stated it probably to be &#34;Swamp Gas&#34; then they left, several nights later an octagonal craft came from the south going north{the UFO hole}, it had faint blacklights surrounding the edge but were on the underside, had 2 big lights across the face which resemble a ZZTop album cover and a rectangular set of red lights that would flash differently as if it were some type of communication, this craft is able to hover and move horizontal at great speeds, if I focused my binoculars a bit off te starlike objects could well be similar but the stars would have been made of several of these hex ones, I have several witnesses for each account !!! Back to tonights show, as well as the starlike, the red/orange dots, the chevron, triangular and Vshapes there were smaller ovals but they had a more oblong appearence. The small ovals did not use funnels but seemed to hold white clouds together and move from south to north as did the others, these would sometimes be in small groups of 4 or 5 in the same cloud, they moved on the clouds bottomside and disappeared as did the others. Where the sky breaks the incoming storms approximately 2 miles south I would see a flicker now and then but with all the excitement it took a while to give them much attention, once I focused on them I saw small green, blue and red semi-cigar shapes that would scramble behind the clouds anytime a clear spot appeared, there were too many small dot and semi-cigar shapes to try to count. As of now the event is still happening and while peering out my sliding glass doors a gigantic rounded hexagonal shape with a bulging circle in the center just came over using a dark cloud for concealment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an idea that I may be near a centralized location for some sort of being that is capable of technology beyond ours, that uses things from the atmosphere for an unknown purpose, is very diverse and that lives under ground as a large society of sorts as well as occasionally emerging and re-entering for the reason of stockpiling whatever it is they take from the atmosphere/clouds. Apparently they are peaceful enough because I have had nor heard of any encounters with them other than sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also believe I may be in way over my head in trying to unvail any more information alone, where would one begin to look for help ??? I am going to close now and continue observing and will gladly inform you all of anymore findings !<n>

The first time was on December 17, 2002 at 9:00-9:30pm, for about 1 minute while returning from a trip to central Arkansas to my home in Jonesboro, AR.  The 2nd observation was on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2002, again between 9:00 and 9:30 pm with another witness from my parent&#39;s backyard in Jonesboro.  I have been thinking about making this report for a long time but, after reading many reports in this database, I had not read any descibing a similar object until this week. Several days ago I read a report of a sighting on 9/25/03 with a similar object described.  Not only that but the sighting was in the same location as my first sighting and at the same time of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting on December 17, 2002 occured as follows:  I was driving north on Hwy. 67 and at about 1 mile southeast of Newport, AR I exited 67 on an offramp to the right and stopped at a stop sign before making a right turn on to hwy 14.  While stopped at the stop sign I looked ahead and slightly up and saw the object about 30 degrees above the horizon and approximately 1 mile away from me.  I am a former private pilot and I would judge the object to have been 300-500 feet above the ground.  The object was moving east to west at a speed so slow my guess is it was about 30 mph or less.  Although I describe it as an object what I actually saw was about 7 or 8 lights.  I had the impression that the lights were attached to an object and may have outlined the shape of it.  I do not recall how many lights there were even after seeing it a second time several weeks later.  The lights were a dim red and steady, not flashing, and the placement of them would outline a football or egg shape.  The outline of the lights was as large as my hand held at arms length.  I do not remember the weather that day or night but the object was well below any cloud ceiling  there would have been.  I watched the object move slowly west for about 1 minute or less (I couldn&#39;t hear any sound), made a right turn and continued home on Hwy 14 heading east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting of this same (or a similar) object was on Chistmas Eve, December 24, 2002 from my parent&#39;s backyard, again at about 9:30pm in Jonesboro, AR.  Again it was to the north of us (another witness was with me) and again it was slowly traveling east to west.  It was slightly further away from me this time and, as a consequence, the red lights were a little dimmer.  I have no doubt that this was the same type of object I had seen two weeks earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I<n>

Then it rose slowly &amp; gracefully into the air a considerable way (a few metres) and came overhead,very low and very quietly,gliding above us it seemed as though the engine had been turned off and it just glided above us above the village and disappeared out of view, we ran outside to watch as it went over, there were coloured lights blue,red yellow and white fairly dim now , we think it was a Diamond shape. Very strange. Second craft followed its path, think this was an aircraft noisier and more familiar shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were outside (Me,my friend and his friend) and we had opened up a camper and got power going to it so we could listen to the radio and turn the lights on,they did that while i built a fire. We had been standing outside for about 30 min when i saw something in the sky about 3 miles away. When i saw it the craft seemed to be comeing down and was glowing bright red as if it were hot. My friend told me that it was common to see such things in the sky about that time and that it was &#34;Nothing New&#34; to them. At that point my friends friend which to be blunt was a retard decided to pick up a spot light connected to the campers power supply and flash the thing four or five times. After he did that the craft stoped glowing and looked JUST like a star,he flashed it again a few times. At that point the craft started to move over to where we were with great speed. The first thought that came into my mind wasent a good one and what my friends friend had done was a very bad thing. Being 17 and them 12 left me in control to take some kind of action and ideas for escape or hideing started to flow into my mind. One thought was that maybe their tracking systems (Advanced of course) used heat,not the fact we had a huge fire going.As the object got closer i moved us to a tree were we hid around it as the craft approached. This was from the idea that maybe trees take in body heat and that it was rather cold outside. So here we are huddled up around a tree trying to hide from this thing. As it came right over us the dogs nearby stoped barking and the radio staion changed along with the lights blinking. What i heard on the radio scared me the most. It sounded like talking but not anything we know on our planet. The thing as i said was right over us and almost appeared to be confused(like it was looking for us). it moved around the tree about mile or so above it and we moved with it to try to stay out of its sight. I could see ! it very clearly. It was triangle shaped with 3 lights on the edges of it. it hovered over us for about 15 min before the sounds comeing in on the radio changed and sounded like ones you would hear from a Air Force dispatch. It was hard to make out as it sounded like the person talking was rushing. At that time (and this is what got my eye) the craft seemed to tilt up a little and three blue like rings went over the surface and it shot out to space at a a VERY fast speed. A few mins later jets and bigger planes littered the sky. Call me crazy but i get &#34;Feelings&#34; about things. things i read or see and i got a spine chilling one from that craft as if it were comeing to get us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> when we went back in the camper the radio which was not digital (old turn knobs)staion had been changed and the knob was clear across the dial. Also things that hadent been on such as lights, a stove and a cooler which none of had been on were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say over all...i would rate that 10.0 on my weird ((deleted))-o-meter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  For corroboration sake, we will request that the witness, who describes himself as a student, have the other witnesses submit reports about their respective recollections of the event, as well.

I was driving north into the city.    When I was approx 3-5 km from the city, I noticed 2 red lights moving vertically above Saskatoon basically directly in front of where I was driving.  As I was driving I was watching these 2 red lights dogfight over the city.  I was wondering why airplanes would fly like this over a city and at night.  As  I approached the city limits, I was stopped at a red traffic light.  I watched these 2 lights straighten out (formed up) and level out fairly high up.  All I could see was like 2 LED lights.  These 2 lights came towards my position in an S-curve and slowly moved over my car towards a ESE direction.  I rushed home but couldnt see anything becuase of city lights.  I did call the airport to report the situation but of course never received an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound...<n>

It hovered over the hillside,  then started traveling slowly upward. Then it shot off to the right and went out of sight, leaving a weak trail that disappeared completely within about 5 seconds. It couldn&#39;t have been any type of aircraft controlled by man, for the sudden change of direction was too perfect: an exact right angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

12/17/02 10:30|New York City (Manhattan)|NY|Sphere|20 seconds|Small silver orbs moving among Manhattan skyscrapers, morning and evening events|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26684.html|102|ndxe200212| Small silver orbs moving among Manhattan skyscrapers, morning and evening events<n> <n><n> <n><n> getting coffee from a coffee cart on the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street, glanced east and saw a small (about two or three feet) silverish orb with two slowly blinking lights on the bottom moving west over 43rd Street directly next to the Grace building about 20 stories up.  I thought it was some sort of balloon toy or even paper blowing on the wind.  The object had an unsteady movement as if being moved around by the wind.  However, the object was NOT falling but proceeding horizontally.  When it reached 6th Avenue (one block away from my position) it made a 90-degree turn against the wind, without changing it&#39;s altitude, and continued south and out of view behind the Conde Nast tower.  It gave me a creepy feeling like it was some sort of probe or reconnaissance device.  I believe in UFOs but have never seen anything as bizarre as this in my life, and I consider myself a pretty stable person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later the same day, just past sunset, I was walking south on 7th Avenue, from 42nd Street to 34th Street.  Around 40th Street I noticed several block south there were three more objects like the one I had seen earlier in the day, about as high up.  They were quite small in the distance but I could see the same slowly blinking lights on the bottom.  The three moved, variously, horizontally and vertically over the avenue, and then grouped together and moved downwards a few floors in altitude.  then they stopped their downward motion and moved horizontally (no downward movement) towards a building on the east side of the street and proceeded, next to it, to move out of sight down whichever side street they were over (somewhere in the mid-thirties).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In no case could I make out any details on the objects beyond the lights on the bottom, which appeared red or orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a professional working in Times Square.<n>

The lights slowly began to move.  We decided to follow the lights.  As the craft passed in front of the clouds it was breifly backlight revealing a triangular shape with red and green lights at different points on the craft.  The object then disappeared over the treeline and we decided to go workout.  A half hour later while coming back down Rt. 3 on the West lane we noticed the craft still in the air above us only now coming our direction.  We began to follow it until we lost sight of it for good.  Several days later on Christmas day my other brother and I we outside talking at around 9:00 pm when I noticed the same craft in the sky near our house.  He tried to dismiss it as a helicopter but it was making no sound.  I then began to drive down the road and lost site of the craft.  About 15 minutes down the road the craft appeared on the opposite side of the sky now with several other lights around it.  I lost sight of it shortly after that.<n>

It was a glowing pale orange-yellow. The only color that I can think of that comes close is the color of a flame.  The color seemed to have a fluid movement like when looking at a flame too. I was in my car and came upon this object, and I stoped the car to look at it.  It stayed there for about two and a half minutes and then just seemed to blink out. Just like some one turning off a light.  This is not the first time that I have seen strange things in the sky, but this was the first time that I had fear in my heart over it.  There was no reason that I could understand, for the feelings of fear, but the feeling was there just the same. A great deal of fear. This object made no sound at all. I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but I do know it was about 7 to 9 days before christmas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright wheel looking light, changing colors and size<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught our attention because it was so bright, and it was illuminating a smaller object just below it that had no light. The object originally appeared to be vertically oblong, and the object below it appeared to be a smaller metal sphere. We got the digital camera out to zoom in closer, and observed that there were bright blue and green lights surrounding the object, with a red flashing light on it&#39;s right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the larger object would reduce slightly in size, then change to a purple and green color around it&#39;s edge, then seemed to &#39;explode&#39; into a much larger array of light, probably three times it&#39;s original size, and highly resembled a wagon wheel with smaller lights on the tip of each spoke and single bright light in the center. The object at that time would be spinning. This can be observed and appears to be obvious on our video tape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of it at that time would change into different intensities of pinks, yellows, greens and sometimes blue and red. Then, the object would again reduce in size back to it&#39;s original appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The smaller object did not come out on any of our video, yet was obvious without the aid of any magnification. But because it was only shown by the reflecton of the light from the larger object, this evidentally caused it not to show up because of light and dark filters on our camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our video is approximately 15 minutes long and we also have several good still shots taken off the tape as well.<n>

The row of lights were of difference colors and were not quite horizonal to the ground. The lights appeared to be some distance, we could not judge distance or the size of the object. I appeared to be large. We had a high powered telescope, but could not get it work properly. We also had binoculers which worked fine. We observed a red light break away from the row of lights. We also saw a faint whitish beam come off now and then from the end of the lowest part of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house is near the flight path of SeaTac Airport and commercial planes came between us and the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were terrable. It was raining and the wind was blowing at 10 to 20 miles an hour.

By the time I got out I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, but we both observed a VERY unusual thick white smoky trace the type that airplanes leave.  The trace disappeared in midair.  Strangely, we both felt an incredibly strong energy current both inside and around, like suddenly the entire area had been charged with an electric charge of super strength.  What ensued was even more puzzling - a strong and continuous cacaphony of animal noises - wild barking of dogs most notably - permeated the air until 3 am.  I couldn&#39;t sleep that nite even for an hr.  I felt agitated, but also electrified, like I have been toughed with an electrifying stick<n>

Very high up, probably above the atmosphere.  It&#39;s size was undeterminable due to its height.  It moved from a Northeast to Southwest direction at an alarming rate of speed.  I am an amateur star gazer/sky wathcer and I know what a satellite looks like moving across the night sky.  I don&#39;t know of any satellites that move from East to West, and I&#39;ve never seen a sattelite moving this fast before.  It crossed the portion of sky visible to me (120 degrees) in less than 45 seconds.  There was no sound nor any streak or trail behind it.  I followed it until it disappeared over the trees.  My best explanation other than some kind of vehicle would be a meteor that passed close to Earth, but I saw no reports either way.  I am uncertain about the date and/or time, and had I known there was a website, I would have reported when it happened.  I know it was late in the year 2002 and that it was around 8:00 pm.  It was nearly directly overhead but just slightly Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was off the interstate on a road that leads East somewhat parallel to the interstate.  I looked up to the left above the trees off the road while going up a hill and saw a circular object, with a red light on one end and a green light on the other end, with a white light circling around, which blanked out the red or green light as it passed on its way around.  The speed limit is low here so I had about a minute to glance at it and watch the road at the same time.  The object was about 30 yds long and maybe 15 wide.  It looked to be about 100 feet above the tree tops, about 150 yds off the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definately spooked me.  I have always been one to look at the night skies and have alot of interest in aircraft.  This seemed different than anything I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued down the road and after hitting Hwy 127 and turning north, I saw what appeared to be the same object, only it was several miles from the road and much higher.  It seemed to blink red, then green, which made me think of the white light going around blanking out the red and green on the object I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not believe that this object was following me, or had anything to do with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was beatufil . All i could tell you is that it happend so fast that i could hardly tell exactly what it was, but it was very close and was a highly concentrated light. The most purest white light ive ever seen. It didnt have a tent of any other color. It was the most pure light ever, and it is hard to explain in words but it didn&#39;t give light off. It was LIGHT ITS SELF, and it didnt streak any light behind it like a comet or any other things like that.<n>

When I reflect to that time of this sighting I would say that as the satellite appeared from behind nine mile mountain from Kispiox Valley, it was in front of Roche de Boule mountain with Hazelton down below.  It looked like it was flying due west.  There was no sound.  Then it made an L-shaped turn north where it looked like it slowed around Kispiox Village ( for maybe 30 seconds ) at which time I was seeing it through the binoculars. It was not that high up. And still no sound.  As soon as it was exactly west of me I watched with the eyes until it was behind the trees.  This was all within about 3-4 minutes total at the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have the jets going to Alaska around 11:30 am which are very high up. Also they come from the southeast and go right over the house here and leave the Kispiox Valley heading in a northwestern straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that is why I thought maybe a satellite because of its unusual flight pattern, almost as thought it was going to Terrace, then decided to head up the Kispiox Valley on the western side of the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I appreciate your interest in this matter.

But satellites do not stop and hover !<n> <n><n> <n><n> Email report Received: March 15, 2003 Hello, I finally had a spare moment to find out who to tell about what I saw last December about a week and a half before Christmas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live approx 17 Km north of Hazelton, B.C. And I was awakened by my dog barking by the south-facing glassdoor around 3:30am.  I took him out because he was going crazy.  I stood on the front porch and thought he had to do his duty.  Instead he stood by the bank barking into the sky.  I looked up more closely into the cold, clear, star-filled night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw a moving &#34;satellite&#34;.  It was traveling over the town of Hazelton heading west.  It was red, with a blinking white light.  The blinking light was steady at first blink, blink, blink.  Then it got irratic right over Hazelton and would skip a blink or two. I decided to grab the binoculars, and it looked too close to be a regular &#34;satellite&#34;, way up there as I have seen several times in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time while I saw it throught the binoculars, it looked like a round ball or sphere and was predominantly a red glow about it.  And it appeared to have the white light blinking off to the side on the outside of the &#34;satellite&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After passing over to the west of Hazelton, it then hovered above what I think was Kispiox Village just north of Hazelton.  It is just 4 Km south of my porch view.  As it is a narrow valley, it then appeared to move up along the Hazelton Mountain and north along the western side of the Kispiox Valley finally passing along the Kispiox Mountain.  Then from my view it disappeared, behind the tall pines around the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really thought it could be any regular &#34;satellite&#34; at the time, whether it be Canadian or US due to the security concerns of the past year.  And it could have been on its way to Alaska?

These objects have been returning our light pattern that we have sent them, thay would pass over 3 or 4 times and then drop in altitude to about 1000 ft, thay have sent probs down aswell?   We have no evidence of what we have done, as no one would believe us, and we dont no why this happens.   Our latest contact was at night doing our usual thing, then out of noware came these 3 red triangle ufos at a speed of 100 mph, they had a some strange sound to them?   Anyway i believe in my own personal way, that these ufos that the world has seen, are not crafts but some sort of animal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

On one of the coldest nights of December in 2002 I witnissed a light which looked like a star I had missed at first but I noticed it was slowly moving beyond the trees so I kept an eye on it to see if it was an aircraft becuase I enjoyed watching planes as well.  It was bigger and more pronounced than the stars around it and suddenly darted north, southwest, then southeast beyond the trees. I was quite scared went inside and never mentioned it again until a year later. I had drawn a picture immediatly afterward but it has went missing since.

We have all been and had a look and hae no answer for the markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The men say the grass is greener because it is butten grass and it usually comes up when everything else has died off.

I first thought the light was a bright star but then it began to shimmer like when you see lights through glass when it rains. I then thought it might be a police helicopter by then it was obviously moving and the light was getting brighter. Suddenly it began to dim and also was rising in a arc. The light went dimmer and lower then quickly began rising as it dimmed. Within two minutes it was completely gone as if it had switched off or moved away  rapidly. I know this was an actual object in flight but it did not move (arc) like any helicopter or plane I have ever seen.

The nose finished in a slightly dulled point. Backswept wing-like extensions were fixed from the middle of the ship to a foot or so behind. It seemed to shimmer as it moved, exceedingly hard for the eye to follow. Unarmed, silent, no lights, no aircraft nearby (strangely enough), left no trail, no magnetic effects. However, the ship did leave a very slight mental signature almost like a ringing in the ears or a tone just below human hearing. It stayed for two minutes, then left in a rush. As it picked up speed the shimmering stopped(or perhaps intensified?). Either way, it disappeared.<n>

The light was comparable to a dim light bulb, it flew parallel to power lines running to the east and over a power plant.  When the light reached the power lines it became an intense bluish color and pulsed. I paced the light in a vehicle at about 50mph. Upon reaching a power line juncture (intersection of three high power lines) the light appeared to stop and looked to be turning towards my direction  and became brighter then was instantly gone (disappeared). Sky was clear with clear star background. Distance followed was about 3 miles.<n>

I couldn&#39;t count them. Possibly about ten. Behind these lights there were several dimmer ones possibly defining more of the object. It looked like there may have been smaller lights around it. It was fairly large and it was moving east to west just above the tree line. I estimate that it was moving at 200mph. It was about 200 yards up and 1/8th of a mile south of me. It didn&#39;t make any noise and it completely disappeared after it went behind a tree.<n>

We just moved to this new subdivision and since there are not many lights this far away from the city, I have a wonderful view of the sky. From behind me I heard the roar of a jet so I turned to watch it. As I was watching it, a V shaped set of 5 lights came into view behind and under the plane. The ufo passed the airplane and disappeared from view within seconds. I then saw another plane approaching from the west at a high rate of speed to the vicinity of where I last saw the ufo. The plane circled the area for about 5 minutes, then left.<n>

I was looking at a bright light out almost due west and a little bit north.  I told my friend,  &#34;Hey, look how bright Venus is there.&#34;  I continued to look at it due to it&#39;s beauty and brightness.  In seconds, it was very obvious it was not Venus, and it wqas coming directly into us, getting bigger and brighter.  My friend said, &#34;that isn&#39;t Venus, it&#39;s a plane with it&#39;s landing lights on.&#34;  The closest large airport was 70 miles East, however.  However, it continued getting bigger, brighter, and closer until it was obvious it wasn&#39;t your typical plane, for sure.  By then, it was getting extremely close and bright, coming directly overhead.  At it&#39;s closest, I could actually make out individual lights on the front of the object, there were many, emitting bright light, with a touch of blue.  The individual lights were round in shape, evenly spaced, on the front of what looked like a delta-wing object.  I had the impression that it was extremely large, the exact shape and dimensions of it were tough to see due to the brightness of the lights.  There were no strobes, no colored lights, no landing lights, etc...it wasn&#39;t like any aircraft I had ever seen.  Although we were on a dangerous part of the freeway, noted for wrecks, I wish we would have stopped and gotten out of the car in the emergency lane to get a better look at this thing, whatever the hell it was.  There were no reference points, so we could not determine the size or altitude of this, the speed appeared quite fast...it looked like the description of the Phoenix lights I have seen, that&#39;s the closest description I have.<n>

The objects were in a pattern: two closer to the west directly above each other and two directly above each other to the east.  I can&#39;t belive no one else on the bus saw them (there were about 30 passengers!). I got off the bus; walked in front of a building.  The pair of closer &#34;zeppelins&#34; had dissapeared.  The pair further to the east slowly drifeted away.<n>

Lights did not move. I told my wife I would drive east out the main gatw then north on Interuban.

I was in my kitchen looking out at the backyard, when I noticed 3 white lights. I thought they were drops of rain on the window iluminated by the kitchen light, but as I looked closer, I could see that they stayed in the same position as I walked around the kitchen. All of a sudden, another one emerged from behind the ground elevation (the objects were approximately 150 metres away), they then begun to interact. One seemed to fly right through the other, then as I went out onto the blacony to get a better look, one approached in my direction. I was in the house within seconds, as I peered out of the window, it continued its approach, when the 3 behind it lit up brightly for about a second, the object immediately flew back to the group. Then they hovered there for a few minutes when they apparently merged together, it then changed its shape to an oval, the furthest points of the oval were pointing horizontally, it then began to shrink then expand and finally began to fly upwards, until it was out of sight, I could still see the glare through the clouds until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights when I first saw them appeared to be diamonds (my vision could have been blurred) but seemed to round themselves out.<n>

We were headed toward Frankfort.  I was talking to him and as I was talking, I noticed some balls of light in the sky.  I continued talking while watching the lights when my husband interrupted me to ask if I saw those lights.  We then watched them for about 5 or 10 more seconds when they just disappeared, as if the lights had been turned off.  At first I thought that there was a tree between us and the lights, but after about 10 more seconds we still had not passed any trees along the side of the road.  We looked all around but could not see them anywhere.  My husband saw two balls of light and I thought that I had seen another one briefly to the left of the larger ball.  There was one large ball of light and another smaller one to the right.  The light was a kind of yellowish with pinkish tones.  They appeared to be about one half mile away.  They were maybe about the same altitude as a small plane, or maybe a bit lower.  About 7 or 8 minutes later, we were just outside the Frankfort city limits when my husband saw them again.  This time there were three distinct balls of light, one a bit larger than the other two.  They seemed farther away the second time.  The larger one&#39;s light got bright and then dimmed, like a dimmer switch, and then brightened briefly again.  Then it dimmed and went out.  All three balls of light went out at the same time.  We called my son-in-law at the Tippecanoe County Sherriff&#39;s dept. to see if anyone was reporting a similar experience.  He called one of the Frankfort police.  However, there were no other reports made.<n>

The structural detail, is what made it stand out from the garden variety landing lights of jets approaching the airport. If I recall,Tampas&#39;airport does not begin flight operations until 6 or 6:30, realizing this, I realized I&#39;m looking at something unusual. The object was the size quarter dollar held at arms length. I had ample opportunity to observe details as I was frequently stopping at intersections with my window rolled down staring at it (with my jaw hanging down). Object appeared to be about 5-7 miles to the left of my vehicle which would place it in a location to my east, between US Highway 41 and the campus of the University of South Florida. It seemed to be slowly drifting lateral to me. If it was as far east as Interstate 75, and the size it was to my naked eye,then this thing would have been really huge. If i had to estimate altitude, it appeared to be about 400-500 feet, but this is only a best guess. Object remained stationary, perhaps slowly drifting at times, and the intensity of its illumination changed every few seconds, i.e., dimmed and increased, in almost a blinking pattern.  2 (two) smaller orange-yellow orbs of light were ejected from the side of diamond shaped object and disappeared in a rapide downward motion. There may be possibility that this was a commerical blimp that may have been used in a recent Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football Game this month, but after it ejected the orbs of light, I quickly discounted that notion. I even considered a shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral, but I&#39;ve observed many shuttle launches at night from our Gulf coast location and there was an absence of a large smoke plume illuminated by the engine nozzles and any distinct arc of movement.

Every night we put out cat food for the wildlife that live behind our house. As we were standing outside smoking a cigarette and waiting for the raccoons to come out, my partner mentioned how nice and clear the sky was. She told me to look at a particular star that was much bigger and brighter than the others. As we both looked at this star, we noticed that it was glowing. I had never seen a star glow like this...all of a sudden this star turns a red color and then a greenish color and then back to a white glow. We start trying to figure out whether this may be a weather balloon or some kind of plane but it&#39;s not moving. As we are talking we see much much higher up....another star doing the same. Automatically we assume this may be some kind of satelite giving off signals..which is really interesting to us, being that we had just moved from a big city and have never seen anything like this. We kept our eyes on this communication for about 5 minutes....all of a sudden this star starts to move from left to right. I think for a moment that it can be our eyes playing tricks on us....and I quickly position my self under a tree. I know for sure that this star was moving because I have a tree branch to help me figure that out. The object or star is moving while the tree branch is still. The bigger and closest star quickly dissapears and then reappears...I tell my partner not to move that I&#39;m going in to get a camera because what we were watching didn&#39;t seem normal. I come out and take at least a dozen pictures on a digital camera. We were out a total of 35 minutes watching this. Watching these 2 stars communicating, moving etc....I don&#39;t know what it is we were watching..but the reason why I am posting this experience is because there are 2 things that don&#39;t make sense. #1 the objects/stars disappeared a minute from each other. #2 The camera only picked up the stars (although very blurry) surrounding the one cha! nging colors, but not the one that was changing colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was outside Caffe Luna, a coffee shop in Longmont, running back to the car to get some crayons I had left there because I was going to be using them to make Spanish Flash Cards inside the coffee shop. Something caught my eye. I looked up to the space between two giant trees outside Caffe Luna and I saw something moving steadily and quickly up at a little under a 45 degree angle. I would have thought it was a shooting star, a BIG shooting star, if it weren&#39;t for the upward motion. It wasn&#39;t a firework because it didn&#39;t leave any smoky or sparkly residue behind. Really, it was a streak of very bright, irridescent light that was . . . accelerating I think. Also, the head of it was very definded, like you would think a comet would be. It lasted for about 3 seconds and then it was gone. I shrieked. My huspand followed my gaze, but it was gone, and I like I said, there was no residue left behind.<n>

The object was small but very bright and all I could see was a white, round glowing light. When I first saw it I was looking east.<n> <n><n> Then the object moved slowly to the south. It appeared to move ~3 inches ~every 5 minutes. It was moving much more slowly than any airplane I have ever seen. And I have never seen this kind of bright object before. There are three other people with me at that time and they also have never seen<n> <n><n> anything like it before.<n> <n><n> I would particularly like to know if anyone else has reported this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You, (name deleted))<n>

I noticed it changed direction several times and continued to observed it for several minutes. I awoke my parents from sleep to bring it to their attention. After going out side i noticed several more spread across the whole horizon. They where noticably larger than stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them outside for a while and walked over to a neighbor who was up early preparing for a hunting trip to bring it to his attention as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed sudden and fluid movments - darting, changing direction suddenly and circulare, and also moments of no movment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also observed was one light that was considerably closer and lower elevation just off the horizon. The light from this was considerably more bright than the others, however movment from this one was limited. Additionally there seemed to be secondary lights of much higher elevation than all the others which had a redish hue to them, these lights seemed to be comparable in size and intensity to ambient stars and little movment was noticed of these.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called some local friends over to my house who observed these with me into the early morning and sun rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a time of observing - still durring the nite, a got a flash light from my house and flashed at the closest object as well as the others in math matical pratterns and progressions; 1, 2, 3 flashes etc, also in series of square roots, and prime numbers, etc. After i had flashed for somtime movment from the objects slowed considerably and eventually haulted compleatly. The objects appeared to  grow farther in distance untill they were hardly disernable from other stars and faded into the sky with the sun rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to persue the closest object in a truck with 3 of my friends by traveling country roads but the oject never appeared to get any closer. As the sun rose all of the other objects faded into the sky and even the largest object vanished into the morning sky as a faint silver spec.<n>

So we kept going straight to it to get a closer look. We got closer and it looked like a saucer shape and had lights and looked like it was spinning and blinking it had a circle around it. It kind of sat in the sky blinking and spinning. We got closer and it went down behind some trees. We waited then started to leave and it came back up for a split second and then was gone. It was a weird feeling. I have never seen anything like that. It was not a plane because it was too big and it wasn&#39;t moving at first.<n>

It was straight ahead of us about 150 feet off the ground and about 2 miles away. The sky was thinly veiled in clouds, the crescent moon and some stars still visible behind them. The light we saw was almost as large as the crescent moon and almost as bright.It was on the underside of the clouds, and was clearly visible. It was a cigar shape and moved with as we drove into the city. We were traveling at 60 mph. and as the object flew with us, covered a much greater distance in the same time. I would guess it traveled about 150 mph. We got caught at what seemed like every stop light trying to follow the light as it passed over the town and away toward the next town. We kept up the best we could and finally lost sight of it as it disapeared over the tree line about 5 miles away. At this point, we were way out in the country and no roads lead in the direction the object flew. Just farm and swampland. The object must have been of huge dimensions as we could tell it was always at least a couple miles away for most of the chase, but was still as big as moon. I tried to call the local airport to see if they had any anomolous aircraft on radar, but no one answered the phone.<n>

I was out walking my dogs. There was no moon out so it was very dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something caught the corner of my eye and made me look up. I saw four very bright, large, round, white lights strobe-ing very rapidly forward. Then they would reverse and go backward. The strobe effect was very rapid.  To my amazement, a huge black “triangle” floated just over the tops of my trees. Then it stopped and began to hover near me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it seemed like once it had my attention that it turned off the strobe lights and  just hovered there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suddenly realized that the object was not making any sound, not a peep. Aircraft fly over all the time, I can always hear the engine clearly, the private planes above the clouds let alone the jets. And this was absolutely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then small white lights on the top, bottom, front, back and sides started to do a little &#34;dance.&#34; All of the smaller lights began to play a pattern. First the two top lights would blink twice, and then the two lights at the front of the craft would blink twice,  then the two top ones again, and then the two back ones, etc.  It went through the pattern until it had blinked every sequence it could with the number of lights that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be dark except the lights, black in color.  It was darker black than the night sky.  The object was very large and solid, I couldn’t see stars through the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate the length to be between 60ft to 100ft long judging by the trees and houses and other landmarks in the area.  I couldn’t tell how wide the object was because I was looking at it from the side and slightly below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, four much larger diamond shaped red lights appeared at the rear of the object, themselves arranged in a diamond pattern. I could see them because the object slowly started to pivot towards me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The diamonds had a “grid” inside them that reminded me of a honeycomb. I knew then that I was seeing something totally unknown. They just stayed on for a moment, and then went out. They were so bright that you could see that the object had a kind of triangular or diamond shaped tail end. Or maybe like two inverted pyramids with a notch on the top and the bottom. And this “tail section” was large enough to house these large red diamonds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally the object flashed the lights in a kind of “grand finale” with the small white and big red diamond lights flashing a pattern together using all the lights.  I just stared motionless, even my dogs were standing perfectly still in the snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object started to move away, flying very slowly. Just gliding along, in no hurry at all.  It didn’t look like it was worried about radar, fighter interceptors or anything else. Although it was probably flying too low to register on radar.  It started to turn in a slow bank at about 45 degrees towards a nearby cellular phone tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right then as it flew near the neighbor’s house across the street, his truck&#39;s alarm went off. It continued to honk until he finally had to come outside to stop it.   I wanted to shout to him to come look at this thing, but it was already getting further away.  My neighbors don’t live close by and he couldn’t see it from his point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also thought about running inside and trying to get my camera, but I just couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it.  As it moved further from me, the patterns got simpler and the red diamond lights came on less often.   I was very relieved that it was moving off, away from where I was standing. While it was right above me the lights were flashing nonstop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved close to the cellular tower which also has lights on it, to let aircraft know it is there. But it only has two beacons, slowly blinking white lights like you see on any tower.  The object blinked its white lights at the tower and the lights on the tower began to blink rapidly as well.  It seemed to linger in the area of the tower for a short time and then starting moving steadily away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it as it moved slowly further away. Finally, after about 5 minutes and it getting cold I wanted to go inside. When I turned my back around again the object was gone. I thought that was strange too, because I thought I should have been able to at least see a little dot but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was. But I do know that I know a lot about airplanes and have seen them fly over at night many times.   Their collision beacons blink very slowly and they have a small red light on the tail that stays on at night. This was *nothing* like that. It was as if these lights had a program written, to get them to create a little light show. I don&#39;t know why any aircraft would have something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t have believed if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes.  It sure was unusual; I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life. I&#39;m not too sure if I want to again either.<n>

The bottom never touched the ground. It was just hoovering above the ground. It never made a sound, neither did it produce any wind around it. Put it this way; It was so quiet that you could hear the crickets outside. The sky was so clear that you could see the stars that night. It never came out of the nearby field where we had spotted it until we began to move.(we had paused beside the road when we saw it) When we began to move into the opposite direction that we were traveling, it also moved into that direction also. It was a very bright object that had small windows all the way around it. We never really got the chance to see the back of the ufo but I do Know that it&#39;s shape never changed. It was very calm and didn&#39;t appear to be  harmful. It did follow us about a mile down the road and never came close. I do believe that it was aware of us. After awhile it later took off with excessive speed across some nearby trees. The only thing visible then was a bright light similar to the moon. It shot off in the air upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it might be a plane leaving Austin Strabel Airport (several had passed over already), but there was no noticeable sound coming from the object. Due to the wind patterns aircraft had been cleared to take off and approach the airport directly over Lambeau (This was broadcast during the game.) Since it was dark at the time we seen the object we can only give a description of the pattern not the overall size or distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to it being a prime time broadcast football game(ESPN) a group of us think it might have been some sort of surveillance aircraft, however I have decided to report it just in case.<n>

I look through binoculars at times and looking at the direction where the red flashes occur the  sky seems to shimmer like looking across heat of a fire.  My wife refuses to look out the window because she say&#39;s she has other things to worry about and that I can&#39;t do anything about it anyway.   This thinking puzzels me, very frustrating.<n>

I was admiring the orange-tint on the horizon when I noticed a bright star-like light up high and behind our direction of travel.  At first I thought it must be a bright star, but within seconds I studied it and determined there were no stars visible like this.  It was too bright and too low; it had my full attention.  After a couple of minutes I further determined it could not be stationary because it remained the same distance from us.  I insisted the other passenger observed this light with me.  Then it made a sudden ascension staight up very, very high into the night sky until the light became tiny and then gone.  The ascension was rapid, but not &#34;lightspeed.&#34;  My excitement level rose.  Almost immediately, I noticed it right in the very same place behind and above us.  I continued to press the other passenger to focus on it.  Within the next couple of minutes, it ascended straight up again.  I did not see it rise as high as the first time, but I was sure the other passenger saw this movement.  Again the light reappeared in its same location.  Shortly after disappearing I don&#39;t know to where.  We must have been the only vehicle on those rural roads that time of morning.  It followed us until we were almost in the town of Carlisle, PA.  I,ve had about three unexplainable experiences in my life which baffle me to this day.  One very involved experience took place in the FL panhandle; I ended up in Tallahasse.  Crazy stuff happened over a significant amount of time.  When it started it was day, night when over.  Anyway, anyone interested I&#39;ll share all the different experiences I&#39;ve had...<n>

I was in my sleeping bag at 10 pm. I thought I was dreaming, however, my companion told me when he got up the next morning that I was gone and did not see me until Monday (12/9) at about 9am. I can not account for my physical disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a cloudy recollection of a dream.  It seemed that I was in a room with two other persons.  One was a man who identified himself as Jake and the other was a woman.  The woman seemed disoriented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was another man present; a small dark figure.  I think he called the other person &#34;gayban&#34;.  They took me into a room and I recall feeling strange sensations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all I can remember.

When we stopped at a red light and in the distance we saw three lights white in color in a straight horizontal line. Which at that point in that distance didn&#39;t seem like much? My girlfriend said it was moving toward us but there were tree&#39;s in front of us though no leaves were on the tree&#39;s it was still hard to get a good description of the object. Then we got the green light and started heading toward the object which stayed in that area for at least 2 minutes before we started heading down Rt. 13. I saw the speed of it as it started to accelerate not super fast but enough to where we couldn&#39;t gain on it and then the weirdest part happened it moved across Rt. 13 with the horizontal lights staying horizontal so basically it didn&#39;t turn like you would think it should have being a normal aircraft instead it strifed or slid across the sky right across Rt. 13????? Then I noticed it slowed down considerably and started to kinda slowly descend and when I got to the light at croydon train station it was like 60 to 70 ft away from my car and then I was astonished because I will admit although I believe a lot of things I am a skeptic and I saw it with 3 white lights in a v triangle shape with a red light in the middle which was not always on it seemed at times to be off and it didn&#39;t make a sound just sitting there in the sky?????(that is not normal for huge engines of man made avionics) then I had to go because I got the green light and it started to move away from us but it was weird how it turned because suddenly the two lights were facing us which told me it just turned and it didn&#39;t really move to do this???<n>

A middle aged couple was driving home on State 254 when they saw 2 boomerang shaped flying craft hovering over a neighbor&#39;s field.  On at least one of the crafts a series of lighted windows could be seen with occupants moving around inside.  When the couple turned around to go down the neighbors driveway, the objects vanished.  They turned around to go home and when they arrived, their college aged daughter was waiting for them.  She had just arrived home from college from the opposite direction and excitedly told them about seeing a triangle shaped object up the road, before they could tell her about what they&#39;d seen.  This area is very rural. I did not personally see this.  I am a friend of the person who owned the field.<n>

Still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m telling this but here goes. Around 12/07/02, at approximately 2330 hours, I observed a very bright, tear drop shaped object, travel from north to south across the eastern sky in relation to my position. The odd thing was that it appeared to travel in an upwards direction and then blinked out of sight. Duration was approx. 1.5 seconds. It was bright white in color and the light tailed behind it or at least appeared to. It is difficult to say since it was travelling so fast. I first chalked it up to something skipping off our atmosphere. Which perhaps is true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing is, I saw the same thing this past weekend, around 01/16/03, at approximately 0230 hours. This one was in the same general area of the sky as before. Except it appeared to travel upwards from south to north, ie: opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what I have been seeing, but these two are not the only strange objects I&#39;ve seen in the sky recently. I work outside at night so I occasionally see objects. These have all caught my eyes as I have been driving. So at least to me they are very noticeable. They have all lasted long enough to get a reasonable look at them. At last eye exam I tested around 20/10, plus I have a stygmatism on top of that, so I&#39;m correctable to even better. Since I spend most of my time in the hours of darkness, perhaps my eyes are more sensitive to movement and light in the sky, and I&#39;m just seeing more of the junk that&#39;s hitting the atmosphere than most others can see. Who knows. I am a college educated professional. I have doubted this stuff, but man, when you see weird stuff you can&#39;t explain, it bothers you and you really can&#39;t tell anyone about it. Especially with what I do for a living, supposed to be the unflappable one. Some who read this will understand what I&#39;m saying with that last statement and wanting to remain anonymous. Anyhow, I see this stuff probably at least once a week over the skies north of Sioux Falls, SD. I see meteorites almost nightly, so I generally notice when somethings a little different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well there you have it, hope this helps some people tell what they have seen. Reading the others on here helped me to do it. All I know is that there have to be more people like me, seeing this stuff and just not saying anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Went from true north from a lower altitude (30 degrees) and shot straight up overhead (90 degrees above the horizon) and disappeared within 1 and one half seconds.  When it disappeared the light did not fade it simply vanised as if it went into a black tunnel.  The background was trees.  We live about nine miles south of Sioux Falls, SD.<n>

I was making dinner when I noticed a star looking shape on the horizan, about SW towards Whibey Island. I had a pair of binculars and looked at the object. It began to flash mutiply color&#39;s; green, yellow, orange, red. It would dime off and on, reapear and disapear, at various times. I began to see 4 other star like balls moving in formation, hovering, disapearing. I got a good look at one of the ball&#39;s. It had a small ball rotating around the bigger ball, while flashing brinlant colors. We watch them and heard pecular sounds like huge jet engines going off. There was nothing around.<n>

When I looked up to see where it was I noticed what I first thought to be a airliner flying at high altitude from east to west.  When it stopped and appeared to be falling i realised it was not an airliner but a dot of light instead.  It seamed to be falling for about ten to fifteen seconds when it suddenly moved back to the west very fast.  That is when I noticed a second dot of light that the first had moved to and stopped.  Both dots of light were stationary at that point and did not appear to be changing altitude.  I called my co-workers to come and look but the dots seemed to slowly gain altitude and fade away before they were able to spot them.  I was a clear day with scattered light clouds and excellent visibility at the time.  It should also be noted that I am a former air defense crew member and have had extensive aircraft recognition training.<n>

As I was walking along the street I saw a light moving fast across the sky out of the corner of my eye.  Immediately I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, however there was a low cloud cover over the city that night and there were two lights, not one.  One was directly above the other and then they started weaving in and out of each others path.  I knew then this was no shooting star as I knew this was no aircraft.  There was no noise coming from the lights and they were too fast and could manouver unlike anything I have ever seen before.  The lights were slightly yellow in colour and would have been about 5km away at less than 1km off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a caller on the radio a few days later describe seeing the exact same lights around the same time fly over in a town about 200km away heading in my direction.  A friend of mine has told me he has seen the same lights a number of times over our region.  He also told me that one time he and some friends were travelling from a nearby city at about 5:30am and stopped in a remote area when one of the passengers saw a light moving in the sky.  They all got out of the car and saw hundreds of lights, like stars, in the night sky moving like they were alive.  This was reported to the local newspaper and another woman in the city reported seeing these lights as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Noticed aircraft lights in the south (learned later a jet had taken off from our local airport around the same time). Felt funny and for some reason looked streight up, staired at the object for what seemed to be about 2 to 4 minutes. It did not move. Best guess it was about 100 to 400 feet right above the area. Very hard to discribe. Around the circomference was like a light rope (beads of light) in a loop surrounding the body of the object. There were four gaps in the loop and between the gaps were four (don&#39;t know what they were) but best discription is, jet nossles like the ones used on the space shuttle. One each pointing out and down in each of the gaps. Emitting, not quite smoke, not quite light, not quite steam, out of each nossle. It remained motionless for the time that I was looking at it. Got in the car and didn&#39;t give it any more thought until today. To my knowledge no one else saw it. I didn&#39;t know what it was and did not understand what it was I saw. Went home, told no one till to day. Thanks for listening. One question for you. Has any one else seen something like this?<n>

Like a bolt of lightning that grew in intensity over time. By the time I had eyes on it and realized that it wasn&#39;t lightning but a fireball, it must have been at about 80° of arc heading quickly toward the horizon from west to east.  I had a fortunate vantage point  as I was facing that direction precisely at the time. It was an awesome sight!  Tied with first for my most impressive fireball observation in my 34 years of life.<n>

Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn&#39;t identify the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;We all just looked at each other like, &#39;What in the world was that?&#39;&#34; Butler said. &#34;I&#39;ve seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain&#39;t never seen anything that color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we&#39;ll never know,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers&#39; trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff&#39;s Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn&#39;t find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff&#39;s departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,&#34; he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, &#34;It could have been. I don&#39;t know.

All the crafts moved very slow to the west. This lasted about 10 min. They slowly moved behind the mountains, as they came near to the mountain top they grew much larger in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a bright flash of white light-something like heat lightning in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess from the angle from that I was is that a landing took place on the old strip mine that is at the mountain top. I will make a trip to the site tom. Also NO sound was made.<n>

We saw a bright light blue ball light up and drop down towards the west. It was almost blinding and only lasted a few seconds. We were on a second story porch, facing the south and it was in the sky at about a 45 degree angle in the sky.<n>

Almost impercetible motion caught my attention in night sky, once I focused on it it was clearly a black V-shaped object, black with no lights but with faint dots on it that looked almost like &#34;stars&#34; painted with glow-in-the-dark paint.  Rest of object was completely black and very hard to see unless you were looking right at it.   It was moving at a good clip with no wind.  No noise whatsoever.  Flew in a straight line from northwest toward southeast, disappeared over buildings within a minute.  Difficult to estimate size or distance due to dark color and no scale of reference.<n>

I saw a very large, exceedingly bright light in the sky.  It did not appear to be moving very fast and I was not at first able to make out any shape.  I kept looking out my window, on the drivers side, of my car.  As I was traveling SE, it appeared to be traveling in a north westerly direction.  As I traveled past it, I was able to quite clearly see the chevron shape of the lights.  I could not determine any shape of the body.  It was too dark and I was traveling approximately 55-60 mph.  My sighting consisted of glancing at the object and back to the road about 7-10 times.  I almost ran off the road twice because I didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of it.  The formation of the lights was one light at its peak, with, I think, 5 additional lights on each side.  The lights were under the craft and exceedingly bright.  They were very clearly round, evenly spaced and on continuously.  They did not blink intermittently or change color and they were of a very brilliant and intense.  The size was immense.  I saw an plane flying in the distance and even taking into account the distance I was from the plane, the size of the plane was about the size of a fly in comparison.  The craft I saw also had one red light at the end of the right side of the other lights and I believe it was blinking.  I am a mother, a professional in finances and am in the church program I was returning from and probably won&#39;t share my sighting with anyone else unless they bring it up.<n>

My husband and my self are in our late 40&#39;s ,college educated ,myself now a full time house wife,my husband holds a managerial position at a local company,our son 13 is in jr.high school.The three of us observed these lights after going out to close up the barn and put the dog up for the night.<n>

I was travelling at approx. 70 mph.  Just past the exit, the highway inclines for a ways, then flattens, and then descends down into a valley.  The Tualatin exit is at the bottom of the valley.  As I began to level out after the incline, I noticed a greenish glowing object streaking across the sky.  The object was also headed north, but was travelling faster than me, and appeared to be on a downward path.  I don&#39;t know how high up in the sky it was...maybe 200-300 feet?  I don&#39;t really have any reference point to provide a good estimate.  It was fairly large, however, and for a moment (because of the whole terrorist scares around the world) wondered if this were a missile about to hit.  It was somewhat spherical, or ovular, almost reminiscent of a comet, but I didn&#39;t think to pay very close attention to the shape.  The object&#39;s speed was constant, and it descended down into the valley (mentioned above).  I fully expected to see/hear an explosion of some sort, as it was descending very quickly, but nothing happened.  I was still too far back to see down into the valley, so I lost sight of it once it went below the top of the hill.  When I began heading down towards the Tualatin exit, I couldn&#39;t find the object anywhere in the sky.  And there didn&#39;t appear to be a crash of some sort (no burning buildings, etc.).  So, I have no idea what happened to it, or what it was.  The duration of time wasn&#39;t any longer than 5 seconds or so from the time I noticed it and the time it vanished.  I didn&#39;t see anything mentioned on the late night news, nor in the newspaper this morning, so I searched the web to see if something was posted about it .  I couldn&#39;t find anything, but I found this site.  So, I&#39;m now just wondering if anyone else saw it and possibly what happened to it once it reached Tualatin.<n>

She was about 5 miles east of Port Angeles very near Sutter Rd. when she saw a green light in the sky. It was on the south side of the highway as she was driving east. She said the light got closer very quickly and at first she thought it was a star or something, but the brilliant green color did not look right. She said the light moved closer quickly and it was approx. the size of about 1/2 the size of a house. It was green with a &#34;frosted&#34; look to it. It slowed down and slowly settled into the forest possible less than 1 mile off the highway. Other cars also saw the light as they slowed down to look too. There were at least 3 other cars; 2 ahead and 1 behind her. She also said as the light settled in the forest, it flared a bright green color which made the trees light-up then they suddenly went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: another strange occurance that night as I heard this morning on KING TV: there was a reported 2.2 earthquake reported at 8:30 pm last night in almost if not exactly same location...strange to say the least?<n>

THIS WAS VERY STRANGE TO ME, SO I WENT INSIDE TO GET MY CAMCORDER.  IT WAS VERY COLD THIS MORNING WHILE I WAS RECORDING THIS OBJECT.  I LOCATED THIS OBJECT AND BEGIN TO FILM.  I THEN ZOOMED IN ON THE OBJECT TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY LARGE AND HAD A UNUSUAL SHAPE.  THE OBJECT WAS FLAT ON THE TOP AND BOTTON, WHILE IT WAS VERY ROUND ON BOTH SIDES.  IT HAD TWO DARK CIRCULAR SPOTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT.  I THEN WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE, BECAUSE OF THE COLD WEATHER.  MINUETS LATER, MY WIFE HAD RETURNED FROM HER DAILY WALK AT THE HOSPITAL TRACK.  I THEN ASKED HER TO COME AND LOOK AT THIS VERY BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY.

For awhile, i thought it was an airplane passing by because the light seemed very bright and close.  It got my attention because it seemed to be getting closer and brighter each time.  so When i got to work Friday December 6, 2002 at 6:00 am, i took some pictures of it with my digital camera.  Only one out of the ten shots I took of the star actually look like a star, the rest of the 9 pictures looked all completely different from each other.  In other words, all ten pictures looked completely differentfrom each other.  None look-alike!!!!! The star seemed to move erradically everywhere, like someone was scribbling across the sky with loops, zig-zags, inter-twining rop-like shape / form.  Some pictures had colors, other were just bright lights( I know for a fact that i can not be shaking my hand that much----I even rested both of my hands on my car to  make sure that the camera is not moving) Two of my co-workers were with me witnessing this event.   We were amazed by it.  Can you explain this???  Am I getting excited over nothing?<n>

SE of Interstate 80, 25 mi. ENE of Elko, NV (Elko County) Number of witnesses: 1 Description: Shape, Size, Altitude, Speed of object all unknown; No discernable features, no lights, just black void in sky casting giant shadow on ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness account: Between 12:30am and 1:00am on a Saturday night in late November or early December of 2002 (not sure of exact date), I was driving my truck northwest on Nevada State Highway 229 just a mile or two north of the Lamoille/Ft. Halleck Road (dirt), from which I had just exited.  I was scouting out good vantage points for nighttime photography of the Ruby Mountains, the west slopes of which were now about 7 miles behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Under a mostly clear sky with a bright moon, I was cruising very slowly along the road, stopping occasionally to glance back and evaluate the panorama for good shooting locations.  This was perfectly safe to do because the road has an EXTREMELY low volume of traffic, especially at night.  As it turned out, on this particular night I encountered no other vehicles on the road.  Hwy. 229 is used primarily for access to local ranches and to the Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge (about 60-70 miles south and lying on the east side of the Ruby Range), and for all practical purposes would give a first-time visitor the impression of being a closed but well maintained seasonal road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just descended into a shallow &#34;dip&#34; in the landscape about a half-mile across and then came to a complete stop.  I turned off my lights so I could better view the full distance behind me under moonlight, and left my engine running just in case I had to quickly clear the way for any approaching traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My truck windows are heavily tinted, preventing one from getting a crystal clear view of distant nighttime surroundings.  Since it wasn&#39;t too frigid outside, I rolled down my driver&#39;s side window to look back toward the mountains and see if any light pollution was visible from rural homes or ranches.  However, this only gave me a good view of everything on my side of the truck, so I had to alternately look through the back window to see the land to the rear and rear right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was turned to my right and looking out the rear window, I became aware that the bright moonlight I had been bathed in all night was suddenly not there.  As I described to a friend recently, what happened during the next few seconds was a lightning fast series of thought processes and internal debates with myself in trying to rationalize why the moonlight was gone when no clouds were present to obstruct it.  At no time was I in a panic.  Everything happened too fast for me to develop any sense of fear about the situation.  Maybe it was because I was preoccupied with my scouting mission and not dwelling on thoughts of being all alone and vulnerable out in the middle of &#34;J.S. Nowhere.&#34; I guess my first reaction was to look up through the rear window thinking I might spot a large owl or other nocturnal bird of prey, which had swooped down low over the truck.  I saw nothing ... and I mean NOTHING ... no moon ... no stars ... just pitch black.  However, the shadow covering me persisted.  I shifted my eyes downward onto the landscape behind me and could see a sharp outer boundary of the shadow about 1/8 of a mile back down the road (beyond that, the land was visibly lit by the moon).  I then spun around and looked out my open driver&#39;s window to see the western boundary of the shadow, about 100 yards away, moving at a brisk pace toward me.  So whatever was casting this shadow was moving west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stuck my head out the window and looked up, but I saw absolutely no discernable shape; just a mysterious mass of darkness the size or altitude of which I simply could not determine.  In the span of about 15 seconds, the shadow moved across the area where I was parked and disappeared over a low hill to the east side of the highway.  The moonlight now once again flooded the truck and immediate surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not having seen or heard the source of the shadow (my truck engine remained running during the incident), I have absolutely no idea how big or how high the object was or how fast it was moving.  All I know is that it was huge enough to cast a shadow I estimate to have been up to 1/4 mile across and moving about 30 - 40 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing about this whole experience is that I never felt frightened or in any kind of danger.  I knew that something strange had just happened, but didn&#39;t really fathom the weirdness of it until sometime later.  In fact, I was only recently prompted to report this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the above is fact as I remember it.  Now for the conjecture.  My belief is that the object was some sort of experimental aircraft, perhaps a mega-sized &#34;stealth blimp&#34; much like that reported numerous times since the early `90s.  I believe one of the most famous sightings of such a craft occurred just a few years ago in southern Illinois.  It was reported by several policemen, who tracked it into Missouri.  If what I witnessed (or didn&#39;t witness) was some kind of experimental military craft, it was far from any test facility, where you&#39;d expect to find such a vehicle.  Could it be that developers wanted to see how far out of the safe zone they could fly this thing without being spotted by the citizenry?  Unless someone else saw it before I did, then the testers succeeded in flying the device some 300 miles from the nearest test site - the Nellis Test Range (part of which is better known as &#34;Area 51&#34;)- before it was spotted ... or at least detected by yours truly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even if anyone else on the ground experienced what I did that night, they were probably just as perplexed as I when they looked up and couldn&#39;t see any definite, solid object in the sky above.  So my question to readers is whether or not anyone else has encountered such a virtually invisible object elsewhere in Nevada or any other place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting sidenote to this:  Just recently, I caught the tail end of a radio news report about an &#34;unknown, unauthorized aircraft&#34; flying low and disturbing livestock on ranchland in the Crescent Valley area (90 miles SW of where my encounter took place).  I didn&#39;t get enough details about that particular sighting, but I gathered from the story that it was a follow-up to a previous report from some weeks prior.  I&#39;m now wondering if that sighting actually occurred the same night as mine.  If there is anyone out there, especially in the Elko, Carlin or Crescent Valley area, who might have more info about the other sighting, I&#39;d like to know so I could follow up and maybe start piecing together the puzzle.  If this is indeed some kind of stealth blimp, how big could it possibly be ... and why would it be so big?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))<n>

I thought it was a helicopter hovering as they do sometimes watching the traffic. I was headed eastbound on Hwy 50 and as I proceeded it became obvious that the craft wasn&#39;t a helicopter because it was much too big and far away. As I got closer to it, it was evident that it had three lights and as I passed near the Cambridge Rd. exit, it was now on the right hand side of the freeway and you could see under it and it was triangular, had three large white lights on the tips of the triangles and a dimmer light in the center, with some smaller little lights around it.<n>
12/5/02 08:56|Richardson|TX|Unknown|90 seconds|daytime stationary black dot aloft showing a brilliant white light|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26484.html|207|ndxe200212| daytime stationary black dot aloft showing a brilliant white light<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was initially seen just under the upper edge of the front windshield of a moving vehicle as the driver attempted to make a left hand turn across oncoming traffic on a city thoroughfare.  It was necessary to focus intermittently on traffic until the vehicle could be stopped in a supermarket parking lot.  At that point, while still visible, the object simply disappeared, leaving nothing but a small and dim point of white light that continued to fade until it too disappeared.  Elapsed time from the initial glimpse until the light faded completely out was less than two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is a 59 year old former police detective who has extensive experience in microwave and RF engineering, and in uplink satellite telecommunications.  He is also very familiar with most types of aircraft including military.  The observer has had no prior sighting experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as a black dot, initially about 1/8 inch in size at arms length.  It was at altitude; although it&#39;s impossible to say how high without a frame of reference for size.  From the observation point it appeared at a heading of about 080 degrees and at an elevation angle of around 40 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the busy airways of the Dallas/Ft. Worth area it would have gone completely unnoticed except that it was showing a brilliant white light similar to that of the landing lights of jetliners but much brighter.  The light was many times the magnitude of the brightest star at night, and was very clearly visible in the daylight.  The object was not moving.  There was absolutely no cloud cover in the entire area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A departing jetliner was in the outbound pattern about 25 degrees to the south of the object appearing to be at around 5-7 thousand feet; but it was not close enough to gain a comparative perspective.  A good guess would be that the object was at at least the same altitude or higher.  There were no other objects aloft that were visible to the observer at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer initially thought that the light was a reflection from the sun on the side of an aircraft until he realized that the object was not moving, was much higher than local helicopter traffic, and that the color and brightness of the light seemed inconsistent with the sun&#39;s reflection.  Within 90 seconds after it was seen, and as the observer gained a stationary vantage point, the object disappeared.  There was a residual point of fading white light clearly visible at the point where the object was located.  This residual light gradually faded completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer was in the area for about five more minutes.  The object did not return or appear elsewhere within visibility.<n>

It moved very slowly for the time I watched it. It was shaped like a squared off boomerange or an L with the short side slanted up slightly. It had six round white lights on one side and four on the other. It was silent moving over the hospital I was at waiting for my daughter to deliver her first child. I backed up watching it as much as possible ruling out everything I could think of that flew around that area. Nothing matched. I looked down for maybe 3 seconds and when I looked up it was gone. I don&#39;t know if it was a ufo but it was something. It was so black that if you weren&#39;t really watching the sky you would have missed it. It was large enough that if it sat down on top of the hospital (San Jacinto hospital) it would be much too large.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not moving at all, not high like an airplane, not a helicopter, not microwave dish.  I was trying to make sense of it because it didn&#39;t move.  After 30-40 seconds, I rounded a curve with trees which blocked my view and when I passed the curve the object was gone- no where to be seen. This frightened me very much and I called 911 to see if anyone else had seen this.  I gave my name and cell phone number.  About 45 minutes later my two children started yelling that there was a rainbow.  I looked out the car window and to the left of the sun (quite a way) there was a light shining in the sky with a vertical rainbow in front of it.  I don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with the other object I saw.<n>

It was cloudy and I saw no stars until I looked over my left shoulder and saw what I thought was one bright star.  I then noticed it was moving slowly SE and thought it might be an airplane but noticed no other lights.  I heard no sound.  I pulled onto the shoulder and stopped to get a better look. As it passed over, I noted it was a &#34;guitar pick&#34; shaped object of a dull metalic color with one &#34;headlight&#34;.It flew at about the height of a low flying airplane.  What really stood out to me was its shape and the fact that it had no wings and no flashing lights like you might see on an airplane. I don&#39;t know what this object was and am interesed in finding out if anyone else saw this.<n>

She told us that the illuminescence of the craft was extraordinary. A &#34;bright white light&#34;.  She informed us that there were other smaller crafts &#34;of light&#34;, different colors, oscillating and circling the larger craft.  She informed us that she called my brother via cell phone as it was happening.  The younger child in the vehicle was frightened.  They pulled over and exited the vehicle.  They told us that there were other vehicles pulled over on the side of the highway watching the crafts.  She took pictures of the crafts.  However, out of a roll of 20+ pictures, they all came out fine except the ones taken of the craft.  Those appeared just &#34;white&#34;.  She did inform me that approximately a week before one of the same sisters saw a strange craft (ufo) in the night sky.  Their home in Monterrey Mexico is basically on a mountain.  From the expanse of their upper middle class home you have a view , panorama, of the entire city below...A million plus.  Their living room is one long window overlooking the city.  She tells me others she knows have taken video.  She wants to look at it to see if it was the same thing seen.  She is sane, yet embarrased.  She told me she never believed, until now.  My brother and I live in McAllen, Texas, approximately a 3 hr. drive from Monterrey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was bored so I was stargazing and noticed a star and it looked strange along the bottom.  It was pretty far away but the light it was giving off looked like a beard along the bottom.  I asked my son to look at the star and tell me what he saw and he said, &#34;It&#39;s moving&#34;.  I thought he was just playing or seeing things but when I took a closer look, it was in fact moving.  It would go rapidly to the left, then the right, and sometimes up and down.  Then it started fluttering in small circles like a butterfly.  I said to my son, who was amazed at what he was seeing, I wonder if this is the only one.  As I started focusing on what looked like stars, I noticed that they were moving too.  I counted more than 20 of them all around.  The closest ones were in the eastern sky and they would get really close and bright and then pull back and fade away and disappear completely, only to reappear a few seconds later.  Some gentleman stopped to try and help us and I asked them if they saw the light moving and they did, but I don&#39;t know who they were.  I snapped a picture of it with my camera.  It had black and white film and I&#39;m not sure how it turned out.  When I develop the film, I will mail it in if it turns out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the sighting may have been the result of looking at celestial bodies, possibly twinkling stars.

I was with a friend , we were standing at the front of my house and talking when I looked at the sky to admire the night and suddenly &#34;an airplane-like  object&#34; caught my eye - I would say it was an airplane at the beginning because the lights were apparently like an airplane&#39;s lights (green and yellow)-I think because it was flying vertically between one star  and the formation of three stars in a row. I knew something was not normal,like an airplane way of flying because of the speed and you don&#39;t see planes flying &#34;vertically&#34; far, far away in distance . Then the &#34;plane&#34; stopped in between those stars and suddenly it changed or &#34;rotated&#34;. I actually had the impression the object rotated on its axis and show other view of it. What I saw where three lights rotating (yellow like) in a triangular shape the lights were round and they seemed to be rotating.The object remained stationary for a few seconds and then flew away like sinking in the sky at a tremendous speed until it couldnot be seen anylonger.<n>

While walking, I noticed a very bright light coming from the southern sky &amp; assumed it was a plane or helicopter.  As I watched it, it was moving fairly fast &amp; the closer it got, the brighter it got,  I then thought perhaps it was a plane in trouble, etc.  As it come closer, it was descending rapidly, &amp; then passed maybe 1/2 mile in front of me, barely over the tree tops!!!  It was a round glowing white ball of light and had a tail attached to it.  It was moving fairly fast but was very distinctive.  It was so low that I thought it was going to hit our barn but it must have come down in a field close by.  I did not hear anything when it &#34;landed&#34;.  I woke my husband up &amp; we noticed that in the sky there was a &#34;path&#34; or rather a &#34;band&#34; in the sky where this object had traveled from south to north.  Sort of like a vapor trail left by big jet aircraft.  Our question is, what would this have been?  I called the local airport, the FAA in Baltimore, &amp; I got the impression that they thought I was a nut.  All I can say is that I am a professional person, in my forties, and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  Please advise as to what this could have been.<n>

It was flying extremely fast and &#34;silent&#34;, no sound(s) at all. It had two plumes, one on each side and to the rear of it, of very bright, but not blinding, white light and also two plumes of reddish/orange light located in the inside of but seperate from the two white plumes but much shorter in length than the white plumes. The white light, I assume, illuminated the valley floor and the sides of both mountains as bright or brighter than daylight. It was traveling from the SW to the NE at an approximate coordinates of N 40 00.182&#39; and W 078 46.489&#39;. I only saw it for a second or two at most for a distance of maybe 3,000 feet until it flew out of sight and the entire area returned to darkness.

Only viewed for perhaps 5 to 7 seconds until it went out of view due to the house.  I ran outside but by then it had burned out. I suspect either space debris or meteor re-entering atmosphere, but was faster, closer, lower to horizon, brighter and with longer tail than any meteorite I&#39;ve ever seen!  The size and brightness would seem to indicate it was relatively close to my location, however no sonic boom was heard.<n>

The treelines hindered my view somewhat but it only lasted about a minute or several seconds.  It was very bright and moved very rapidly and would have appeared to be over Beverly looking toward the distant horizon.  This was very unusual and really caught my attention.<n>

It went from west to east faster than anything I ever saw. Bear Valley joins Short mtn. short is about 2 1/2 miles wide on top .  When I first saw it , it was standing still then when I told my buddies to look it streaked across the top of Bear Vally Mtn. It was the first day of hunting season and I know more people saw it other than us three.<n>

The craft returned 3 weeks in a row, but I only saw it myself clearly the one night. I was working behind a cotton gin here. I was taking a break between loading trucks when I first heard it approaching. It made a humming noise like a huge generator makes. I can&#39;t be positive about the shape except that it was a lot longer than it was wide. It had 3 red marker lights in the shape of a funny triangle. It must have been about 300 yards long @ least. It took approximately 15 minutes for it to pass from the point where it first came into sight until it disappeared on the far horizon. I could see the black outline around the 3 marker lights. It was definitely one long object. the marker light were in this approximate shape:  O    O    O   The next week my wife was working @ a convenience store when it passed over, the Fast Stop on Hwy 385 here in Lubbock. It was the same object. Another friend a few blocks from there saw the same object a week later. This time it passed over further toward Levelland. We didn&#39;t see it for a while after that, but one night my wofe heard the same noise again &amp; went outside &amp; saw it hovering over our area of the city. She said it was huge. A bright light was shining out of the bottom of it &amp; going up &amp; down the next street over from us, 14th Street. it hasn&#39;t been back that we&#39;re aware of since then. We heard it once since, but we didn&#39;t see it @ all. We&#39;d like to know of any other reports you&#39;ve received about any similar objects in our area in the last 2 years please.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first we thought they were satellites, since we have previously seen satellites flying in the night sky at our home in California, but this time the objects were flying at a much greater speed than we have ever seen before and, also, the objects were flying in a straight line course then instantly changed their course of direction into an an east-to-west direction (for example, flying north-to-south, then instantly heading in an east-to-west direction).  Both my sister and I have over 30 years working for the Department of Defense and neither of us are aware of any aircraft that can instantly change directions such as what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Error in date above.

There was flashing red lights on every side. These lights were not very bright but very much brighter then an planes lights. The craft flew horizontily in a spinning motion. This motion was not a fast spin but more like a rotation. It was hard to tell which part of the craft was spinning the outside or the inside. It came very close to hitting another flying aircraft which might have been a plane. A minute or so later there were many other flying aircrafts farther away probably planes however it was to far away to see. The object flew very slow and low to the ground,but still well above the height of our house, and lasted around ten seconds. After seeing the aircraft the house plumming backed up and the toilets started bubbling and no one could use the bathroom or run any water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a student in the 7th grade.

At about 8:12 PM EST there was a bright pale blue flash which lit up the sky and area we were driving in.  Everything lit up, so we could not tell which direction (if any) the light came from.  It &#34;seemed&#34; to be either from above or that we were &#34;within&#34; the flash.  The street lights all went out, but power to homes remained on.  There was no sound.  The sky was clear, slight winds (maybe 5 mph) and the temperature was around 32 degrees F.  We continued driving towards home and when we got to another area of street lights, they were also out, but beginning to come back on.  This area was one mile southwest of the point where we saw the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the event might have been caused by the explosion of one of the local transformers.

If it was daylight and they were not illuminated I would guess it was a flock of geese. It appeared like a typical formation of birds, but the shape changed as it moved across the sky. At times it looked more like a string of illuminated pearls. Maybe it was just geese catching the lights from Manhattan. I&#39;d never seen anything like it before. I watched it for about a minute. Then it was just gone. Any guesses as to what I might have seen?<n>

Almost every night after dark we observe strange lights hanging on the sky. Some of them change color (blue to red). They do not stay at the same spot and they move forward, backward, up and down. More strange, when we flash a strong light through one of these objects, they slowly go back and dissepear, then they come back to the same spot. Sometimes, they move so fast from one spot to another that they leave a light track. Some of them come down over a coil mine which is about 10 km away from us. Sometimes dogs start barking, we go out, check arround but we could not see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time of alleged sightings are not indicated by witness.  PD))<n>
