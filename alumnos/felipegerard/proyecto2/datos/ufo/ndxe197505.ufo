Just rose up and eventually disappeared into stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in middle school which is why I stated 1975 but I am unsure if it was 1976.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large dark object with rotating lights slowly lowered itself down toward our house.  It was the size of a baseball field and triangular shaped (per lights).  I can remember as it hovered over top of our tree tops that I realized it would land on our house.  My mother stood outside staring at it while my two sisters and I ran to our basement out of fear.  I just remember thinking how quiet it was. The rotating lights were the only way you could sense it was moving.  It wasn&#39;t until our mother also became afraid of it as it was so close.  Once that happened, it slowly raised up.  We then all ran to our large picture window and watched as it slowly just went up toward the stars and actually eventually blended in with them.  I was terrified at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all drew a picture that night and I remember our mother told us not to say anything because no one would believe us anyway.  It wasn&#39;! t until recently I mentioned something to one of my siblings and they just blurted out about that same incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near a PP &amp; L power substation and on a farm.  I often thought our front yard looked almost like a cleared runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I always wanted to discuss this with Dr.Schumacher but his untimly demise saddened us all. I have had three other sightings but I have no frame of reference in currently accepted reality to explain them as I can with the lunar impact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly prior to the moon entering its peach orange phase preceding the full lunar eclipse, I saw an explosion on the moon that briefly extended from the 11 o&#39;clock postion outward into space to a distance of .20 lunar diameters. It dissipated quickly followed by an after shock less than a third the size of the first impact. Note I could only see the explosion from the edge of the moon outward into space. Only the black background of space allowed me to see this event which lasted an entire 4 seconds and fading to nothing in 6 seconds. While in Rochester I witnessed an inexplicable passage of two globes of soft nebulus lights six to eight inches in diameter. One followed two feet behind the first in the same trajectory. THEY WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH SOLID MATTER , PASSING THROUGH BRICK WALLS WITH ABSOLUTLY NO IMPEDENCE I tried to touch one of the globes. It had no discernable surface and with some trepidation I hesitated to penetrate its outer haze and it continued to pass through an inner wall about a foot below the ceiling. Since this event I do not recall a single week that I don&#39;t relive those brief moments. In fact my study of Hyperspace and 4th dimensional physics has been a great solace in understanding events we weren&#39;t taught in school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two friends and I were camping on the shore of Atwood lake and talking about what we going to do that coming summer, when we became aware that an odd silence had come over the lake. The lake area in early spring was usualy rife with animal and insect sounds and we became slightly alarmed. A few seconds later my freind saw the object. It was roughly the size of a house and glowed a yellowish white light that pusated. It&#39;s shape was triangular. It made no sound. After about two minutes the object steaked away at a speed that left a trail of light simmilar to those left on phtographs when filming fast moving, illuminated obects. We all became very freigtened and ran the 100 or so yards to my haouse and reported it to our parents, who dismissed it out of hand.<n>

We were talking and laughing but the light was till in front of us. we were still driving toward the light.We went down in a dip in the road and came out to see the light again. and i said off the top of my head that it was a UFO and we both laughed. We went down in another bottom and when we came out we were looking at a UFO . This ufo was tree top high and was 30 to 40 feet around with lights that blink around the object.We were in a 66 chev, i rolled down the window and climbed out on the window ceil. looking straight up at this ufo We were still driving down the road with the ufo right above us. there was no sound,this went on foraround 5 min.then like a sparkler at night that you swing around you seeing  the light trail the craft was gone. We were not going to say anything to anyone when we got back home but when we got to my house our wifes wanted to no what was wrong , the 11:00 news was on the TV . Os we started telling them and as we thought they laughed well at that time the news man told off a state patrol officer crossing over six flags and the river sighted and reported a ufo.things where different after that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/15/75 13:00|Denton|TX|Other|2 minutes|bright red, heart shaped vehicle flying above tree tops mid-afternoon on a clear, sunny day day|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70595.html|7|ndxe197505| bright red, heart shaped vehicle flying above tree tops mid-afternoon on a clear, sunny day day<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was sometime mid-afternoon on a bright sunny day.  I am not sure of the exact year but it was most likely in the mid 1970&#39;s.  I grew up as an Air Force brat and my father was chief executive officer (director) for the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH for 5 years. Therefore, I am and was familiar with nearly every aircraft our military has flown. At the time of the sighting, I lived on a 98-acre farm just north of Denton,TX, and I was a high school teacher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The farm was located in a creek bottom area in a flood plain adjacent to Core of Engineers property. My mail box was located about 1/4 mile from the house on the blacktop road above (elev.) the creek bottom. As I got out to check my mail, the object flew directly over me and across the tree tops in a NW direction. My description of the object and event: Bright fire-engine red heart-shape like a thick, fat Valentine heart (the pointed end of the heart was the forward or leading edge); no visible windows: no noise; no vapor trail; air speed was about 50 to 60 mph; flew in a straight line only, no turns. I am guessing that it flew only about 100 to 200 feet above me and estimate it&#39;s size to be in length and width approx. about the same as an F-16 fighter jet, it was in a thick, heart-shape as I stated earlier. I knew immediately that this was not something I could explain or that it was anything I had seen before. I was excited, jumped back into my truck as I watched in cruising away, and raced to the house to ask my wife and a girlfriend of hers if they saw it or heard anything since the object had to fly almost directly over the farm house. They did not hear or see anything. I drove back to the mail box so I could see over the trees and of course it had disappeared. I don&#39;t know why I never reported this until now except that I have never seen or heard of a report of a UFO that describes something similiar or exactly what I saw. I know what I saw, it was a perfectly clear day, and it was too close to me for me to be mistaken or confused about its description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I made a whirling noise and every time the main body revolved around the stationary dome on top at a certain point around the periphery a flash of light and a blip sound occured.The underbelly was concave thetop half had a rim that was flat for about a foot towards the center then it was dished down and ran flat to the half spherical dome which did not rotate.as the disc rotated faster the blip and flash occured faster with the increasing rotation.all this time it gave off the spectrum of light in varrying colors around the upper rim,then it took off so fast you would say in the blink of an eye<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOST TWO HOUR&#39;S<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

5/5/75 02:00|Jacksonville|NC|Sphere|Approx.4minutes|Silent rocking 4ft silver sphere hovering 2ft of the ground with tremendous takeoff speed.|9/15/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46088.html|11|ndxe197505| Silent rocking 4ft silver sphere hovering 2ft of the ground with tremendous takeoff speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1975 I was a marine stationed at Camp Lejeune. North Carolina. I was a military policeman and was working the graveyard shift with my partner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned down this certain street I noticed a silvery light about 100 yards away on the left side of the road.I told my partner to check it out and to keep his eyes on it since I was driving.  As we got within 50 yards or so I could not figured out what the light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that maybe, since the light was near a trash dumpster, that an scavanging animal had maybe pulled out a plastic bag and it was reflecting back our headlight beams. This part of the base is near a wooded area right next to a large inlet of water, so I thought that my animal theory was probably correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to about 25 yards away from the light to my surprise it was not an animal with plastic trash bag but a silvery color sphere about approximately 48 to 60 inches wide.  It hovered off the ground approximately 2 ft.  It made no noise and just kinda floated just a bit to and fro.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had slowed my patrol vehicle to less than 5 miles per hour and was slowly inching our way towards the sphere.  At about 10 yards away from the object, I got a good look at it.  It didnot have a smooth surface but rather a surfaced made of crumpled tin foil and every time it shifted positions it would reflect our headlight beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time my partner was mesmerized he seem to be in a trance and would not answer my questions.  At this time I grabbed hold of my spotlight control and aimed at the object. The object began to move to the edge of the road. I then shot it with the spotlight beam and the object stopped and rotated on its axis several times and than shot across the road at a tremendous rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so fast that one second it was right in front of us then it was gone leaving like a trail of light behind it. &#39;&#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It dissappeared into a patch of trees. I had been in radio communications with my Desk Sargeant who had dispatched some backup patrols to my location but they got there to late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After searching the area for more than an hour we finally call it quits and I went back to the station to submit my report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this time my partner never spoke a word he was in some kind of shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5/1/75 17:00|Reno|NV|Disk|2 minutes|A disk shape hovering over my apartment building in broad daylight in a busy city.|1/3/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15639.html|12|ndxe197505| A disk shape hovering over my apartment building in broad daylight in a busy city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened when I was 15 years old. My mother had taken me, my brother,my friend, and her roommate to get Kentucky Fried Chicken in her van. When we got back to the entrance of our apartment building (The Village of the Pines on 700 E. Peckham Ln.) my mother yelled, &#34;look at that&#34; and pulled off on the street (not entering the driveway) and we all got out and looked at this weird round thing hovering over the apartments. It seemed to me that the top 1/3 of the craft had windows and I remember trying to see if I could make out the shadows of the people(?) moving around inside. The bottom of the craft was lit up but did not seem to be bright (it was still daylight). There was a slight humming sound the whole time, then it went off over the back part of the apartment complex. It did not &#34;zip&#34; off, but seemed to be at a fairly regular plane speed. The strange thing is that the roommate and my brother immediately afterward claimed they didn&#39;t see a thing, even though I remember them wondering aloud as to what it might be. I have always personally thought that it might have been some kind of top secret aircraft of the US government. This apartment building is directly acrtoss a K-Mart, and is close to the airport. It was daylight on a busy street, and a few cars did stop, but I don&#39;t remember anyone else getting out.  I have never reported this sighting as it always seemed to weird. This incident did get me interested in the subject of UFO&#39;s but I have never seen a description like mine. This is the main reason why I think it may have been some kind of test craft.<n>
