I just passed the intersection of State road 69 and county road 274.  At this time a glanced south at rain clouds that were forming from thunderheads.  Lightning started flashing from the clouds and thunder could be heard very loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While i was glancing south I observed a silver looking cylinder shaped object approximately (50) fifty feet long, streak across the sky then fly behind the cloud that was producing lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then pulled over to the shoulder of the road and cut of my engine and started watching the cloud.  The cloud was approximately one hundred yards long and 125 yards high and about 5 miles from my location where I had a great view.  (farm land went about 3/4 of a mile away and then it started with planted pine trees ten feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 minutes, I observed a portion of the object come out of the north end of the cloud.  About 10 minutes later, the object came out at a high rate of speed from, the south end of the cloud and vanished into higher clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had cut off my engine so I could hear if there was any sounds coming from the object.  I never heard any sound, even when it left the dark cloud flashing with lightning unless the thunder covered it up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this has been around 30 years ago, but I recall it like it was yesterday.  Sorry i took so long reporting this but I never thought anyone would believe me, but after hearing you on Coast to Coast for the past year and a half, I decided to make a report because the info was still fresh in my mind after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why do you think it stay in the cloud that was producing lightning?  I wondered if it could detect me and was hiding, or was getting some energy from the lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yea...it came out of the south end of the cloud, and then made a sharp turn to the west and started heading up into the high hanging clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks so very much for all that you do to keep this program moving forward.<n>

This is a reoccuring event worthy of investigation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived out in the countryside while I was growing up.  As children, all us neighborhood kids would ponder the wonders of the great night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the latter half of the 70&#39;s roughly the summer of 78&#39;s several of us saw an object dart from place to place at incredible speed only to jart off in another direction at impossible angles of trajectory.  We summoned our parents who also witnessed this event only to get the shoulder shrug, oh well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part 2. 1984, 5.5 miles north of home. A friend was having problems with his soon to be wife. We took a drive so as he could discuss his problems. Upon driving for no apparent reason I sugested we pull over and talk about his problems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 6 or 7 minutes everything changed from &#34;personal problems&#34; to what is passing in front of us. The object was and is not of this earth.The night was peacefull, a gently breaze if best. A field of crickets chirped as in a wave like sound ( if one has been in th country they know the sound) the object moved with exacting precision.At this point I said tho my buddy, Lets get out and stand on the car. I told him immediatly it was a u.f.o. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the point the object entered our plane of view, the crickets stopped. no sound, a pin drop dead silence.The object passed by approximately 300 ft. away, following the contour of the ground, up a small hill and over the top and down the other side, out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I told my friend that it was going to a large 15 acre pond/lake. This pond/ lake  is very deep. left over glacial sink hole approximatley 100 -125ft deep. I know this because I hunted the land years earlier. It is private land.I also knew whatever it was knew we were there. I told my friend &#34;lets wait a minute because it will be back&#34; Less than 2 minutes had bassed and The object returned up over the hill, only with an intensely bright ambure essence light, scanning the ground back and forth as if searching. Note: the craft is only feet over any brush or tree at any given time, following the conture with precision. At this point the objet was directly in fron of us, slowly comming closer.I felt a sensation only experienced when I had dental x-rays bluured vision. I asked my frfiend if he had felt anything wierd and he had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We opted to leave immediately. jumped in the car and left. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT ! I could not leave the scene entirely so we apt to view from a distance. A half mile north was a paralell road to view with caution. Apon driving there another object with the same intense light came almost straight down into the same area. With this we left. apon arriving home my ever trusty cat freaked out. my brother and his friend asked what was wrong with us because we didn&#39;t look right. I explained the event without fanfare. The cat would not come near me for 2 days. Never before or since has this occured, animals are sensitive plain and simple. LIFE GOES ON : several years pass. 4 to be exact. August 1988. Apon driving home, again I see what I know is not a star, planet etc... Same vacinity as child hood,as well as the very close expeience. Nervous I drive north again 5.5 miles. As I approach the same spot, it becomes apparent that the object is large, stationary and when I stopped and turned off the car, dead silent.After observation for approx. 5 minutes taking all vantage points, marking distance at about 1100 ft. and general observation. the object began to move. I got in my car and idled at a pace of 5 mph. for a quarter mile, watching in awe. The object increased speed, I followed up till120 mph. at this point the object shot like a cannonto approx 15 miles in two seconds, no more.Again awe.More years go by. I see an old friend that lived within a quarter mile of these occurances. I casually ask if he had ever seen anything of the sort. Yes , many times, unexplainable , remarkable movement that nothing of this earth can produce. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS EVENT COULD BE CAPTURED IF SOMEONE HAD THE TIME TO OBSERVE AREA FOR ROUGHLY 2 WEEKS ANY GIVEN AUGUST.. FOR THAT IS WHEN I FEEL IT MAKES A REGULAR APPEARENCE. If I had equipmentIE:proper video, camera electronic sensors etc. and a little more time I know there would be no argument as to the validity of other life. This is no joke and I wish some day to have time and resorces to accomplish and prove with hard evidence the reality of life elsewhere. Sorry for the lengthy explination. there are more examples which may take a little more time to devulge into. Sincerely, Joseph Deutsch<n>

My Brother (12 years of age)and I (9 years of age) were in our bedroom,at the front of the house and on the upper floor, when we both noticed an object on the other side a the road, 20 meters away, hovering above a fir tree. The object was approximatley 1.5 meters in diameter and PERFECTLY spherical. It was metallic in colour, roughly the colour of iron, which was constant throughout the sphere. It did&#39;nt seem to have any markings or openings. We both were familliar with weather ballons and other air filled objects, and it definately wasn&#39;t an air filled object, it definatley had a SOLID SHELL. It would be best described as a ball bearing 1 meter wide. It remained there for what seemed 10 minutes and didn&#39;t move a CENTIMETER. At that point we BOTH ran downstairs and out the front door, this must have taken a MAXIMUM of 6 - 7 SECONDS, when we opened the front door it had dissapeared. We had a clear view of the sky in all directions, approximatley 30 degrees from the horizon and above, but there was nothing to be seen. From that day i have had strange nightmares, and when i get them they cause me to be sick when i wake up, these i havn&#39;t had for a few years now. END OF REPORT Many thanks ((name deleted))<n>

We wondered why an automobile would be in the middle of a field.  Shortly after spotting the lights, the lights rose straight up in the air.  Then the red lights went off and other colored lights came on.  The lights were blue, green, and white.  The craft moved slowly to the left and came out of the area of the field and moved toward the road where our car was.  At this point my father stopped the car and told me to lean out and see if it was making any noise.  The craft was at this point directly over our car.  I opened the car door and leaned out of the car and looked up and saw the craft was a triangular shape with rounded points.  It appeared to be grey and was moving so slowly over the car is was almost floating.  It made no noise what so ever and it was only approximately 30 feet above our car.  I closed the door and my father drove off I&#39;m sure from fear.  We didn&#39;t spot the craft after that but at one point on our return trip through the same country route we did spot the same type lights off in the distance though we weren&#39;t sure it was the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Moves slow &amp; quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize this is almost twenty years later, but I was not aware of this database till now. I was driving home from a friends house in Patterson NY, and by the time I was coming down route 22 in to Brewster, I saw what looked like a long line of white &#34;Christmas lights&#34; in the sky, which took on more of an enormous &#34;V&#34; shape as I got closer to, and more underneath it. I pulled in to a supermarket parking lot to view it better, and to my amazement it was moving or &#34;drifting&#34; at maybe 1000 feet off the ground, with an amazing span that nearly crossed the sky North to South. It was moving (drifting) West to East, and made almost no sound. It was moving much slower than any conventional aircraft, and seemed to &#34;fade off&#34; behind the treeline at a certain point, at which the lights that had been small and piercing white became orange, then red as it got behind the trees. The altitude may have been less than I first thought on account of how quickly it became obscured in the trees at such a slow speed...almost &#34;setting&#34; into the forest line. I jumped in the car and followed it for a few miles to a resevoir where it eventually faded off behing the surrounding hills. I had nobody with me at the time, but in the parking lot I was going to point it out to others who were there, only to notice them already standing around and pointing to it. I didn&#39;t talk to them, as I thought it would be more interesting to &#34;chase&#34; it. Months later, I saw a similar phenomenon near Lake Peekskill, NY while driving, but it was further away. The second one had two small airplanes chasing after it. This one, too disappeared (floated) behind trees and hills. There was an article in the local paper around that time explaining that many had seen it; and they left a phone number for reports. I left a report on their machine, and did not hear back from anyone. My friends still laugh about it, although it intrigues them at the same rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sorry I am so broad on the years – I am almost 40 now but I know it was in that time frame.  We lived in Stamford, CT on the Darien line (which is East of Stamford).  It was an August night around 9 pm and there was a meteor shower that night, but the odd thing was the meteors were red balls zooming from the North toward the West.  For some reason I remember counting 13 of these red balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some strange reason after the red balls stopped my brother and I were drawn to the edge of the driveway toward the street.  At the same time we both looked up to the East and saw this MASSIVE, bright orange object hovering in the sky fairly low – just above the tree line.  The shape from our perspective was disc-like.  We stared at this massive object in disbelief, but then my brother asked me, “Is that the moon”?  As soon as he asked that question this object shot to the South towards NYC and flipped end over end until it disappeared behind a building and into the horizon.  As a note, when the object zoomed toward the south a blue/green electrical charge emitted from the ground.  My brother and I were completely speechless.  In fact, I don’t think we ever talked about that incident until I recently brought it up to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days after this experience I remember my brother saying he had a dream about watching a UFO fly away from our bedroom and into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this incident I have seen many strange “lights” in the sky.  Most of the “lights” I see in the sky are crystal blue in color and travelling way too slow to be a meteor and silent.  I have showed a friend the “lights” and when my twin visited from Australia I was able to show him.  These events occurred from June 2010 to present day at my mother’s home in Stamford, CT.  The lights would usually appear from the North/Northwest and travel southeast, but the insane thing is the light would disappear above her house! I appreciate your time and maybe some other watchers have seen what my brother and I have seen.  Or maybe we have some kind of connection with other worldly beings?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/84 21:00|South Glens Falls|NY|Cigar|5 mins|We saw a cigar-shaped object fly and then land.|8/11/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38325.html|8|ndxe198408| We saw a cigar-shaped object fly and then land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the year or the exact time but I know it was between the time I started driving and graduation so that gives me some time reference. At the time this happened, we were both in high school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving around our neighborhood. It was cool out but not so bad. I was riding and I had my window down. As we came to a stop sign near our elementary school, I looked up and saw what I thought was a plane. I said to my friend, &#34;Damn! That plane is really low!&#34; She peered out of the front window and said, &#34;That&#39;s no plane!&#34;  Just as she said that, I realized that despite it being very very low (we could see the lights on it) there was no noise. It hovered over the school and then took off to the west at a leisurely pace. It was in no hurry. We followed it with no problem down the road about a mile or two and then made a turn towards town. We could still see it without any trouble. Then, it started to descend into a clump of trees. That area had been a house but the house had been torn down due to it being right near a toxic dumpsite. The area was fenced off but we knew we could get in there if we wanted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started to turn up the dirt road/driveway and then we came to our senses. There were no lights from that area, just darkness. We turned around and she hit the gas. We talked about how they probably could hear us now and we both yelled out that we were going home and we weren&#39;t going to bug them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we squealed into my driveway, we started yelling out the windows for my parents to open up the garage door. When they didn&#39;t hear us, we scrambled out of the car and ran screaming up to the front door. We were really spooked by what we had seen and didn&#39;t really care that we were not acting like the cool teenagers we were. I knew my mom wouldn&#39;t doubt me as she had seen a UFO back in her college days in Nebraska. We told her what happened and then we never spoke of it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it like it was just yesterday. It looked like a plane but then I noticed it had no wings. The lights were similar to a plane&#39;s ... the red and green but I remember they were really really big and there were three in a line on each side. There was no sound, no noise, no vibration and had it been a plane, there would have been because it was so low. It was shiny but I don&#39;t remember it being any color in particular. As it landed, it was going down fast enough that it should have kicked up a lot of dust or a cloud of some kind but it didn&#39;t. As it landed, the lights, which had been steady up to then started to ... like blink in a pattern. Red white green down a line. Once it time to land, there was no glow from the area .. just darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at my boyfriends house I went out and Saw what everyone was looking at (Many people on the street were standing infront of their houses looking up) this craft was huge it had lights all around the perimeter Like a floating football field. And it made no sound.  It seemed to be following the street...which was a dead end so the police cars which came wizzing along had to turn around and go back the way they came when it glided on past.  There was talk about the sighting for a breif time but excuses were made that some jokers from west point were flying in formation. Also A blimp was mentioned I believe.  I know it was not the airforce flying in formation, Because the lights were all connected. I could tell this because the distance between them remained fixed. Also what I saw was very low and made no sound. I am skeptical about the blimp explaination because It was not confirmed that there was infact a blimp hovering around after dark at that time...I would hope the police would know of such an event. But they didn&#39;t.  This was a long time ago but I recently saw a similar craft cought on video on T.V. Also some I witness accounts were Familiar From the lights to the slow speed to the lack of sound.  And this account came from a police officer I was hoping it was the same sighting I was wittness to but it wasn&#39;t. I have heard nothing else about the event.  I looked online to try and find some record. I thougt that maybe someone else would corroborate the event for me but I see no listings For Croton - On - Hudson.<n>

Everyone left to go home except my friend from next door and myself. We were sitting on the sidewalk in between our homes talking when we both saw movement above our heads and looked up. The triangular shaped object, about 18-20&#39; long seemed to be following the direction of the road (North) then it physically turned (not banked) left. I say it turned because at the speed it was traveling (about 60-70 MPH), it any plane would have needed to bank. It flew right above the tree tops (approx. 40-50 feet), made no sound (but a slight whoosh), had no lights, was completely black, didn&#39;t shake the trees, and had no flame from behind (like the flame from a jet). We sat there looking in the sky for about another hour hoping it would come back, completely dumbfounded. We thought it was strange that we would see such a thing in our neighborhood (very busy suburb of Philadelphia) and we were only 12 miles from the Philadelphia International Airport. I would have thought that the airport would have seen it on radar. I can&#39;t be sure of the date, but I know it was summer and we were 13, or 14 (either 1983 or 1984). The closest movie type space craft I could relateit to was a star fighter from Battlestar Galactica. It seemed to be a triangular shaped pyramid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing is, my brother-in-law saw the same thing on the same street approximately 10 years later. My sister told me he saw it and he said he would tell no one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

It moved in one direction, then stopped, stayed immobile for a few seconds, then started to move in another direction, and stopped again.  It repeated that sequence many times.  There were no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, having dinner before going back to work.  The sky was clear, i.e., no clouds, and it was daylight.   This was not a satellite, a helicopter, an airplane, a meteorite or northern lights.  I have seen many of those and the behavior of that light was nothing like it.  This was not Venus or Jupiter.  It was as bright as Venus, but was moving rapidly instead of the slow motion that a planet would display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a scientist with a B. Sc. in physics and a Ph.D. in molecular biology.

No moon as I recall, the sky was very black and the stars shone brightly.  My fiancé at the time (now husband of 22 years) and I were stargazing on the beach off of Lincoln St. on the boardwalk.  To the left of us was Kennedy Space Center, to the right of us The Pier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to note that there were no launches that night.  Since I grew up in Cape Canaveral this I would have remembered along with seeing these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly out of no where there appeared a very bright light that seemed to change in colors.  The object hovered above the ocean just to the right of the Space Center.  It would move in and outward, then it would appear to rise in the sky and drop suddenly and stop.  It moved in directions that I have never witnessed before!  It made no sound that we could hear, only the oceans waves were heard.  A second object then appeared and both of these moved around almost as if following each other, then at other times they would be doing different things.  One would be moving towards the beach and one would be rising up or down above the ocean.  We both have never seen any aircraft move so effortlessly in a manner that these objects did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I both asked each other if we were both witnessing the same thing, wondering if we had lost our minds!  We watched the objects for probably a good 15 minutes doing it’s dance in the sky.  Suddenly the first one or lead object seemed to move in quickly at us (but still kept a distance away), like it knew we were watching it, then backed off to where it was then in a flash both of them were gone leaving what seemed to be a streak in the dark sky where they had moved so quickly out of our site. Not a trail, but a streak that vanished in a second!  Over the years we have told many of our friends of our experience, but never thought to report the incident until I ran across your site.  I have looked to see if others perhaps saw these objects that night, but did not find any.  Since I can not remember the exact date I will have to estimate it.  I know that this happened in 84, it was in the summer months and it was before we married in 1985.  Sorry I wish I would have wrote now the date and kept it somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We have assigned an artificial date and time to the case.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possible abduction from my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just laid down when I heard a high pitched whirring sound.Then a extremely bright light came through my window. I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember I was lying on a bed or table. The feel and look of the table was cold and had a gray porcelan look to it. It did not have legs but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver blanket it did not feel as if were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside the table I believe 2 on one side and 3 on the other. On the side with 3 one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to communicate to me telepathically I do not remember him speaking to me directly. I&#39;m not sure of the color but they were medium hieght. With two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth.  He informed me that I would not remember this, that I would not be harmed and they would try not to hurt me. I remember this light above my head, it started at my head and slowly and extremely painfully moved down my body. It felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When it got to my feet it stopped I was in alot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going tp puke as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point I began pleading to be let go that it was to painful I could not take it. The being at my head then said something to the being that I took to be in charge thay seemed to have a little heated arguement. He turned to me and told me that I had years earlier ask them to come and that I would not resist. Then I remembered yelling into the sky years earlier with a friend that I wanted to meet and would be willing to be examined by a UFO. Now that they were doing it he said I was whining about it. A few more words were exchanged with his boss and the light began its trip back up. The one comforting me said &#34;We are sorry if we harmed you and scared you&#34; I lost it. I remember feeling  the beam place me in my bed and as I looked up the light left my room. I was scared ((word deleted)) I ran to my parents room crying and then I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. My parents dismissed it. A few days later on the news a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city close to where I live. I have told only a few people but we joke about it. However I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I remember it and I have tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my abduction. I trie! d to be calm and remember as much as I could because I knew no one would believe me. I think they put me back before they had finished. I was 21 or 22 years old. Non smoker, non drinker and I did and do not use drugs.<n>

My brother and I were traveling on a rural road near our parents home and saw a bright red light through the trees ahead.  As we approached it we saw a very large object hovering at about twice the height of the large trees in the area.  I remember describing it as football shaped and about as large as a football field. We saw many lights other then the large red light.  There was at least one green light and many white lights.  My brother stopped the car just after we had passed under the object. He got out of the car to get a better view, but I could see it fine over my shoulder out of my window.  I remember hearing a very loud &#34;jet engine&#34; type of sound.  We watched as the object slowly moved back in the direction that it had come from.  The entire incident took about 5 minutes.  One interesting note is that my mother, who often traveled the same road late at night, had reported seeing a ufo several times.  She was too scared to get a good look at it as she hurried home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Unseen source of light.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15056.html|16|ndxe198408| Red glow from object. Hovered over pond. High in the sky. Unseen source of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Full Story. Me and my brother were fishing at McFalls Creek for Pike in Buckingham.Quebec. When we noticed a red light reflecting on the pond from overhead. It was very dark and the object displaying the light was not visible. Two fighter jets came from the East and flew very quickly overhead. The sky was bright with stars. Again to the East some kind of object was releasing a sphere shaped object. It was a very clear night. It was frighting because the red glow on the pond startled us. I have waited this long (November 26th,2000) to report this case because I have just recently read about a UFO abduction case in Buckingham over the WWW. I swear that this statement is absolutely true.<n>

Stars do not move arround as this did and, satelights hold a steady course. Ionly noticed this point of light becauseits behaviour was very unusual.  It was able to move at great speed from a standing start and then stop abruptly.  No speeding up or slowing down. It did this aeveral times, in random directions over both land and sea . There was one other witness, a woman I am no longer in contact with.  I think she was a primary school teacher from New Zealand.  She hadn&#39;t been on a yacht at sea befor she was helping me on my watch, I was telling her about stars and satelights to calm her nerves, which was how we came to notice it.  I am not sure of the duration of time we could see it because a fleet of trawlers arrived and I had to consentrate  on sailing by them.  When I looked afterwards it was gone The boats name was ((name of boat deleted)) she was registered in London, I wrote the sighting down in the log book.  No one Ihave asked has any suggestions what it could have been.  I have not seen another UFO before or since.<n>

I was looking for the Big Dipper. Part of it was hidden by the roof line, I thought. Some thing looked wrong with it. I realized it had an extra star in it.  About the time I figured it out the extra star started across the sky North and disappeared over the mountains. It traveled at a steady rate of speed slowly enough that I was able to watch it for maybe 20 seconds after it started to move. The craft looked just the same as the other stars in the Big Dipper. Yellow like a light or a star on a clear night. There was no light pollution and no Northern lights that night.  I was so shocked I couldn&#39;t sleep and I don&#39;t think anybody ever really believed it. It didn&#39;t wobble like a sat- ellite or have a tail. I probably watched it 15 or 20 minutes before it went out of sight. No sound.<n>
8/12/84 21:00|Columbus|OH|Rectangle|10-15 minutes|Football field sized gunmetal gray rectangular craft with bright lights and "windows" hovering silently 100 ft or so above parking lot|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77232.html|19|ndxe198408| Football field sized gunmetal gray rectangular craft with bright lights and &#34;windows&#34; hovering silently 100 ft or so above parking lot<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1984 or 1985 (I’m very bad with dates) and I was living with my ex-fiance on the north side of Columbus, Ohio.. We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren&#39;t far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. &#34;What the Hell is that?&#34; he wondered aloud. &#34;It&#39;s probably just highbeams on a crane&#34; I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying &#34;What the Hell is that??&#34; Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled &#34;WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not &#34;Independence day&#34; huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it&#39;s surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink&#39;s department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn&#39;t notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it&#39;s front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the &#34;back&#34; of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn’t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said &#34;We have to get closer!&#34; and I completely flipped out -and I&#39;m not one who is given to &#34;flipping out&#34;. He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim &#34;Holy Fuck!!&#34; I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

Fishing was slow so I looked to the sky to see if I could spot any meteors. I saw a light dancing just above the mountains. I yelled to my friend to look and we both saw it speed to a stop, and then dart off to where we could no longer see it. We later heard what sounded like jets flying overhead minutes later, but we could not see lights from the aircraft. A couiple of years ago talking to a work mate who lives about five miles away from our sighting, said his son spotted a low flying sauser with lights that he also saw hovering above his house around Chritmas of around 1997. Seeing the other spottings in Pa has made me want to log my sighting in. Hope someday to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/10/84 07:00|Dorintosh (Canada)|SK|Sphere|20 minutes|Observed crop circles while being made........|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35006.html|21|ndxe198408| Observed crop circles while being made........<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well this is a story that happened a while back I am now 33 and was 14 when this happened,I have never told this story due to the ridicule I would have recieved.  I was walking with my dog as we did this every morning at about 7:00 AM,we always walked around the edge of the field because we did not want to get wet from the dew in the field that early in the morning,...well it just so happened that on the way back,my dog Whiskers, ran a little forward with his ears perked up, I had seen him do this lots of times before whenever he saw or smelled something, then I heard it too.  It was a vibrating whistling sound not very loud but loud enough that you could hear it at about 20 yards or so, so trying to see where this noise was coming from I headed in the direction of the sound and there to my amazement was a blue see-through sphere about a foot in diameter and I remember thinking how beautiful this light was, (if this would have happened in the dark I could only imagine how much of the area it would have lit up as its brightness was astounding)it was about 6 inches below the top of the wheat field,looking like it was going crazy flying in an amazing pattern seeming like it was doing something with reason, it took all of about 3 minutes, I couldn&#39;t tell what it was doing.  Then after what was about the most bizarre flying I have ever seen it went up to a level of about ten to fifteen feet in the air and just hovered there for what seemed about 10 to 15 minutes, it then flew along the top of the field in a northern direction not very fast until it was about 200 yards away then with amazing speed it went straight up until you could not see it any more.  Whiskers and I and ran over to the spot where this blue sphere had been and I was totally surprized at what I seen and smelled, it was two perfectly round circles joined together at the sides, the wierd thing was that the wheat around us was totally soaking wet and the wheat inside the circles was completely dry,not warm or anything but still ! none the less completely dry,and to top that off there was this sour tingy smell that even when Whiskers was smelling he would jerk his head backwards as if the smell had burnt his nose. I went and got my Father and told him my story and I think he thought I was crazy until I took him to the sight where it actually happened, I think he was more amazed than I was,he said he had heard of it before but never believed it either..... then he had to get away from the circles though because he said the smell was choking him I remember him telling me to measure them out with his tape measure which I did and found each to be 26 feet in circumfrence right on the nose. I was told not to talk about this incident because dad didn&#39;t want people thinking we were crazy..I have never seen this again until I had recently seen this t.v show about crop circles so there you have it I really don&#39;t care what people think because I know what I saw and so does my father and my dog Whiskers , so thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had one light, which was connected to this body (which I couldn&#39;t see) which orbited around the body in no apparent pattern, and changed colors each time it orbited the body.  The object itself was slowly moving from south-west to northwest, stopped and sort of hovered in one place for about three seconds, then at a very high rate of speed darted in a &#34;z&#34; shaped pattern-first to the east, then to the southwest (while darting way up in altitude), then west while darting out of sight towards space to the west of my position.  If you can picture a sphere, with a connecting yet orbiting light that changed colors and flashing frequency (the orbiting light part) thats the closest way I can describe it.  When this thing darted, it was un-beleivably fast!  No sound at all either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I kept a keen eye on the light, and at one point it stopped, and then it moved very quickly east at a more rapid speed than it had been traveling, almost like it had been shot out of a cannon. Then it reversed direction and traveled back to where it had been before. This erratic movement made me curious as to what I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved along the road through woods and farmland, up and down and around curves, I tried to keep up with the object, and as I rounded a turn and made for the straightaway ahead, the object approached us on the right in a slow and deliberate manner. I crossed through an intersection and came to a complete stop to watch the object in the sky cross over us from right to left about thirty to fifty feet above my car. Our car windows were rolled down, and there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft appeared to be egg-shaped or round with an unorganized array of lights, mostly amber-orange, red, and white covering the outside. It appeared to be from fifty to 100 feet high.  A large beam of light was directed down from the bottom of the craft like a search light, and it was whipping back and forth as if it was searching the stand of trees as it flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft disappeared into the woods east of us, and we did not see it again. Needless to say, we were all VERY shook up and were not really sure what we had actually seen. I did not report this sighting to anyone, but I have witnesses in my daughter and her classmate to corroborate this amazing event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Long story short, very short,considering all related material about our lives since that is so important. My brother, father and I used to visit our family&#39;s cabin in northern wisconsin every summer when my brother and I were young. One night after fishing late, we returned to the boathouse, unloaded, and sat on the dock as we did everynight. Sudennly, I looked at my dad and he was pointing at the mouth of the channel our dock sat on. I turned and looked... here was this bright light, but contained, like not a flashlight, or anything else, and there was no sound at all, just a light layer of fog that night about a foot above the water. It was a very beautiful night, with stars, fog, etc. unusual. very dark, but moonlight. What I remember is my dad pointing to this light and I&#39;ve never seen that look on his face.I look and from my left (this is narrow opening to a bigger part of the channel, at the point) a very bright light moved slowly from the edge of the woods on one side to the middle over the water. moved so smoothly, yet not on the water, but gliding slightly above it. It stopped right in the middle, which gave it a perfect view of us starring at this, and then it turned colors. Thats when my dad&#39;s trying to scare us by making a drunk fishermans flashlight seem like a ghost, actually scared the shit right out of him. after it stopped it faded into an orange color, almost spinning orange and red, I always remember feeling like it was focusing on us or trying to communicate, then at deep red and much smaller it took off, light speed, i don&#39;t know, but left a trail of red behind it into the woods at the point. My dad swore to my grandma he was just fooling us, scaring us, but as I learned later she was very concerned, because she knew of it, and was very interested in what the gov&#39;t is hiding from us, and used to lecture me of such things on that very dock, as if one day i&#39;d understand, thesame with my greatgrandmother, one day(with a grin) you&#39;ll know. There is much, much more, and know i do Know, and i want to share it. It wasn&#39;t until i started growing up, reading and searching, and suddenly an explosion of reports, abductions(including my mother&#39;s, even though she believes it was supernatural gift of God) well, it was. I realized all these things i thought were isolated to me and my family were really happening all over the earth, fireballs, &#34;balls of light&#34; what we saw.This is all real and while discovering what i had always known inside on paper from writers such as Zecharia Sitchen, Graham Hancock, Erich von daniken.THIS IS REAL AND I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE AND I&#39;m ready to let the cat out. please contact, anyone. thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The size of the craft was around 40 feet in diameter hovering about 200 feet above the house. It was emitting a loud, distorted noise that could have been music. It was spinning slightly and moving at about 25-35 mph. It was saucer shaped and had various lights around the vehicle. The time was around 3 to 5 o&#39;clock in the day. After staring in awe for around 10 seconds, I ran to  the front porch thinking where I could find a camera inside. I decided that I would miss the opportunity to see the craft again and therefore turned to watch the craft float off into the distance. My Mother, Brother, and I all stared at each other in bewilderment. My conclusion after all these years is that the research on the 1965 &#39;Abrocar&#39; experiment in Nevada was not cancelled. From my research, the hovering vehicle was manufactured in somewhere in Nevada and flown and tested in an air force base in Canada. It is possible that we witnesses the experimental vehicle en route to the testing facility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I lived and worked on Andros for 13 months as a crew member on several different torpedo retrieval boats and also on AUTEC vessels that deployed sensitive sonar testing equipment in the Tongue of the Ocean -- affectionately rendered as the acronym TOTO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During one voyage on an AUTEC vessel in the summer of 1985, we were underway in the channel between the north end of Andros and New Providence islands, bound for a port in West Palm Beach, Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the midnight to four o&#39;clock a.m. watch, my watch partner and I sighted what I would describe as two &#34;ghost rockets&#34; that flew side by side over our ship on a west to east trajectory.  These &#34;rockets&#34; were highly unusual as neither made any sound, were traveling at an oddly slow rate of speed and were visible to us for about 15 seconds.  However, the rockets left behind contrails that glowed brightly and which were &#34;multi-colored,&#34; in that the contrail smoke changed from white to green to blue to pink and then disappeared completely after about ten minutes.  (I estimate that they passed over us at an altitude of about 500 to 1000 feet; both rockets were white-colored and perhaps 25 to 40 feet in length).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never have been able to determine to a 100% certainty whether or not those &#34;rockets&#34; were a part of some sort of secret Navy submarine or destroyer test being conducted in the area; I have always assumed that they were not and for good reason: As an AUTEC vessel, we would definitely have been informed that such a test was being undertaken and subsequently, warned to stay out of the area.  This had always been the Navy&#39;s practice during similar rocket firing tests that I witnessed while working at sea in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After returning from the voyage, I asked a friend at the AUTEC base who worked as a sort of &#34;air and ocean traffic controller&#34; about the incident.  He told me that he had no knowledge of any sort of test-firing of rockets on that night and due to the sensitive nature of his job, he certainly would have been in a position to know.  (And as a very close friend of mine, he would have told me even if it was supposed to be &#34;top secret&#34;).  Again, I have never heard any satisfactory explanation as to exactly what it was we saw that night.  I have also never heard of rockets that travel in such close proximity to each other, i.e., the &#34;side by side&#34; flight that we witnessed, or at such an unusually slow speed.  Since that incident occurred, I have learned that there is a known history of so-called ghost rocket sightings in other parts of the world, particularly in Sweden.<n>
