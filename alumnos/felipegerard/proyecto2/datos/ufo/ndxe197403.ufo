It left fast, really  fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was waiting in my car in my boyfriends yard when I saw a bright light about 25-50 yards in front of me hoovering over a barn. I got down in the floor of my car. It just sat there, I didn&#39;t hear anything. It scared me but at the same time I wanted to look at it. I don&#39;t remember it doing anything. I can&#39;t remember seeing the top of it but it was real bright around the underside of it. It just stayed in one place for about 5-10 minutes and then it made a slight move upward to leave and it was gone. I don&#39;t mean it slowly left, I mean it was gone. I told a few friends who laughed at me so I never told anyone until about 25 years later and mentioned it to my then boyfriends mom. She turned pale. I thought she was going to laugh at me but she said she had seen it to and had never said anything to anyone. I wish I had talked more about it back then because I keep feeling like I forgot alot about it by supressing it. I wonder if hypnosis would help me remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, so you want to know if I&#39;m a nut. I don&#39;t feel that way. I was a student either a senior in high school or just out. You would think that I would have that date engraved in my memory but I don&#39;t. I do remember exactly where I was when JFK got shot, Elvis died and both of our space shuttles went down but I can&#39;t tell you the dates of them either. I have been a nurse for 27 years and my boyfriends mom is still a practicing nurse today at age 79.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I KNOW what I saw!!  They are out there somewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/20/74 15:30|Palgarup (Australia)||Disk|90 seconds|A daylight sighting from 250 metres|3/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22241.html|2|ndxe197403| A daylight sighting from 250 metres<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working for a farmer and had been having a day off. The area where this occurred was a farming area. The farm I was on was being used to grow potatoes. There was posibly 80 or so acres of cleared land sloping downwards to a dam.  The valley was surrounded by a eucalypt forest. The distance to the dam would be approximately 250 metres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the laundry doing washing.  The laundry building was detached from the house - and there was about a 10 metre walk to get back to the front door. I was walking back to the house and turned around to face west and looked down towards the dam, over the cleared field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the tops of the trees at the left of the dam a silver-grey shape appeared.  It was in line with the treetops and slowly moved over the dam. It was in full view for about 60 - 90 seconds. It was travelling northwards very slowly over the dam - and then went behind the treetops on the northern side of the dam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a solid object, very clearly ly the work of an intelligence and definitely not a weather phenomena or a trick of the light etc. - but I had the distinct impression it could change &#39;dimensions&#39; if you like.  It had a very distinct pink/light mauve &#39;halo&#39; or field around it.  I remember noticing how this &#39;field&#39; finished abruptly a metre or 1.5 metres away from this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember thinking how wonderful this thing looked and realised I was looking at something that was way beyond any technology I had read about exisiting at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you know - there is no way you can explain that these craft actually exist to people who have not seen one.  Generally you are greeted with mild scepticism - and you can generally sense their rationalisations about your experience.  I have told very few people about this encounter - because basically , what&#39;s the point? I have had a couple of sightings since then but none so close where you could actually see the object clearly and make out its actual shape. The 2nd last sighting was in company of another person. This person saw exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/74 22:30|Santa Rosa|CA|Disk|2 hours|The size of the object and it's perfect detail left us with no doubt of what we were seeing.|3/11/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27400.html|3|ndxe197403| The size of the object and it&#39;s perfect detail left us with no doubt of what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry about informing you about this 19 years after the fact.  Anyway, I thought you might want to hear about what my brother and I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our vantage point from a mountain northeast of Santa Rosa we spied the object perfectly sillouetted against a river of fog luminated by a full moon that was flowing across the entire valley below.I would quess that we were about seven miles away as the crow flies. I make that assumption based upon my knowledge of how far the city of Sabastopol is from Santa Rosa. Using the lights of Sabastopol peaking through the fog as a measuring stick I would have to say the object was close to being at least a mile across.Now unlike other alledged sightings this object did not have any flashing lights.I thought it strange that it wasn&#39;t illuminated like the fog or lit up at all.It was like light had no affect upon it. It was  flat dark grey in color.It had a dome on top and bottom. Hollywood movie makers could not have created a more perfect saucer,only this one was real. We looked at it for about two hours before getting bored and to cold to look at it anymore, then went home. All the time we were watching it, it didn&#39;t do anything.  It just sat motionless above the fog as the fog flowed beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is public employee.  Date in 1974 is approximate.  PD))<n>

At the time, several teen boys in town owned small motor scooters and it looked like the headlight of one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had been watching the light for about 30 seconds when it turned to its right and headed west across the field.  Still thinking it was a scooter, we didn&#39;t become scared at the time.  A few seconds later an orange glow appeared and ,for lack of a better word, dominoed into a rectangular object about the size of a small trailer house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember being terrified and screaming at my friend that we should leave.  We had no trouble starting the car and quickly drove into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We became braver the closer we came to town and decided to drive back out to the area.  When we arrived at the area, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend died in a car accident in 1975, leaving me as the only witness to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate; does not indicate town in which alleged sighting occurred.

3/15/74 19:30|Moosic|PA|Circle|30minutes|Buzzed by UFO|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52567.html|5|ndxe197403| Buzzed by UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> Round saucer with domed top. Silver-gray with white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 17 and pregnagnt for my first child, my boyfriend and I were walking the railroad tracks from Moosic to Avoca.  As we approached a railroad bridge that crossed over the tracks we were on I saw a bright light comming from the right.  I asked my boyfriend what he thought, he wasnt sure, we went under the bridge and came out the other side (aprox, 40 feet).  The object was almost over head, I could clearly see a long hose or cable like rope hanging from the craft just above the power/phone lines. As it approached the bridge the line silently went back into the craft.  The craft had rows of lights around its middle line and underneath, they appeared to rotate giving a spinning illusion, the craft was not spinning just hovering. It had a clear row of windows in the dome and there were forms moving inside.  Underneath it had three holes with large possable propeller like or fan like blades that were spinning. The intire area was lit up like daytime. I stood there in awe, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then craft than tilted up to about the position of 2 on a clock and took off.  The whole time there wasnt a sound, no wind, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend was terrified and wanted to hide, I knew they had already seen us and where would I hide from something that big. There is a little ligue field not far from there, if that craft were sitting on the pitchers mound all sides would touch a base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we reached our destination in Avoca it was 9:30 pm  about two hours had past, the walk should have taken no less than a half hour. Later when I return home I told my dad and we called the local airport to see if they saw anything on radar, we were laughed at, so for the past 32 years this has been my secret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

3/15/74 18:00|Tula|MS|Circle|30 minutes|Round disk seen in field across from home in the 70's.|2/7/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106869.html|6|ndxe197403| Round disk seen in field across from home in the 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting a story my mother told me many years ago and recently retold the story so I could report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened back in 1974, I was about 3 years old, and my brother was 4 years old and my sister a newborn.  We lived out in the country on a gravel road beside my grandparents. Across the road from us was a field.  My mother could stand in the kitchen and wash dishes and look out at the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it was early March and around 6 in the evening before it got dark.  She was at the kitchen sink doing something and glanced out the window to the field.  She said there was a huge round disk hovering above the ground and it was pulsating a pinkish light.  She kept saying it was huge and glowing.  There was no sound coming from it.  It never touched the ground and she said she could see no windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it sat there for probably 30 minutes doing nothing but hovering over the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said that we, I and brother, went out onto the porch and watched it.  She sent my brother next door to get my grandparents and they came over as well.  She said they just stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was and nobody could explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandparents went back home and my sister started crying, my mother went into get her and when she came back out it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother said it was not anything she had ever seen before or since. She said nothing weird happened and no missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it strange that I have always been interested in them and nobody else in my family is.<n>
