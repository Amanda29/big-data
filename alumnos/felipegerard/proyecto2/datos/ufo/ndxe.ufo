23:00|Northern California Coast (in, highway)|CA|Cigar|3-5 min.|We were travelling along the coast of California going North--this was about 15 years ago, so I can't remember the town we were near.|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09753.html|2|ndxe| We were travelling along the coast of California going North--this was about 15 years ago, so I can&#39;t remember the town we were near.  We had a car and van filled with a baseball team from Washington State, and were heading home at 10:00 or so at night(it could have been later).  I looked out the driver&#39;s window and noticed this oblong object that seemed to be keeping pace with our vehicles.  At first I just thought it was an airplane, but the more I watched it, the more I became con- vinced it was not an airplane.  Suddenly, it seemed CLOSER, and as the two vehicles went down a small hill on the highway, all our lights, radio, EVERYTHING on the van in the front of us and in our car went out. I looked at the object and it looked closer still and looked to be hovering.  We pulled over to the side of the road as quickly and as safely as we could when you have no lights or any guidance, and stopped. My husband got out of the van, and just as he said, &#34;What was THAT?? What is going on??!!&#34;, all the lights came back on in our vehicles, and the oblong object had just dissappeared.  I wouldn&#39;t have believed this if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes. I must tell you that our cars did not stop running, but everything else did--even the heater we had on.<n>

9/??/75 23:00|Berlin Heights/Huron|OH|Light|45 minutes|Ufo attracted and responded to flashlight from aprox.60-80 miles away.|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09774.html|4|ndxe| Ufo attracted and responded to flashlight from aprox.60-80 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was out in the back yard of our country home, (about 8 acres) to take care of the dogs in the kennel. He was shining an ordinary flash light toward the stars on a clear night. Time was about 11pm. The sky was very clear and dark, no lights from the cities. He had been outside for about 15 minutes when he called me to come and look at this funny star. I came out and he pointed at a star that seemed to be moving at right angles-the distance from us was hard to tell--but it was only the size and brightness of a star in the distant sky.. He was turning the flash light on and off, and when the light was on the object begain to move closer (could tell because it grew larger and brighter--as though it were homing in on our little light) When he turned the light off it retreated back to it&#39;s orignial size and place in the distant sky. At the time we were certain it was not a star because of the movement, and the angles of the turns and speed of which it grew closer, and withdrew, it was doubtful that it was a plane. My husband kept playing with the light, moving the light, and shining the light toward the object, (which looked still star like) and the object got larger and brighter as it came toward us. In a very short time (seconds) it seemed to travel a great distance to stop over our yard and hover there. The light was so bright that we saw our shadows in the darkness and the whole field was lit up like a carbon arc light. By this time I was frightened because we didn&#39;t know what it was, or who it was, but it was certain it was nothing like anything known. There was no sound at all, only this intense light, which shone so bright, that it was impossible to tell the shape, or see the craft itself...however it was directly over us..impossible to tell how close or the size. We could only see the light and here no sound. We ducked down behind the bushes, which was a joke, because they didn&#39;t hide us at all, and I urged my husband to turn the light off...he did and the object/light withdrew from us and grew smaller and smaller until it was the same star-like ofject we had seen before. My husband turned the light on again and shined toward the &#34;star&#34; and once again it zoomed toward us and grew into this brilliant light overhead. Once more he turned the light off and it zoomed away...off into the distant horizon. We went into the house, and turned off the lights....locking the doors..I called my mother to report on what had just happened. A few days later there was an article in the Lorain Journal or the Sandusky Register paper, about 2 nurses who were leaving work and chased by a ufo on their route home. This was on the same night! The direction they were coming from would have been in the same direction this light came from. The milage from there to where we were would have been about 34-45 miles, and if it was from the Cleveland Ohio area the distance from us was about 65-80 miles...if I remember correctly. So it traveled a long distance to reach us in seconds...and also what is interesting to take note of, is that what kind of technology would it have to have to spy our flashlight at such a distance...and be able to zero in on it&#39;s location, and be there in seconds....so we were open to the idea that maybe it was not from somewhere else but maybe some unknown craft of ours. My husband had a mathmatics degree and was a scientific person. so this is why he kept playing with the light to see what would happen, and before the experience was not a believer in ufos. Prior to this event some weeks before this I had been alone at home and spotted hovering glowing objects over the woods late at night. The area where we lived was within a mile of a proposed neclear powerplant to be built by Ohio Edison. They purchased land without telling the truth to the people who sold to them. They thought it was going to be a resort. Later the truth came out. There was great oposition to it.The lights that I had seen were hovering over that area. One note of interest. This experience had an impact on me, and I have always saught an explaination...a few years or so after this event, I started having out of body experiences...once, for some reason I became really still during one of these experiences and asked with my thoughts, about the ufo experiences....and a voice answered me saying&#34;They are real, they are related to us in that all energy is related, and, were in the area to influence the population who lived there, to protest the building of the neclear power plant&#34;. Believe this or not, there was enough protesting and the plant was never build on this property.<n>
23:00|14 Island Lake (Canada)|QC|Fireball|~2-3 sec.|A 2-3 second streak of an emerald green laser-like light leaving a long thin green line of light like a hi-liter pen  in its wake.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37245.html|5|ndxe| A 2-3 second streak of an emerald green laser-like light leaving a long thin green line of light like a hi-liter pen  in its wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:- Sorry, E-mail Address not included due to spamming idiots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin with, I apologize for not being able to, not only pin-point the dates of these events with any accuracy, but the years also. I have read your Hoax/Joke reference &amp; concur with the rationality of its content. Secondly, both my wife &amp; myself are not prone to UFO/Alien theories, BUT likewise, we are also old enough (mid-60&#39;s) not to be so gullible as to not believe that there are indeed &#34;things&#34; in this world/universe which do in fact appear to be rather unexplainable. Thirdly, since it is you who has &#34;publicly requested&#34; reports of UFO??? sightings via this Website, here is what &#34;we&#34; saw in the first incident sometime in the &#39;80&#39;s, &amp; what &#34;I&#34; saw in a second incident in the mid to late 90&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live on the N/E. shoreline of 14 Island Lake in the Municipality of of St. Hippolyte, Quebec (50 miles N. of Montreal). House located on hillside ~50 ft. above water &amp; ~75&#39;from water&#39;s edge. When facing the lake from our deck, there&#39;s a huge 90&#39;-100&#39; pine tree about 30&#39; left of the deck, most of whose branches extend outward toward the lake, and which hides our view down the shoreline to the left. Extending outwards across the lake, about 1/4 mi. away, beyond that pine tree to the left, are two islands in the distance which hide most of the rest of the lake surface to the S. &amp; S/W. from our view. Also, across the lake, about 15 degrees to the left of us, is another island (with open water to its left and right) which is also visible from our deck as well as the shoreline and rising mountains beyond the far shoreline ~1/2 mi. away. To our right there are also tall trees 60&#39;-70&#39; which partially block our view of the mountains to the W. &amp; N/W. Obviously at night up here it can be very dark and any unusual light(s) or lighting will immediately attract the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In both these incidents, it should first be noted that even in full darkness, the outlines of the trees on &#34;our&#34; shoreline, on the islands, and the outline of the distant  mountains are clearly visible against the sky are always visible, unless of course it would be cloudy/misty. In both cases the nights were starry &amp; clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First Incident:- (In the 80&#39;s). While standing outside leaning on the railing &amp; facing the lake talking &amp; having a smoke arpound 23:00, suddenly from our left (from beyond the branches of the pine tree), an emerald green mini-ball of light suddenly just shot in a absolutely dead straight line across the lake on the &#34;near side&#34; of the two islands I just previously described as being ~1/4 mi. beyond the pine tree. I would say that the light was traveling downwards at maybe 2-3 degrees. It then disappeared behind the trees on the second island I just described, but it did not re-appear over the water to the right of that island. It just disappeared. All this could not have taken more than 2-3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part I find interesting, is that this light was not up high in the sky, but very low over the water. It had to be, because it&#39;s line of travel was well below the outline of the trees on the two islands to our left. Therefore, logically, if it was below the island treeline, that would have to mean that the light past between us and the islands. And since it was streaking downwards towards the right, it could only have gone either into the lake at some point behind the other island, or into the shoreline on the far side of the lake. Those latter two locations are out of our line of sight from the deck. My wife &amp; I just looked at each other in silence; we knew we&#39;d both seen what I described, but at the time, we figured, &#34;Who the hell&#39;s gonna believe that.&#34; Come to think of it, right now, I&#39;m still trying to figure out why I&#39;ve even bothered sending this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Really, the best way I can describe the shape and brightness of this light, would be to say it sort of resembled the appearance of Disney&#39;s &#34;Tinkerbell&#34; when she was very far in the distance; just a small brilliant laser-like light that seemed to have a hint of a faint halo but with no real space between the light and the halo  - and with just a bit of a shimmering effect to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing that might be worth mentioning, is that the next day there were also reports in Montreal, and on the South Shore of the St. Lawrence River of people having seen a shooting emerald green light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd Incident:- Same setting as 1st incident, only I was alone standing at the front door leading onto the deck at about 23:00. Suddenly, this time from the right, the same green light streaked across the lake in front of me and just disappeared in mid-flight; it just sort of &#34;winked out&#34; so-to-speak.  This time it appeared to run in a very horizontal plane as it streaked by and was only visible for 2-3 seconds. Again, this light had to have past directly over the lake, because I could see the light against the mountains in the background across the lake, and since the mountains across the lake are about 250&#39;-300&#39; high, I would guess the light must have passed by at ~ 100-200 ft. above the water. This time the light appeared to be closer to me; maybe 1/4-1/3 mi. away. Note:- the lake is only about 1/2 mi. wide at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there ya have it - our visit from &#34;Whatever&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates of both incidents are unknown.

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neon green, long-tailed fireball meteor-looking<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has been bothering me since I saw it, especially since I saw ANOTHER of the same exact thing months later in another location an hour South of the 1st location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was simple.  I was laying in bed watching tv and in the corner of my eye out the window I saw what I thought was a meteor.  I&#39;ve seen many of these glorious things having played in an LA band and having to drive home at 2 am in the morning many a night.  But this was different in that it was neon green as was it&#39;s long tail, and the &#34;ball&#34; part was definitely like a round ball in front.  This was a few miles from LAX, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw the same exact thing was when I was exiting from the Irvine Spectrum Mall in Orange County, CA, an hour South of LAX, and again in the corner of my eye going West was what I thought was another beautiful long-tailed meteor.  But when I looked directly at it, I saw a few seconds of it clearly and I exclaimed to myself out loud &#34;ANOTHER green fireball thing!!!!&#34;  There it was in all it&#39;s neon green, long green-tailed glory.  WHAT ARE THESE THINGS?  Nobody else I tell has ever seen one and I don&#39;t want to start sounding like a crazy person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date of this was a couple years ago or so. I have a serious &#34;date memory defecit&#34; and my sense of time is completely bad unless i have some date or event to relate it to. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t be more specific as I truly wish somebody can tell me what these things are so I can have an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM BY SAME ANONYMOUS WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wrote about the 2 sightings of the green meteor-type things with the long green tails and I wanted to add something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were low in altitude (definitely lower than any plane would fly) and they were flying straight across in a slight arch. The ball in front was a definite sphere shape and the tail was very green like the ball. Both times they just disappeared. Not sure if a fizzle-out would look the same as it just disappearing, either way it died within eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the first sighting the green sphere w/ tail was heading away from LAX which making it North or North/East in direction if that means anything as the second sighting was also East with a slight North direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting was very close to the ocean (just blocks away) and the second was a few miles from the shoreline. Again, not sure if this is significant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But the stand-out characteristics both times was the low altitude, the large sphere that was clearly a round sphere in front, the neon green tint to both the spheres and the long tails behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I was about 12 years then. I shouted to my father to look up in the sky,we ran to where my dad was,by that time the space craft was right over our house. It just hovered there for about a minute or so, it never made a sound, it was a very clean and it was round with large pipes protruding out of the bottom. On the top of the craft there was a object shaped just like a windshield of a car rotating around, something like radar or a force field or something.The very outside rim had windows all around it,my father saw people looking out at us. Then after a minute the craft began to move without a sound, it was travelling west. It came from the east over the bay of fundy. The spacecraft was only about 100 feet above our house,it was the size of tennis court or a little bigger.It moved slowly west about 2 miles, then it stopped for a couple of seconds,3 large orange balls of lava looking material dropped out of the bottom with equal distance between them. We were all standing there staring at this monment in our history wondering WHAT,WHERE, WHY, HOW and WHEN or if we would ever see this ever again.Ater the 3 balls fell to the earth the craft dissappeared instantly.Those few short monents have been with us all our lives. I ask my brothers an sisters over the years if they ever think of that night and all of them including myself an my dad said they think of that night every day.We are not sure of who they were but they know that we are thinking of them. I often think they will be back one day, either for a visit or to accomplish whatever it is that they have to do.This was such a great experience,it was so uplifting that it makes me fell very special to be apart of that very special evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.

It still bothers me that I never reported it, so here it is, you can throw it away if you want, but what I saw was and will always be a UFO (I am getting goosebumps as I write this). My friend and I (I was 20, he was 19)where at my house and decided to go to the small party store in the town of Cohoctah and get a pop. It was around 10:00 P.M. We left the store and headed east a few miles out of town into Deerfield township. We where out in the sticks on some back road when I asked him to pull over so I could go to the bathroom. I was standing outside the car taking a pee and looking up into to sky. (It was a clear night, I could see the stars in the sky), Then I saw this dark object above the trees (it didn&#39;t have any lights, I thought it was a Blimp or something of that nature) it was quiet and just glided over our heads. It was only 100&#39; above my head and blocked out the stars as it flew by. I closed my eyes hoping it was just a cloud, but then, as it flew west, I noticed a small light at the rear. My friend and I were totally amazed at what we saw and got back in the car and headed west back to my house (the same direction this object was heading). At times we could still see that small light on it&#39;s tail as it flew parallel to the road we were driving on. We lost sight of it about 2 miles from my house (trees along the side of the road made it hard at times to keep track). When we pulled in my driveway (here come the goosebumps again)we stood in my front yard talking about what we saw, when all of a sudden, across the road over a 30 acre hay field this huge set of lights turned on! it was approx 100&#39; above the ground. no sound at all (totally took as by surprise). It had round lights, about 8 they were in a circle. They lit up the whole hay field, and I could see the tree line beyond, it was amazing (it reminded me of what you see when lighting flashes at night and briefly you can see things far away)I could see the details of everything around. I ran to my front door to get my Dad,when I looked back at my friend, he was standing there with his mouth dropped wide open, just frozen, he was lit up like a car was in front of him with its head light on. I was screaming for my dad, as he came running from bed and turned the corner to come outside , the lights turned off, we pointed out to him the little light floating away from us. (note: The lights were on for 30 seconds or so). Two things I have to point out. First, there was no sound. We lived in a farming area,you could hear car comming a mile down the road. There was no noise at all! Second, another friend of mine saw the same thing about five years later in the same location. They built a home back in the woods about a 1/2 mile from that site. His wife was washing dishes and it was late in the evening when she saw a huge set of lights come on behind their house. It was the same thing I just described. She could see all the trees and stuff as it hovered just above them, then, the lights turned off and it was gone.<n>

From this mountain I could see Washingtonville, Campbell Hall, Stewart air base and th Hudson River. It was dark and stupid us we had not got fire wood for the fire yet. We got the wood and then. Tired to start a fire. I got a small fire going and it went out so I just sat back to look at the stars. I saw a flash of bright white light. It stopped in the middle of the sky right over the hudson river. It was then that I relized there were 3 of them. One landed about 100 ft. from the hudson. It stayed there and then left as quick as it came. the hour and 15 minute felt like 10-20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MOUNTAIN- It was rocky and had some good soft dirt<n>

Truck wouldn&#39;t start.  Pieces magnetized and stuck on inside of hood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home (south) and was just south of the Opera on 84-285.  From the valley on my right (the valley is on a line with Los Alamos) a big &#34;thing&#34; &#34;floated&#34; over my truck.  It didn&#39;t make any noise.  As I was looking at it (it was like a white light--(it did not light up the road or my truck but it was very whit-bright--I know that doesn&#39;t make sense, but that&#39;s the way it was).  As I watched my truck died.  It is a full size Ford F-150 and the power steering doesn&#39;t work when the ignition is off.  SoI was &#34;muscling&#34; the truck off the road while it still had momentum and when I got it off to the shoulder, the &#34;thing&#34; was gone.  I kept trying to start the truck.  It wouldn&#39;t start.  Finally I called AAA (my phone worked fine) and had to be towed.  I called a friend to pick me up.  The truck felt like it wasn&#39;t getting any gas.  The next day I asked my mechanic what happened to the truck. He said to call him back--he couldn&#39;t figure it out.  The next day he told me he had never see a whole distributor &#34;explode.&#34;  A cap may but not a whole distributor.  Plus pieces of it wer magentized and stuck to the inside of the hood.  (The truck is old and made of steel not plastic)  It cost a lost to fix the truck.  I didn&#39;t lost any time because I looked at the clock.<n>

Entry Date 7/20/00|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13529.html|16|ndxe| Carolina Beach N.C. cigar   I shined my bright headlights on it!   Entry Date 7/20/00<n> <n><n> <n><n> As best as i can recall as time frames escape me,in the summer of 1987 as a resident of Carolina Beach,N.C. my mother began yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a u.f.o..After ignoring her cries for three times,I was compelled to go check the situation out because of her &#34;close encounter&#34; scream! Upon entrance of the back porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a tubular shaped flying vehicle beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1000 yards away from shore!I turned to Mom and We both began to more or less &#34;freak-out&#34; about what We were seeing! I then instructed her to examine every detail about this &#34;thing&#34; so that We could better remember it&#39;s design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps&#39; pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship. This angered local residents who came to confront my recklessness , but once I pointed to that &#34;thing&#34; all was astonished at &#34;it&#34;.As it neared I clicked my bright headlights on it. It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like a circle and had it&#39;s light off. It began to hover over me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently PRAY!! When I looked back up ,it slowly moved back to surf just beyond the pier and &#34;blasted&#34; is too slow the term for it&#39;s departure! Instantly in the distance Wrightsville Beach N.C. lit up from the u.f.o.&#39;s lightbeam. After a few min. the same thing began at Topsail Beach&#39;N.C. . This happened up the North Carolina eastern coastline untill it faded from my sight. When I ! returned home my mom said local news would carry the story at 11:00 which was just coming up. In a brief report , they mentioned that the u.f.o. sightings being called in was nothing more than a &#34;Coast Guard Drug Survailence Vehicle&#34;!  O.K. Carolina Beach &#39;You remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!<n>

One man observed that there was a &#34;Star&#34; moving across the night sky.  The sky was very clear and we could see lots of other stars, but this one was slightly larger, and moving slowly.  At first most of us thought it was some sort of satellite and I remember we were all pretty casual about it.  We watched it for at least ten minutes, travelling from East to West, fully expecting it to keep going until it disappeared.  Then to our astonishment it stopped and two smaller &#34;stars&#34; appeared either side.  They shot out accross the sky in different directions at fantastic speeds, before returning to the bigger &#34;star&#34; then repeating the excercise over and over again. I remember we were all stunned,as we had absolutely no idea what it was we were watching. Others were starting to get excited and some were getting nervous. I just stayed with my family and kept watching.  After a period of about 45 mins, the two smaller &#34;stars&#34; seemed to merge with the bigger one and with that, the big &#34;star&#34; literally shot up into the sky, at such a speed, that if we had blinked at that instant, we would have missed it. My mother rang the newspaper to tell them, but they told her that it must have been a meteorite.  All of us on hearing this stated emphatically, that that was no meteorite!<n>

This ball of light was above the house in the sky. I thought it was a star and so I went back inside, I thought to myself it had to be to bright to be a star so I went out again, and it had moved. I was in the trees. I went upstairs to get a look from my room with the binoculars. It was round and very bright. I then looked away to check the time, it was about 10:30. I looked back again. It was there for a split second longer and then it just vanished. I have not seen it again since that night.<n>

I walked under it and saw it was saucer shaped.  My brother could only see an orange light, so we left.  Later that night, down the road he saw a light and walked towards it.  I clicked the CB and said &#34;radio check&#34; and the power meter went off the scale and back to zero.  My brother became frightened and insisted we leave.  He told me later that he saw a blinding light, which I did not see.  Many other ufos have been seen in the area.<n>

I then relised it was hovering,more lights seemed to come from behind it persumably out of it.I saw three lights jumping up and down irratically,in orbit around the first one.They moved from it and disappeared and reappeared in places around the area.Iwent through a check list , meteor etc. But it was none of the more usual things.I was both frightened and fascinated by it.I didn&#39;t take a photograph of it as my mother and father were the ones who owned a camera I was afraid of what they would think ,(mental,crazy etc.) , if I were to ask for the camera, they would ask me what I wanted it for.I couldn,t keep track of the objects movements (dissappearing and reappearing), so I lost count.The original one stayed in the same place.They seemed to return to the larger one, it dimed until it was no longer visible.So far, I have only told a close friend.

My relatives and I had been watching fireworks with my binoculars, and as we prepared to go home, my mother noticed a small but conspicuous point of red light almost directly overhead.  Using my binoculars, I watched it for several minutes and noticed the following features: 1) It appeared to be a point source of light with no noticeable shape 2) The red light pulsated on an irregular basis, growing dim and then growing brighter with no apparent pattern 3) The light slowly shifted its position relative to the background of stars, but without leaving the area in which it was first sighted.  My impression is that its movement resembled that of a lighted balloon attached to the ground by a string or rope, which allowed it to be blown by high altitude winds, yet kept it from moving to a different area of the sky. It is my understanding that this object was also seen by other persons in the area and that the local Altadena or Pasadena newspaper ran a story about the UFO the following day, but I have never followed up this incident.<n>

I am now 50 years old and have never reported this although I have mentioned it to a few people I know. I was at that time a military dependent.  My father was stationed at Lajes AFB,Azores.  I was camping out at the school grounds on the air base with four of my friends from school.  Ages ranged from 13 years old to 17 years old.  It was a summer night and the sky above was as clear and full of stars as it could be.  We were commenting to neach other that it looked as if we could see every star in the heavens.  As we were gazing upward one of my friends said in a completely astonished tone that one of the stars was moving.  We thought he was crazy and were kidding him till he pointed it out to the rest of us and sure enough that bright light was moving slowly across the sky from right to left.  We followed it&#39;s progress wondering if it could be a plane although it didn&#39;t look like any plane any of us had seen before and being Air force dependents we had all seen a lot of planes.  The bright light appeared to be very high in the sky and when it stopped it looked exactly like a star.  It stopped and started a couple of times and all of us had our eyes glued on it then it started moving again and kept moving to the left across our night time horizon toward the atlantic ocean.  A wing of the school was about to block our view and we raced to keep it in sight, falling down stairs and hills as we kept looking up.  We did manage to keep it in sight till we got around the building.  We got there just in time to see it stop. It started to move again very slowly then to all our amazment another one, lower in the horizon, started to move from left to right while the original one kept moving from right to left.  We thought the second one was a star till it started moving.  The two lights moved toward each other till one was right above the other then they momentarily stopped before the one higher in the sky moved down.  the lower one moved up until they joined ! to becom e one light in the sky.  We stood entanced not daring to look away.  Then the two separated in the exact oposite manner in which they joined ( a reverse Z).  The higher one streaked away to the east the lower one to the west.  They moved at an incedible speed as each moved out of sight in opposite directions completely gone from our horizon, our line of sight now totally unobscured for miles.  We agreed amoungst ourselves not to mention it for fear of ridicule from our peers but I&#39;ll never forget it.  The next day one of the guys that was there said there was a report on the base radio station that a ufo had been detected by the base radar the night before.  I didn&#39;t hear that report and I never heard anything else about the incident.  I haven&#39;t seen anything before or since that time but I&#39;ll never forget it and I know UFO&#39;s are for real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mom was at the front door and window.  She was excited and claimed that there was a flying saucer outside.  Not wanting to be disturbed from watching a favorite TV show, at the time, I told mom to leave me alone.  Anyway, she got my sister&#39;s attention first and they both still claimed that there was really a UFO outside.  I looked in thier direction and could see that there were flashing lights through the windows.  I told them that it probably was the police with somebody pulled over on the side of the highway.  We lived right off State Rt. 42 South, just outside of Xenia, Ohio.  My mom said that it wasn&#39;t the state police it was in the air.  I told here it may be a police helicopter or something like that.  Then I noticed how quite it was outside.  Usually traffic was relatively constant until about eleven o&#39;clock in the evening and it would die out to an occassional trickle.  The lack of sound is what first caught my interest.  My excplaination about the helicopter was shot down because of no sound.  That&#39;s when I got up to take a look.  I looked out the window and saw flashing lights that came from beyond my field of vision because of the front porch.  There wasn&#39;t any traffic and no sound, but the lights were there. I went out onto the porch and immediately looked to my left towards Xenia.  There were some cars stopped on the road.  I then looked to the right and saw the same thing.  There weren&#39;t may cars but there were definately other witnesses.  This all happened in a couple of seconds.  I looked up and above and beyond the tree in the front yard over the median of the highway was a very large (as big as our house) dark shape with lights flashing all over it.  The lights were several colors: white, red and green are the ones I remember most.  I can&#39;t quite remember the exact shape of the UFO but mom remembers it as an oval or cirular shape.  It remained stationary over the median for what seemed a minute or so, it&#39;s really hard to say exactly how long it was ! there.  Then it started moving to my right straight down the median until it was at the next house or slightly beyond.  It started to come down closer to the ground and the underside started to glow brightly.  Then just when we thought it was going to land it arched off away from us.  Whatever it was it was fast.  It went from a fairly shape to a spot of light in what seemed to be just a split second.  It darted around in the sky for a few minutes zigzagging back and forth then it disappeared.  We didn&#39;t report it then because I personnally didn&#39;t want to be referred as a kook.  I wished that I can talk to others who saw the UFO that night.  It was reported in the news of multiple sightings then things died down.  Someday I think I would like to be hypnotised to see if I could recall things better, like the exact day, the exact shape, etc.  Thank you.  Robert<n>

The formation seemed to narrow (tighten) and then spread out ... meanwhile one light was zig zagging in and out of the formation. A plane circling for landing at Toronto International Airport could not have missed the spectacle in the sky above them .We thought at first we might be looking at migrating geese with the lights of the city reflected off their white bellies, but apparently Canada Geese seldom fly at night, prefering to rest, and besides the lights appeared to be much too high up for geese... the lights were the size of bright stars. A week later I saw a single object streak accross the sky, around the same time of night. This object was much lower down, and appeared to be triangular(although it seemed to have wings) in shape, it looked almost translucent and was a shimmering bright orange. It was travelling from the South East, towards the North over the city of Waterloo, at a speed much faster than any plane I have ever seen. Both these sightings have left us puzzled and a little scared... the more time passes the more we doubt our own eyes and the experience we both had. Very interesting! The day after I had the single sighting, I phoned a professor who has a strong interest in Astronomy at the University of Waterloo. She was extremely interested and told me that she had been seeing unexplained lights near the horizon for a week, and like us, thought their must be some other explaination for them. I am a 50 year old mother of seven grown children, I have a science degree, and am the president of a national animal welfare organization... I don&#39;t smoke and I don&#39;t drink...just incase you wanted to know!!! The other witn! ess is my daughter(We were visiting with her in Ontario), married with two young children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As above, I have nothing more to add.<n>

When I started hearing what sounded like a radio rapidly changing stations, than what sounded like something flying ,but a sound I had never heard before. Than instantly I saw a silver disk with a red lit dome on top, and three red lit circular lights trailing it like a tail. It stopped directly above my window, It knew I was there. It was not a large craft. I screamed with terror and ran to my parents who were downstairs watching TV. By the time they ran upstairs, there was nothing there.<n>

I can&#39;t recall what month it was. I think it was a fall or winter month. I&#39;m pretty sure it was 1984. The time was around 10Pm or 11Pm. Rt 444 drives along Wright-Patterson AFB and there were a lot of cars out at the time. I am sure that there were other witnesses. I am also sure that the control tower at Wright-Patt saw it. Anyway, I was driving north and suddenly I saw this brilliant green fireball heading north overhead. It was about the size of a full moon and it looked like it was on fire. It left a small trail of flame behind it. A lot of people saw it cause I remember a number of cars pulling off to the side of the road. I had never seen anything like it, but I assumed it was probably a meteor. Now, I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s what it was.<n>

Would love to take a polygraph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed one craft of a steady red appearance not flashing or pulsating.  Not a dark maroon red or a pale red just a regular inbetween red colour.  I was with my dad and a friend named Duncan when the sighting occured.  I witnessed the craft positioned above a factory named pang at the time of the sighting it was circular in appearance just a solid red glow.  It was disc shaped but slightly rounder than the typical disc you would see on one of those cliche tv programs that&#39;s so streamlined.   All I can say from the sighting is that the duration was approximately 15-20 seconds and what I witnessed I wouldn&#39;t describe as extra-terrestrial or a man made craft because at the end of the day who knows. all I know is what my eyes witnessed.  What I saw what the craft/disc shaped light I saw hover from a stationery position for about 5-10 seconds above the factory and then accelerate from a standstill to what I can only estimate as to be into the 1000&#39;s of mph&#39;s instantaneously without a whisper and then the craft disappeared behind cloud cover.  Like a bullet fired from a rifle, the velocity of the craft was astounding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad still mentions it to people to this day 10-11 years later as if it&#39;s a joke and kind of makes me feel uneasy and embaressed by what I&#39;d seen.  If I could only guess at the speed of which I&#39;m no expert I would assume to be 8-10000+ mph silently, instantly.  I live near Lakenheath &amp; Mildenhall airbases&#39;s and see the harrier&#39;s on a regular basis and know they make a lot of noise when they accelerate.  I would be willing to take a polygraph or any test to prove what I saw be it extra-terrestrial or an experimental government craft, thanks for reading would love to prove what I had truly seen.<n>

It was a clear night  so we chose to just lay our sleeping bags on the flat bed trailer, So I was just laying there admiring the stars, my eyes had ajusted to the darkness and the night sky was full of beautifull stars, when I noticed an object flying direcly overhead and traveling at 100 plus miled per hour, It was triangular shaped but I could not see the skin of the ship, it was visable only because of the stars being blocked out .  Under the craft there were three rectangle shapes ,  one in the front, two in the back these were of a very dim red color, I would not have been able to see this craft at all If my eyes were not adjusted to the darkness.  this craft flew directly over the camp ground and was heading straight for sturgis, now I was there for the Bike rally, so I am assuming that this event was the atraction of the craft, I also believe that this craft is man made, possibly military or some powerfull corperate entity, there is no question that this was an unconventional craft, and I am assuming that the rectangular objects under the craft are the propulsion units possibly EMP style<n>

00/00/62 22:00|Morrice|MI|Cigar|3-5 minutes|Summer 1962 - Large and small identical craft hovered at tree top level for several minutes 2- yards from 2 observers|6/2/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02937.html|46|ndxe| Summary : Large and small identical craft hovered at tree top level for several minutes 2- yards from 2 observers in small, rural Michigan community of 500 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a warm, clear, dark and moonless summer night (June, July or August ?), circa 1962, my grand mother and I watched in dumbstruck silence as a 100&#39; long object closely resembling a DC-3/6 fuselage sans wings, a tail or exterior lights, approached and hovered over the rural residential community of Morrice, MI at tree-top level. From a distance of 20 yards, the UFO displayed multiple lighted windows ala a commercial airliner of that era....along entire length of body.  After hovering motionless for 1-2 minutes, the tail ramp of craft dropped open in fashion similar to ramps of &#39;60&#39;s military cargo planes and subsequent Boeing 727 aircraft.  A coverall clad, normal sized human looking &#34;man&#34; walked out on the lowered ramp and physically signaled to the  visible pilot of an identical air craft 1/10 the size of the first vessel,that quickly apporached and stopped (hovered) 10 yards aft the larger aircraft.  The smaller aircraft entered the rear of the larger &#34;mother&#34; vessel in a! matter of seconds and the ramp door closed behind it, curtailing the yellow incandescent type light emitted from the larger aircraft&#39;s interior.  After a few moments, the droning RPM&#39;s of the unidentified craft increased as it moved off to the west at an estimated speed of 25 MPH, still just above the tree tops.  Local TV news the following night (Sunday) reported that UFO&#39;s (&#34;Ha!, Ha!) were sighted over Flint and Lansidng the night before.  Morrice is located just about half-way between those two larger cities. Both vessels were dark in color, but presumably metalic.  At first we could only see the outline of the larger vessel, but as our eyes adjusted and focused, we could the vessel rather well against a dark, cloudless, night sky.  The propulsion noise of the large vessel was similar to, yet, different than the sound of two diesel locomotive&#39;s whose engines, side by side, non-synchronously vibrating the air. The larger aircraft, again, lacked both wings and a tail, but was roundly &#34;pointed&#34; in the front akin to the shape of a traditional commercial or military aircraft. In fact, at first sight, I thought I was observing a slow moving airliner.  The shape of the larger vessel(s) in retrospect, was cigar like.  The smaller &#34;scout&#34; or &#34;shuttle&#34; vessel bore a front window large (possibly a clear canopy) enough to evidence a pilots head sillouhetted by background lighting from within the cockpit interior.  The shape of that head appeared to be that of what I would consider a normal hum! an being. The smaller craft could not be heard over the propulsion noise of the larger vessel, accounting perhaps for it&#39;s unexpected appearance out of the completely dark sky.  The beings I observed, looked like ordinary human individuals, the one on the larger craft being approximately 5&#39;8&#34; to 6&#39;0&#34; in height, and again, wearing what I described then at age 12 or 13, coveralls.  I would, today, after having served in the military, refer to the same clothing as a jump suit or a flight suit.  There was nothing extra terrestrial about this sighting.  In fact, the only thing that seemed unusual to me at the time and to this day, was the absence of wings, an air speed too low for even a four place Cesna to stay aloft, the stationary hovering, and the surprising appearance of the second smaller, identical vessel. The event reminded me the recovery of an amphibeous landing craft seen in WWII movies and in photographs. I recently spoke with a retired USAF Colonel, who claimed that &#34;TOP-TOP-SECRET-SECRET&#34; design and testing of aircraft was rumored to be taking place at one or more of the AF bases in Michigan (Wurtsmith, K.A. Sawyer, Kincheloe, Kinross, Selfridge ?) in the nineteen fifties and sixties.  Perhaps that is precisely what my grand mother and I observed.  I can recall being frightened enough by what I saw, that I didn&#39;t walk from the backyard down the driveway to the street where I could have watched the vessel in question fly across two or three hundred more yards of open sky before being obstructed from view by trees and houses.  Oddly, I don&#39;t recall having a conversation about our shared sighting with my grandmother on that eventful night or the next day.  I can clearly remember telling my parents on the following evening upon my return home, about what we saw, and becoming quite excited when the eleven O&#39;clock news backed up my most unusual account.<n>

My mother would never come forward.  My father would never believe it.  I myself have just graduated with a B.A. and am 24 years old.  My mother told me this story.  Before I can remember, my parents spent occasional weekends at a friend&#39;s summer home in Columbia, MS.  Late one night, at approximately 10pm, my mother was reading beside the east wall of the house, which is glass.  Occasionally looking up from her reading, she noticed a stationary light, which she assumed to be a star, that was getting brighter, over a period of approximately 2 hours, by which time the star&#39;s magnitude was similar to that of Venus.  Slowly then, the light began moving south at a speed of approximately one degree per minute.  My mother called my father into the front room to see the strange light.  They were so shocked by its rapid increase in speed (up to 10-15 degrees per minute), that they went outside and watched it move across the sky.  After only a few minutes, my mother became so unsettled that they went back inside, locked the doors, and had a good, nervous laugh. While I am just an amateur astronomer, this tale (given to me first hand, by my own mother no less) definitely piqued my increasing interest in UFO incidents.  As vague as the details are, I hope this is of some usefulness to you.<n>

The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street in Golden Valley, when I saw a flash in a cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices). I remarked out loud to myself, &#34;He&#39;s too low!&#34;. He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St.Paul airport that I&#39;d seen any planes take. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I&#39;d seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It came from the same cloud I&#39;d seen earlier! (It was a very large, white cloud, and unmistakable). I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating in the south, going around in a circle, and striking something with each pass. When the beam made contact, something flashed in the cloud. I had NEVER seen anything like this before! Why I didn&#39;t try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I&#39;ll never know. I simply stood there and thought, &#34;Isn&#39;t that interesting....&#34; - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o&#39;clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and came out at perhaps 11:00pm. The clouds had now drifted away, but the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight! Even though the clouds were gone, when it flashed, there seemed to be a variable haze around the flash. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. It was late and 3 of my neighbors had young children at that time, so I didn&#39;t feel comfortable calling them at 10:00 or 11:00pm or later, to say, &#34;Come out and look at this strobe light which flashes every 30 seconds...&#34;. I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type), and he had never heard of anything like it either. I was able to triangulate its location using a city map left over from the Street Light Project in our neighborhood, since I had 2 sightings of the object from 2 different angles. This thing was located approximately over the street or over a neighbor&#39;s house in front of my house! Frankly, I was flabbergasted - even though the triangulation was simple, and could really have been done in my head if I&#39;d been thinking. Since that episode, I&#39;ve purchased a videocamera and a 500,000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight. Maybe next time (if there IS a next time), I won&#39;t be so timid and mush-brained! Next time, I will videotape it, put a searchlight on it, use the binoculars, and call a neighbor for corroboration.<n>

The first object flew by at five mph, it was very dim and hard to see until it lit up for a second and dimmed back down for every five seconds. After that one passed, another showed up a few miles away from the first one. It was very bright and it also seemed to hover at five mph. The third appeared and it was opposite the direction the second object was. As I watched, I counted 7 bright objects. The objects were in a double line formation, atleast the six were, with the first leading the group. Each line consisted of three objects. If you were to look at the line in pairs of two, the objects formed a short, diagonal line. The colors of the objects were a sort of bright white(the last six) and they all seemed to be a circle or a oval.<n>

I then saw a big light focused directly skyward. The last thing I remember is saying to the girl, &#34;We need to get out of here.&#34; After that there is a complete blank.  I had never been with the girl before, and as I look back on it, I have no idea why we were in the woods or how long it took us to get there.  My boarding house room was a short distance from a drive-in restaurant where the girl picked me up.  My usual behavior would have been to take her to my room.  I don&#39;t have any recall of leaving the wooded area, and I never saw the girl again.  About 35 years after this happening, I have started recalling the above.  I expect that I went to work the next day as usual. I have no idea of time involved in this event. It was as if time stopped still. I still think of this happening and wish that something would connect to explain the situation I encountered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to get a more accurate date from the witness.

I was 10 or 11 years old.After a day of fishing with my friend we were sitting in his parents car trading stories when I saw a light come out of the sky twoard us. It hovered over an down a hill and settled over the river. By this time my friend looked up and saw it too. We both got out of the car and started walking toward the object. It would stop hover then move at great speed back and fourth then stop again. We were as close as 200 yards from it.We watched it do this for 30 to 45 seconds. It was disk shape and had lights going around it. It did not make any noise.It started going back up the hill hovered 600 to 900 feet above the hill then shot allmost              straight up in the sky.In less than a seconed it was the size of a small     looking star. We watched it move around in the sky for another 20 seconds or so then it came back down just as fast as it left. When my friend and I started walking toward it this time it came at us. We both froze, then it moved around again going up and down and moving at strang angles.Something an airplane could not do. The speed was very very fast. After watching it for another 45 seconds or more it shot back up in the sky. When this craft would shoot up in the sky and turn into a little spec,it would take a blink of an eye. We watched it standing still no bigger than a star then it starting moving across the sky heading south. It picked up speed then within 1 second it shot across the sky. I would say as far up as it was and my view point it traveled 75/100 miles in hundreths of a second. It was a clear night the moon was not out and there was a small airport near by. I rember during the day we would watch airplane turn and make there aproach to land .This was not some light in the sky are some kind of airplane.<n>

I saw two disc shaped objects ( blended in like street lamps) side by side  between the hours of 8:00 - 12:00 midnight They hovered toward me slowly.Gliding through the district like its nobodies business. A police helicopter was flying around with its spotlight on the ground. just below the disks. I dont think the helo pilots knew though. Approx. altitude was between 200 - 300ft. if that. The disk on the left had started to jitter a little. Acended upward slowly gaining altitude: progressing to a higher rate of speed. I spoke to a friend at work the following day ;he told me two kids from the UNLV area saw lights in the sky jolting around and called the Art Bell show to report the incident. Question: Is it possibile that whoever is piloting those alien craft can tell when somebody is watching them. Question 2: Do you think the disks camoflage themselves in cities to avoid detection? My final question is could you tell me if any report like this one came across the lines? Is it possible to give me a response?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We left,and upon returning home my ex-wife told me that she had left her purse at either the resturant or my mothers. I went to both,and as you leave my mother&#39;s old neihborhood you go down a high hill. As i was going down this hill,I noticed a strange light,non-blinking and shining brightly. I stopped the car on the hill and got out to look at it. There were no other cars on the road at the time,and this light did a righthand turn from it&#39;s original trajectory and began coming towards me. I was very curious at this point,and looked around to see if anyone else was seeing this. I then saw another car about to come around a bend in the road about an eighth of a mile down the hill and when I looked up at this light I saw it change back to it&#39;s original course,taking a left hand turn. I&#39;ve lived here all my life,and I was pretty sure I could catch up with this object,so I jumped back in the car and took off. I turned off on (I think it was called Cliffside drive or Rivercliff drive) an adjoining road and drove like crazy to see if I could catch this thing. That&#39;s when I came around a bend in the road,and to my amazement this huge rectangular/cigar-like thing was slowly moving over a pasture to the right of the road.It had begun drizzling by this time and I got out of the car and just stood there looking at it. I looked at it for about 10-15 seconds (it felt like a lifetime though) and then I got this unbelievable feeling that I was going to be in trouble for looking at this thing. I got so scared in fact that I jumped in the car and was driving away at a fast speed,crying before I knew what was going on. I remember looking at it through my rear-view mirror once just to make sure it was real and then I went home and cried for about an hour and a half while my ex-wife tried to drag it out of me what I saw.<n>

The sun had finally set, and we were eager to see mars, since it was at its brightest at this time. As my dad was setting  our little cheepo telescope, I happened to glance upwards to see three lights ina triangle shape, rotating around a fixed point. I stared in complete fascination. I showed my dad what I saw. He looked for a minute and simply  went, &#34;Huh!&#34;. He then continued to set the telescope. I really don&#39;t think he paid any mind. He had always said that he and his brothers use to see thins all the time out on the farm. He knew damn well that ufos existed, but simply thought that people were naive to think otherwise. I continued staring upward, only to see te thing take off at a speed which (I&#39;m assuming) human kind cannot produce at this time. I&#39;ll take this time to say that I think the whole &#34;alien&#34; thing is total crap. I hear about stories of little men with arms, legs, eyes, mouths,etc. It doesn&#39;t take a mathemetician to figure  the odds of an otherworldy being looking anything like a person are virtually slim to none. I expect more of an ameoba type-looking thing, or whatever. I don&#39;t know, maybe somewhere in the future, humankind accidentally  stumbles upon time travel. When were confronted by &#34;little green men&#34; we think they&#39;er\re from another  planet. This only shows how blind we are. I&#39;m blabbing! Thanks!<n>

He had told me that night about how he had seen a UFO sometime before.  I laughed.  He also said that he was abducted, but couldnt remember inside the &#34;craft&#34; or what the aliens looked like.  HOwever he did mention what the craft looked like. When i saw it for myself that night while i was with him, the object was exactly like he explained. We saw two bright white lights and then it seemed to dissapear.  And like 3 seconds later there was a bunch of multicolr blinking lights that took the form of a triangle.  I saw yellow, green, purple, red, and i believe there were other colors as well, but im dont think i saw much if any blue lights.  HE said there it is.  I was like thats just a plane, and he said no way, look at it.  So i starred and to my surprise, it was moving to the left (which was south)  but it wasnt moving straight.  It seemed to be stuttering, constantly and rapidly moving back and forth.  It was extremely fast whatever it was.  I seriously beleive it was a UFO. It also made no noise.  Another weird thing that happened, was we were walking down the street when we saw it, and i remember thinking about turning around to go back to my house.

I do not know what this means but I was getting home from band practice tonight, the night that all the crashes happened. I was looking around the sky for light of planes because I knew they were supposed to be grounded. I looked to the north and saw two disks with lights on the edge through some clouds. They had lights on them that changed in Sync from blue to green. They darted around each other for about 10-15 seconds before I lost track of them. I was really freaked out and I felt like this needed to be shared.<n>

I WAS 16 AT THE TIME AND A NON-BELEIVER OF THE UFO PHENOMONEN. I CAME UP FROM SACRAMENTO AND I WAS VISITING MY PARENTS FOR THE WEEKEND. WELL IT WAS EITHER FRI,SAT,OR SUNDAY. I WAS WALKING UP NELSON ROAD HEADING TOWARDS MADRONE ST. BUT I DID&#39;NT GET THERE JUST YET. I HAD STOPPED BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS. ONE WAS A CHURCH AND THE OTHER WAS THE SIDE OF A MINI MART. IT WAS NIGHT TIME AND I FIGURED THAT I WOULD GO FOR A STROLL IN THE TOWN GETTING TO KNOW IT BEFORE I MOVED HERE. WELL I NOTICED HOW QUIET IT GOT. THERE WERE NO CARS AROUND WICH IS TYPICAL IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN.  BUT THE ODD THING WAS NOT THAT. IT WAS THE FACT THAT I FELT MY HAIR RISE LIKE THERE WAS STATIC ENERGY OR SOMETHING. NOT ONLY THAT IN A YARD NEXT TO THE CHURCH WAS A DOG. THIS DOG JUST STARTED GOING BERSERK. IT WAS WHINING AND BARKING. WELL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I LOOKED AT THE DOG FIGURING IT WAS BARKING AT ME AND THEN THATS WHEN IT HIT ME. THE DOG WAS LOOKING UPWARDS TOWARDS THE SKY AT SOME TREES IN MY DIRECTION. AT THAT TIME I DID&#39;NT KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I LOOKED AROUND FIRST TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYBODY BEHIND ME OR STANDING AROUND. BUT THERE WAS&#39;NT. SO I LOOKED BACK AT THE DOG AND THE DOG WAS RUNNING AROUND AND STARING AT THE TREE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME. SO I FIGURED I TAKE A LOOK AT THE TREES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A CAT OR RACOON UP THERE. THEN RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KIND OF PANICKED AND MY HEART WAS THROBBING. RIGHT ABOVE THE TREES WERE TWO OBJECTS. THEY WERE THE SIZE OF CARS AND THEY WERE GLOWING WHITE. THE TWO OBJECTS WERE HOVERING THERE MOTIONLESSLY AND AT TIMES MOVED AROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT.  THE OBJECTS WERE AT LEAST SIX TO TEN FEET ABOVE THE TREES. FOR SOME ODD REASON IN MY MIND I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY WERE WATCHING ME AND IN SOME WAY IT WAS TRUE. THEY WERE. SO RECALLING SOME STORIES I HEARD I TURNED AROUND AND STARTED RUNNING BECAUSE I HEARD ABOUT ABDUCTIONS IN THE PAST. BUT THEN I STOPPED AND I WALKED TOWARDS THE OBJECTS AND STARED REALLY GOOD AT THEM. I TOOK OFF MY GLASSES JUST TO SEE! IF I WA S SEEING A REFLECTION OF LIGHT BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE. THESE OBJECTS WERE FANTASTIC. I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY KNEW I KNEW I WAS WATCHING THEM AS THEY WERE WATCHING ME. NOW I TURNED MY ATTENTION AT THE DOG AND THE DOG LOOKED AT ME AND WHINED AND LOOKED BACK UP AT THE OBJECTS. I LOOKED AT THE OBJECTS AGAIN AND THEN THE OBJECTS MOVED UP  HIGHER FROM THE TREE TOPS SLOWLY. THEN THEY PAUSED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAD ME RUNNING HOME. THE OBJECTS SHIFTED AND MOVED IN A DIAGONAL MOVEMENT TOWARDS SPACE. THEN THEY PICKED UP SPEED AND THEN QUICKLY SHOT UP TOWARDS SPACE AND I COULD SEE THEM AS THEY GOT HIGHER AND SMALLER LOOKING. THEN WHEN THE OBJECTS GOT SO SMALL LOOKING I SEEN THE TWO OBJECTS FLASH AND DISAPEAR. I THEN RAN HOME AND TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED. NOW WHAT AMAZED ME WAS WHEN I TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT IT AND ON THE TELEVISION WAS A SHOW CALLED SIGHTINGS AND I HAD AN UTTER LOOK ON MY FACE. I AM NOW A BELEIVER AND NOT A SKEPTIC. I DID FAIL TO REPORT ABOUT IT SOON TO THE LOCAL SHERIFFS OFFICE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS AFRAID I WOULD BE LOCKED UP FOR BEING CRAZY. NOW THERE IS TWO MORE EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS TOWN CALLED SUTTER WHICH I WILL HAVE TO REPORT ABOUT NEXT TIME. BUT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW ONE OF THE EVENTS HAD TO DO WITH ME WALING IN THE BUTTES AT NIGHT AND A BLACK HELICOPTER APROACHED ME. WELL I GOT TO GO FOR NOW. STAY TUNED FOR MY NEXT REPORTS NOW THAT I FEAL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TO TALK ABOUT IT. I WILL ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE AREAS. GOOD BYE!<n>

Two spheres then appeared to the west of us and floated directly over head at app. 500 feet altitude. Vanished while heading in easterly direction.***Note- there were no clouds; this was a clear night. these craft just disappeared into thin air. A large triangular shaped craft then appeared on the horizon over Monterey bay; I thought it was three separate aircraft flying low over the water when first sighted. As it approached us-(I was with one of my daughters)- I realized with shock that it was one aircraft-not three. It had very bright lights at each corner( I mistook these for conventional  aircraft approach lights.)This aircraft was huge and made no sound as it passed directly over us. It was black and very scary- I was afraid for our safety. The triangle flew over us and disappeared like the others before it. While my daughter and I ran for the car a group (7-10) of the orange spheres came in low over us, seeming to follow the big triangle. They flew off in different directions and made a &#34;whooshing&#34; sound as they darted off at an extremely high rate of speed. They all vanished like the others before they got very far away.<n>

Appeared massive, never changed direction, speed, or configuration of its six or more (I cleary saw six)dim white lights.  The object dissapeared when it dropped towards the horizon, due to city glare from the metropolitan Miami area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sober, not tired and had not recently seen any sci-fi movies, the sky was perfectly clear, low air traffic.  I have never seen something with these charcteristics in my entire exsistance.  I have no evidence other than what I saw, and I understand human perceptions are highly fallable, it was my subjective experience.  I know I saw something, what I do not know!  Too big to be a space station, could be six sub-orbital planes capable of tremenedous speeds and atmospheric pressures, or six orbital space crafts (US or other), flying in perfect formation (with out hint of going of course) while under these extreme conditions.<n>

It was about 50 feet overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went for an evening walk in a residential neighborhood in NE Portland.  While walking I noticed a blue cast on a lawn.  I looked over at the house thinking that it must be Christmas lights not yet taken down, but there were none.  Thought nothing more about it.  About five minutes later I again noticed the blue cast on a lawn.  This time I looked up.  Directly overhead was a bright blue ball.  Apparently it had been following me.  I stopped and the ball contined moving.  I estimated it at about 100 foot above the ground, and about 2-3 feet in diameter.  I based this estimate on a tree that it passed over.  It moved very slowly for about a block, then banked left but continued moving.  When it banked left a bright orange light came on in the center of the ball.  I watched it move for about 2 more blocks, then it simply disappeared.  I looked for searchlights or any lights in the sky but there were none.  I then became quite frightened and returned home. I retraced my steps the next day.  No Christmas tree lights.  I revised my estimate of height to about 50 feet above the ground because the tree that I used for estimating was much shorter than it appeared in the dark.  I mentioned the blue ball to my brother who suggested that it might be ball lightning.  I checked the weather and there was some lightning in the Portland area that evening.  Have never seen anything like it before or since.  The blue ball was simply beautiful Background.  I&#39;m ((age deleted)) and recently retired but at the time was working as a manager for the State ((deleted)) agency.<n>

It must have been around 8:00pm and it was just after dark and the weather was warm, clear sky, no clouds. Stars visible. I was the oldest and the ages of the other kids ranged down to about 8-9. We were in our own neighborhood and standing at the end of the street. Exact intersection address is N.W 42nd Ave. and N.W.9th Street The kids started yelling for me to look at some lights approaching us from the North. The first thing I saw was a soft red light approaching us thru the trees. And as it approached closer I could see two more red lights coming with it. My first thought was...what is that? As it came into the clear spot from behind the trees, the shape could be seen....a dark sharply outlined Equilateral Triangle with Three round-globe softly glowing blood-red lights, one on each corner where it would have come to a point if the lights were absent.It was Approximately 25-30 feet tip to tip each side although it could have been slightly larger.It was moving about 3-5mph...this I know because after we got a good look at it, we ran ahead of it in the same direction. The purpose of was to get my friends parents outside so they could see it too.they were only about seven houses down on the same street we were on (9th). And we were able to run ahead of this thing which was not too much higher that the trees... maybe 60ft up but less than 100ft. Well my friends parents Did witness this... But I will say this...I have never really understood their reaction to what we saw. The Father, who had been in the army and in Germany and tinkered with free-flight gas engine airplanes, saw this, and went back in the house and didnt say anything....I think he was spooked.... but when I asked him several times during the time after..even years after..he said He didnt know what it was, but would not discuss it... The Mother was spooked and didnt understand what she saw..now this is from my viewpoint of course... but I know how they acted at the time and remember it.But as far as my friends go, the two brothers and sister, They have all talked about it in the years since....we all know we saw something very strange. This machine, and it was a craft...was SILENT and if there was a sound, we didnt hear it.I could answer questions about this easier in person... because this typing is draining.. I have never been able to forget this experience. I was not afraid but really want to know the answer... I want to know if there was any other reports of this back in 1967 in Florida or elsewhere... and there is more to this story....something related happened 11 years later and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest.But this is too cumbersome here for me to say it all... I met Stanton Friedman in person here in Florida a few years back at White Springs and shared this with him, and Gave him a sketch of this that I made, but he had no information to share...he just thanked me for what I gave him... Sincerely, from ((name deleted)) Gainesville Florida…<n>

These objects emit Bright, Blue, Green, Red and Yellow lights. The movement of these objects are: Zig Zagging, Side to Side and Up and Down movements. Sometimes we have seen them flying. We are a family of 3. Age groups ranging from 32-81 years old. Our neighbors have also witnessed these objects. We have a panoramic view of the Ocean. We have spent HOURS and HOURS, observing and trying to figure out what it is we are seeing. We had a local newsreporter come to our house and she wrote a big article on our sightings. I called Peter Davenport in Seattle and also, the local Coast Guards, local Airport here in Newport and McMinnville, Oregon. Also, the local National Guard and have gotten a brush off from all of them. Have talked to a scientist at The Mcdonald Observatory in Texas and he assured! us that what we were seeing was not! stars, satellites or plantets. His exact words were, &#34;It is a phenomena&#34;.  Please, let us know what it is we are seeing in the skys of Newport, Oregon. We have taken many pictures but unfortunately they do not come out.  Please, contact us.

From a distance of about 20feet, the sphere glowed brightly, circled at random speeds around the shed--probably 5-7 times and then disappeared--it didn&#39;t fly away, it just went around the shed and never came back into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was probably 10-12 yrs and had a bedroom to myself--whereas my 3 brothers shared a room in our home. One of my brothers had a family friend over--I can&#39;t think he was over 14-15 then. The friend and my brother were witnesses to this event, but i have never questioned either of them in all these years since.  I saw the glowing sphere and screamed for someone to come in my room and look out the window.  My brother&#39;s friend and my brother both did, and we all three looked out the window at the orange glowing ball circling our &#34;tin shed&#34; as we called it--it was made out of tin and held such items like gardening tools and the like. From the distance of my room to the shed, the glowing ball looked to be about 2-3 times the size of basketball--but I was too little to really judge at that time.  It went around the shed at various speeds, sometimes quickly and sometimes not, but after a few revolutions, it just disappeared.  I went out there the next day, and saw nothing unusual, not that I knew what to look for anyway.  I have told this story many times over the years, but had never heard of anything like it, until reading other stories on the net and decided I would write.  I am now 31 and my brother and his friend 36 respectively.  I have had other strange encounters over the years--and one just this January in my new town of residence, St Louis.<n>

At break time (8pm) one of my men called me outside where he had been having a cigarette. He pointed above and to the left of us.  Some type of vehicle was, very slowly, floating from the northwest to the southeast. There were a series, slanted downward, windows in the craft. We could see figures moving about and some were apparently looking down out of the windows. The background behind the figures was red, making the figures look like silohettes.  The strange thing about the craft was the rather bobbing motion it had while moving along as it wasn&#39;t a smooth motion.  We watched it for about 10 minutes altogether.  Because of the darkness it was impossible to see much of a shape of the craft other than the lighted windows were in a curved arc.  I have been rather hesitant in talking about this sighting.  I rarely mention this to people as they look at me like I&#39;m a little demented.  I only believe what I see and this I did see.<n>

I was party to one of them but for whatever reason our family of five (all witness) never reported or talked about it until recently when more people and shows began investigating some of the strange phenomena.  I was a cigar like shape surrounded by orange, brown and reddish clouds or &#34;smoke&#34;.  It was large and long and just sat there doing absolutely nothing.  In fact after a few snapshots (which did not develop, we had a regular fast shutter speed camera),  we got a bit bored and went inside I believe.  It went away and we never saw it again.  It was in San Gabriel, California and seemed so close we could touch it if we had climbed a large tree.  This is the only way I could describe it from a child&#39;s memory, but I still remember it clearly, but not exactly afterwards.  We headed for bed after waiting for a long time for it to do something. I am very curious to know if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO in the past or recently.<n>

Sort of like the left arm of a &#34;V&#34; formation. i looked to see if was a dark shadow of a plane wing or something, but no shape.There was no noise associated with them. They moved rather slowly, then suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to get the kids to come out to witness the lights move slowly ove the back yard, but couldn&#39;t get them outside in time. I tried to get a date and time from the Lake County Sherriff records department, because I reported the above, but they said they hadn&#39;t gotten computers in yet and many times didn&#39;t keep the hand written reports made. That night when the deputy came I asked if anybody else had made a simular report? He said he wasn&#39;t aware of any. This has bothered me for years. Several years ago in Idaho my husband, two older children and I had seen very bright, small star like things (two of them) that seemed to be out of this atmosphere darting to and fro, one minute in one spot then all of a sudden in an other spot so fast your human eye lost track of them for a moment. We saw another just like the two only it was only one in California.  I don&#39;t remember dates or time of year on either The Idaho event or California event.<n>

It looked like something looking down on us.  There were no sounds or noise made and then it started disappearing slowly away leaving a puff of smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought someone or something was coming down on that beam.  I was staring at it waiting for something else to happen but nothing did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.  For a moment there I thought it was the coming of the lord.

Some years ago, standing in my backyard, I looked up an saw a triangular shaped object with a round cigar shaped bottom.  The craft was a beautiful brillant blue.  From the nose what appeared as an electrical charge started and snaked across the body of the craft.  As it did the color from the nose bac changed to a beautiful green.  When the charge stopped at the tail the entire object was green.  Sparks or shrouds of light came from the back (approx. 30 ft long) The object lurched forward and disappeared in a few milliseconds.  Anything like this reported before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object triangular in shape.   Size approximately 100 feet long.  Bottom of craft appeared rounded.   Color at time of sighting:  Light that was blue.  Noticable change:  An electrical color snaked or wormed through the body starting from what appeared to be the nose.  As the light snaked through the color behind it changed to a beautiful green.  At termination of electrical charge the entire color was green.  Sparks or energy rods shot from the back of the object as it lurched slightly forward and then disappeared in a few miliseconds. I do not wish to have my name released and request confidentiality.  I am curious is anything like this has ever been reported. If you want to contact me by e-mail, please do.  No phone calls or investigators.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting was approximately 1962.))<n>

My husband and the men saw a gigantic round object, lighted organge and surrounded by a haze that clung to the object and was also orange.  They heard no noise from the object.  Within a few minutes, the object turned sideways so that it assumed the classic &#34;cigar&#34; shape, then moved off, disappearing within seconds.  I asked my husband to describe the size in terms of &#34;hold your arm out straight, pretend you&#39;re sighting down your arm and tell me approximate size in inches&#34;.  He held his hands apart about 2 feet. After this encounter I contacted CUFOS (sp?), and they claimed it was a satellite that had been launched from Virginia that night.  when I relayed this to my husband, he burst out laughing.  He said only if the satellite visited middle Tennessee first. I relayed this story to a friend who at the time was in the astronomical society in Shreveport, Louisiana.  She said on that same night, two men at the boservatory had spotted the same thing, only smaller.  One of these men had a call from his mother in Michigan, who reported the same sighting. I am not dead sure of my dates--but I would like very much to know if anyone else recalls seeing a similar objecft at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bright orange, no sound, surrounded by a haze that reflected the orange light, round at first sight, then turning to present the side.  My husband is a heavy equipment mechanic who reads no UFO literature, never has and probably never will.  The other men are older, retired men.<n>

I followed the light as it passed overhead with my digital camera, I grabbed a passerby and asked her to take a look at the light to see if she knew what it was, she had no idea what it was.  The entire episode lasted 7 minutes before it just vanished.  It was only when I zoomed in on the light after the picture was taken that i realised that i was looking at more than just a light!  There were several lights that changed formation with no noticable change in colour.  Coincidentally, there were several other sightings over West Cumbria during this same week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness submitted two photos, but they are simply a squiggle of light in one, and a dot of light in the other.

I saw that light coming at us above the clouds making shadows. It had a sparkling tail and it was very bright. I saw lots of falling meteors but this was not a meteor. I stopped the car and told my friend that we are about to see a UFO. They were exciting too; we got out of the car and start to look at this object. It was very fast and bright. We could see it&#39;s sparkling tail behind and it passed by right above us. No noise. Basically it went from one end horizon to the other between the clouds. Next morning the newspapers had a FrontPage and half of the page covered that saying lots of people saw three or more UFOs that night. It&#39;s tail was abut ten times longer then itself and we could see it as big as ping pong ball.<n>

We were dropping one of our friends off at home at the mouth of Carmel Valley, when what appeared to be a large Craft came out of or just over the top of the mountain. It was very large and did not look like anything of that of a conventional aircraft. The shape was that of a long triangal squared off at the back and tapered to a point as to what appeared to be the front secondary to the direction it moved. The craft moved slow and then to a stop, and hovered With only that of a hush like hum type of sound, then it moved slowly to the north towards Monterey. We followed it to the top of Carmel hill in which the craft shot out over Monterey Bay very fast in a North West direction. At that point we decided to visit  Monterey Airport, only to find that there was nothing found on radar and no in coming or outgoing flights were scheduled in the monterey area at that time. As a note further on the description of the craft, it did have spiratic lights of green, red and yellowaround the sides and base of the craft. All I can say is that it was very exciting to se and I will always wonder.<n>

We will ask the witness to attempt to reconstruct the precise date.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a close encounter with an unidentified craft over downtown Los Angeles around 1978 or 1979. I saw  4 human in appearance beings .<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was driving me to work one day I was on the back of his motorcycle. We were going west on Figueroa St and just crossed Olympic Blvd. I looked to my left at a hotel (Holiday Inn I think) and I saw  what appeared to be a metallic colored disc shaped object shoot up from behind the taller buildings nearby. It got to a height of 100 feet into the air. At this point I told Bob to check out his left near the buildings and he did but he told me he had to keep his eyes on the road so I had to watch it for the 2 blocks it traveled in a straight line occassionally dipping 30 feet. We turned left onto 12th St and then the sun shined on it and I could see inside the ship because it turned transparent. I could see 3 or 4 people inside of which 2 were looking out at me &amp; they were leaning over a console /platform. They looked like 2 handsome ordinary human men. I gave them the peace sign because it seemed fun to do. They didn&#39;t respond and showed no emotion other than curiosity. I had to go to work at 1200 N. 12th St. so he dropped me off after I told him to follow it. He lost it about 1/2 a block away. I risked being made fun of once when I called radio station KROQ after they asked their listeners if anyone has ever seen a UFO in Southern California. I don&#39;t think they believed me but I was curious if anyone else had seen that craft. I have a copy of my calling KROQ. I don&#39;t tell many people because of my fear of ridicule. My husband saw them too but not as clearly as me. He has a pretty good description of it all. It reminded us of a soap bubble where the setting sun shone on it. Where the sun didn&#39;t hit it , the craft remained steel gray opaque color. My husband doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to tell anyone but I&#39;ve been keeping quiet too long because of fear of someone coming around and telling me to keep quiet.<n>
1988-89 18:58|Houston (17 miles W. of)|TX|Unknown|Ended by 19:01|Large UFO thunders over Houston neighborhood at TREE-TOP level!|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14929.html|100|ndxe| Large UFO thunders over Houston neighborhood at TREE-TOP level!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The incident occurred in a neighborhood called &#34;Forestview,&#34; 17 miles West of the city of Houston. Forestview lays directly South of Baker&#39;s Reservoir and within that reservior was a military air base. They trained para-troopers and practiced flying helos out there all the time. The neighborhood was used to seeing para-troopers training within the confines of the reservior, but occassionally, a helo or two would circle over the neighborhood at a pretty low level. No one was bothered, however, and I remember the whole neighborhood just being used to the military presense. Also, the neighborhood, in particularly my house, laid in the flight path of a small airport in Sugarland, miles to the South. The small aircraft would usually fly South over the neighborhood and over my house to land down there in the small little airport. So, this is the setting of which my encounter took place. I don&#39;t remember the year because I was only 9 or 10 at the time, and I wasn&#39;t really too interested in UFOs either. I do remember the exact time, though, because of what I was doing. I was watching the local NBC affliate and I remember that some boring sit-com had just gone off. The ending credits were now on the screen and the exciting Prime Time shows were next. I looked at the clock. 6:58pm. Just a few more minutes and something good would come on. Bored, I tuned out and listened the noises within the house. I was in the bedroom watching tv, while my parents were in the livingroom watching something different. I could hear a loud and annoying commercial playing on theirs. I also heard something else, something I was used to but I would always notice it. It was the low steady sound of an approaching plane. Not wanting to watch the stupid commercials on tv, I got up and went to look out the window. It was night outside, as I looked North through my backyard, and cloudy too, low clouds. As I listened, the noise got louder and louder. Louder and louder, louder and louder still, until I realized that this sounding bigger than what I was used to hearing. I looked up in the direction of the approaching &#34;plane&#34; and waited for it to appear over my house. I didn&#39;t think I would actually see it in the darkness and through the clouds, but at least I thought I&#39;d be able to see the lights. Eventually, as the steady hum built into a rolling, thundering roar, the aircraft suddenly appeared and what I saw scared the living hell out of me. Upon seeing it, I instinctively hit the ground and braced myself. To me, at that moment, I thought I was about to see a plane crash into my neighborhood. In that flash of a terrifying instant, I saw a solid metalic underbelly of a large aircraft appear through my trees and it was so low it appeared to be flying at tree-top level! What didn&#39;t make sense, but I didn&#39;t have time to think about as I ducked for cover, was that this thing was huge. The curved underside of it was at least three houses wide. Nothing that big ever flew over the neighborhood, not at that level anyways. And, it had absolutely no lights. None. The only reason I was able to see it... was that the streetlights behind my house reflected off the bottom of the craft. THAT&#39;S how low it was. Well, I waited. Curled up in a frieghtened little ball, I waited and listened as the sound gradually died away. I braced myself for an explosion, as I imagined that the &#34;plane&#34; would surely crash. It didn&#39;t. After it finally died away. I stood up and contemplated everything I just experienced. Thinking back on what it looked like, it wasn&#39;t until after the experience that I realized I had seen a UFO. I ran into the livingroom, all excited. &#34;Mom! Dad! Did you hear it?! Did you see it?!&#34; They just looked at me, puzzled. I couldn&#39;t believe it. They HADN&#39;T heard it. But, to me, it sounded so incredibly loud. I was frustrated. How could they not have heard something as loud as that. They knew that I was not prone to over-reacting or letting my imagination run THAT wild. They listened to my experience with interest, but they said they truthfully didn&#39;t notice anything. Discouraged and confused, I stayed up the rest of the night, even watched the evening news. I watched the entire broadcast, waiting to see if they mentioned anything about a UFO or at least a plane making an emergency landing down in Sugarland. Nothing, but I did take note of something I thought might lead to a possible answer. If it didn&#39;t come from that air-base, which I still believe it did, then I thought it might have something to do with the jet-stream, which was exactly over the city of Houston at the time. Sorry, for such a long post, but hopefully I&#39;ve provided enough details about my experience that you may be able to draw up some conclusions, thoughts, or ideas.<n>
Early October , 1985 18:30|Cloverdale|CA|Circle|1 minute|UFO sighted while in-transit on southbound 101 near Asti|8/30/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08831.html|101|ndxe| UFO sighted while in-transit on southbound 101 near Asti<n> <n><n> <n><n> In early September of 1985, I was beginning a pre-calculus course  taught by one of my high school math instructors at Santa Rosa Junior College. Mr. S was also a good friend of my parents (my mother worked with Mr. S&#39;s wife), and with our familiarity, we  commuted to the night class 2 nights a week. One particular evening, Mr. S&#39;s wife joined the trip and remarked &#34;What a funny looking light in the sky&#34; in an unusual tone of voice. I&#39;ve seen many UFO sighting in the area of Cloverdale my whole life (due to my love for stargazing), so I instintively reacted to her remark. Sitting in the rear seat, I craned my neck back and looked up at the sky through the rear window. It was fairly dark, the sky was quite clear with whisps of stratus clouds. Hovering over a grape vinyard/Russian River on the east side of HWY101 just south of Cloverdale near Asti. The craft was apparently motionless and hovering at approx. 500-600 feet. It was comprised of a large, central red light (which appeared dome like) surrounded by a cricle of numerous small white lights. The large red dome pulsated from bright to dim illumination while the ring on small lights flashed momentarily and sequentially around the red light. I could not ascertain as to what the shape of the craft was, but there was visible depth to the light formation, but the amibient light levels are fairly low on that particular portion of the highway. I continued to watch the object as we drove south until we went behind a spur of the local hills on the highway. At the time of the sighting I was 18 yeats of age, Mr. &amp; Mrs. S were in their late 50&#39;s.<n>

As I was towling off, I was looking approximately NNW, at &#34;Windy Point&#34;(a local terrain feature), when 5 objects appeared from the west, over the top of the Point. The objects came to a smooth halt, rigidly maintaining their formation. They were flying in a box formation --one at each corner, the fifth in the center. Their altitude would have been between 2000-3000 feet. The objects were disk-shaped, 30-50 feet in diameter, and emitted a &#39;soft-white&#39; glow. As I watched, the objects underwent extreme acceleration, disappearing over the eastern horizon in seconds, while maintaining their formation. I looked back at the Point, and another group of five objects appeared, in the same formation. They came to a smooth halt, then &#39;backed up&#39;, the way they had come. At no time did the objects &#39;turn&#39; in any way. They made no discernable sound. I later called the Edwards AFB PIO to report the incident, and was told that they were &#34;...helicopters, on maneuvers.&#34; At the time of the incident, I was 11 years old. I susequently went on to join the USMC, where I served for 6 years. I have had an abiding interest in helicopters from a very young age, and I have never seen any helicopter perform maneuvers that even remotely resemble what I saw that night.<n>

We had the sun at our backs. The weather was clear, the sky was clear with a few wispy clouds. The part of sky in which we saw the object was clear. My wife saw the reflection of it at first. She asked me if I saw it and I slowed down. I saw it and looked for wings thinking it was the shiny reflection of a plane heading to or away from us (as I only saw the round shiny orb). I could see the round orb shape clearly, but could not see the horizontal line that would be wings. Then it made it&#39;s turn and if it had wings, I should have been able to see them. I did not. Neither did my wife. From our vantage point of moving east, the craft was at our 10 o&#39;clock position when first noticed. Our movement was straight during the time we saw it. The craft moved south to our 12 o&#39;clock position then made a slow arc downward toward the ground (probably 10 degrees downward) then when approx. 10 degrees above it original altitude, moved away from us at our 2 o&#39;clock position. Very fast when it moved away. All motions were very smooth and controlled. Regarding the direction of movement, the craft moved very smoothly, no erratic action. It moved slowly at first. Took approx. 60 - 70 seconds to move from its initial position to the point at which it started its curve downward. It then accelerated through the curve and shot away from us at a very high speed. Fast enough that we lost sight of it after a few seconds when it finished its arc - maybe five to ten seconds at most to get out of sight. No apparent radio or electrical interference. It was a silver sphere. No wings or other markings. As described, we were probably 3-4 miles away, according to the mountains it was over in the Blairsville GA region. It was polished and looked like a ball bearing. It was large enough that I would guess it to be as large in diameter as the length of a small plane would be at the same altitude and distance from us. It was very polished and smooth in appearance. It&#39;s movements were very smooth. Not like the erratic movements of balloons adrift. Nor did it have the crinkly texture (mylar) or teardrop shape that balloons always seem to have.<n>

What i saw n the binoculars was a, i guess a sphereical orange light .Not blinking.One time it looked liked one of them had a wide short beam of white light coming out of the top.Another time the long triangulated or sphereical light was sitting at a 45 degree angle.Well they were getting to far away to really see them so we went back inside.The whole length of time was mabye 15 minutes.We really have no idea what they were.This is first time i have ever seen anything unexplainable in the sky.I have always ben interested in the unexplainable things like ufo,s and bigfoot.I know bigfoot could not exsist,I know its all a hoax but still watch any thing about it .I dont really know why.This ufo sighting happend about 3 hours ago. I knew about this website by websurfing but never thought i would get to submit any thing.I,m going to call the local airport tomorrow to see if they know what the lights were.I bet you they dont.Let me add this ,i coulndnt see a definant shape of the objects ,just glowing orange lights.Thru the binoculars when one was fairly close it looked like a long traingulated sphereical orange light .I couldnt see what the light was coming from .As far as it emitting a wide short beam of whitish looking light out of the top of it , i,m really not sure about that as i was trying to focus the binoculars,but it sure looked like it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date not indicated by witness.

It flew in a very straight line toward my house. It appeared to be 400-500 ft high. There was no wind so it was not a balloon.  It turned north in a 45 degree angle about<n>

At first we thought it might be a string of balloons, but the the object was definitely of a set shape. It remained stationary, slowly rotating on the horizontal plane and drifting extremely slowly to the west, all the time rotating horizontally and keeping its shape.  We tried to look at it through a telescopic lense on a camera, but got no better resolution than with unaided eyes.  An airplane flew low beneath it and seemed not to acknowledge it.  It was too high to be a kite.  It was noiseless.<n>

Normally this wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, but on this cloudy night it really stood out in the sky. I observed the light dropping below the cloud level then back up into the clouds over and over as it moved across the horizon. At first I thought it was a star, but it was moving. Then I thought it was a plane, but it was moving way too slow. So I stopped my car, got out and watched it move West to East right over the city. Whenever it was directly overhead it didn&#39;t change in appearance as I anticipated, and it made no sound whatsoever. My next thought was that it was a helicopter, but there were no flashing lights and it didn&#39;t make a sound. I noticed some other people watching this object also so I was not the lone witness. The only way to describe this object is, it was a bright white light, and I couldn&#39;t make out a shape.<n>

I could see the sky through it&#39;s interior opening. It was metallic or chromed finished. It seemed to reflect the setting sun on it&#39;s surface. The craft asended in a straight upward flight exposing its complte triangular shape. The metalic frame of the craft had what appeared to be 10-12 equally spaced thrusters on one side of the craft. After a brief ascent it seemed to turn in a 90 degree angle which I figured was upside down now that the thusters were on the top side. As it rolled into that 90 degree turn the craft took on a thin flat shape. With  the thin edge I could  barely see, I could not see its shape any longer as the craft turned stealth like or (blended in with the blue sky). The thin edge I could still see excellerated so fast to the east that the edge was thinning into nothing. The black helicopter was gone as well but I had completly forgotten about it. I immediately whipped into a conveinent store to see if anyone on the inside just witnessed what I had just seen but no one seemed to be excited from any sighting so I kept it to myself. My family still laughs at me today until today (Sunday Nov. 15th) when the Charlotte Observer,page 2A, a gentleman writes that his wife swears she has recently seen the same type of craft. The paper printed your web site. Until now I didn&#39;t know where to write to tell anyone.<n>

A very large cigar shaped silver craft flew slowly over the center of the city and cast a shadow so that hundreds of people looked up and saw it. It was NOT a blimp as they were a daily sight on sub duty for years previous, and it was much larger and silent.I was about 13 of 14 years old at the time. My brother,my Mother, my Father and I, as well as many of the neighborhood people all watched it . My Dad, just back from the air force, called it a Foo-Fighter. It flew from east to west, and from our vantage at S.W.4th Ave and 10th.St. it seemed as large as the Dade county court house which was plainly visible and at an altitude roughly twice that of the building. (23 stories) It seemed to fly directly over it. Friends of mine north of there placed it in the same location. It was the main topic of conversation for a day or two then everyone just let it pass. In those days people (including pilots) were not afraid to talk about what they saw.<n>

While on the way back in total daylight and in a built up buissy area at what must have been around 3:00 i looked up into the very lightly clouded blue sky and saw an object hovering. Now i have not writen a recording of this down so the exact info that follows may not be 100%. We pulled over in the car and parked in a side street to look at the object. to me the object looked to be a dull silver colour not verry shiny at all. it was what appeared to be a cone wedge like shape from the angle that i could see it. there was some detailing on the object but i can not recolect what it was  just that it had it. we saw the object for around 10 minutes hovering in one spot and slightly altering its orientation in the sky over a slow period of time. Me my mum and my younger brother all witnessed this object. the object then changed it orientation to what seemed to be vertical and slowly rised upwards. this is when it god a bit more exiting and a large lokking flam of what looked like fire came out of the bottom (as u would see in a hot air baloon) and the object shot upwards very rapidly and out of site. I would also note that nasa was develaping a vertical take off and landing roket thing that i saw on discovery chan that has a similer sort of shape and movement in the air to the object i saw. I know that what i saw was not a NASA thing but it gives a compparison.<n>

( I believe it was a baseball game between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh and I believe it was in August, 1977. During a break in the action, the camera suddenly focused on a object that I can only describe as a four-story building hanging at an angle in the sky adjacent to the playing field. One of the commentators said &#34;What is that?&#34; The other replied &#34;I don&#39;t have a clue.&#34; the camera then returned to the ballgame. A few minutes later, the camera again focused on the object, which apparently hadn&#39;t moved. Again, one commentator asked the nature of the object, this time with more urgency in his voice. Again the other commentator disclaimed knowledge of the object. Again, the camera returned to the action on the field. After an interval of several minutes, the camera again focused on the object (which apparently had not moved), this time using a telescopic lens. The object appeared to be made from some dull, non-reflective, greyish metal. It was huge (there were buildings on the ground that could be used for comparison). The second commentator was still talking about the game when he was interrupted by the first commentator saying emphatically &#34;I want to know what THAT is!&#34; Play resumed on the field and the camera did not focus on the object again. I waited expectantly for the evening news, thinking that the story would be earth-shaking. The news had no mention of the event, either that evening or the next day. No newspaper picked up the story. Apparently the entire episode became a non-event. Over the years I gradually forgot about it, until about a year ago. I gave this report to another internet UFO site, but never heard anything from them. My story should be easily verifiable. All the networks keep video tapes of all the sporting events they broadcast. Even if the game turns out to be football rather than baseball, going through the videos for August and September of 1976-1977 shouldn&#39;t prove too difficult. Such a search will be rewarding.<n>
00/00/1994 15:00|El Paso/Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)|TX|Sphere|05 minutes|Big, crazy, spinning eyeball tumble-weeding along at warp-speed.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13367.html|120|ndxe| Big, crazy, spinning eyeball tumble-weeding along at warp-speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a big, white sphere with a black spot on one side rotating counterclockwise. It looked like a spinning eyeball tumbling through the sky faster than any airplane I&#39;ve ever seen. It also &#34;fuzzed&#34; in and out of focus while we watched it, ranging in clarity from hard/shiny like a silver christmas ornament to soft/fuzzy like a white cotton ball. It was also impossible to guess how big this thing was or how far away. A Sunday afternoon when the freeways were full of people going home after a day out at the malls or wherever. We were heading east from downtown and were just going over that big spaghetti bowl where the I-10 jacks into that freeway headed towards the Army base, starting to go north along the east side of the mountain. I thought at first it was one of those plastic grocery bags being whipped along in a real high thermal, thinking it was going real fast for that. Then I saw it was big, shiny, solid, tumbling, real high, supersonic speed. Wait: small, fuzzy, soft, close. Hold on, it keeps changing! What the hell is that thing? Like a big, crazy, weird, spinning eyeball. It&#39;s really moving on, too. I hope it&#39;s one of ours. It&#39;s almost out of town, it&#39;s gone. Take me to the crazy house cause I&#39;m hallucinating. It either popped like a balloon or got shot out of here like a rock in a slingshot. Maybe straight up or at a slant up and north over White Sands, hundred-thousand mile-an-hour. Somebody tell me what the hell that was! I still wouldn&#39;t believe to this day I had really seen something like that except that there were four other people in the car who saw it, and doubtless thousands of others in the thousands of other cars on the road with us. Also, the Nasa T-38&#39;s at El Paso International Airport, the ones that escort the shuttle in on its piggyback ride when it lands in California, they were circling around the airport like a bunch of buzzards because what they had gone up to chase was long gone. To top it all off, the driver of the car was a retired Army lifer with all kinds of spooky top-secret clearances for his job he had for years on White Sands Missile Range. We&#39;d just finished a 3-week running debate about UFO&#39;s a couple days before this. He described his job, his clearances, and how he&#39;d seen everything there was to see &#34;out there. And there ain&#39;t no such a thing as no little green men!&#34; He had me convinced for the first time in my life, and kind of depressed at the idea that maybe we really are alone in the universe. I&#39;m glad it only lasted three or four days. He was asking me over and over &#34;What is that?What is that?&#34; When it was gone, I had to rib him: &#34;You tell me, Mr.Top-Secret Man. It was something, you wouldn&#39;t ask what it was if you hadn&#39;t seen it, an Object! You gotta admit it was Flying awful god**** fast. And until you tell me what it was, (cause you know about everything and I&#39;ll take your expert word on it), it was Unidentified! A UFO.&#34;  I think he&#39;s still mad at me for that, and still won&#39;t admit it was a UFO. But I saw the damn thing, Nasa saw it, everybody on the freeway saw it, and probably everybody in Juarez, too. They can&#39;t go on saying millions of us are just crazy or stupid forever. So I&#39;m sticking to my guns, and I&#39;m never gonna shut up about it, and I&#39;ll never stop trying to find out what it was. It changed the way I understand reality forever. I don&#39;t know about the UFO&#39;s other people have seen, I only know &#34;mine&#34;. Just give me &#34;mine&#34; and I&#39;ll be happy and go away quiet, dammit. Until then, you organized UFO people keep up the good fight, I&#39;m with you all the way. And help me find &#34;mine&#34; if you get time.<n>

I was in our front yard playing with about 4 or 5 other children (some boys and some girls) when someone (I don&#39;t remember who) excitedly pointed skyward and exclaimed: &#34;Hey, you guys, what&#39;s that?&#34; Well, we all looked up, and saw a bright, silvery-white object, far and away above the top of the tallest tree in the neighborhood, and appeared to be approximately the size of a basketball held at arms-length. (What the actual size was, I am unable to estimate as I do not know the correct formula for computing this.) Anyway, it circled the neighborhood approximately 8-10 times in 4-5 seconds, hovered over the southwestern edge of the neighborhood for an additional 2-3 seconds, and then took off to the sowthwest never to be seen again. To this day, we still wonder among ourselves, just what the dickens it was we did see?  Also, I wonder, did anyone else see it, and did they report it? (The neighborhood where this occurred is the Elmhurst Addition, which is adjacent to the Brentwood Addition if that helps.) Also, there were no wings nor tail assemblies that we could see, there was absolutely no sound whatsoever, and no visible exhaust.<n>

It was a bright sunny day. We were driving in medium traffic on the six lane highway (3 each way)  when a bright glowing green ball of light flew past our van and continued along above the highway at about fifteen feet above the roadway. When it got to the overpass down the road from it, it continued to follow the conture of the road staying the same height above the road. We could see it continue on past the &#34;hump&#34; of the overpass (actually we could not see it go down the back side of the hump) but it continued on and came back into view and continued out of sight. The driver and myself saw this object as about the size of a softball. As it passed the van we were in it was no more  than a few feet from the side of the van. I was on my knees bwtween the two front seats. The drivers wife however, said the green ball seemed to be about the size of a basketball and about fifty feet  off the road. The lady driving the car that was beside us waved here arms franticly at us pointing, like, &#34;did you see that?&#34; We nodded yes and kept driving. It seemed to be going a couple hundred miles an hour. it was gone in a few seconds. The green ball was very bright, glowing emerald green light, quite visable in the bright sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

CLouds moving from SW to NE, but object and relatively  smaller round and white orbs zipping around the main disk. Main disk shimmered from the side and when it turned on its side you could see an inscribed dark inner circle. I had rand into the house and got a pair of 9X25 (5.6degrees) Nikon binoculars. The objects were not affected by the winds above which moved the sporatic clouds at pretty fast speeds. After some time, seeing how it appeared to be intent on staying around awhile I went to find a camera, but only my Nikon 35mm had film and this has no telephoto lens. However, upon blowing up the objects in Photoshop you can see the Saturn shape and its companion which resembles the &#34;X&#34; shape of those craft that Luke Skywalker flew in the final battle in the movie Star Wars. THese &#34;Xs&#34; seemed to have emitted from the craft, but I could be wrong. THey were hard to see and seemed to leave some kind of visual blur (not a contrail, but could be mistaken for one). I am a college educated professional of 38 years of age, who majored in geological engineering and my wife is a geologist too. I am an amateur astonomer with 10&#34; Newtonian and 8&#34; C-8 with computer and am familiar with the local sky. Often we see strange craft coming out of Edwards AFB nearby. Incidentally, the craft would have been just south of the Edwards AFB southern boundary. I can send a map to anyone interested. I am not mistaking this sighting for conventional or any kind of typical experimental aircraft. I am an aviation buff and have done consulting work for leading pioneering contractors in military aerospace. One more thing. I could see jetliners passing nearby and clearly below these objects. So I estimate that if the cumulus clouds peaked at 55,000 feet that the object was somewhere above this, maybe at 75,000 feet. Therefore, the main object must have been much larger than large airliner and the smaller orbs about the size of the airliner. Keep in mind I viewed with binoculars. I have 30 hours in flight training and my wife is a private pilot. I am sending you the photos by e-mail attachment. That e-mail will read &#34;VictorilleUFOs&#34; as will the attachments.<n>

Traveling in a straight line from west to east at a rate of speed approximate to that of a jet, the object was a-glow from white light reflecting up from the earth below.  Two or three other objects, similar in appearance yet smaller in size and more difficult to see, were then observed trailing the larger object as it reached a 90-degree zenith point in the sky.  Spread out at random distances up to a total of about a 40-degree arc, each object caught up with the larger object and flew around the sides and rear of the larger object in honeybee-to-hive fashion.  Each smaller object, one at a time, disappeared into the back of the larger object. The larger object, picking up speed, kept moving in a straight line towards the east.  At about 55 degrees up from the eastern horizon, developing thunderhead clouds obscured the object from view and it could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report does not indicate date of incident.

I was swinging on a swing set with a friend of mine and happened to look up to see a U.F.O. flying low enough so that I could see the windows or what looked like windows anyway on the sides of the ship. I wanted to tell my friend to look, but new that it was travling to fast and by the time I would have told her it would have been gone. So, I said nothing. It&#39;s possable she saw it too i guess, but I was to young to think about it at the time. I also had no idea what aliens and Ufos were other than as a creation of hollywood, just like the terminator. I know this for fact because a year or two later when I saw some show on Ufos I remember than telling my brother for the first time what it was that I had seen. He was the first person I told.<n>

My partner and I took our daughter and her friend to the swimming pool and went off for a drink at the opera terrace.  It was a bright clear day with not a cloud in the sky. My partner went to get the drinks and I sat at a table.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking up, I saw a silver disc in the sky. I couldn&#39;t tell you how far away it was or what size it was as I had nothing to compare it with. The waitress came to clear the table and I said to her &#39;Look at that,&#39; pointing at the craft. She said it looked fantastic but took no further interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke to the people on the next table and they said it was great but when I suggested it was a ufo they turned their backs and didn&#39;t want to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed it to my partner and we watched it for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Passenger aeroplanes passed by without it moving but then it went away. A light silver plane flew over and when it had gone the craft reappeared.  We watched it until it disappeared again and a Harrier jump jet flew over rather slowly. When it passed the craft returned. It was almost a spiritual experience. Every so often clouds of luminous substance I presume were ionic bursts of blue and orange were emitted from the craft. It was a truly amazing sight looking down on the streets with all the people walking by, bulders high up on construction sites and nobody aware of the craft. A heliuum filled balloon escaped and flew off in a different direction. It was as though all this was happening to remove all doubt that it could only be a craft. We had to collect our daughter and I said to her and her friend do you want to see a ufo and they laughed thinking I was having a joke.  Walking back through Covent Garden I saw some one with a camera and asked him to take a picture but he could not speak English ! and I di dn&#39;t pursue the matter. We watched the craft until about 7.00pm. It did the most amazing thinks, appearing and disappearing instanly it was like blinking. Then a sort of brown cloud appeared around it and it disappeared and then returned. Eventually I had to take the children home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened a few years ago but it is very much in my memory. I have a degree in analytical chemistry and was wearing a new set of contact lenses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a child I had many dreams of being abducted by aliens. One vivid one was of flashing lights at my bedroom window. I lived in a large house overlooking Elswick Park in NEwcastle upon Tyne England. In this dream I was the only person left. The aliens had everyone I knew and many other people I don&#39;t know where but I was aware of being the only one conscious. I also had dreams of beings in my bedroom thsat were so frighteneing that I would have to sleep with the light on and would always get into trouble for it but the trouble was never worse than the fear. Playing in the park one day I noticed a lump under my skin on my knee cap. I could mmove it around under the skin. It is not there now and I have not had it removed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is more things in my life but can be interpreted in rational terms so I will not go into them here. I have often wondered about hypnotic regression to see if it would reveal more of my dreams but am unsure about the technique. After seeing the craft I looked into ufo&#39;s and alien abduction so my mind may be contaminated with this information. I am still unsure whether to be contacted by an investigator but I assure that what I have written is true and would testify to it in a court of law or on anything that I hold dear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

summer/49 11:00|New Troy|MI|Cigar|unknown|Large (at least 500 yards long) cigar shaped object with two rows of approx 100 windows. Light metallic brown color. Issued blue light.|10/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/009/S09687.html|145|ndxe| Large (at least 500 yards long) cigar shaped object with two rows of approx 100 windows. Light metallic brown color. Issued blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 4 years old.  Playing in front yard of home.  I became aware of the object when I was kneeling on the front lawn on all fours when I became aware that the green grass was blue in color.  As soon as I became aware that the grass was blue and was puzzled about it, it suddenly switched to green.  It was then I realized I could move and I stood up and felt a presence behind me.  I turned and looked up above the trees and saw the large object.  It had approx a double row of 100 windows and was light brown metallic color.  It was moving slowly west.  I felt fear and turned to run into the house.  But then it dawned on me I had just been there and the &#34;people&#34; were friendly. I turned back, smiled and waved.  I stood there and watched the object move slowly west for about 3 minutes.  I then ran into the house and tried to communicate to my mother what I had just seen.  She went outside but the craft had already passed over and did not return.  She could not understand what I was trying to tell her.  She then asked if I wanted lunch (that is why I place the time around 11 AM). I remembered at the moment the &#34;people&#34; who looked like those whose picture was on the front of Communion though with less pointy chins as depicted on that cover.  I later recalled &#34;flashes&#34; or moments of actually being on the craft.  In junior high school I would draw/doodle pics of the large eyed, large headed persons.  It is difficult even now to think of them as aliens or anything other than persons or people.  It was a totally positive experience. Later, I was in Army Intelligence as Chief, Intelligence Branch, Military Intelligence Division, G2.  During the USS PUEBLO incident I participated in decisions about the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea (Jan68).  I experienced an intense Deja Vu and there was a sense of dread that &#34;the last time through&#34; we had made the wrong decision and used nukes vs NK.  I made recommendations not use them in a memo that had 5 items against and 3 items for their use. After the memo had b! een acce pted by, sent in CINC, UNC name unchanged, I experienced a recall of craft seen at 4 years old and the feeling that was why had the &#34;contact.&#34;  That the purpose of that &#34;contact&#34; had been fulfilled with my recommending not using the nuke weapons but instead advocating for negotiations and setting an example for other countries to keep the peace.  The first point of the memo was the stated United Nations Command mission was to &#34;keep the peace.&#34; The second point was negotiated to get the crew back unharmed and set an example for other countries to follow in such crises. I can recall the entire memo but it was classified: TOP SECRET, NOFORN, LIMDIS, EYES ONLY  on the rest of the items in the memo.  But there was the intense feeling that the purpose of the contact had been fulfilled with decision not to use nuclear weapons in response to the seizure of the USS PUEBLO.  I have only told a very few persons about this for obvious reasons.  But it is as clear to me today was it was then.  At the time my IQ was measured at 155 and I had a photographic memory with respect to reading intellligence reports.  The naming of the position I held as Chief, Intelligence Branch identifies me to those who have access to the information of who filled that position during the PUEBLO crisis.  I am a bit uncomfortable about that but the experience of 1949 is clear in my mind.  I have researched for sightings of such an object as I saw: cigar shaped with double row of windows and light brown metallic color and huge:  as a 4 year old I can only try to guess at the true size of the object.  But I estimate at least 500 yard long (in my mind 5 football fields) or larger.  At one point I found a list of sightings in a book which indicated a large cigar shaped object in summer of 1949 near South Bend, Indiana which is approx 30 miles from the New Troy, Michigan location.  It confirmed my experience.  I would be interested in knowing if there were any other sightings during 1949 of such a large object in the midwest.<n>

Plus, we were all memebers of the military at the time of the incident, which kind of set off a series of events afterwards. We were hanging out behind the barracks in which we lived, on a somewhat famous military base in the area mentioned above. I would first mention that neither of us had consumed any alcohol or anything else that would have impaired our sensabilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of us, I can&#39;t remember who, had spotted a dull looking object behind where we were standing (I&#39;m unsure of the direction from which the craft approached). The craft had to be a quarter mile long and half the size in width! Now the starnge part, the craft was almost like a Star Trek shaped vehicle, only it was tubular in frame configuration, and had two similar sections front and rear. The rear section,again, attatched by tubular material to the front section, clearly sat higher in elevation than the front section. As the craft passed over us, it made no sound whatsoever, not even a wisp of traveling through the air. And the most peculiar thing was that there were no lights on this craft at all. I&#39;ve always wondered about some of those strories I&#39;ve read where these craft have a &#34;Fourth of July&#34; display of lighting. considering these craft are real, which I do believe they are, why would they need to display something greater than say an anti-collision light on a normal aircraft. Rarely have I ever read of a similar experience. The remaing two strange things are, I can hardly remember the names of the people I was stationed with of which I had the experience, and, the craft glided over a &#34;Major&#34; Army base! We couldn&#39;t have been the only one&#39;s to have seen this. I hope that sometime in this lifetime I read something similar. I know we seen it, I know it was a physical thing in the air! And the fact that I also noted right angle type objects, and some kind of lines of some kind along the sides of the craft. Clearly man made(or something else)!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date of incident, and he provides no e-address.

The shape was totally devoid of any color.  It hovered over the parking lot in which I was standing and observing.  It seems to bounce vertically. It did not appear to have any solid form, as an object, but was merely a light in a general teardrop shape, or an upside-down candle flame, pointed at the bottom.  I felt that there was something spiritual and serene about the &#34;thing.&#34; I never reported the event at the time, nor since, but have always wondered about it.  An astrology amateur told me in 1997 that he calculated that the object was likely an early morning sighting of the planet Venus which would have been in the northeast sky on that date. It seems like a possible conclusion, however, my skepticism lies in that it did not resemble at all what I might think of as a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I have watched blimps land or accelerate and it takes a little more time to accomplish than the 30 seconds I was in the house.I listened to the radio and checked the newspapers and never heard anyone else report this event.I am at a loss to know what we observed!My background is:Machinist for the U.S.AIRFORCE for 28 years and 53 years old.My wife is a clerk for the OKLAHOMA ((deleted)) and 2 years younger than me.My granddaighter is 8 years old.I dont use any type of alcohol or drugs, nor anyone else in my family.I can report that we all were very sober for this occurrence.I regret not having the date of this event nor any photos of the craft.Also I wished I could have reported the event sooner.I hope that by telling of this occurrence to someone who knows something of UFO`s that it will help me to purge my mind of the frequent question I ask myself:&#34;What did we see?&#34; and I hope that maybe someone may have seen something similar to this somewhere.If you are able to help,I would be very grateful!<n>

At first I thought it was just two planes.  My brother pointed out that they were flying in perfect alignment and so we waited to see if when it flew over the stars, if it covered the stars, which it did.  I did not go in to get a camera or anything because I was in shock and afraid I would miss something.  Anyway, it flew along then suddenly shot out a flair or something then it was gone. I called the airport tower which told me that their last flight was well earlier.  I called the National Guard Base who told me they had no flights out at that time.  I drove to the airport to look for incoming planes, and I did see some 20-something people out by the hangers, so maybe it was two small planes, but it made no noise, and samll planes usually make a lot of noise, and it did cover the stars. The object seemed to be cigar shaped with a light on each end. All the neighbors were out, but no one was looking up and no one else in Pendleton ever reported a thing.<n>

The nearest cross street is(was) Dickerson Rd.  I was walking southwesterly toward the bus stop across my yard when this object caught my attention, roughly 45 degrees off my left shoulder hovering silently over my neighbor&#39;s field.  It was a black, round, man sized object, featureless except for a single light in the middle of the circle, and two &#34;legs&#34; which were thin, antennae-like hanging down from each side of the circle.  About the time I became cognizant of what I was seeing the light in the middle of the circle went out.  It then backed silently and smoothly backward and upward, across my neighbor&#39;s field and positioned itself behind the pine trees which bordered this field and the back of the subdivision.  The object then vanished.<n>

I didn&#39;t hear a lot of what she said because there was a lot of static.  It reminded me of a situation that happened to me about 2 years ago in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left Lake Arrowhead and I was heading down the mountain.  When I got on Highway 18 I saw this round glowing object nearby on the lefthand side of the road.  At first I thought it was the moon and I remember thinking that it was so pretty and so close.  Then, and I&#39;m embarrassed to say this, I realized that it wasn&#39;t the moon because I was heading west not east.  This object kept pace with me and it was playing games and taunting me at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I speeded up to get a better look it moved away but still kept the same distance between us.  Then I realized I was witnessing something quite interesting and certainly not a normal occurence.  It was rather large too.  The next weekend I went back to Lake Arrowhead.  I went into the Stater Brothers market to talk to Sharon who worked in the bakery department because I wanted to tell her about my experience with the object.  She got this knowing smile and said, &#34;Oh you saw it&#34;.  I said &#34;yes&#34; and asked her what it is.  She said these glowing objects/balls come up along the road.  (I must say if you have never driven Highway 18 it is very winding and there is the mountain on one side and the valley below.  It is a very spectacular sight from this road).  So they come up along the valley side of the road.  She said that these objects appear to selected people, they are friendly, and they are communicating with us telepathically, teaching us and warning us. She said they appear quite regularly to selected people.  Anyway, I thought this might help you to piece together a pattern because I know there have been quite a few sightings near Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs and Crestline.<n>

The object was an aluminous green in colour with a slight haze around the edge, no tail and orb shaped. From my perspective it was about the size of a grape.  It just disapeared over the horizon.

BUT WHAT I DIDI SEE HAS STAYED WITH ME TO THIS DAY. I WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF MY FRIENDS FATHERS CAR. WE WERE ON OUR WAY FISHING WE TURNED DOWN A ROAD I&#39;M NOT CERTAIN WHERE, I THINK IT WAS NEAR THE AIRPORT OR SOME TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION REQUIRING LARGE DUMP TRUCKS, THE LONG TYPE THAT CARRY LARGE LOADS OF GRAVEL AND DIRT. THERE WAS A MIST OR FOG NEAR THE AREA THAT THE TRUCKS WERE GOING IN AND OUT. WHAT WAS UNUSEUAL ABOUT TIHS MIST WAS THER WAS A LIGHT PROJECTING DOWN ON THE AREA, I THOUGHT IT WAS ON A LIGHT POLE. AS WE CAME TO THE END OF THE ROAD THERE WERE RESTRICTED SIGNS AND WE REALIZED IT WAS A DEAD END. AS WE TURNED A HUGH TRUCK PASSED US I LOOKED BACK BECAUSE IT SUPRISED ME THAT THIS AREA WAS SO BUSY THIS EARY IN THE MORNING. THE LIGHT AS WE TURNED DREW UPWARDS INTO THE MIST AND THERE WAS A SPARKLE LIKE THE EMBERS FROM A LOG IN A CAMPFIRE AS IT IS BEING MOVED OR TURNED. AT THIS POINT I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW AND WHAT SUPRISED ME WAS THE SPARKLE SORT OF IMPLODED INTO THE MIST RIGHT BEHIND THE LIGHT AND THE FOG OR MIST SURROUNDING IT MOVED TOWARDS THE GRAVEL PIT OR CONSTRUCTION AREA. I&#39;VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT I WAS OVERCOME. I SORT OF SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING TO MY FRIENDS FATHER, BUT NOT MUCH. AT THAT POINT I WAS WISHING FOR A PHONE TO CALL THE AIR FORCE AND JUST LEAVE A MESSAGE AND NOT TELL THEM WHO I WAS. I JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT THE FACT THERE WAS NO POLE FOR THIS LIGHT AND THE ONLY REASON IT DISSAPEARED SO FAST WAS IT SPOTTED US COMING AROUND THE EXITING GRAVEL DUMP TRUCK. THE FACT REMAINS SOMETHING WAS GOING ON HERE AND I&#39;VE WONDERED IF SOME SECRET FACILITY WAS BEING BUILT HERE OR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE REASON FOR THE OBSERVATION. I&#39;M NOT POSITIVE OF THE DATE AND EXACT TIME BUT IT WAS JULY OR AUGUST AND IT WAS DARK JUST 30 TO 45 MIN BEFORE SUNRISE.<n>

Objects also had a blinking light as if signalling each other, blinked only when another crafty had blinked. Lights were very low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was about 05.00 am, on my way to work I have to travel from a small village 3 miles into a nearby town. I live near our local T.V. mast and it one day became suddenly common for fighter planes to be out at around this time. Now these fighters ( Our nearest RAF base is RAF St Mawgan, not far away) had sound travelling behind them, yet were not moving fast which I thought strange ( I know little about planes, but I always assumed travelling faster than sound means high speed and lots of noise!), but I enjoyed watching them so I began to specifically try to spot them every morning to kill the boredom of the walk. On several occasions I spotted lights that would suddenly appear out of nowhere and then speed across the sky and disappear in an instant. I guessed that maybe RAF St Mawgan had sent some planes out to patrol the area as maybe they were aware of such objects on their radars. But on two occassions I spotted these lights just hovering, totally silently, not far away and low in the sky. The first incident occured on Caradon Hill by the TV mast - a light moving and hovering not far from the tip of the aerial at about 05.00. I thought it a star at first but when I realised it was to low I watched it and the light moved about! I could not stay to watch too long because i would have been late to work. The second incident was under the same circumstances - on my way to work at 05.00 - it happened at 05.30, except this time they were near the main road that leads into the town of Liskeard. There were three silent lights this time, low in the sky, hardly moving and just signalling to each other. I would have watched further but somebody pulled over to give me a ride - I did not wish to mention the matter to them - so I left it. I have never seen any craft - just lights that either move or hover a little erratically low in the sky. The sky was clear - no cloud, stars clearly visible. I no longer live out that way, but I may one day  camp out on the hill one evening just in case I get to see any more - it was quite incredible as I am unaware of any craft we have that is able to silently hover and move so erratically.<n>

It is hard to describe because it was inside a cloud.  It had an outer ring of triangular lights that were bluish white.  They fashed one at a time around in a circle, sometimes faster sometimes slower.  It had an inner ring of lights that moved as if it were opening and closing sort of like jellyfish do when propelling themselves forward.  It did not move it just hovered there for hours, Gradually getting higher in they sky as the sun rose. I stood under it and so did my kids and neighbor.  It didn&#39;t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seen it but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something.  Many witnessed it moving from Ogden area to the Layton area, to my area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to know if anyone else saw this and could explain what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify date.

Eventhough there was a rain and electrical storm outside I could hear this noise, like a clicking sound with some occasional high-pitched  gurgling.  Concerned that my son might be having some breathing problems I sat up in bed and directed my attention to the hallway where his door was.  It startled me that his door was closed, as we had never closed his door in the past.  Again I heard the noise and even though I tried for a brief moment to wake my wife I could not rouse her.  Again and again I heard the noise and was quite terrified that someone possibly was in my son&#39;s room.  I quickly gathered my courage and went to my closet for my S&amp;W 45 caliber semi-automatic pistol.  I chambered a round and moved to my son&#39;s door putting my ear against the door.  Again I heard the sounds and burst into the room.  What I saw next will never leave me... something I think about several times every day since then.  The way my son&#39;s room was laid out was my son&#39;s little bed was to the left of the open door and a window was directly ahead.  Eventhough the light was off, a moment after I burst in I looked directly into my son&#39;s bed as lightening illuminated the room. I could see my son setting up in bed facing a small alien creature as if they were playing or something.  Simultaneously I realized the window was open, the screen was off and there was a larger alien creature somehow hovering just outside the window.  The rain was pouring into the open window and I have learned since then that the best way I could describe the creature is that it was a &#34;Grey&#34;.  I was petrified and could not move.  I could tell by it&#39;s movements that I startled the alien outside the window as much as it startled me.  The next thing I know, I am laying on the floor looking up at the lightening painting the ceiling and realized that my entire backside is soaking wet, the window open, it was not raining and my son was sound asleep in his little bed. ! Later I found my 45 laying in the center of the dinning room table with the magazine removed and one bullet (the chambered round) missing.  I have not been able to reconcile this event to this date.  The window was certainly open, the screen on the ground two floors below (we lived on the second floor) and the carpet was soaked.  In addition, the missing bullet was never found.  I don&#39;t know how long I was out or why I was out but it could not have been more that a couple hours.  I know this was a Grey who, for some reason, was letting it&#39;s child play with mine.  I will never be the same.  Before this I thought folks who saw UFOs were quacks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates no date for the event, and elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was about 3 am in the morning and I was heading north bound when I observed approximately a dozen seperate lights on the initial horizon.  There were about six of these &#34;lights&#34; in &#34;opposition&#34; to each other approaching the others at a very rapid pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was that these &#34;lights&#34; could be searchlights operating from two seperate directions but in synchronization to each other. It suddenly occured to me that no power on earth could synchronize these lights at the speed and directional changes they were operating at.  At this point I was so taken aback I actually ran my cruiser off the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the next exit (my home) and parked the cruiser in my yard - we lived on a 90 acre stretch so it was isolated.  About five minutes later I looked up at the sky and saw an enormous, oval shaped object flying approximately 300-400 feet in the air in a westward direction - due to the darkness, the altitude was an approximation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object approached my direction.  I stood in the roadway attempting to interpret what I was observing - the craft made no loud noise but rather as it passed overhead I could only describe it as a &#34;whoosing sound&#34; - very quiet.  At certain intervals  there seemed to be a circular, revolving series of low impact lights surrounding the craft which was moving rather slowly to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my home to wake my wife but she was too frightened to step outside.  Rather than reporting the incident I tried to call Otis Air Force Base but the lines were jammed, as were those of a local police department - as discretion is often the better part of valor I put the incident in my own &#34;I don&#39;t know file&#34; and just let it be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is unknown to us, at this writing.

Half way down the wings there were twomore white lights as well as white lights at the end of the wing tips.  The object made a weird oscilating sound and moved very slow. This is what drew our attention to it. I estamate it was between 4 to 500 feet above the ground. Looking  straight up and out the upstairs window We could just see the end of the wing tip. The fuslage was about 500 ft. or more from that wing tip, and out over the tops of the trees in the back field. The trees are about 300 ft. from the back of the house. The other end or wing tip was almost out of sight. It had to be 1000 to 1200 ft. in length from wing tip to wing tip. It moved extremily slow and went in a striaght line. It finally dissappeared from sight behind the tree line at the far end of the upper part of the field. The sound was still audible for awhile until it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested further information from the witness regarding a more accurate date of the incident.  PD))<n>

North Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell asleep on the couch downstairs. Woke up at around three to realize that I should go upstairs to bed. I walked to the bathroom with no light (because i know my house and where to walk.) There&#39;s a window on my left overlooking the the cow pasture with a small creek and tree&#39;s following it. I look above the tree line and there&#39;s a object hovering along the tree line about fifty yards away. At first I thought it was a helicopter. I opened the window and listened. No sound. After a few moments of trying to figure it out, I got this really scared feeling of &#34;oh shit, I think I know what that is.&#34;. I then pissed all over the whole bathroom and ran upstairs to wake my parents. But what the hell are they supposed think, A 15 year old kid runs upstairs screaming there&#39;s something outside. So they tell me to get in bed but weren&#39;t really awake enough to comprihend what i was saying. I got in the bed thinking at least they wont take up alone. 5 to ten minutes later, two ground rattling sounds came flying over the house. I thought this was it. I later put two and two together and figured that it had to be fighter jets coming to investigate. It had to be because no airport near my house was capable of harboring a plane of that magnitude. I laid in that bed till Moring awake, scared ((deleted)). Three years later my father finally saw it too…<n>

What the hell is that thing? Flight, you guys see it?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this sudden commotion on the intercom got me and the other Acoustic operator to look up from our stations. Looking up the &#34;tube&#34; (which we affectionately called the aircraft interior) we saw the flight station was flooded with a brilliant light shining through every window from above. I got up from our station and made my way up the Tube towards the cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both pilots and the flight engineer (FE) were leaning forward trying to look up. Everybody was kind of panicky and yelling back and forth in the flight station when the brilliant light stopped, and the pilot said &#34;look at that! look at that!!&#34;. The object had moved from above us to about a hundred yards off of our port wing. That was the first I actually got to get a look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 50 feet long, cylindrical, and green light all over. The surface was smooth or at least I couldn&#39;t make out any markings or features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second FE came up to the flight station with this high tech camera that we used for intel gathering. He told me to move, so he could get some good shots of it. I made my way aft to the port overwing exit so i could see the object. It just stayed off our wing for maybe 2 or 3 minutes then shot off and up faster than anything I have ever seen. It went from about 100 yards to out of sight in just a couple seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our Navigator/Communications officer (NAVCOM or NAV) had been on the radio with Red Crown (An AEGIS Cruiser acting as the air traffic control for the exercise area) who asked that we loiter on station and see if we could re-establish contact. We remained on station for another half hour and were told to RTB (return to base).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we landed, two white government vans took all of us to the briefing/debriefing center. We were interviewed one at a time. Our interviews taped. Our film confiscated... (two of the guys had their own personal cameras and had snapped some photos too). Our mission tapes confiscated. We were told to not discuss this flight and made to sign an agreement to that effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well we thought this was all too cool, so we get back to the barracks and my buddy who had been the radar operator on the flight, and myself started spilling our guts. &#34;We saw a freakin UFO!!!&#34; The following day, our crew was called into the CO&#39;s office, he informed us that he was hearing &#34;stories&#34; and reiterated the fact that we were &#34;NOT to discuss it.&#34; So with the exception of a few hushed story swappings here and there... we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report for his having shared the information with NUFORC!

It looked to be 1/3rd the size of the moon or larger (also thought it was pretty high up, which stayed stationary for at least 10 minutes until our attention went back to focusing on other things. The second we saw was a light blue ball light that did a &#34; /\/ &#34; (zig-zag) pattern and dissappeared, this was seen est. 300 yards and 100 ft. off the ground. The third looked almost like a sattelite orbiting earth, but was not moving in a straight line but changing directions repeatedly, which we didn&#39;t look at more than 4 minutes. UFOs were not all that were seen that night, but more then you (in my opinion) would understand or know (including me). PS. I have seen another UFO with a similar (yellow-orange) &#34; /\/ &#34; pattern while sitting on a porch swing at my house. It too dissapeared as if a light switch were switched off.<n>

We wandered about for a couple of hours then shut down for the night about 2 am. After we had watched the stars for a half hour we noticed we were near(4 miles +-) an active airbase. Suddenly a group of very fast lights dropped over the base and began to zip around the airbase. Suddenly a large yellow globe descended and hovered over the airbase. A small globe came out of the large globe (it kept hovering) and descended to what appeared to be the main base. The other lights kept zipping about the airbase and the large globe kept hovering. After about 30 mins the small globe ascended up to the large glove and disappeared inside. They shot off into the firmament. Followed by the other skipping lights. It all appeared routine and after they left things continued on as before. We do not know where we were, somewhere in northern Nevada and in the morning we found our way back to the hyway and proceeded to Vegas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us use drugs nor were any of us drinking, we were just lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We never told anyone then because they would have said we were all crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the incident.

Then I finally saw it, it was streaking across the sky so fast that I knew ammediately that it couldn&#39;t be a jet. The weird thing was is that it had absolutely no contrails at all. But, even though this ordeal lasted around 5 minutes I didn&#39;t think about telling anybody else because I was so fascinated with it at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, a student, does not indicate a date for the incident.

White Ball of light huge floating in diagonal toward me and coming lower near hill in fron of my house . It stopped in mid air , and was close . I FELT it had seen me . I was frightened , ran to get parents , screaming ( they did not respond and garbled nonsense ) I was shouting to them GET UP THERES A SPACESHIP OUTSIDE &#34; They did not hear or get up at all. I ran back and FELT the spaceship was  speaking to  me inside my my head and told me not to be frightened .I was every frightened . Riveted to the floor with my mouth gaping open and just staring . Trying not to believe my own eyes , blinking them shut , opening them again  to check I was not mad . I still screamed out for my parents and they did not come . Then the fear I gave up , and words of YOUR SPECIAL _ DONT BE FRIGHTEND boomed in my mind . It came from the spaceship and I felt energy and calmness all of a sudden .  I asked them to tell me they knew I was talking back and to move the craft when I said so . It did . It did a triangle for me , and then again . It wa so bright and I felt strange . I found myself later in my kitchen at Dawn , sun coming up. I waited by the radio for BIG WORLD NEWS that never came , became withdrawn  and concerned  for myself all by myself for a few weeks that no one else was coming forward . My parents  asked me what the hell I was screaming at them for to get up and confirmed they remembered  something I said about a UFO . My parents under any other circumstances would have whooped by butt and got right up out of bed  for yelling as hard as I was , so I beleieve they were knocked out by something. Greymouth where I saw this , is 13 miles direct south east  of Kaikoura , where I learned 15 years later  while watching a TV show of the white flying objects seen by AIr New Zealand near there.  Famous video footage I believe . I knew  the  that I  had seen the same craft and much closer than they did , in the same dates, but I also had them talking to me for ! years to shut up so I did that , and still feel strange doing so  . They took me away it seems becuase I lost all these morning hours . . I saw more people inside ( approx 20 ) all lined up behind and infront of me , we had to take showers that didnt use water . They said they were us from the future ,historians  trying to learn from the past. It changed my life forever , and I still cry if no one I ever tell this story to is willing to accept my truth or believes me. It is so fraustrating . I am 37 now.  Aliens to me are not scary , and shouldnt be to anyone else .  Teachers , timetravellers or messengers , the ones who talked to me when I was sixteen feel sad  that we are such cavemen especially in our attitudes of all things on Earth ( for example they said - when we mine the gold , quartz , coal , oil , crystals etc  removing and displacing resources  from their natural habitat to all parts of the globe , we are  denaturalising the  skin of the planet . We have wrecked the weather and  many  important magnetic fields doing this ). Aliens as we so call them , also observe us as animals as we are so unclean , full of disease and boast rather  digusting habits , sport loose dangerous ideas, politics and morals . They believe we disrespect too many other creatures that we live with to prove their point, and that we are not every smart, even the greatest of scientists on earth .  They believe we are too primitive and immature as an evolutionary race right now to communicate  with and that we could not handle the truth  about ourselves at this time . They feel happy to share with humans and will gladly teach them things if they are willing to be taught .  They also believe we  can all understand the bible and the analogy of Jesus life as nothing more than the best description of &#34;Love &#34; and alot of &#34; how to live and think on the planet Earth &#34; ever written by  human beings  probably touched by the same truth ,and the same light. It may be considered wild  by some that Id say all this , but its got to be said ust to get it off my cheast after all these years . Id know there are others out there who have had the same meetings as I have . I have read some of their books and learned that others have heard the voice of an alien as well . Just not all of them actually got to see the source of its projection first . f anyone has , Id be happy to know your there .<n>

Carson training area during the month of August during a Oklahoma NG summer rotation at about 0100 in the morning.Even though it was early in the morning I was alert for I was the only one on gaurd at the time in my platoon.As I was roving my area I noticed a light in the Eastern portion of the sky. It was I judge to be at least 10 miles away and to have about 1500-2000 ft. of altitude.The light was similar to that of an aircraft light and I watched it just to pass a little time.I probably would have lost interest but the light started to fly with erratic movement.It traveled to the south and as it did it would move ubruptly vertically down and then back up.At the distance I would say that these vertical movements were anywhere from 500-1000 ft.The light continued to do this for maybe 1 min. and then continued moving south until out of sight.There was no sound and the sky was clear and no other aircraft were in the sky at the time. I thought of awakening the other members of my platoon but, it was my first field excercise with them and I didnt think that they would believe me or appreciate being woken from their sleep.I am presently in the Reg Army and I have been since 1990. I have seen military aircraft and civilian and I have never seen anything out of the ordinary since then. When it starded moving funny I moved so that there was a small tree brach between field of vision and the light,at first I thought that it was me moving up and down and not the light but, using the limb as a referance I decided otherwise.I didnt have the hair stand up on my back or anything like that but it just seemed very odd.I would be happy to answer any questions pertaining to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had turned off the light and were talking in total darkness.all of the sudden,her face and the rest of my bedroom was totally lit up and we could see each other perfectly.we both jumped up with fright and looked straight out the window,where we saw  something that seemed to be a ball of slightly blue light hovering just outside my window. in distance it would have been near the middle of my garden and in height,just above the roof of the house.we froze as we looked at it and after about a good five to six seconds,it shot off extremely fast.we then were left in a darkend room again. Neither of us have any idea of what it could have been and we regularly wonder about it.My dad suggested it could have been a fireball,but it was totaly soundless. it&#39;s not like there&#39;s many people you can tell this kind of thing to,so i dont really bother(even though i want to tell everyone)but i would love to hear from somebody who could tell me what it could have been. the curiosity hasn&#39;t faded in the last few years and i don&#39;t think it ever will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No date provided by witness.

So I figured if I could be underneath it, it would probably look like a saucer (circular) shaped craft.  I also estimate it was really long, because the Uptown are of my Hometown is probably a couple miles from where we lived back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked up the steps to the new deck to get a better view.  It was just moving across the sky horizontally (over or behind the Uptown hills of my hometown, maybe one hundred feet off the gorun ((sic--ground??)) or more).  Then it stopped, then ascended, until it looked liked it left our atmosphere.  I can&#39;t remember now whether it was moving away or going towards Concord Naval Weapons Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still feel bad because to this day I wish I could have waken my Mother and Step-Father, because I could have knocked on their sliding-glass door.  But I was so in awe of this craft, all I could do was stare at this object moving across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now think that either it was extra-terrestrial or a Government U.F.O. since Popular Mechanics did an article that said our Government has mini-reactors in these U.F.O.&#39;s and that traces of spent nuclear material has been found where these craft land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate the date of the incident.

My nephew was the navigator and flight weapons control officer.  There was a special secret weapon being tested over the gulf of mexico.  It is a light 80 times brighter than the headlights on a 747.  It was used in the first gulf war.  They flew over the enemy, which were seen on their infrared cameras very late at night.  Then they would put on the light and announce that they would fire, that the enemy was surrounded, to come out and surrender.  Thousands did with no weapons needing to be fired.  As you fly in a circle with all lights on the aircraft out ,just this one light on it appears to be a very bright light that goes from left to right, disappears and then appears again where it started to the left.

The first event I remember occurred in either the summer of 1975 or 1976.  My husband (at the time)and I shared a common interest in things like weather-watching, storm-chasing and skywatching in general.  We had driven to a remote area Southwest of Odessa, Texas to a place on the Caprock that was an excellent skywatching spot.  There are many radio, and television transmitters strung for miles along this caprock.  We had driven to a spot where the line of towers was behind us by probably 5 miles at most.  We were in his small convertible sports car.....an old, tiny mid-engine Porsche.........and we were sitting on the tops of our seats where they met with the frame of the car.  There was no back seat to this car, and it was like a T-top.  I don&#39;t remember how long we had been watching the sky, when one of us spotted what at first looked like it might be a satellite...........reminded me of a moving star.  No blinking or twinkling to speak of, no changes in intensity.  We first noticed it in the northwest, and it was moving slowly but steadily. across the sky towards the Southwest.  We became convinced it was a satellite within about 30 seconds, and at this point, it was in the center of our field of vision (almost due West).  If you think in terms of inches, it was about 12 inches above the horizon at that point we came aware of another identical light moving from the Southeast along the same horizontal plane.  We both then began to scan the entire sky almost instinctively, and immediately became aware that there were numerous lights coming from several directions, including directly overhead .  I remember at this point I was extremely excited and we were both shouting expletives and I was saying over and over, Whaat is going on, now.............come on, what the hell is happening and him saying Wait, wait, look over here and oh crap there&#39;s another one.  They finally had us convinced that they were going to collide and I remember how intense the feeling was that we were about to witness an explosion of! some ki nd...........but instead, as they got closer to each other, they slowed a bit, all at the same rate, and all stopped instantly, where then you saw what was either six or eight spots of light in a circle, equidistant from each other.  Then they began to flash independently but in an organized sequence that then gave an impression of an octagon or six-pointed star.  It was like if you drew dots on a piece of paper and then connected the dots so that the shape was revealed.  However,  It seemed that the area within the dots was not obscured.  You could see the night sky within the area formed by the dots.  After about maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I have never been sure about how much time went by) they stopped flashing, one at a time, as if each had to complete a sequence, then they were gone for a couple of seconds, then all lit up at once, and began to increase in brightness, and then began to glow red, and then streaked off in all 6 or eight directions, leaving trails that reminded me of meteors on fast-forward  but disappeared before traveling halfway across the sky.  As we sat there with our mouths hanging open, I was crying in wonder more that fear.  About 10 seconds maybe, after they disappeared, we heard what sounded like a sonic boom and a flash that lit up the whole sky for a split second, brightest at the horizon.  Only in retrospect can a say that the flash reminds me of what I have seen in films of nuclear bombs.......the first flash.  I can remember us jumping off the car and each lighting cigarettes and just standing there smoking and looking at the sky and not speaking, me crying.  Then we put the top back on the car and headed home.  I remember the drive from our location to the highway, but I don&#39;t remember anything else about getting home.  My next memory was going to work the next day and telling my boss and co-workers about it, and being ridiculed about it for weeks afterward. My ex-husband and I stayed friends and had other skywatching adventures, but only eclipses and meteor showers. I cannot remember us talking about it to each other in anything but a round-about way, except for a couple of times, between the event and when I moved to Tulsa in 1980.  I had very little contact with him from then until 1985, when I had been back in West Texas about a year.  I attempted to ask him about the subject, and he said he didn&#39;t remember the details very well.  I sensed an even greater reluctance to discuss it when we talked again about 3 years ago.<n>

Location is assumed.  We usually do not include reports of dreams, but we have decided to include this one, since it seems to us that the recollection of the dream is clear, and the witness seems very serious.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dream spaceship long years ago, same direction as the comet from some month ago!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking an UFO Report on tv today and I remembered me of a dream that was somewhat realistic that I sould tell you. Sorry for my bad english language, but the dream might be interesting to some of you. Some years ago, I had a somewhat realistic dream. I do not tell you my name or other things, because i just want to report. I looked out of my window in the night. The night was clear, I could see the stars. It was silence. I could see a group of space-ships flying to the earth, they were slow, not fast. And there was no light or something, they all where brown/grey. It was a gigantic formation with houndrets of ships  coming directly out of the sky to the earth. It was looking as they would directly fly to my window, it was gigantic. I could hear nothing, it was completely silent everywhere. No engines, nothing. And they were moving very slow. The formation was as long as i could see, approx one or two ships in a group, then the next formation. Like a small street, but very long, as long as you could see. I remember that the front side of the ships where with red lights and yellow within the light. But only the front site, i could not see a ship from behind. I could not move myself or do anything, i was looking and i can´t move myself. It was unbelievable. Then, i am not sure, because it was long time ago when I had this dream, I think that they startet to shoot, but then i waked up. I am not sure if they really where shooting, i can not remember this. But i can remember the formation in the dream as if i dreamed this dream yesterday, but it must be 10 years ago. A dream is a dream, but this was unbeleavable realistic. I felt the same feeling as wheere a comet some years ago flew in the near of the earth where you could see something if the comet in the sky. exatcly on the same position of my house i had the dream of the direction of the space ships. Again sorry for my bad english.. however.. in the dream the location of the space shipts was the same as i could see the comet flying in the near of the earth some time ago, i forgot the name of the comet but we all could see it. It was the same location! So i think that the ships will come from this direction, too if the dream will come true. This dream *is* true. There was no strange light except the red light, and it was somewhat silent... and gigantic, as if your days are counted. I am living in germany near cologne. Thats all. Someone unknown<n>

I was camping with my indian guide group at a YMCA camp near Oscoda Michigan.  I think the camp was called camp oeasa (I am not sure how it is spelled).  There were about 15 kids and about half as many adults.  most of the adults had gone to sleep, but there were at least one or two on night watch, to keep us kids out of trouble.  We were all in sleeping bags around a camp fire, lying on our backs when I remember seeing a string for flashing lights hovering in the sky, then just shoot up into the stars after about a minute of so.  I do not remember if I saw it and started talking about it, or if someone else noticed it and I looked up.  I remember joking about it with the ohter kids.  It was very strange!  It looked just like a funny string of very funny looking Christmas tree lights flashing.  It was so long ago that I can not even guess how far away, how big, etc...  What ever it was, it did not make any sound that I can recall.  There is a near by Air base and I remember wondering if it was something from there, but I do not know of anything that could have come from Oscoda that might look and behave like that.  But then again who knows?  It is worth reporting anyhow.<n>

I looked out my window at the trees lining my street to see them completly calm.  So i thought it might be a jet aircraft and went outside to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon exiting my home, i realized that the sound wasnt moving.  I started scanning the sky, looking for the sound. It is a clear night out. U can see the whole of the night sky.  Stars from horizon to horizon.  There was no visible jet, or any aircraft that i could see.  I began searching for FAA running light, hoping to use them to locate the source of the sound.  There where no lights anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then began trying to use the complete star banket as a means of location.  When an aircraft moves through the night sky, it has to pass under the stars, thereby blocking some out as it moves.  There where no disturbances in the area that the sound was coming from.  As i was about to just go back inside, thinking it was just a high wind off up in the area above the tree line, the sound began to move at a slow but accelerating rate due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again began to use the star light to try and locate the source as it moved.   It was then i saw a weird distortion.  Not a true blocking of starlight.  But more of a moving of the starlight, like it was being forced around something.  As i tried to follow the distortion visually, it accelerated at a phenomenal rate north and both the sound, and distortion disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to apologize about the condition of this report.

|Winchester|MA|Triangle|The past few years|Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar , Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston)|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16570.html|239|ndxe| ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source.  No dates provided.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar, Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen several objects which I believe may be UFO&#39;s.  I live on the flight path into Logan Airport in Boston and observe normal aircraft all the time on approach and take-off.   I also live near Hanscom Air Force Base and have observed military planes landing and taking off.  In the past few years I have been stargazing, when all of the sudden, some very bright objects high up in the sky will appear and seem to hover over the Boston area in the sky for a couple of hours.  I observed one of these objects very closely once for a few hours before it seemed to move away.  I used binoculars for a better look. The objects were very bright and very slow moving, but I could tell that they were moving slowly back and forth all over the sky.  It took several minutes for the object to cross the sky.  Then it would change corse and move a different direction for a while.  I looked through the binoculars and also when I squinted my eyes I could make out a triangular shape to the  bright object, and I thought with the binoculars I could make out some flashing lights on the ends of the points of the triangle and even a brightly lit cockpit area. (the object was small and very bright as if it was high up above the earth) Well above the aircraft routes.  It seemed to be observing us.  I have since taken more notice to the skies than in the past and have noticed several times some diamond and triangular objects and even a cube and cigar shape once.  They are all very high up but below the stars and above the planes.  They all move very slowly - and I do not know how to explain it.  But the object is too far away to be a plane and doesn&#39;t move fast enough, and too big from the viewpoint to be a star.  The fact that it moves slowly across the horizon and shifts position occasionally rules out that it is a star or planet. I do not know how to explain it except its a UFO.  All of these sightings in the past few years have been in winchester from my house.  But I did also see a cigar shape object with flashing multicolored lights pass overhead in Cooperstown New York.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  And this one actually changed speed.  It moved slowy at first picked up speed, shifted positions, then finally sped off.  But it was moving much faster than a plane or military jet and was too high to be a plane.  And too bright and large to be a star/planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date.  PD))<n>

All these were remarkably DIFFERENT in nature and all were observed in the company of witnesses.  I first thought about reporting them to someone when I came across the Lemon Grove(CA) (sighting/landing?) description from the 70&#39;s on the Internet.  Apparently, a youth was the witness to that actual incident but I had overheard a conversation about it taking place in a coffee shop between members of the Lemon Grove Sheriff&#39;s Department within a month or so and it had peaked my curiosity since the landing had apparently been sighted in the BACK YARD of the house I had occupied for a number of years and had only RECENTLY left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lenghty experience with lights, one to three in number had taken place during the same period lasting for over a week.  I never followed up looking into the (landing) report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness submit a separate report for each of his sightings.  PD))<n>

Relatives of my friend were outside and told us to come out a look outside.  When I looked up I saw a brilliant flourescent orange light moving toward us at a very slow speed.  It was about 5 miles away and moving toward our direction at about 2 thousand feet above.  As slowly moved toward where we were (within about a 1/4 mile.  I noticed it didn&#39;t have any sound to it even though it exibited amazing characteristics.  It started to glow violently brighter and brighter.  It driped something on fire (molten metal?) that burnt out before it reached the ground.  It slowly started to climb in altitude. Then all the sudden it shot straigt up at faster than light speed.  A few years later in Arizona I saw what appeared to be the same object being escorted by 2 military helicopters with their lights out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No date indicated by this witness.
