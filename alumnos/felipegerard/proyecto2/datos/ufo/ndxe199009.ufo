I&#39;m also not sure if it was in 1990 or 1991.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very early evening, still light, and as I stopped at a stop sign on a fairly busy suburban throroughfare, I noticed what I thought was stadium lights on some spare ground that was being made into a park, about 100 feet to my right. Instead of stadium lights, there was a large metal, flattened ovoid-disc, machine(?) hovering just above the trees. No noise. I&#39;m not good at judging size but I&#39;d guess it was around 40-60 feet in diameter. It had a ring of very bright lights circling its lower rim. As I continued very slowly along beside it, it moved, also slowly and very smoothly, in the same direction. It moved with facility and seemed not to be labouring under its own weight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for about a quarter mile. It was slowly gaining altitude but continued on the same path. The road I was on began to veer away from our mutual direction but I watched it until it disappeared from view, as a plane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I find stunning about this is that there were many cars on the road. The other travellers must have seen it - it was unmissable - but none of us did what one would expect folk to do under such circumstances, jump out of our cars and point and gawk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never heard anything about it in local media. I can say with conviction that it was not a helicopter, an aircraft or a blimp. Dunno!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/22/90 19:00|Champaign|IL|Egg|2 min|Black silhouette in twilight sky, almond shaped UFO moving N to S at constant speed and low altitude|5/28/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44148.html|2|ndxe199009| Black silhouette in twilight sky, almond shaped UFO moving N to S at constant speed and low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking out of K-mart I looked up at flock of birds in the twilight sky.  Above/beyond the birds I noticed an object slowly moving northward.  It immediately gave me chills because it didn&#39;t look like any flying vehicle I&#39;d ever seen (and since I grew up in Wichita KS I&#39;ve seem them all).<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a moment I thought it might be a stealth fighter, since the nation was gearing up for the first Iraq war at the time, but the object had no wings or rotors or wheels, just a smooth oval (almond or maybe flattened egg) shape, slightly narrower in front, with a small oval bump on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t determine surface details since the sun was down and I could only see a black silhouette against the sky.  It made no noise, there were no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it was about 45 degrees up, to the west.  I estimate it was 20-30 feet wide, flying at approximately 1500&#39; altitude moving north around 100mph (similar to a small private plane in size and speed).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought &#39;hey, I see YOU&#39; and looked around at other people in the parking lot, no one else was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for a couple minutes until it disappeard over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting home I phoned the local airport and asked if they had any strange radar images or if anyone else had reported a UFO. They acted like I was crazy so I didn&#39;t bother to notify the police.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the posibility that it might have been some type of balloon but it was moving much faster than the wind that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer info: Faculty member at the University of Illinois<n>

As we entered into level cross nc, just turning on providence church rd. out of the lft. side of my eye a small orange ball shape object with neon type glow was zig zagging through the tree lines down in a revene.My sister was asleep in the seat between myself and mother. She awoke imeadiatley asking me if a saw a strange object and about that time the orange ball appeared 20 feet in front of the truck hovering. The object had increased in size from large pumpkin to about the size of volkswagon.From this point it was about ten miles to red cross and I contiued to drive as the object followed 30 ft above truck.The object began moving at irratic directions at speeds of light. As i was driving two white lights like head lights approached rapidly from the rear and as soon as the lights got to the back of the truck they shot streight up and disappeared. In the mean time the orange ball had grown to the size of hot air balloon.This object seem to be almost pure energy form with a personality. We had come to the end of the road which dead into state hwy 22 when the orange appeared over a large fieled. This object had grown to the size air craft carrier.The object started moving east and west at the speed of light. It hovered over the field again and about that time a another car appeared and a man got out and looked at me and looked at the ovious UFO and said ((obscenity deleted)) and jumped in his car and sped off. I was begining to get nervous myself with my mother and and sister screaming for me to get in the truck. I was driving Ford wrecker unit at the time and I decided to turn all the rotator lights on the truck. This seemed to startle the object and it made a slow upward climb making a humming noise like high tension power lines and then start poping and fiseling sound like hand held sparkiler and faded out and disappeared about 3-4 thousand above ground,WHOW! This trip should had taken about an hour but in reality it took about three hrs.To this day we dont know what happened to those two hrs of lost time.Never a day goes by I don&#39;t think of this sighting.<n>

I was in awe,my brother &amp; I watched as its sound disappered&amp; its light from the engine dimmed to almost nothing after it had moved passed us,it kept moving slowly &amp; we kept trying to see it.it went on a north east course toward canada.we will never forget it.I have more details .<n>

May have been livestock involvment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in the country about 2 mi. north of Alcoa. We were outside talking and noticed to the east of where we were this lighted object just hovering in one spot. The lights appeared to be flashing of some sort. All of a sudden as fast as you can move your hand above your head and as far down as possible this thing moved this fast and flew right back up just as fast. Up,down,up,down several times. When the thing flew up you could hear the cows in the distant 1 mile away mooing. After watching for about 1 hr. it started heading west toward us. I could no longer see any lights though as it moved directly over our heads we could see it was huge about the size of a football field only triangular in shape it was not that high in the air maybe 800 ft. there was no noise coming from this thing at all total silence I could even hear the crickets as it moved over top of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

9/15/90 22:30|Cloquet/Duluth|MN|Triangle|2 minutes|Large triangle object moving slowly West from Duluth, MN|2/24/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55149.html|7|ndxe199009| Large triangle object moving slowly West from Duluth, MN<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in September of 1990 at about 10:30 PM I was driving towards Virginia, MN from Cloquet, MN. As I came up onto an overpass on Hwy 33 to the North of Cloquet and to the NW of Duluth, MN and saw about six vehicles parked on the side of the road with their hazard flashers on. Several people were out of their cars and were looking to the East. I stopped and got out to see what was going on. Looking to the East, I saw something very large flying just as it went overhead. It was silent and looked like a black triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed overhead, I realized it must have been at least 200 feet wide and had some bright white lights on the tips that faced forward. It moved overhead and blocked out a considerable amount of the evening sky. It moved silently at about 30 MPH and was out of sight within a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details about the evening: Approximately 10:30 PM (22:30), Sometime in September, 1990 (unsure of exact date as it was 16+ years ago), clear skies, new to ¼ moon (relatively dark), temperature in 50-60F range, no noticeable surface winds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details about the location: Hwy 33, North of Cloquet, MN on Northbound bridge that goes over Saginaw Road (County Roads 694+46). This location is about 4 miles West of the Duluth International Airport and there is an airbase at that location, although not very active, just border patrols and Air National Guard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Details about object: Speed of approximately 30 MPH, altitude was less than 500 feet AGL, direction of travel was from East to West, visible for less than two minutes, triangle shaped with white lights on front (leading) edge, silent, no exhaust or emissions, no electrical interference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am college educated geographic specialist and have researched some possibilities for this object. I didn’t really think about it for a number of years and finally thought about what it could have been. My first thought was that it was a stealth bomber, but realized that the actual production started later than when this was sighted. I’m sure there were prototypes around, but most likely not flying out of Duluth at this time. Stealth bombers and fighters have never been stationed out of Duluth. This object was also as silent as a bird; no wind noise, no jet exhaust, no turbine whine--nothing but silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fact that there were more witnesses confirmed that I wasn’t seeing things. I wish someone else would come forward and confirm this besides me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/90 21:00|Middleville|MI|Disk|1 minute|The huvering silent crafts lighs moved and focused on us befor it crossed the road and shot away in the night.|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60900.html|8|ndxe199009| The huvering silent crafts lighs moved and focused on us befor it crossed the road and shot away in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to express how difficult this is for me to talk about.  I have told family members and a few choice friends.  I was on my way home from my ex inlaws home on chiefnoonday road in middleville.  My ex husband and I stopped at the corner of chiefnoonday and yankee springs road.  (Please know that this is several years ago).  We both noticed a saucer shaped object huvering above the tree tops.  There were almost head light looking lights (2) that went from shinning straight ahead to focusing directly on us.  We just watched in disbelief, that it could be a spacecraft of anykind.  I remember rolling my car window down to listen for any noise.  There wasn&#39;t any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My exhusband and I watched it cross over Yankee Springs rd.  diagonally.  I was on the passengers side next to the stop sign on Chiefnoonday headed towards Hastings.  It had colored lights on the bottom, green I believe. I was at that point almost hanging my head out of our car to get a better look.  It moved very slowly then almost as fast as lightning dissappeared from sight.  We thought for a moment that perhaps the quick flashes of light we had seen on the drivers side of the road on our way to the corner could of been the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t live far from that corner and as soon as we got home we checked the time just for kicks to see if we had been gone longer then we should have.  We were fine.  I do remember calling my ex mother in law and asking her if there was anything happening on her scanner.  (She always had it on back then).  She said nothing was being said about anything related to what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had pretty muched dismissed the happening until My mother in law called the next weekend.  She and a line of cars wer at the same corner of my sighting and she experienced the same craft I had.  She however hung her head out the window and started shouted to it &#34;beam me up, there is no intellegent life  here!&#34;.  My sister in law at that time was a young teenager and started crying in fear.  My mother in law was dissappointed no one stopped and pulled over to talk about the craft that was there. She called us right away in excitement over the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one else that I am aware of ever came forward and spoke about the events that we experienced.  I guess that is why I never really brought it up before.  I  did ask a family member at that time who had some millitary knowledge  if the was a huver craft that made  no noise?  I was told he was aware of huver crafts but they all made some sort of noise.  In my experience I heard nothing.  I always tease my middle daughter that because she has an odd body part she is my alien daughter.  (I am just joking of course).  She was just a tiny newborn at the time and was in the car durring the experience. I think its odd that she has recently moved to Texas this year.  I cant wait to tease her again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe I make a joke of it to keep my sanity.  Maybe it was a government test of something. I dont think I&#39;ll ever know.  Its just something that happened that I wanted to share almost 19 years later, that seems like it just happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could be more accurate about dates and times.  I also wish I knew if the other lights that had flashed by prior were related to what I experienced?  I would love to know if anyone else in the Gun Lake area at that time ever came forward with an experience simular to my mother in laws or myself? Thank you for letting me share.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It seemed to be larger than a football field, noiseless, and glided directly above railroad tracks by train station.  it was moving at about the speed of 5mph (we walked right under it as it barely moved above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then witnessed a bright white light come from the center of the underside of the triangular formation. The light split into two and they flew over the fields of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another came out in the same fashion and scanned the fields as well. i&#39;d say at the speed of a cessna type plane. the third light to come out grew intensly bright and flew right back in to the &#34;mother ship&#34;.  It then popped back out again immediately and split in two, following suit with the other 4 &#34;scouts&#34;.  The triangle continued to follow the tracks and we watched until it was out of sight and the scouts were gone as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mothership was immense!  Noiseless!  Moved at a slow rate of speed.  It did not move erratically, just continued on a straight path over the local train station tracks. The red lights at the corners and along the edges were very bright.  The 6 scout ships were of a bright white color that remained solid as they flew at a speed of a Cessna airplane.  They flew over the farmfields in that area as if they were scanning something.  When they came out of the mothership, they would appear as one bright white light splitting into two separate crafts.  Concerning the 3rd light to come out of the mothership:The other 4 scouts were already moving along the skyline of the fields.  The 3rd light came out, grew intensly bright white (whiter than white)then immediately flew back in to the craft.  We watched this happen at about 1000ft above our heads.  We had to look directly straight above us.  It then came out again, almost immediately, grew intensly bright white and split into 2 crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember running to the high grass in the fields after that because we were so scared.  We watched them until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in September 1990 is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/90 18:00|Greencastle (west of)|IN|Other|5-10 minutes|A silver-metallic hockey puck shaped object just hanging in the daytime sky.|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16596.html|10|ndxe199009| A silver-metallic hockey puck shaped object just hanging in the daytime sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred during full-daylight, in a beautiful blue near-cloudless sky. I was traveling north on a popular rural route (Manhattan Road) in western Putnam County, when I noticed an object up in the sky probably many miles ahead of me at an altitude of several thousand feet. My first impression was it must be a balloon, but very quickly knew it was not one as it was completely motionless in the sky. While it was a fairly serene day, obviously anything in the sky such as a balloon at that altitude, would have been moving at least a little bit. Since it was in the sky ahead of me, I was able to try to watch it for several minutes, maybe as much as 10 minutes. But because I had a commitment that I had to be at, I couldn&#39;t stop, and of course I didn&#39;t have a camera to take a picture of it. The entire time I was viewing it, it never seemed to move. Rather it just hung there motionless in the air. I have never to this day have seen anything that could just stay motionless in the air, except this one object I saw in broad daylight. The best way to describe the shape of it is to compare it to a hockey puck. It appeared flat on two sides and perfectly circular in shape. The color was silver-metallic. I couldn&#39;t make out any features such as &#34;windows&#34;, or &#34;engine ports&#34;. The object&#39;s surfaces seemed perfectly smooth. While it looked like a hockey puck, it didn&#39;t lie flat in the sky, but was &#34;tilted&#34; at about 30 degrees. Once again, nothing about the appearance of the object during the time that I observed it changed. It never rotated on its own axis, or moved in the sky. It was clear to me that it was some kind of solid object, and not something &#34;celestial&#34; in the sky I was looking at. It finally was out of my view after driving about 15 miles, but when I was able to take a peak behind me in the sky, it was still there. I am an open-minded person, but always look for a logical solution first. This sighting to this day, still has me baffled as to what could just &#34;hang in the sky&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At that time I was in the military the US AirForce  we were dispatched to Egypt pryor to the start up of desert strom to build a fuling base in the desert along with a large MASH unit.  While at the site we would start working at dawn and many times would not finish up to well after dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first 30 days we were in country we were house at a large hotel complex in Cairo Egypt.   Not sure of the date but one evening after we had finished work we all were waiting on the tarmac for our buses to takes us back to Cairo it was about 72 Degs and a very clear night.  Their was aprox 70 of use including our commander.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after we all gathered to wait for the buses one of the guys pointed to the south east and said what is that well we turned around and looked up.  I have never seen anything this until at that moment.  There were aprox 100 objects pale orange in color that were at a very high altitude in two V formations one next to the other looked like a W in the sky. These objects moved very slowly from the south east to the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached our location you could drop a pin and hear it hit the sand not a single person was making a sound.  Once they got over head at a high altitude they changed course in unison to the north.   We watched them for about 30 to 35 minuets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over and saw our commander looking up at the objects and asked him what he thought they were.  He said I have no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have not been able to determine what the objects were.  I did go to base ops the next day to see if their may have been a large military flyover.  NO traffic was in the air that night  The Egyptican military do not fly at night and no commercial traffic was in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted this report some years ago to MUFON but have never heard anything back from them or if they received It.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now retired from the Air Force and this incident still bugs me I would like to know what they were.  By the way being in the middle of the desert their were no external lights other than a bldg light that was on about 500 yards away .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

9/7/90 22:00|Dover (south of Dover AFB)|DE|Triangle|1:00|Evening sighting of UFO at two different locations.|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12263.html|14|ndxe199009| Evening sighting of UFO at two different locations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were camping at a private camp ground when we heard a very strange sound and looked up to see what at first appeared to be a jet airplane passing by the campsite very slowly and at a very low altitude, as if it were landing. The sound was very foreign and did not sound like any aircraft either of us had ever heard. Then the craft became silent and seemed to disappear over some trees. We then went out to a nearby field to see if we could figure out what it could have been &amp; where it went. We saw nothing for a long while. As we decided to go back to our campsite I noticed what appeared to be a falling star. I pointed out the location I saw the light drop when all of a sudden a craft slowly approached us. It was triangular in shape and huge as it came to a stop right in front of us, almost above us. We noticed that it made no sound whatsoever. My friend noted that is did not have any flashing red light that all registered aircraft are required to display. Right after he stated that a large red light began to glow at the bottom, center of the craft. As soon as that occured we freaked thinking that the occupants may have heard us and responded. We then witnessed the craft swiftly drifted away silently then sped upward at what appeared to be a 45% angle until it went out of sight.<n>

It went straight down then went in the water in our river about 2 miles away towards the town of Rexton and it dove in really slowly and then we said omg I dont believe what I seen I thought something crashed. BUT then we seen a light coming towards our town in the water and it was flickering coming at a pretty good spped around 40 mph at least. Then when it came by our wharf the whole wharf rumbled and our car shook thats when we looked back at it after freaking oit and it kept going towards the sand dunes we have in Richibucto about 2 miles down river and it cane back out of the water and went straight up back into space at a speed we knew wasnt normal there is no way. And im telling u when it went bye our wharf. My friends car shook like hell.  To shake ! our wharf like that takes power and not to mention the wave above the lghts that were flashing in the water. AMAZING<n>

THEY WERE ALMOST LIKE HEADLIGHTS ON A CAR BUT THEY WERE TOO BIG. IT WASN&#39;T A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE. I COULDN&#39;T EVEN HEAR THE RUSLE OF LEAVES AS MY MOM PICKED THEM UP. IT WAS LIKE I WAS IN A TRANCE. AS MY MOM BENT OVER TO PICK UP THE LEAVES THE LIGHTS CAME DOWN CLOSER TO ME. BUT WHEN SHE STOOD UP TO TURN TO ME THEY ASCENDED.

I lived on the 3rd floor of a building that was situated on a hill, so I estimate I was about 50 feet above the ground, with the treetops just below my balcony, facing due east. I know because the sun would rise directly in front of me. Off my balcony is an empty field and next to that is a local private school and a residential area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I owned a telescope, so I often would be on my balcony at night looking at stars, and I was familiar with the positions of constellations and planets, knowing their relative positions at any given time at night, or season.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one night I was on the balcony, and decided to train my telescope on a portion of the sky that I often did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked for a bright object to observe, I noticed a perfectly circular cluster of &#34;stars&#34; that I hadn&#39;t noticed before. I knew it wasn&#39;t Plaiedes... though they were roughly as bright as the stars in that constellation. It was circular, and after realizing I hadn&#39;t seen it before, I continued to look at it, and realized the points of light were following each other in a pattern. It was rotating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds of watching it, one of the points of light circled the others, then exited the cluster from the center, and accelerated away from the others. Soon after, they all seemed to diminish in brightness until they were all gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was certain they were moving, and it wasn&#39;t the illusion of movement that one gets when they stare at an object in the sky for a long time. I have noticed this phenomenon before, and I was careful to make absolutely certain I was not seeing things. I have seen simple satellites or space debris streaking across the sky before, and this behavior was not reminiscent of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time later, I saw an episode of Unsolved Mysteries that featured a couple that had taken a video of the same thing I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We lived near  big apple orchard  and had just finished picking a bunch of apples. My dad and I were out on the drivewayspraying all of the apples down with the hose. Since we lived out in the country the sky was almost always bright with stars and I often found myself staring up at the sky for meteors and such. This particular night I was staring up at the sky and there, directly above us, at what seemed like miles in altitude, was a gigantic triangular thing with bright lights on each tip of  the triangle. The thing just sat there motionless for a couple of minutes. Then, without warning, it began rotating back and forth as if on a fixed point. After I came out of my state of shock I grabbed my dad and showed him what I was looking at. My dad is not very emotional. He just kind of looked at it and said, &#34;Oh yeah. My brothers and I use to see that thing out on the farm all the time when we were kids.&#34; Then he went back to spraying the apples while I flew inside the house to get my mom and grandma to show them the thing. They were frustratingly slow and was begging them to hurry. By the time we got out there, the thing was gone and I was royally p.o.ed. My dad was still standing there with the hose. I asked him where the thing went. He said he didn&#39;t know. That was the last we ever saw of the big triangle. But, I kid you not, it was one of the most wicked cool things i have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It made no sound whatsoever.  I couldn&#39;t exactly makeout the shape of the craft at first, because it appeared that the entire sky was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching in awe for a moment, i noticed that some of the &#34;stars&#34; were flashing like a dim strobelight.  A line of these lights extended down the center of the craft, and the outer edges appeared to have similar luminations but more widely spaced.  The size of the vehicle i saw is indescribable, other than that it covered the entire sky.  Even after many attempts to find pictures of a similar craft, as well as witnessing other ufo phenomenon i have yet to see anything in comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was twelve about twelve years old at the time and this event has changed my entire outlook on life, religion, history, and the future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the age of seventeen, i joined the Marine Corps and was selected for Signals Intelligence(mos:2631) at Parris Island, SC. Years in this field revealed to me even more strange and sometimes unexplainable craft all over the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am now 28 years old, and continue to watch the skies for any more evidence of extraterrestrial travel in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
