5/30/70 22:00|Brantford (Canada)|ON|Disk|45 min.|while watching the eclipse of the moon I noticed a light far out in the heavens that was quite larger and brighter then the other stars|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34981.html|1|ndxe197005| while watching the eclipse of the moon I noticed a light far out in the heavens that was quite larger and brighter then the other stars that were visable at the time. I have seen aircraft with the sun shining on them and it was not this situation at all. the shape of the light was perfectly round and seemed like it was coming straight down towards earth. Afer watching it&#39;s approach for about an half hour  I went in the house for what I would say was another half hour to do some things . The unusualness of  this light that was coming from from the heavens was still on my mind so as so as was finished doing what I had to do I went back outside.  I no sooner got out  the door and onto the lawn when two little old ladies that were standing on the cornner , waiting for a bus, reported to me .&#34;Look at the helicopter over your head!&#34; I looked up and saw this disk shaped object hovering  , maybe 50 feet over my head. I said to the ladies that  I didn&#39;t think It was a helicopter because there was no absolutly no  nois There were lights all around the perimeter that seem to alternate red, green and white. I&#39;m sure if I picked up a stone and threw it I could have hit it. The u.f.o. stayed still for close to five minutes without making a sound then slowly turn as if on an axis and moved away at a liesurly pace. The reason for writting this letter is to find out if anybody else has seen the direction from which these obects come from. Although it has been many years since this incidence has occured I still can walk out and point to the exact position and path that  the object came from in the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> best regard ((name deleted))  now aged  60<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I turned around just to see if any of our freinds might have been walking behind us. There weren&#39;t any. When I turned around I couldn&#39;t help noticing a huge triangular object in the sky kind of comming up behind us. I yelled at mt freind in awe and said something like &#34;LOOK&#34;! He said, what is it? I said something in the terms of, It&#39;s gotta be a UFO!! The object was &#34;huge&#34;, atleast one hundred feet or more tip to tip. It made no sound what so ever and was fairly evenly lit by a bright light on each corner. It hoovered above us as we watch it for quite a while and we decided to leave. It went in the same direction as we did so we ran to get home. I lived near the spot where we saw it. My freind went home the long way to avoid the object. When I got home, my mother asked why I was home so late and I said I didn&#39;t know. About 10 minutes later, my brother came in the door. He was at his girlfreinds house up the street. He said look, we saw this earlier. He and his girlfreind were laying in her yard just watching the stars and whatever else and he said a huge triangular object went right over them. High in the sky, of course. He described the exact same thing that I saw and he had a picture that he drew and it was, the exact same thing I saw. It was in the news papers the very next day. A lot of other people saw it too. My freind never remembered the incident when I saw him a couple of weeks later. I had night mares for years of being in a totaly white room with no corners, and a dark object would come closer and closer to me towards my face and then I would wake up. I was stressed for a long time for some reason and for years I was convinced it was from seeing the craft. I had a small round scar on my left legg that I could never explain. It looks like a vaccination mark now. I had my throat checked once for a problem I was having. The doctor went through my nose with a scope to go down to see my throat. He asked me through the course of the check up what did I get opporated on for in my nose. I said I never got an opperation in my nose. He said you had to and I replied, I would know if I did. I had my nose courtorized when I was a child but never an opporation. That was the end of the conversation. I&#39;m not saying I was abducted, but with all the things that happened to me, I sure thought about it. If I had the money, I&#39;d get a whole body scan just to check it out. I would like to say that I and other people I know and talk to, beleive in u.f.o.&#39;s. This is the reason I do. Also, about two years ago, I ran into! an old employer of mine at a store. We were looking for a good ufo movie and my old boss replied, I shouldn&#39;t tell you this, but I saw a u.f.o. years ago. Around 1970. He described the &#34;EXACT&#34; same thing we saw. And best of all, the same time frame. He lived behind the mountain where the school was located. He and his father saw the same one we did. Everything I mentioned here is 100% true. I&#39;m 47 now and was 16 then, I recall everything I mentioned as if it happened last night. There is no forgetting. You can watch all the movies you want, but you just can&#39;t comprehend the feeling, of seeing something so large so quiet just floating in the sky abouve you, unless you saw it yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was preparing to observe the heavens, as an amateur astronomer. As I was observing mars in my back yard with a small telescope, looking due south east at it through my telescope I got a premonition to look up, and as I did I saw 2 Luminous Orange Disks Oval shape traveling from the direction of Mars. They were traveling side by side as if they had a tractor beam holding them together. They zig zagged from side to side as they moved forward across the sky, very high up, from one horizon to the other in about 3 seconds. The sky that night was crystal clear, no moon glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly, an oval shaped craft came down, out of nowhere, and hovered above the ground, about 1 foot off the ground.  This was about 50 feet from where we were sitting on our porch, and acroos a dirt road, in a cow pasture.  The craft just hovered there for about 2 minutes, we were silent and just watched it.  There was a slight humming noise coming from the craft, there were no windows, that we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was about 5 to 6 feet in lenght, it was domed from the middle to the &#34;back&#34; end of it...the other end was aerodynamic...seems to me that it must have been at least 3 to 4 feet in width...maybe two beings could have occupied it.  Also, it was metallic in color, look like it may have been stainless steel.  After it hovered there for about 2 minutes, it slowly rised and then took off at such a speed that it was over the ocean and out of sight in just seconds.  I have told some friends about this, and they all seem to believe me, but I always get the idea they it really scares them that I saw this craft.  I think I have the approximate time and dates correct, I was 16 yrs. old when I saw this with my step-father, and I know that he only talked to me about this, and no one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

5/15/70 16:00|Kansas City|MO|Light|ten seconds|A brilliant, greenish light that suddenly appeared within a grey cloud overhead.|5/14/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22801.html|6|ndxe197005| A brilliant, greenish light that suddenly appeared within a grey cloud overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> when I was a very young man, I and two of my friends were standing outside our Jr.High school talking. It was on the last day of class of my ninth grade year and school had been over for about 30 or 40 minutes. As I was listening to the other two guys talking, I was gazing up at the clouds overhead. All of a sudden, I saw a very bright light suddenly just turn on within a cloud allmost directly overhead. The light appeared to be moving within the cloud because of the way the shadows shifted within and without the cloud. The light appeared to be of a greenish hugh and moved slowly for about 10 seconds, then as suddenly as it had appeared, it just went out. For some strange reason, I never brought it up to the attention of my two friends who were still talking to each other. Indeed, I passed it off as a flare to myself and thought little of it afterward. Two other incidents in my later years have brought this incident into the context of a possible UFO sighting. One was the sneezing of a BB like object out of my left nostril that struck the palm of my hand and then struck  the passenger window of the car I was in with a loud &#34;click&#34; like metal on glass. The other was a daylight sighting of a cylindrical object that I reported to your center as having occured on Oct.21st 1999 in Kansas City, MO. It is no longer a question of &#34;if there are UFO&#39;s&#34;. It is now a question of &#34;what are they here for?&#34; I am 48 years old now and am an archaeologist and a former armored cavalry officer. I do not have moments of fantasy and know what I&#39;ve experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was playing right field on an asphalt ball field.  All of a sudden, the pitcher, Eddie Rodriguez looks up and continues to stare at the sky.  All the players looked up and there were 2 moons.  The moon that wasn&#39;t supposed to be there released a smaller object that soon overshadowed the original and was very large in the sky.  It looked like it was alive and was about fall on the ball field.  My friend, Eladio Alvarez, said run it&#39;s going fall on the park.  Eddie and I couldn&#39;t believe our eyes.  This thing was going to crush the park and everyone in it.  Over 150 people started running for their lives.  As I watched this thing get massive over the park, it disintegrated to the sides.  Disappeared and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it again.  Many people saw this.  I just happened to be in the South Bronx play yard of P.S. 154.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was a student at Public School 54, an elementary school. At around lunch time I and hundreds of other students and some of the school faculty saw a silver-colored object shaped like a pyramid, about 100 feet up in the air above the school yard, spinning in its place in the same manner as the Earth spins on its axis. I&#39;d say the object was the size of a small school bus. There is no doubt that it was a solid object because the sun&#39;s rays reflected off its surface. I was standing next to the assistant principal, who made a comment about UFOs. This was the first time I heard the term ufo. A few minutes into my viewing, a helicopter appeared, which proceeded to fly around the spinning pyramid. Once again this was a solid object that was being &#34;investigated&#34; by a helicopter. The bell sounded signaling the end of the lunch period. I went back in. By the time school was out the object and the helicopter were gone. The school changed its name to CS 54, and was torned down by the mid 1970s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done extensive web searches for articles/news stories about this event but have come up empty. It is as if I was the only one to watch this phenomenon. But there were at least 50 eyewitnesses! The school&#39;s vice principal (middle aged then, now perhaps dead) also witness it, along with other staff members. I would like to provide his last name, if this web site&#39;s host will allow it. This needs to be followed up. There can not be an unconfirmed UFO report when there are scores of people who witness it! Other witnesses out there, come forward!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We usually don&#39;t allow use of the names of witnesses, although any student at CS54 in 1970 probably would know the name of his/her principal.

I came out into the school yard for recess, saw with about 50 other students, including some faculty members, a silver pyramid appproximately the size of a small school bus spinning in place about 50 feet above the school yard. The object made no sound. This was no optical illusion because the sun&#39;s rays reflected off the pyramid&#39;s metallic surface. A few minutes into my observation, a helicopter arrived and immediately flew around the pyramid. The assistant school principal, also witness this event. He remarked something about UFOs, and this was the first time I ever heard the term. The school bell sounded, signaling the end of recess, so I went back in. At the end of the school day I came back out, but both the pyramid and helicoper were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second posting---it is as if either I&#39;m not being believed, or someone wants to censure me.

5/1/70 15:30|La Grange|IL|Circle|30 seconds|Saucer sighting|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/097/S97197.html|10|ndxe197005| Saucer sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Report  I don&#39;t know the exact date this happened.  I know it was in the springtime and I think it was in 1970 or 1971.  I was in the fourth or fifth grade, that much I do know.  It happened in La Grange, Il., a western suburb of Chicago.  Because of the uncertainty of the date this event happened on, I am hesitant to report this, but I heard a plea to report any sightings to see if they could be correlated and so decided to go ahead and report it recalling any detail I could remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was after school, so in the mid afternoon around 3:30 pm, probably DST. I recall it was a pleasant temperature. The sky was mostly sunny, but there were large fluffy clouds in maybe twenty to thirty percent of the sky. I was cutting through an empty field at the corner of Elm and La Grange road which I always did when I was that age. Now there&#39;s a public park at that corner. I liked to look up at the sky. I remember that the sky seemed so blue back then. It seems to me that the sky was bluer back then, but who knows?  Anyway, I looked up and I saw what I would describe as a classic saucer shaped metallic object hovering over my head at about the two o&#39;clock position. It was shiny and obviously metallic. I would estimate that it was maybe 1500 to 2000 feet up, though I wouldn&#39;t have known that back then so it is my adult knowledge making that guess. It looked like it was spinning on the outside. I just looked at it for a few seconds, kind of amazed I was looking at this thing and wondering if it saw me. It was between clouds, not even close to an edge. I remember the clouds were moving slowly in the sky but this thing remained perfectly still for at least 10 to 20 seconds. I just stood there and stared for that amount of time, then suddenly in a streak that shot off to the southwest it was gone. It just kind of disappeared in that direction in what I would guess was less than a second. I then focused my attention to my front and went home. I don&#39;t remember experiencing any lost time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never told anyone about this experience. It is the only time I can recall seeing a UFO in the daytime. I don&#39;t think it was anything that could be explained as a natural phenomenon, but it could have been a manmade thing. Anyway, that&#39;s my report. I apologize that it&#39;s not very detailed, but it happened so long ago. I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone back then because I knew it wouldn&#39;t be believed, but it is something that has stuck with me all this time. Thanks for the opportunity to tell someone and I hope this helps someohow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up and saw what I can only describe as a disc reflecting the afternoon sun.  I raised my hand and pointed at it while at the same time asking my friends if they knew what it was. We had no idea what it was but we all knew that it wasn&#39;t an airplane.  It looked like a silver dollar held at arms length except that it was the color of highly polished brass not silver. It had three antennae on top in the center with two of them set at 45 degrees of the third.  It moved silently across the sky from north to south at a right angle from where I was standing (my house at the time was on West Outer Dr. the second house down from the top of Washburn Cir. facing east).  My best guestimation would have put it over Highland View Elementary School (now the childrens museum) heading south across the front entrance of the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant.  I&#39;m not one given to hallucinations and will have my pilots licence in 2-3 months which is why I know it wasn&#39;t a plane from the local airport,  but I would like any information as to what it could have been from anyone in the area who may have seen it.

Intercontinental Airport had opened the year before and I was very familiar with the landing routes of the airplanes.. I was looking at the few stars I was able to see when I saw a very bright &#34;star&#34; APPROACHING from the west. It grew larger by the minute with lights becoming visible all around the structure.  I remember that they were green and red and I seem to remember an amber light on the bottom of the structure. It was a silverish saucer-shaped craft, moving at an unbelievably slow pace, no more than a mile or two an hour with absolutely no sound at all! As it was almost directly overhead of our house, I jumped up and woke my younger sister, practically ripping her out of the bed, dragging her to the window so that she would also see it. She was groggy but amazed. I jumped up from the floor by the window and ran down the hall and out the back door. I stood on the back door step and watched it maintain its slow pace overhead, heading due east, directly in the path of JFK Blvd and the FAA!! As it slowly proceeded that way, I ran back inside to the telephone to see if I could get the number to the FAA so that they could witness this also.  I was so nervous that I dropped the phone and my father got up. I tried to get him to go outside to see if it was still visible, but he sent me to bed. This has stuck with me all my life.. I will never forget it. I dont know how long I was outside observing it, but it was a huge saucer, perhaps 125 ft across with maybe an altitude of less than 200ft. My sister for years had denied seeing it, but now we discuss it openly as she has seen unusual things in Mississippi where she now lives..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date is approximate.
