Sky was clear and cold with a full moon behind us just rising in the east.  Object appeared from over our heads and behind us moving into view in the windshield as it appeared to be falling from directly overhead to the west.  When about ten degrees above the western horizon it abruptly blinked out.  Object was about the same apparent diameter as the moon (NOT a reflection) and was bright green with an orange halo around it and left sparks as it descended.  Would have thought it was maybe a re-entering satelite except for the way it abruptly blinked out.  I am an amateur astronomer and have been a police officer for 28 years.  Never saw anything like this before!  Sorry I took so long to report this to you but I didn&#39;t know you existed until just now.  I am always looking for interesting things in the sky but this takes the cake.  Thought you might be interested.  Thanks!<n>

At first I was not sure if I was looking at winged aircraft or helicopter.  What caught me attention was that it was moving rather quickly but able to execute very sharp and quick moves.  It was flying toward me briefly, then started to ascend straight up. This ascent continued for about 20 minutes until I could no longer see the craft.  I saw no wings, propellers or exhaust.  During that time a commercial jet aircraft flew by but the UFO was far above so I don&#39;t know if the aircraft pilot saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early evening in Jerusalem.  Object appeared to be black at the time, but that could be due to light conditions.  Object appeared to be round saucer with a small cap on top.  It caught my attention because of the fast but maneuverable manner in which it flew.  I then realized that it was neither plane or helicopter.  I was facinated by the way it ascended straight up until it disappeared.<n>

Sky is very clear in the desert - no lights near because we are in the north part of town. Looking up at the stars I suddenly saw two lights moving very very high up, from west to east.  I said to my partner to look at the lights and she saw them as well - no form discernible.  It was the fastest thing I had ever seen (I was an Air Force brat and have been around planes since I was a kid).  We followed the lights to the east when they made a very sudden ZIG ZAG and disappeared.  I timed this afterwards by counting the time it took for me to move my head to see this - it was seven (7) seconds, and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We rose early in the morning of Sunday January 30, 2000 about 5.15 am PST to see the last quarter of the moon and how close Venus was to it. Our property is in the north part of the city of Palm Springs - higher than the town itself, so there isn&#39;t light reflection from the city.  My partner went outside on to the patio and turned all the lights off.  After looking at the moon we then tilted our heads to look at the stars in the clear desert sky -it was exceptionally clear.  As I looked back to the east I saw two lights, very very high, moving very very fast and said to my partner - look at those lights, what&#39;s that?  The lights moved eastward and then after a few (maybe 5 seconds)seconds, zig zagged sharply to the left and then disappeared.  I was very careful to note the time and then timed the incident again by moving my head (I&#39;d previously timed it by saying one and two and - to get the seconds count.  I subsequently (during the day I timed a jet) and found that the jet was 5 times slower than what we had seen.  The lights moved together; they were tiny, almost pinpoint but the lights themselves were really bright even though small.  There was just one object even although we couldn&#39;t see any form. This incident took place at our weekend home in Palm Springs, CA.<n>

The sky was mostly clear, and with the near-full moon, the shape of the craft was plainly visible.  It had small lights on the bottom and some lights around the circumference, some of which were pulsing.  There were about 4 planes flying in a large circular pattern around the craft (similar to planes flying around fireworks on 7/4).  The craft was stationary for about 5 minutes, moved (fast!) higher and to the west, pulsed several times, then disappeared.  After the craft had vanished, the flight-paths of the planes seemed to change, slowly criss-crossing back and forth across the area the craft had been in.  On my southbound return, I noticed many contrails coming from the area the craft had been in, going toward a point east/northeast (returning home?).<n>

Object was two to three times the size of the aircraft and left no contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a truck driver for a large freight company. I drive mostly at night, But at times, get delayed and do not finish my route until late in the morning. On the morning of 1/29/99 while en-route to Santa Maria, Ca from Bakersfield, Ca. on Hwy. 166 just west of Maricopa approx. 3 to 4 miles. Hwy. 166 west of Maricopa turns into a long steep grade which drops the speed of loaded semi trucks down to a crawl. The reduced speed gives me a great opportunity to gaze at the beauty of the San Jaquin Valley below. It also gives me the chance to watch the commercial airlines fly into &amp; out of the Los Angeles area over the mountain range to the south of Hwy. 166. The temperature of the morning of 1/29/99 was down in the mid to low thirties. The aircraft that would fly north over the Grapevine would leave long, thick contrails as they entered the San Jaquin Valley. After listening to Art Bell&#39;s discussion a few nights earlier about aircraft leaving strange contrails is what drew my attention to these aircraft and there contrails. As I was watching one airplane and it&#39;s contrail I noticed an object just to the left rear of the contrail and the aircraft. It appeared to be about two to three times larger than the size of the commercial airliner. It also seemed to be at the same altitude. This object was unlike any thing I ever seen before. Being bit of a skeptic on UFO&#39;s I at first dismissed it as another plane. But then, This object in a matter of a few seconds darted over to a plane that was headed north and followed it for about a minute or two. This got my curiosity up, So at the first turn out I pulled over and got out my binoculars and started watching this object. It would follow one plane for two to three minutes. Then, In a matter of seconds, It would zoom across the sky and start following another airplane. It always stayed just to the rear and left of the plane and it&#39;s contrail. The odd thing about this object was that it appeared to be transparent at times, Then solid. The shape of this object would be like! if you put two coffee cup saucers together. One upside down from the other. On top this object had a small dome like shape, But with sharp angles. On the bottom, It had a smaller, More rounded dome shape that ran almost the length of the object. The object had a grey,silver color to it. No lights nor windows were visible any where on this object. Nor were there any type of numbers, letter&#39;s or any other identifying marks visible. The other odd thing about this object was the fact that every airplane that flew in the San Jaquin Valley area left a contrail. This object left none at all!!!!.<n>

Suddenly, there was a thin orange streak that went from in front of the plane, straight south, in a second or less. There was no noise other than the plane. The plane immediately cut all lights, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing ramge. The &#34;streak&#34; was obviously some type of aircraft, but were it not for the streak, I would have never known it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually live 13 miles due north of McAlester, in a rural area. It was a Sunday night, fully dark, and clear with lots of stars but no moon. I was out gathering wood when I heard an airplane. I looked up and saw the lights of a small prop plane. As I watched it travelling almost directly overhead, heading north, I suddenly saw an orange streak of light that begin immediately in front of the plane, and travelled due south, appearing to fly over the plane. It was gone in a fraction of a second. If I had not been looking at exactly that spot, I would never have seen it. I watched to the south for several minutes to see if any lights or exhaust would appear in the direction the streak had went, but none ever appeared. Strangely, as soon as the streak went over the plane, the plane turned out it&#39;s lights, all of them, and never turned them back on while it was within my hearing range. This is not the first time I have witnessed such a &#34;streak&#34;. The first time was in 1994 just east of McAlester. Again on a dark, starry, no-moon night.<n>
1/28/99 06:30|Scottsdale|AZ|Triangle|2-4 sec|Dark triangular shape against the darking sky. The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident.|2/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05451.html|10|ndxe199901| Dark triangular shape against the darking sky. The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past few days 1-25-99 until yesterday 1-31-99 I&#39;ve seen some interesting things in the sky over north Scottsdale in AZ. I wont speculate on what I saw but I will provide this brief explanation. The rear balcony of my 2nd story apartment faces east - north/east overlooking Stone Creek Golf coarse so I&#39;ve a very clear view with little or no obstruction. The other day I was relaxing on my balcony just enjoying the sky as I am an amateur astronomer. Then I saw a streak in the sky low on the horizon about 10 degrees. This streak was black against the darkening sky, and triangular in shape. The time was around 6:30 pm and the sky was turning a deep low saturation purple as is does here in the desert. The shape almost reminded me of an orderly flock of birds but it was clearly not birds as the speed was way to great and there was no variation in its shape, it was solid. The object covered at least 45 degrees horizontally in about 2 seconds. I estimate the object to be approximatly 2 to 4 miles distant making it quite large about the size of an f-15 or larger. At first I thought this is what I must have seen but there were no lights and no reflected light the only way I saw the object was due to the fact that it obscured the darkening sky. The sky was dark but the object was much darker. There was no sound and what seemed to be a dark streak or trail behind the object. I noticed that I could more clearly see the object by not looking directly at it. As all astronomers know when looking at very faint objects it is best to not look directly at the object due to the make up of the human eye, rods and cones. I&#39;ve a very clear understanding of aircraft, speed, size and action. Just to the north east of me is the Scottsdale Airpark, an airport that can handle many types of jets up to small passenger jets. It is a very busy airport and at any time you can see 4 to 6 jets on approach from the north. I know how fast a leer jet looks as it takes off and lands and this object was approximately 5 times that. Well after this first sighting a couple days ago I didn&#39;t give it much more thought, I don&#39;t need to dwell on such things as I&#39;ve seen many unexplained things in the sky. Well yesterday I saw  2 more such objects in the same place at the same time with 2 friends who also saw something. This time I saw the object for a good 90 degrees horizontally it was not quite as dark so I could see it more clearly. This occurred just after the full moon had cleared the mountains in the distance. Again there was no sound and the shape was triangular. I saw one and then within a few seconds another one. I could clearly point at it and follow it across the sky telling my friends as it crossed various reference points such as houses and the moon. I&#39;ll be watching the desert skies at dusk in that area everyday now with my camcorder in hand.<n>

At each wing tip were much smaller aircraft. A probe went to the ground from the belly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I left work that evening between 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm.  I walked out the main entrance that faces South and saw a low flying aircraft that looked like a 747 three times its size on a slow approach.  Concerned that a jet craft was in trouble and was attempting to land I went back into the building.  As it continued to approach I got oncerned that it was going to hit the building so I went back outside to the parking lot to get to my car.  I heard an extremely loud hum from the aircraft and relized at that time it was hovering about 300 feet in the air approxiamately 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile from my position.  The main body of the craft had approxiamately 8 to 10 portals which shinned red.  At each wings&#39; tip, which spanned an estimated 250 yards, where red shinning lights.  From the belly of the main craft appeared a probe which dissappeared into the trees.  Eventually the wing tip lights separated from the main craft&#39;s wings and one flew East and the other flew West. A few minutes later the main craft flew South West and dissappeared over the mountains.  The entire form of the craft(s) were vague -almost opaque.  The red portal lights were prominent.  It looked like a jet liner on approach in a fog, however, the evening was clear and most important was extremely windy.  Wind gusts in the mountain that day were clocked at 155 miles per hour.  Walsenburg, CO., our neighboring town to the East, made National news with winds gusting at 90 miles per hour.  The wing ends red lights which separated from the wings had no other form other than being a red light in the night sky much like a small Cessna 180.  Who in their right mind, military or other, would have been out flying the front range that evening in a wind storm I will not forget for a long time.  Four other individuals that evening witnessed strange aircraft activity about 7:00 pm in the evening.  One individual saw a bright white light North West of my sighting.  The other three individuals saw what appeared to be a very low flying jet hugh in size, one sa! w a probe from the belly with a red light at the end, the other two saw much smaller aircraft assisting the main aircraft at wing tips much like I&#39;ve describe above.  The craft(s) were flying North West of my sighting.

I&#39;m timing out and can&#39;t seem to recover.  I will mail you a full description along with area maps as well as a drawing of the craft.  I will include the names and phone numbers of individuals to contact who had a similar siting that same evening as well as another very strange siting which occured Friday, January 29, 1999, which may be related.

To high for an aircraft, but too close for a satalite.  My son and his friend came out to see the lights and noticed a group of about 7 lights in a triangular shape towards the west.  Two of the lights shot off from the others going in opposite directions (west and east).  Then they just disappeared.  After that time fog began to roll in and we were unable to see any other lights.  The light were a blueish white in color and at times seemed to get very bright white.  The lights were too large for stars, but too high for jets.  We live near Houston Intercontinental Airport and I am fabiliar with planes, etc. that fly around the area.  These lights did not fit a normal configuration of any aircraft I have observed in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> see above`<n>

My son and I both saw them. &gt;They had flashing lights (red, green and white), which seemed to pulse. Two &gt;of the lights seemed to dance with each other, and headed off.  The larger &gt;of the lights left behind, stayed stationary for 10 minutes, with lights &gt;pulsing around the middle.  Looking through binoculars the object was hazy. &gt;Then this light moved off in the same direction as the other two.  A faint &gt;hum was noticed.  Time: 8:22 p.m. Jan. 25, 1999. &gt;<n>

She was excited at seeing a beautiful object which she thought was a moon.  I looked out and immediately noticed a reddish-orange glowing roundish object on the horizon.  I scrambled to put on my glasses.  We noticed that the object was very far and with its size about 50% larger than the sun when it sets down.  The object was slightly obscured (maybe it was its shape) by the clouds.  It was also quickly moving down into the water.  By the time I found my binoculars and a camera the object was 40% into the water/horizon.   It soon dispeared into the horizon.  The whole experience took about 3-5 minutes.   My wife claimed to have seen the aicraft extinguished its lights as it went over the affected area through her binoculars --- I can&#39;t verify that. We also noticed a great number of lights blinking on the ocean horizon, approximately 10-25 miles.  These lights were all evenly spaced between each other, covering most of the horizon visible from our window.  The lights were all white with the exception of the two lights, one green and one red, between which the object disappeared.   These lights were also the closest between each other.   In all there were approximately 8-9 lights  -- to me it seemed that some Navy or something sealed the area of possible activity/landing. This activity seemed unusual to me.  The lights were active as we went to bed 2 hours later. I am college educated and well read.  This is a first UFO experience for both of us.  The next day, at 1645hrs, I called US coast guard in San Francisco to inquire about possible Navy activity, other reports, etc. -- there were none.  Nothing close to my description was logged by anyone.<n>
1/24/99 20:00|Portland|OR|Oval|120 seconds|Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83765.html|17|ndxe199901| Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming down OHSU Hospital in Portland, Oregon which is on a hill above the city.  It was winter and the sky was clouded and grey, but there was like an opening between the clouds and below it you could see the city lights.  It was about 8 PM on a Sunday night.  As I was going down the hill, looking at the city, suddenly a huge, immense, flying object started passing almost in front of me, and on top of the city.  I stop the car in the middle of the road as I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  It was flying low, so low I could see how huge it was.  Unbelievable... it was almost at the bottom of the heavy clouds passing the opening in the sky.  I could see it passing, like in slow motion, like almost hoovering, without making any noise, nothing.  It was in a tilt position, like a dish, a plate... Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn&#39;t see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.  It was too wide and too long, and absolutely quiet to be anything I have ever seen.  It was not an airplane or a flying globe.  This was a huge, immense object, so big, it couldn&#39;t be confused with any known thing.  May be a mother ship? I will never forget this experience, I could take a test to verify my story.<n>

We consider the source of the report to be highly credible.  We express our gratitude with this individual for sharing the report with NUFORC.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were approached directly by a cylindrical UFO from about three miles away to within 60ft of us, while driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, I agree with your position regarding the submission of observations and incidents to a central point for all the obvious reasons. Please do not publish this report with my name....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have several other incidents to report and will be happy to provide them as time allows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was good to speak with you regarding your concerns and I look forward to speaking with you again,<n> <n><n> <n><n> 23Jan99, Oakland CA, Cylindrical UFO:   I met ((male name deleted)) about 3 weeks before this sighting, below.  I told him two nights before that I had seen UFOs, that I suspected there was more to it.  I told him that, if he spent any time around me, he might see them, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((female name deleted)) has tolerated my focus on the UFO matter for the majority of our relationship.  She was privy to conversations with my relatives about sightings that occurred earlier in my life so I had the semblance of credibility with her.  She was also aware of my discussions with ((male name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 23, 1999 myself, ((name deleted)), and ((female name deleted)) were Southbound on I-80 in Oakland, CA.   I was in the front right hand seat, ((female)) was driving, and Ian was in the back.  It was about 7:30 PM, dark with overcast above 4500ft.   The lights and skyline of Oakland, CA were visible and reflecting light off of the overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we began the large curve leads past the Oakland Post Office I looked past ((female)) and pointed to the East and said &#34;Now that’s unusual.&#34;  Several miles away we could see a large yellow light over a white light. It was between the Oakland hills and us. We then made the curve at the Oakland Post Office and, at the point were the freeway begins to rise we again spotted the unusual light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it began to turn and changed to a cylindrical shape viewed broadside. It was emitting yellow light from its entire length.  It was cylindrical but slightly tapered.  There were no wings, no rotors, no thrust port and it was clearly not a blimp.  On its underside, at each end were two very large white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling end forward and perpendicular to our direction of travel - Southbound, from left to right us at a moderate rate of speed.  It was about 3 miles away, perhaps further.  On the front of the cylinder, above was a small, irregularly fluttering green light, on the front underside a small red irregularly fluttering light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((female)), who was driving, exclaimed &#34;Weird!.&#34;  ((male)) was having some difficulty locating it.  It was already obvious to me that it wasn’t anything conventional.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued Southbound the object arrived at a point between us and the Oakland Federal buildings. At this time we began to make out details including four equally spaced vertical separations and a horizontal deck. Towards the leading end we could barely make out shapes. I am left with a distinct memory of this craft and crew framed against the background of the newly completed Oakland Federal Buildings.  The craft must have passed with in 100yds of them as it continued to approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, in a moment, faster than I could blink, the object leaped from the location near the Federal buildings and stopped about 60ft from our windshield. It covered perhaps two miles in a manner that should have killed anything living that might be inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point the I-80/880 freeway rises off the ground to about 75 feet, passes under the Highway 24 overpass and continues for at least a mile as a raised freeway.  So our vantage point regarding what followed was from 40 to 75feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire side of the craft that was facing us was transparent.  It was as if one half of the tube became transparent and the side facing away from us was opaque.  It was emitting a very yellow light from its interior.  Inside, it had a deck evenly dividing it in half, lengthwise.  There seemed to be 5 evenly spaced vertical ribs against the opposite wall from the one we were looking through. The entire interior of the craft appeared to be visible.  It seemed to be completely hollow, with no ‘engine compartment’, or any other furnishings. It had similar dimensions to a cardboard toilet paper tube.  A width to length ratio of about 1 to 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became aware of three shapes that were visible at the front end of it.  The first was somewhat obscured by the large, white external light directly underneath.  The other two were evenly spaced from the first.  At this point I had a rush of adrenaline and my vision seemed to go telescopic. It was like this bizarre scene I was witnessing suddenly filled my entire field of vision.  ((female)), who was driving, said &#34;Are those ?&#34;  I blurted out &#34;No!,&#34; before she could say what we both already knew- aliens.  This is a scene I am not likely to ever forget.  There was no mistake.  These were not human beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the front end of it, with their hands resting on a thin bar or table were three people.  They seemed so similar that they looked like paper dolls.  ((female)) and I could both could see them clearly. They were standing, you could see their legs below the bar or table, facing us.  They were backlit by the yellow light and it was reflecting off the flat sides of their heads. They were staring right at us.  The sensation was one of very focused attention..  The heads were oversized, their foreheads were about a third larger than that of a human being.  The eyes were very large and dark and they have an occipital ridge, eyebrow, oriented like ours..  They seem to have narrow shoulders and hips and they have longer upper arm and upper leg bones than human beings.   This gives them a sort of stretched appearance.  They seemed to be about the same size as human beings, though I didn’t have reliable scale of comparison. The face is small, under the eyes but because of the backlighting I couldn’t see other details.  It was one-step above a silhouette.  Even so they were clearly not human beings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to try to describe the sensations running through us at this point.  ((female)) was doing her best to maintain control of the car while being emotionally overwhelmed.  Ian was counting down through the list of things the object was not.  I felt like Bugs Bunny looks when he loses morale and his ears droop down over his shoulders.  I slid down in the seat and made a conscious effort to stifle the fear that came with realizing that ‘it’  was happening again.  The fear was along the lines of &#34;I’ve studied hard to understand this, and based on what I feel about what I’ve already seen and what I have learned, I really wanna be somewhere else, anywhere else but here.&#34;  I didn’t sense danger as much as I felt extreme self consciousness.  The reality of the fantastic was scary.  I have prepared myself for this type of thing, both as a martial artist and a UFO experiencer so the fear phase was very short-lived.  I moved through it quickly and started observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to ((female)) and asked her what time it was.   She said &#34;7:34.&#34; Then I rolled down my window and started really watching.  She took confidence from my focus on observations and started watching closely herself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went below an overpass, the Highway 24/ I-880 overpass, and the craft intercepted us on the other side. It was less than its own length from our windshield.  In other words, it was flying sideways from its original end-on orientation about 75 to 100 feet in front of our car.  It was about 50 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point it had turned off its internal or deck lights.  Now only the two large white lights located at each end of the craft and the small red and green lights were visible.  Its interior was no longer visible. It was very difficult to see the structure behind the lights.  It hovered for a long minute directly in front of the windshield before it slowly passed in front of us, as we did 65mph, maintaining the same distance from our car as it did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((male)), who was in the back and was just beginning to clearly view the craft hovering in front of our car began asking questions. &#34;Rotors? A Chinook?&#34;  I rolled down the window. &#34;No, no noise, too big, way too big.…&#34;  The light from the two fixtures on each end of the craft was shining through the window and casting the shadows of bugs from the windshield onto my hands.  It lit up the inside of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned my attention from myself to the craft, I felt very &#39;altered.&#39;  My feeling about this is that it was a result of the adrenaline rush that had been occurring since this thing started.  My sense of time went away.  The experience took on a ‘slow motion’ quality.  As the light poured through the window onto my hands I was aware of a long, still, silent moment.  This sensation lasted until the craft began moving away. Nobody spoke as the craft began a second maneuver.  I could hear everything around me.  I was hyperaware.  The fact the craft was soundless and was displaying other unusual qualities at such a close range contributed to the ‘weirdness’ of the moment.  It left such a strong impression that even a year later it is on our minds daily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the window down and the object less than its own length from our car we could detect no sound.  It was absolutely silent. There was no thruster ports or jet blast, no sense of  anything at all holding it up.  It seemed to move through the air like a fish through water.  Silently.  No hum, no vibration, no sound at all.  It seemed to be very much under control and capable of very articulate maneuvers.  All we could hear was the sound of tires on the road.  Several of the cars around us slowed, we could hear the changes in tone of tires and motors.  I assume they also saw the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I distinctly had the internal mental impression of &#34;Stop the car,&#34; but this is the last place in the entire state of CA that you would want to try and stop. ((male)) and ((female)) said they had the same sensation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light fixtures themselves must have been huge, I have yet to see any night time lamp in the entire Bay Area that big.  The light itself was white to off-white in color.  Maybe similar to sodium street lights with fixtures the size of Volkswagens.   At the same time it wasn’t so bright you couldn’t look at it.  It had a very busy quality.  Almost static.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I could estimate the craft spanned 8 lanes of freeway.  It was about five times as long as it was wide, I’d guess 30 to 50ft wide and perhaps 140 to 200 feet long.  It easily spanned eight lanes of freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even more bizarre was that at this point it was within a hundred yards of the Oakland Police station, no small building itself.  It held its position directly in front of us as we did 65mph.  It was now flying sideways or broadside to its original orientation about 75 to 100 feet from our windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then passed to my right, continuing to fly next to us in our direction of travel.  The ‘back’ end swung away from us was now it was parallel to us, keeping its same close range on our right passenger side windows.  It was now flying backwards with respect to its original orientation.  I studied it carefully through my open window.  I was alert, more so than in previous experiences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed over the Jack London Square area as we passed by it.  I looked up through the open window and watched the ‘front’ end of this thing, its red and green lights fluttering on and off without rhythm, swing over our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it passed behind us, crossing back over the freeway and returning toward the East.  As we drove away from it we could make out the very rectangular silhouette of a cylinder viewed side on.   Susan began making comparisons between the length of the craft and the width of the buildings it was passing over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last we saw of it was a pair of lights above the radio repeaters in the Oakland hills, boosting at about a 45degree angle upward into the overcast..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back to Ian and said, &#34;That was ((deleted)) bizarre.&#34;  Right in the middle of downtown Oakland in front of God and everybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately began noting all conditions.  Time, location, etc..  I distinctly heard cars around us slowing.  Should have started noting license plates. There was a police helicopter hovering over Fruitvale avenue, in San Leandro with its spotlight on.  It was perhaps four miles South of the craft as it headed upward and Eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During its approach, the craft passed directly in front of several apartment complexes and office buildings as it approached.  It passed by  the Oakland Police station at less than 50 yards.  When it left it was visible to more apartment complexes on the South side of the Oakland skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another detail concerns the appearance of the object once it had shutoff its internal lights.  While it hovered in front of our car I noticed another unusual quality. There was overcast to 4500 feet, the ambient light of the city of Oakland was reflecting off of the clouds.  I feel there should have been a visible silhouette of the object.  There was not.  Though it was obvious that the external lights of the craft were attached to the airframe, the object itself was not visible behind the lights.  This bothered me, because it seemed unnatural.  There was obviously something between the clouds and me.  I was looking right at it, but I couldn’t see it.  It is a very odd quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it passed to my right, the island of Alameda was behind it.  Directly across from Jack London square is about 1/3 of a mile of open water, then a marina, then a business park.  There is very little light rising up from a very large area.  Against this background, the object itself was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it began its turn to pass behind us, the underside of the object was clearly visible.  It was only 30 to 40 feet over my head as I looked up through the open car window.  The bottom was smooth, seamless with visible lateral striations that made it look similar to an aluminum thermos bottle.   It was lit up by its own external lighting.  When I looked back at it as it crossed over the high-rises and it returned to the East, I could clearly see the out line of a cylinder over its own lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path of this craft was amazing.  The side of the craft the people were looking out of remained facing us through the whole maneuver.  The changes in direction and orientation appeared seamless.  There was a sense of acceleration as it first approached and when it left us.  There was no sense of ‘correcting’ maneuvers to maintain exact distances while changing direction and attitude.  It approached to intersect directly in our path, then it was hovering in front of us at an even distance flying broadside to its original orientation.  At no time did it wobble nor did it veer either closer or further away.  It didn’t overshoot as it took its position in front of us.  It moved with exact precision. The actual interception and turn might be considered a ground reference maneuver whereby a pilot picks a point of reference on the ground and flies as exact a course around it as possible.  As weird as it sounds, our car seemed to be that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire experience lasted from about 7:30 to 7:37 plus or minus.  It took about 6 minutes. The interception and turning maneuver itself lasted less than two minutes with the remainder taken in the approach and exit.  The object was visible longer during its exit.  We saw it travel laterally then directly approach us. We watched its entire exit, until it lifted into the overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my opinion that I have seen this craft, or this class of craft on three occasions.<n>

It was hovering approximately 40 feet above the road in the northeast region of Knapp Road in SherburneWit. We watched it continue in that direction until it disappeared.  My grandparents told us that they heard a sound like someone was &#34;blowing into a bottle&#34; at the time we saw the object.  We did not hear anything because we were inside the car.  We heard strange &#34;howling&#34;/ &#34;air-movement&#34; sounds for the next few hours but it was not windy out.  Our family has witnessed two other sightings in the past two years, in the month of October.  Both times there were three yellow, oval/diamond shaped objects in the eastern sky around 9:30 pm and lasted for about three hours.  Each object moved separately and sporatically, but kept the same distance between themselves. They moved at very high speeds. We did not see them leave.<n>

There were bright lights in front of what appeared to be the body of the plane or object, and perhaps windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were on our way to Gainesville, Florida, on our morning commute at the time.   I thought I could see a wing of the plane or ship behind the lights, but my husband could not tell.  It was hard to tell the exact shape.    It began as a bright light in the early morning distant sky, which we thought was just an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it started moving towards us and came right over the top of our car, and stayed very briefly, then took off.   There was no noticeable noise.    I kept wondering if anyone else on the road with us could see the thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the FAA in Atlanta, I believe, and they recommended I call air traffic control in Jacksonville to see if anything had been reported.    No one offered any explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this again.   I mentioned this experience to someone I was working with at the time, and she told me she had seen a very similar object over a shopping center in Boca Raton one evening.    I would just like an exlanation for what we saw, if that is possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both baby boomers, in our late fifties, or early sixties, and while we do enjoy science fiction, we are not making this up.    We are both college educated,  and we just do not understand what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband felt at the time this must have been a military test plane, but the way this object moved,     I just don&#39;t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

1/23/99 04:00|Chicago (1 hours south ofoff I 57)|IL|Disk|approx 15 min|I tried to post this yesterday but could not get to the site so I wrote it all down on a wp so i would not get anything wrong|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05408.html|22|ndxe199901| I tried to post this yesterday but could not get to the site so I wrote it all down on a wp so i would not get anything wrong<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something very strange last night 1/23/99. I work midnight’s and This was my normal day off, I usually try to stay up most of the nights I’m off since its easier on the body. I was listening to Art Bells show when the dogs started to act funny, this was about 4am central. I thought they wanted to go out so I headed to the back door. I live a couple of miles from a midsized city an hour south of Chicago on I-57.. Our subdivision is built in a large U shape with a farm field in the center. The houses opposite mine are about three hundred yards away across the field to the east. The filed is about six or seven hundred yards north south. We have had a very dense fog for the last few days due to little wind, a very deep snow cover and temperatures in the mid to upper 40’s. The Fog has been so thick that I could not see the houses across the field behind me, visibility has probably been 100 yards or less. As I approached the back door to let the dogs out I saw a green light coming from the back yard, actually from the field behind the yard. This puzzled me since the fog was still out side. I could see it out of the window in the front of the house from the room where my computer is located.  I grabbed a flashlight that was on a table and headed out. What I saw amazed me. I opened the door and there it was. A large object probably 40 or 50 feet off the ground. The center of the object, which had a small intense green light on the bottom was located about 75 or 80 yards directly behind my yard in a line with a point 5 feet to the north of my back door connecting the electrical box at the edge of the property. It was about 100 feet in diameter since it looked like it would touch the ground if it were turned 90 degrees and extend about the same distance upward from its midpoint. It looked cigar shaped but had point like extensions kind of like a star of David but eight of them equidistant around the circumference. I poked my head back into the house to look for a camera, my wife took up scrapbooking a few months ago and usually has a camera with film in it in the kitchen. I found the camera, but no film. I was going to grab the video camera but it was in a different room. What I did see to grab was my laser pointer from my brief case on the island in the kitchen. I kept the dogs inside and headed out to see this thing with my maglight and my laser pointer in hand. I only had a pair of slippers on but didn’t think much of it till later. I shined he flashlight at the object but the fog made it a big blur for lack for a better word. I left it on the deck as I headed out to the edge of the yard.. When I reached the edge of the yard and the end of the grass I stopped. I was still 70 or so yards away from the edge of it. It did not move. I shinned the pointer at the object then and could see my beam and the point it hit the objects belly. I then shinned it on the neighbors house to get some idea how far it would go and still be visible in the fog I could see it as far as 2 houses away but could not see where I knew the third house to be. So the visibility limit for the point was probably somewhere between 100 and 150 yards or so. I then shined the pointer on the object running it across the bottom  making sure to run it along all the edges to better judge its size. After a few minutes of this the light on the bottom of the object flashed once. It increased by at least, I’m guessing 3 orders of magnitude. Then it went back to its previous brightness the flash lasted maybe ¼ second and reminded me of a photo flash but green in color. After a  few seconds it flashed again but twice this time, each flash about ½ second apart. It did it again a few seconds later and this time it did three flashes then a few seconds without a flash then 5 flashes a period of  seconds then 7 flashes. It was then it dawned on me these were prime numbers. I still had the pointer and I shined 11 flashes at the green light then 13. The object then flashed 17 at me. We were communicating.  Then it stopped for almost a minute. At this point its easier to just write in the number sequence of flashes I have no idea what they mean. 19,7,8,18,19,6,16,19,21,11,21,12,13,20,23,21,24,8 	After the last grouping the light went dull maybe a magnitude or so dimmer than it was initially. Then at the tips of the star like projections green lights but a darker green or a little toward blue came on. The object started to lift up then moving a few feet a second at first then moving faster. There was no sound. It looked to be going straight up.  I shined the pointer on it until I could not see the point any longer but could still make out the 8 lights from the projections for a few more seconds then it was just gone. 	The whole event took maybe 10 or 12 minutes, I forgot to look at the watch when I went outside but know that it was around 4 am, it was just after 4 15 when I checked the watch. Then I went out to the field to the point that was under the center of the object. The snow in the field was kind of spotty but a circular pattern could be seen at the point I figured to be under the green light. The pattern was by stepping it off in my house slippers 45 paces a bit bigger I think than what I had thought the object was. My step count was 115 from my army days, this put the diameter of the circle on the ground at about 127 feet. 	I saw your site on Arts site so I figured you would like to know about this. I would rather not attach my name as I think people may find out about this and think im crazy. But I will give directions to the location without giving my actual address as well as my email, though im not sure thats a good idea. On I 57 take the 1st exit to kankakee southbound from chicago. Note sure of the exit number but there is a Wal-Mart near it along with a mall. Head south 1/2 mile to an intersection there will be a Dennys on the right and the Wal-Mart will be on the Left front. Turn left at this intersection. You will be headed East. The road crosses over I 57 and continues east. From the center of the over-pass the site is 1 mile further East just past the first creek that you will come to. From here you can&#39;t miss it.<n>
1/22/99 18:42|Vancouver (Canada)|BC|Circle|2 seconds|white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05387.html|23|ndxe199901| white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 18:42 PST my mother let our two small dogs out into the back yard and was standing on back porch waiting for them to come back in.  She looked up at the sky and saw a white circle about the size of a small pea held at arm&#39;s length or one quarter size of a full moon.  She said it suddenly appeared in the North to Northwest sky and was visible for about 1.5 to 2 seconds as it sped toward the SSE sky and suddenly disappeared.  There was only the one object and the sky was partially obscured by a layer of cirrostratus cloud.  She called to me and I went out to look at the sky.  The object was gone by this time but I did note the cloud cover and that I was able to see a slightly fuller than crescent moon and some brighter stars through the thin cloud cover.  She said there was no trail behind the object and it didn&#39;t look like a fireball.  My mother is a retired store manager and I am a  librarian.  She informed me the following day that the new space station was apparently visible in the sky during the time she saw the object.  This brings up many questions. It moved from the NW horizon to the SE in under 2 seconds.  If it indeed was the space station she saw, is it capable of such speed?  Is it tumbling which would cause it to reflect the sun&#39;s light and then seem to disappear?   Is it&#39;s orbit in a NW to SE direction?   My mother feels that is what she saw--the new space station.  But I am not so sure.  About 2-3 minutes before she saw the object the was a loud rumble like a sonic boom.  It definitely was not thunder; the sky was basically clear and here on the west coast of British Columbia we get few thunderstorms mainly from April to early September.   Thank you for your time.<n>

The light was approximately 20-feet above the overpass, the size of a softball or volleyball traveling at what I estimate to be 60-70 mph. When I exited the off ramp 15-20 seconds after the sighting, I could not see the ball of light or anything that may have caused it, only normal car traffic.  It was still fairly dark (dawn) and the weather was cloudy and dry at the time of the sighting.  There had been light showers on and off as I drove to work.  Thats it!  I hope someone reported this.<n>

I told my friend to look, and then the object started to maneuver about the sky, going back and forth, stopping, and did a couple of half circles and we watched this go on for 15 minutes, and then cloud cover started to come in. It was hard to tell how far away it was but seemed like a great distance, and it moved about a foot in each direction (but the actual distance was much greater).<n>
1/20/99 20:35|Granada Hills|CA|Other|approx.2mins.|Myself and 3 others were in a car on the freeway when we saw a vertically long flying object moving slowly approximately 4 months ago.|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07723.html|26|ndxe199901| Myself and 3 others were in a car on the freeway when we saw a vertically long flying object moving slowly approximately 4 months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling to my fathers house with my friend and his mother when his mother started asking what the oddly shaped aircraft in the sky was. At first I ignored her and brushed it off as an airplane without looking out the window of the car for myself. It was when my firend looked out the window that he got my attention and i looked out the right window of the car. We were traveling northbound on the freeway at approx. 65 mph. The craft appeared to be traveling at a slow but not too slow pace, probably around 30-40 mph. Now here&#39;s the tricky part. It had a large disc at the top much like the radar discs on military airplanes, but then under the disc was a long cylinder, approx. 20 feet long. That cylinder coned-out and was joined by several slim tubes to another cylinder below it, this one no more than 10 feet long. It had a non-blinking white light directly on top (i saw this because it was quite a bit in front of us when i first saw it), and then 3 purple lights; one on the first cylinder, one on the connecting tubes and one on the very bottom of the lower cylinder. it was all white in color and it was flying very low or so it seemed. It couldn&#39;t have been more than 3 or 4 hundred feet off the ground. It was flying at a very slow pace and as we approached the point of intersection where we were to drive directly underneath the craft, while it passed over the freeway, it appeared to stop and hover just before crossing the freeway, and then out of nowhere it jetted off at a rate of about 80-90 mph. It was traveling much faster than it had previously been moving. It was out of sight within a matter of 10 or 15 seconds. Now you must forgive me for being so vague and approximate in my descriptions; it happened at night while i was in a moving car on the freeway and i was very tired at the time. I was fully concious at the time of the incident though. after it disappeared it was simply forgotten of and disregarded as nothing. i have not mentioned anything of this incident to anyone since it happened until! now. I saw your story on channel 7 eyewitness news last night and thought i would share my story with you and leave it to you to figure out what its worth.<n>

The red lights seemed very tiny but the white light that first caught our attention was huge.  It was larger than the landing light under a normal plane.  I came to a stop to observe it.  Then the lights turned to green and there seemed to be several around the outline of the wings.  About that time, it started in our direction.<n>

At first I thought it was a tower light or perhaps an airplane, but there were no lights where other tower lights would be.  The light did not move in the sky, but stayed in its position as would a star.  However, no other stars were visible as the sky was cloud-covered.  The ball of pulsating red light (about the size of a BB at arms length)just stayed with me for 40 to 45 minutes until, near Springfield, it seemed to have moved further south and become smaller.<n>

The bottom of the object had red and white lights alternately flashing. It was a cloucy night and the object was flying very low underneath the cloud cover.  I was too scared to pull over as I was the only vehicle in a basically cornfield expanse of land.  The object initially was flying northbound at a rather quick pace and then suddenly about 10 miles up the road (I was westbound) I saw the same object to my left traveling westbound still at a rather quick speed.  It was probably a mile or so away from my vehicle at all times.  I watched it travel westbound for the next 8 miles or so and then I lost it in the cloud cover.  I did not roll down my window to check for any noises. I observed no interferences with my radio at all.  I did not observe the object switching from northbound to westbound so I guess it could have been two different objects.  I am a professional and would never lie or exaggerate anything about something this scary.<n>

At first, we assumed that these reports resulted from the missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at approximately 1816 hrs. (PST) on this date.  However, many witnesses in Oregon express strong opposition to this theory, stating that what they saw did not look like a missile launch, and the object observed illuminated the ground with a beam, or cone (?), of light.  This sighting occurred 82 minutes after the missile launch.  Moreover, our theory is predicated on the assumption that a missile launched from near Los Angeles could be seen from northern Oregon.  That may not be correct.))<n>

After 20 to 30 seconds it &#34;popped&#34; (like fireworks) splitting into a momentary burst/shadow of in four sections, at which time the point of light (source) dissapearred and a very bright cone (and streak) of blue was left behind.  I thought this might have been a very sophisticated flair, except it moved SOOO slowly and shined light in a very distinct &#34;V&#34; behind it only.  Strangest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n>

Within 8 second a very strange hissy kind of hum enveloped the house from the south. It sort of sounded like a huge electrical transformer station approaching very close.  Three other adults in different rooms of the house saw the light and heard the sound.  It penetrated like a wave passing inside the house. The whole thing lasted about 15 seconds. It was late and I was in bed at the time. I do wish I had looked out of a north window to see what the heck it was. I don&#39;t know if this has anything to do with it, but my house sits on the 5 mile FAA marker for the Tumwater airport. Did you get any other reports around that night.  It definitely was strange and I had a very interesting dream that night. I have had many experiences with UFO&#39;s, but this was the most recent possibility. Thanks for the response.

It was a clear night. As we approached the top, I was pointing out some facts about certain stars I had recently learned, when from the right comes this huge thing. As I&#39;m pointing to the stars, and in the middle a sentence I move my pointed finger towards the object saying &#34;what the hell is that!!&#34; My friend starts laughing, which really annoyed me, and said he didn&#39;t know. It was huge, a triange or diamond shape, with glowing greenish light coming several round areas it. It seemed silent and moved slowly, gliding from west to east making a smooth rather sharp turn to the south and slowly fading into the dark reaches of the night sky. I referred to it as a big as a mother ship, since we were near the top of a large mountain, with a huge panoramic view, albeit starlit, under the infinite expanse of the sky, and this thing rolls in still seeming to be gigantic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was shaped like a &#34;K&#34; with two lights (almost like searchlights)(these lights also gave off enough light to tell its shape though it was not an auro or haze around the ship caused by some other souce) at the top and bottom of the the vertical line of the &#34;K&#34;.  We decided to turn around and see it again.  This was no more than 20 to 40 seconds afterward.  Upon turning around this craft had vanished. We scanned the horizon in all directions  and could not find any sign of the craft.   Also within 1 minute of our sighting this craft there was an extremely bad automobile accident approximately 2 miles southbound(?? towards solomons) of our location.  One of the observers (namely me) has believed for sometime that there are such things as UFO&#39;s and aliens (not nescessarily related but maybe) and the other observer thought both ideas were ludicrous though now he does believe in UFO&#39;s and thinks aliens may exist. ****IF YOWOULD LIKE TO YOU MAY CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER INFO.

We were coming off the highway into Contoocook and there were 3 lights in the sky.  Bigger than stars but not huge.  I noticed they were moving but they were moving erratically and separately and told my boyfriend to stop.  One would move up very quickly while another moved right or left and yet the other would go in a different direction.  They moved very, very, quickly.  No noise at all.  Nothing else in the sky was moving.  We sat and watched for quite a while.  They stayed in one area and just kept moving very quickly in all directions. These definitely were not military.  There is nothing that can move that quickly, that erratically nor switch direction that quickly.  It was amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My friend could not see the lights when I tried to point them out.  I watched for several seconds till they were out of my line of vision.  There were trees, buildings, etc in the way. Since I was in an enclosed car with other traffic sounds, I could not tell if there was any sound.  Later that evening while talking with another friend who lives on the 13th floor of apt building.  She interrupted me to ask if I had seen the lights. Evidently she had seen the same thing. She said they appeared to land and blink out.  They did not seem too far away, though I have a depth perception problem and can not really judge.  I called the radio station, and no one had reported any lights.  She later called and they said two other people had reported lights.<n>

I am writing this belated report on Sept 8th 2001.  (I will bring you all up-to-date in an other report for our more recent observations. But let me first tell you this... My wife and kids where taking a ride to go to dinner, we got on Rt 3 North from Exit 6, as was merging on to the highway I pointed out to my wife something in the sky, it looked like a star but is was moving, we then saw two fighter jets scrambling up there. This was over Plymouth Bay... I got off the highway and headed towards the bay and saw the jets again going north, so I turned around and headed up Rt 3A and thought it was all over because I am in a car not a plain so I cant chase anything.  So about 2mile I pull into the Charlie Horse Bar &amp; Grill. I pulled right up front because it look like there would be a wait, so to save time I just opened my door and looked up and WOW! No Sound, 4 Lights (3 white on each point one in the middle), Black Triangle shaped Craft Just over the oak trees aside the resraunt.  It freek me out, I stuck my head in the car and told my wife what is over us, but I did not want to scare my two kids 1 and 5 at the time.  My wife looked at me an told me &#34;I know....now shut (()) up!!&#34;  I was shocked at her attitude! She never talks like that.  I just got into the car and went to KFC and said nothing about it again to her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It caught my attention, so I watched it for a while. It had no apparant markings, and I recall it being dark grey in color. It was still light, and visibility was good except for scattered clouds. There were some clouds to the West of us. After the small plane circled for a few minutes, an object came out of the clouds. It was either the size of a fighter plane at about 1000 feet, or something larger much higher. My 7-year-old son who has very sharp eyes said it looked like a fighter plane to him, but I couldn&#39;t make out the exact shape. It didn&#39;t look like any fighter I was familiar with, but was roughly that shape. What was odd was that there were two glowing orange circles on the back of the object like it was a fighter jet on afterburners, but it was completely silent. It was not that far away nor that far up -- a fighter on afterburners sounds like a freight train. After the object came out of the clouds, the small plane stopped circling and they both headed off to the East. If it was a fighter on afterburners, it was moving much too slowly. I estimate it was going only about 2-3 times as fast as the small plane. It looked all the world to me like the small plane was waiting for the object, and then escorted it somewhere. An army base is in the approximate direction that the two craft were heading.<n>

It dissapeared behind a large cloud after two F-16&#39;s were racing towards it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a about 1300 hours and I was coming back from lunch. I was smoking my cigar in the shade of the building and I was by myself. After I noticed a very bright, metallic object just NE of my location.  The sun was high and behind me. The wind was blowing lightly toward the SW.  It was a beautiful day with occasional large fluffy clouds drifting by. As I watched the object, it seemed to be creeping up and away at one time, so I thought that it may be very far away at that point. Even though it appeared to be rather close.  Then it moved towards the towards the East. About 3 minutes after I noticed the object, two employees came out to have a smoke break.  I asked them what they thought. They were both retired from the military.  They said they didn&#39;t know what it was either.  After they finished their cigarettes, they went back inside but I stayed and watched because I had some cigar left anyway. As the object moved East, I tried to guage the speed by a fence at the end of the parking lot.  It took about a minute to go the distance between each of the fence posts (it is a high chain link fence with poles 10&#39; apart). After moving between 5 or 6 fence posts, a large cloud came drifting towards my location. At this point I lost sight of the object.  I waited to see if I could see it after the cloud moved.  I gave up after a few minutes and thought to myself, if it was something important, the local air force base would send a jet to check it out.  As I started to go inside, two jets, I&#39;m guessing F-16&#39;s, came flying by side by side heading in the direction of the object.  They both disappeard behind the cloud and I lost sight of them and the object as well.<n>

Then while sitting down i spotted a light source (round in shape)at an angle of 60 degrees from my vision into the sky.  It moved from left of the building where i work looking towards it to the centre where i was sittin in a matter of seconds.  Then i saw no light, and in about 3 sec, the light came back on but more to the right now from where the light stopped. Then after it just shooted up in the air past the clouds in a mater of seconds.  At the time of the sitting the light source was moving at tremendous speeds no aircraft could go faster or close to the speed what i had seen and there was no sound coming from the light source as well.  I know it was some kind of ufo cause it came down from the clouds then it shooted back up, light source stoped then appeared again.  The color of the light was clear. PS.

I saw a green ball of light similar to meteors I have witnessed in the military, however unlike the meteor I saw(which was large &amp; had a tail), this ball was low at about 9,000 feet, guessing by the high cloud cover. It was well below the clouds.  It flew due West from the East.  It was a clear bright ball flying faster than any aircraft I know of, but not as fast as a &#34;shooting star&#34;.   It didn’t have a tail or anything trailing it. &gt;From my viewpoint it was the size of a streetlight, as compared in contrast of a full moon. This ball was perfectly round and very bright green.  It didn’t make any turns before going out of view, it could have been a meteor but I seriously can’t believe it was.  It is also hard for me to believe it is something alien, but I would like to know what it is other than &#34;it’s just another meteor&#34;.<n>

The approach was from the north to the south.  I was watching a Boeing 737 on final when I saw a traffic signal green in color light directly over head.  The conditions were, light s/w winds, overcast sky.  The approaching aircraft were below the cloud base.  The light apeared to either be in the clouds or was bright enough to shine thru them (as a car head light would shine thru fog). The light was about the size of a pencil eraser and had difussed light around it about twice it&#39;s size.  I first observed the light at about 90 degrees above me and watched until about 30 degres to my front. The light was traveling on a 270 degree (west/true not magnetic) compass reading. The light did not fade out it just went out like a light would go out if you turned off a switch.<n>

Clouds were thick and low. It was dark. First I noticed a bright light shining through a small break in the clouds just north of my home which overlooks the water. I assumed it was a plane and gave it no further thought. Then I saw a second light of equal size east of the first light and a third light just north and inbetween the other two. The space between the two nearer lights, when I held up my hand, was four fist-widths. Each light was about the size of a full moon but appeared eliptical in shape, always keeping the same horizonatal axis. This triangle of lights was about 60 degrees above the horizon. My next thought was that it could be helicopters launching a search for a missing boat on Possession Sound, however the lights did not descend over the water. The lights rotated clockwise about every 20 seconds and with each rotation, all lights appeared to converge with the northern-most light. It was like a laser show, except there were no visible light beams. The lights were only white, and the pattern of motion was unvaried. I tried to spot the source through my binoculars, but could not see through the clouds. There was no sound. I scanned Possession Sound for boats but could see none. I went outside and checked many times, but the lights and the activity remained the same until 9:30 PM (21:30). At that time, the lights were further north at aproximately 45 degrees above the horizon. They were dimmer and appeared more distant. At 10:00 (22:00) the lights had disappeared.

When it slowed, I knew it wasn&#39;t a meteor, because meteor do not slow from and enormous speed and then curve toward the surface of the ground.  The event lasted app. 10 seconds or more and I lost sight of it because of a tree line to the west.

The circle appeared to be slighly south of my line of travel, and about twice as high in the sky as the section of the mountain range it was directly over. This area is known as bear caynon and the mountain ridge is at about 9,000ft ASL,  I would say the object was at approximently 18,000ft ASL. The sun was back lighting the mountains as it was rising, at first I thought it was a weather ballon, because we witness them all the time in this area of the sky in similar light conditions.  The only problem with this is the object simply disappeared, no movement, just poof, gone. I observed this area of the sky for another 45 minutes and never saw it again.<n>

My brothr saw it come out of the sky.  It was about the size of a football field and was about 30-50 miles away from where we were standing.  When I saw it, it was droping behind the trees.  It had a glossy wet looking surface.  When I saw it there were only 7 lights left, the rest had already droped behind the trees.  when my mom saw it. there were 8 lights.  The only thing in that direction is a lake. There were two planes in the area, but the lights on this were in a circular shape and just above the tree line.  It went down slowly(I think it landed).<n>

The object fell almost straight from the sky and dissapeared just prior to reaching the ground.  At first I thought it was a comet, but there was not a tail. The whole incident lasted only a few seconds. In addition to myself, my two sons witnessed the sighting. There was also an aircraft of some type, to the North, that should of had an eyeful of the object. I am a 33 year old male. My present position is a licensed wastewater treatment plant operator.

In the NW, I saw a blue-green fireball with a tail descending at a steep angle (on a clockface it would have fallen through 7:00).  It disappeared behind the hills above San Ramon Valley to the W and NW.  The object was the size of a large star.  With the arm outstretched and fingers on top and bottom of the tail, it would measure about 1 inch.  It&#39;s light was about the same brightness as planes flying overhead.  It was very visible though it was late dusk.  (It was only slightly smaller and much brighter than Hale-Bopp appeared in the bay area.)  My sense was that it was headed for the bay, which would have made it 13-17 miles away. I am a computer professional with no military nor pilot experience.<n>

It seemed so solidly held there in the air but I could not see any visible means of support.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to go see what it was for sure but I was concerned for the safety of my grandson.  So I went ahead and turned right (south) but kept my eye on the object for as long as I could.  I drove about a minute down the road and it was out of sight now.  I decided I had to go back and check it out.I turned around and went back.  It was gone,  I drove down the road and looked behind those trees and all around in the field etc.  It was not in the air, not on the ground, not anywhere that I could see.  It had disappeared.<n>

Some nights it appears to be much slower and more erratic in its trajectory although it has not been low enough to get a close look it is fairly obvious that it is not a airplane/jet for there is no sound at all and the manuvaers are so erratic that any normal aircraft pilot would have lost his flight privlages.

The family consists of two adults and three children ages 13, 12, and 8.  I, my wife, and my 12 year old son observed an unknown moving green light.  The strangeness of this sighting impressed all three of us, and I immediately dictated a few notes on our observation. The disc of light was larger than the pipoint of light usually seen from a star or meteor.  The visual angles subtended were similar to what one would see from a green stop light at a distance of about a quarter of a mile.  We viewed the object when looking out the left-side van windows while traveling at about 50 mph in an east-south-east direction.  Since the disc did not appear to chane size and moved in a left to right direction as we looked in the north-north-east direction, this lead to the perception that the object was moving roughly in the same direction as we were, but of course falling as well as moving forward.  Although we could entertain guesses as to distances and speeds, I don&#39;t believe there is any objective basis for doing so. The trajectory swept a path from a elevation angle of 30 degrees to an elevation angle of 10 degrees, while the azimuthal angle swept through approximately 20 degrees.  The visual duration was between 1 and 2 seconds.  Both my wife and my son reported the path as being curved downward.  The duration of the image was so short that I am not sure whether I perceived the path as a straight line or curved. The color was distinctively green, much like a stoplight green with not as much blue in it.  The sighting took place approximately a mile west of tyson&#39;S Corner.  The sky was partly cloudy and although some stars and airplane lights could be seen, there were none in the vicinity of the unknown object sighted. I would be interested in hearing if there were any other simultaneous sightings in this area.<n>

I noticed my shadow on the snow like there was a quick flash of light. I looked up to the basically clear sky and saw a blue-green fireball with a slight tail moving N to S very quick. I don&#39;t think it was a shooting star because it was too low. No noise. No arc like a fire work. Completely straight line. It was about at a 45 degree angle from me and about the length of a pinky finger at arm&#39;s length. Entire event from flashing to light extinguishing was about 1.5 seconds. I saw it for over .5 sec before it extinguished. It seemed close. I dont think it was any craft but probably a meteor, just thought you&#39;d be interested. I am a 21 yr old college senior.<n>

This was repeated 3-4 times then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 17:45 on January 10, 1999, I was parked on Lake Lewisville just north of Dallas looking west. Just after sunset, there was a lot of air traffic as usual (I do this very often) and two high flying jets flying straight with long tails from southeast to northwest. These continued on their path for the full event. Just above the horizon at about 3 degrees, I noticed what I thought was another airplane with an orange reflective tail moving from northwest to the southeast. Looking at the map and from my previous experience, this craft was flying over Flower Mound and disappeared just north of DFW Airport. This one was very different from the other two. I got out my binoculars and followed it across the sky for about 15 minutes. It began zigzaging to the east and then back on course. During the zigzag, the tail got much larger and brighter. Then suddenly, during the last five minutes I saw it, a bright white light &#34;jumped&#34; in front of the tail (at least a few hundred feet or more) with the tail becoming much shorter. The light jumped in front of a rapidly dissipating tail at least 3-4 times and then it was just a light which suddenly disappeared. This event was not at any angle -- horizontal though it rose a bit as it got closer.<n>

Then another (popped on?)about 3 inches behind it. It was not an airplane because I did not see wings. It could have been a satellite though it was curious that there would be two satellites fairly close together. It could also have been balloons, but they seemed to move in a very straight line and I would think balloons would move more randomly. I saw them out my window and by the time I got up and got dressed to go outside I could not find them. Professionally I am an administrative assistant, and a member of MUFON.<n>

Unfortunate because I understand a lady may have seen what I heard on the same night--tape played on Art Bell Sunday night.  She was one ridge to the west in Paradise.  We have had other instances of ufo here too.  Had a bright square shaped light in the garden area a year ago--didn&#39;t go out to investigate it either--both my wife and I saw it.<n>

I was walking home from work at around 9:40 pm EST Melbourne Australia time. I was walking up Swanston Street toward the train station and an unidentifed object streaked accross the sky. It was travelling easterly and was like a large yellow ball of flame with a bright blue centre and had a yellow streak of light behind it.  It was simply awsome and I have never seen anything like it. No sound was emitted. I have seen falling stars before, but nothing like this. This thing was comparatively huge and had a much lower trajectory.The object was visible for about 5 seconds, heading in an easterly direction. I just happend to mention it to a work college the next day, and amazingly he saw the same object but at a totally different location about 20 miles away.  He claimed he also saw its shape after it had burned out its flame and its light grey color. This is the most bizzare observation of a UFO type object I have ever seen.

The motion stopped for a few moments as the object hovered and glowed dimly pink and then accelerted at an astonishing rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood on the beach with my wife watching the stars and occasional planes and helicopters move across the sky over the western Florida coastline and the Gulf of Mexico.  I saw a distant object, approximately 40-50 miles away pulsing from bright white to red to blue randomly and exclusively.  I pointed the object out to my wife, who then pointed it out to another couple walking on the beach.  From my perspective, the object first appeared due west of my location and was moving toward the coast south of me.  Over the next few minutes the object&#39;s flight path looked like the pattern of angles that can be found on the side of a car key.  The object occasionally doubled back and retraced its steps.  When the object was directly south of me (possibly just west of Ft.Myers over the Gulf) it hovered in place for a few moments at what looked like about 20,000 feet, held a red color that slowly faded to a dim pink, and then accelerated faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  It took the object approximately 350 milliseconds to move from its hovering perch about 15 degrees above the southern sky through a path directly over my head toward the north until it faded away.  From my perspective, the acceleration path was a straight line that went between Orion and the Seven Sisters, fading in the vicinity of Polaris.  I witnessed a similar event the next night at midnight.  The only other time in my life I saw anything remotely similar to this was in late April, 1996 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  The 1996 event was also witnessed by a truck driver traveling I-70 between St. Louis and Kansas City.  Perhaps at some point I&#39;ll take the time to write a summary of this one as well.  These are the only unexplainable aerospace events I have ever witnessed.<n>

It stayed motionless for around 2 minutes, then started to move from east to the south, and quickly dissapeared.  Approx. 2-3 minutes later, the same object appeared again, and agian in the same place, and in almost the same fashion, except within a shorter timespan, moved the the south and &#34;collapsed into itself,&#34; as my father put it.<n>

While working outside close to the border on the U.S. side,  I observed a white flash traveling from the east to west over the southern hills of Tijuana.  It looked similar to a meteor.  Altough, it stopped in the shape of a rectangle with round corners.  It had a bright green color emiting from it, but it was also &#34;fuzzy&#34; looking.  Then after about a second, it traveled at an angle vertically and to the east back into a white flash. It was very interesting, because I listen to Art Bell and a listener called stating that there was UFO activity in the skies over Tijuana.  I disproved that statement due to the fact I work outside near Tijuana and I hadn&#39;t seen a thing.  Well, now I think I believe it. I would rather not be exact on what I do or my background.  I am a college graduate, military veteran, and a pilot.<n>

At the same time my husband noticed a bright flash that lighted up the whole back yard; he shrugged it off too.  Then we both felt that rummbling feeling that you feel with a earth quake and then a big boom like an explosion of some kind.  It was so loud  it literally shook the house, I yelled; what was that and we looked out the window thinking one of our neighbors houses had blown up!  About 11:05 PM the same night my neighbor called and said his daughter called him with a report on the radio that a &#34;Meteor&#34; just crashed at mile 143 on the Parks Hwy. (Heading North);  I called some friends in Eagle River, AK. (35 miles from us) and they seen the Flash and felt the Boom Too!  My daughter called me and she had just heard on the radio that the State Troopers wanted anyone that could pin-point the impact area to please call them and that they wanted to reasure people that it was not a missle!  That&#39;s about it; we&#39;re trying to get some information about it now and no one seems to know anything and it is Now Jan.9,1999 at 9:00AM<n>

Could not see shape because of high fog.  Live in canyon and have observed every typ of craft from ultra lights to KC-130s and to compare, this was much larger. There seemed to be lights above the fog but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 20:30 hours I heard a very loud noise ( actually felt the vibration before I heard it) I went out on our elevated deck that runs around the 2nd story of our house.  I could not actually see the object but could tell it was very large and moving slow for an aircraft. Our house is at about 850&#39; elevation in the low foothills of the Sierra Navada mountains and the high fog was at about 1000&#39; feet.  The object was above or in the fog layer.  What is strange was the sound of the (enginges?) It was more like a vibrating pulse that vibrated everything in the house. I have observed numerous aircraft over the house, some quite close fighting fires where they were dumping water on the house and diving on fires near my fense line. Every type of craft from ultra lights to H204s and H206s, Hiller/soloys, Bell 1Bs, high flying passenger jet and low flying tankers and I have never heard anything like this. My exact position is:  37deg. 04.670min N. and 119deg. 50.241min. W. I am an amateur radio operator and did not observe any abnormal radio emmissions befor ar after the event and I also had a scanner on listening to Fresno/Yosemite international airport tower and heard no unusual traffic from the controllers. At my point of observation I was faceing SW and the object passed about 1/2 to 3/4 mile in front of me (SW) traveling from NW to SE. As I said I could not actually see it but only scence lights and tell the sound was moving and the area seemed to equal about 8-10 full moon diameters long and maybe 3 full moon diameters wide at the center. It took 2-3 min. to move through the area. I take off my watch at the end of the work day Fridays and don&#39;t put it on till Monday morning so the time I gave is only approx. After the event I stayed outside for a while walking around the hills trying to figure out what it was because, unlike low flying aircraft this thing set off every coyote for 5 miles around and they would not shut up for about 20 min. after it was gone. After i came back into the house I messed around on 2 meters for a while to see if any body else in the area heard or saw anything unusual but nobody had but then all caontacts were over 20 miles away. About 22:00 I remembered there was a web site to report  UFOs so I hunted up the site and here I am.  I don&#39;t know that this qualifies as a UFO but I am hoping maybe someone else saw or heard this also and can give a hint at what is was. I am also an amateur astronomer and cannot believe how disorganized I was on this observation, if you can call it that. That is about all I can say, except it shook me up quite a bit. Thanks, ((name deleted))<n>

The airport at Chico is used for pratice approaches by aircraft from Beale AFB for the U-2 and SRC71.  The Arrora replacement for the SRC71 is currently being hangered at Beale for short periods of time, in training situations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not meant to downgrade the observation of the Lady from Paradise,  but I think it is important to note that Beale has a ready crew of ground personnel and equipment for Chico and the runway is capable of taking large aircraft.  I have 26 years of experience in the distant early warning system, tower and radar approach controll and carrier approach control and have observed UFO activity as early as 1957 over the North Atlantic and reported same to NORAD by single sideband direct communications.  I have observed many &#34;large military&#34; aircraft on pratice approach to Chico since 1979 and am aware that it is a designated dispersal point for certain types during national emergency situations.  There are old military silo launch sites in the Chico vicinity and some may still be active.  Happy hunting from one who knows first hand that you are not on a wild goose chase.<n>

A mile further observed a 2nd separate, independent lite. The 2nd lite split and became two lites moving together, with no sound I could hear. The 1st lite remained constant. Pulled over and stopped again, and the 2nd lites turned and became three lites in a row with the  middle one flashing. It turned more and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape. Then the object moved behind the hill I was parked by. I continued to drive up the mtn, and observed the 2nd lite occasionally through the trees. I stopped a third time on top of the mountain when I could see the 2nd lites again. It made a deep rumbling sound and was in a diamond shape with a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. It moved to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 19:15, while driving N on Hwy 70 at the Hwy 191 exit to Paradise, I observed a flashing white lite, brighter and bigger (maybe 6 times bigger than the surrounding stars), in the sky above Paradise. I looked at the digital clock in the car. About one mile further, I saw a 2nd lite NE of the 1st. At first I thought it might have been a reflection in the windows, so I pulled over, stopped  the engine, and rolled down the window. It was a dark clear cold nite. The 1st lite was still constant in the same place in the northern sky above Paradise. The 2nd lite split into two lites, fairly horizonal in the sky. There was no sound. I proceeded to drive NNE on Hwy 70, sighting both the 1st and 2nd lites the whole time, and turned W on Pentz Rd. Here, (4.8 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff) I pulled over a second time, turned off the engine, viewed the 1st lite in the same place in the sky, now left of my position, constantly flashing on and off. The 2nd lite seemed to turn and the left lite split into two, making three lites in a row with the middle one flashing. It continued to turn, while hovering in the same place, and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape, with the middle flashing lite of the first three slightly ahead of the other two. It was now 19:25, I was parked facing WNW and was viewing the lites by ducking my head a little and looking out and up of the passenger side front windowshield to the N. I held up my hand, and the four lites, if they were at the outside corners of an object, would make the object about as long as my thumb (maybe 1.5 inches). The object then moved behind the little hill I was parked beside. I continued W on Pentz Rd, nearly driving off the road to keep the object in site! Pentz Rd then turns and heads NE, up the mtn. I lost sight of both the 1st and 2nd lites at times as the road climbs the mtn. On top of the mtn on Pentz Rd, (at 6.2 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff on Hwy 70) I again sighted the 2nd object. I stopped the car (third time), turned off the engine, and rolled down the window. The car was facing N, and the object was in the sky to the W of me traveling in a S direct! ion. Now I could hear the wind in the trees and another deeper rumbling sound that seemed to be coming from the object. It was about three inches wide in the sky and there was a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. I viewed it for perhaps three minutes before it went behind the trees. It was now 19:40  and I continued on my way home to Magalia. On Jan. 9th, my husband and I traveled the route again at the same time as the sightings on Jan. 8th, and took the mileage readings. Unfortunately, there was a pea-soup fog in the valley, so at the first two places I stopped we could not view  the sky.<n>

When I heard you playing the sighting description from the night before in Northern California I had an instant recall from the night before(FRI EVE). While not actually seeing anything, at about the time or earlier that the reportee was witnessing the event, I was made gradually aware of a very peculiar whirling/humming/vibrational sound. It came up on me slowly, was presant for about 20 seconds and gradually left. I was busy at my computer and opted not to get up and look. Now I regret that decision as perhaps I would have shared in a very interesting sight.<n>

Oily substance emited from craft and the stars behind the oily substance became greatly magnified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> January 8, 1983	6 PM I was on a long flight from Paris, France to Los Angeles on a Pan Am Clipper Class 747.  The flight took the polar route over Canada, Seattle, Portland, and the Pacific coast.  Looking out the window, I could see the stars shining brightly in the early evening skies as I was looking out at the constellation Orion. I could even see what I initially thought was the planet Jupiter glowing orange in the distance.  I then began to think that it could not be Jupiter, because it was not in this part of the sky.  It must be something else.  Sure enough, the object was moving along side of the plane.  A big orange ball!.  Judging from the time remaining for us to land, we were somewhere over Portland, Oregon.   The object was moving from right to left and then right again.  I then saw beneath it a stream of fluid along its path.  Looking through the fluid, I could see the stars behind it were greatly magnified. After about ten minutes of this, I decided to try and take a picture of this object.  But since I had only a cheap instamatic camera and it being night, I knew that the picture would not come out.  But I took the picture anyway. Soon thereafter, the object came straight towards our plane and I could sense the plane turning aggressively as if to avoid something.  The object disappeared behind the plane’s tail and I never saw it again.<n>

I did not witness the event of maybe 10 minutes but I do have access to the video made. If you are a reliable reporting agency that can be verified I can put you in touch with the person that has the original 8mm video and witnessed the event. They are concerned about releasing info to military organization. I do not give out my address or phone to anyone. You can contact me via e-mail. This is a pretty good quality video for taken by amateur at night. Definitely worth seeing. It appears to have landed. Area behind this subdivision is isolated with a lake and no development.<n>

I assumed it to be an satelite as it did not have 2 sets of lights. i then noticed a second identical light to the left-behind the first light. they were moving at normal air-speed for a small aircraft, i thought this strange as i have been in the military and jets that fly in such formation are very noisy at such altitudes(approximate same as for airplanes arriving to the Williamsport/Lycoming Airport.  I didn&#39;t hear any sounds.  Then i heard a small aircraft and within a few seconds did see a small aircraft heading east toward the airport.  As i watched the &#34;tandem&#34; lights they seemed to have a light pattern: first a whitish-yellow, then a blueish slightly green, and then red.  I have also had instruction in astronomy and have utilized several college observatories.  I have never seen two satelites(sp?) orbit in such fashion. or at such low altitudes.  And once the small aircraft dissappeared from veiw i no longer heard a sound, but still saw the lights.  The lights appeared to accelerate slightly and then the front light flashed a &#34;beam-kind of like you would see lightning between clouds&#34;.  This did not light up the entire sky, but slightly illuminated the area directly around the 2 objects/lights.  within about 5-10 seconds the light to the rear &#34;sent&#34; the same type of &#34;beam&#34; back to the first object. My attention was distracted to the west and i thought i saw a shooting star.. it went directly towards the point where the 2 objects were located.  Those 2 objects began to show a change in behavior.  Their lights got brighter/stronger..the item to the rear picked up speed and seemed to run into the first the flashing of the lights continued(no beams, just the white,green, red) Then another shooting white light came straight down to again seem to come to a target or convergence area.  Another appeared coming from the Wilkes-barre/Scranton area. My next thought was that of a meteor shower, but i know there aren&#39;t any right now. Then all of the white lights stopped all logical behavior and seemed to move around. More erratically than you would see from a spotlight..like when a child plays with a 4TH of July sparkler and swirls it around in front and you can see the tip glowing.... At this point there were at least 5 lights in the sky.  I could no longer rationalize anything reasonable that i could blame this on...i wanted to verify with the airport . I left the window and called the Williamsport airport, but no answer. i called a delta 800 line...the reservations person took a bit of information and told me that i needed to hang up and call 911 and make a report, and again asked me to please do so right away. I called 911 embarrased.  I am an educated person, but this was too weird.  I wanted some reasonable explanation of the events.  I went back later to look again(took me a while to get up the courage..the incident really seemed to get me in the gut..but there was nothing.  I live in Williamsport on edwin street there is a hospital--Williamsport hospital about 5 blocks directly north of my home. The activity appeared to take place directly over the hospital. It was way too low for a satelite(sp?) but was at a higher altitude than the small aircraft that passed through the area. I have never seen anything like it in my life.  it was very unnerving. Please feel free to contact me for any additional information.  I was unaware that anyone would even call me about this.  I had already received a phone call from Stan Gordon.  I was a bit unnerved by the second phone call from Peter.  My apologies for any rudeness.  I keep private to myself and was not prepared to be getting calls asking me questions.  Again, feel free to call or e-mail me.  I would like to find out what I saw.  I am very bothered by the incident.  Respectfully, Pamela Gill<n>

As other aircraft flew above, objects seemed much higher and distant.... seemed to be at a altitude that high flying jets take. No sound, or exhaust. Seemed to keep same shape..but angle of objects changed as they began to excel gradually in speed and continue to climb at an angle until fading out of sight. Witnesses are professional middle &amp; late aged. One did not know what to make of it. The other thought it might be &#34;bats&#34;. At first I thought so to, however focusing on the objects for about 30 seconds and looking at the skyline and other aircraft in the area, they seem to be much higher than any bat I ever saw. Also, the objects had smooth movement throughout the event. Was hard to focus continuously due to work activities for the duration the objects appeared in the sky. My best guess at this point is military stealth type aircraft, or some type of bird???.<n>

One went north, the second one went northwest, and the third headed west, during and after we saw military jets flying in the same airspace, one headed south and the other headed west. Earlier in the evening, and all evening there had been a noticeable increase in aircraft activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working as an outside security guard at the Barona indian reseervation on the night of the sixth of January I noticed earlier in the evening at around 6:30 p.m. shortly after I began my shift that there was increased aircraft activity in the airspace over that region of Southern California. There were military jets, heliocopters, and commuter planes. Later in the evening at 9:30 another guard that I was standing with saw the first white flashing strobe-like craft appear overhead traversing at a tremendous speed zig-zaging across the night sky; thats when he told me of it and I looked up startled at a white flashing craft zigzaging across the sky making pin-point moves seemingly defying the laws of movement, then at about 20 seconds into that another craft appeared but not overhead it was moving around up and down strait ahead north of us, then as suddenly as that had appeared a thrid one appeared just a little west of the second one. They all danced around the sky in strobelike fashion for around another minute, during which a military jet, with red and green lights on the wing tips, going at a fairly normal speed, which helped to compare speeds of the crafts, crossed the sky heading south. Then as suddenly as they had appeared the third one headed west, the second one headed northwest and the first one was still visible heading north and went out of range at around 9:34 p.m. Just as the first one was getting out of range we  saw another military jet heading south and then veering west. That was the first time I have ever witnessed such a craft going through space at such tremendous speeds, I would guess they must have been going in the thousands of miles per hour based on the time it took them to go from directly overhead to a point north of us in only around ten seconds time. This was much faster then conventional aircraft I have seen cross the same distance in time.<n>

I saw a large white circular object shoot across the sky in a south east direction. It lasted for only a few seconds.  I thought it might be an airplane but there were no other lights with it.  It looked much larger than any meteor showers I&#39;ve seen before.  It was about 3-4 times larger than the stars in the background and much brighter.<n>

It was travelling from NW to SE approximately 500 feet over Lake Union. The Space needle was visible above and behind the object. I was driving south on Interstate 5 near the center of the Ship Canal bridge. I was travelling at 60 mph and the object was travelling at approximately 75 mph. Its trajectory was at a slightly downward angle and I got the immpression it would soon strike the roadway some distance ahead. It disapeared instantaneously. The object was forest green in color and teardrop with a long tail. it was lighter in the center. The answer to all the following questions is &#34;no&#34;.<n>

Unusual shade of green.  Object below fairly high broken overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 0631 Hrs PST today, as I was traveling south on I-5 (in the Shoreline area), I observed a single very bright light green colored object traverse about 40 degrees of the sky.  The object  became visible to me as it came out from behind the roof of my car and hence became visible through the windshield.  It was traveling southward at what appeared to be a straight, downward course.  A rough estimate would be 20-30 deg below the horizontal. This clear very bight object moved quite fast, but slower than meteors I&#39;ve observed in the past.  neither have I seen anything quite this shade of green, although I have seen green fireballs or meteors before.  A fairly high broken overcast was made obvious by the Moon, and I believe this green object to have been below that overcast.  I did observe the normal air traffic in the sky such as airliners approaching Sea-Tac and traffic helicopter, etc.  These all were below the overcast.  When the green light from the object went out, it went out as often described: &#34;like a lightbulb being turned off.&#34; The things that distinguish this sighting in my mind are the clarity and exceptional brightness of the light from this object, the fact that it did not appear as a &#39;streak&#39; as other meteors I have seen did, but appeared as a clear, very bright object  (no discernable diameter), and that it seemingly was quite close tot he ground, - a couple of thousand feet at the most I would guess, (based on the cloud cover) and the sense was that it was quite lower than that.  And that it did not &#34;smear&#34; in my vision, but remained a clear single source of light with no trail, and that it moved at a speed that I preceived to be faster than aircraft, but slower than other meteors I&#39;ve observed. While I expect that what I saw was a meteor, and believe what I saw to be within the normal range of behaviors for such objects, it was nonetheless an unusual sight.<n>

1/4/99 21:50|Stillwater|NY|Changing|16 minutes|Three low,silent craft hovering,looping over each other,flaring huge,bright,then fly head-on near-collision course.Videotaped|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07673.html|118|ndxe199901| Three low,silent craft hovering,looping over each other,flaring huge,bright,then fly head-on near-collision course.Videotaped<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving on Lake Avenue in Stillwater I and another witness saw a brightly lit silent craft hovering, then moving very slowly just over the trees. I pulled my car over and began videotaping. It was lit from underneath, an intense yellow-orange solid light, round or oval, and with a smaller light above sometimes visible revealing a dark unlit mass above the light.                                                   I drove a little further to get a view unobstructed by the bare tree branches,then drove again to get closer. I knew I was close to Flike Road where I had videotaped a dramatic sighting on December 18th,and it was a safer road to stop on,so I sped there.                            Just as I turned the corner we saw the craft heading slowly away from us,and loop directly over another similar craft. The higher craft&#39;s bright light showed more clearly an unlit upper section of the craft that passed beneath. This maneuver brought them dangerously close to each other,and the lower craft&#39;s altitude was less than fifty feet, the other not much higher. The one craft was so low, lower than the tops of trees it passed behind, I thought it may have been on the ground, or possibly coming up from the nearby Hudson River. I pulled a little closer. One craft seemed to change into a flat triangle with multiple warm lights and traveled more quickly, moving off to the west. I believe that these craft can sit upright to hover and move very slowly, like a rocket does when lifting off. Instead of a rocket engine it seems to be balanced over a glowing globe which could be its source of lift or propulsion. I think these craft can lower themselves from upright to a horizontal attitude, which reveals them to be triangular or near triangular with a slightly rounded back end. They travel faster in a more direct line in this position. However, it&#39;s the nose of the triangle that seems to be the bright round light, which leads me to think that when they sit upright (or at least at a 45 degree angle) t! hey may be sitting on the nose rather than the back end. As the one passed behind the trees there was a second smaller light visible above the main light but at an angle, resembling a tipped cone or party hat drifting slowly sideways. It could also be sitting upright on its nose but with the third point unlit or unseen from my vantage point. Then, a third craft rose up from the trees to the right, across a field. It seemed triangular, brightly lit underneath, casting a diffuse beam of light before it. It traveled east towards the remaining craft and as they got closer they, too, looped one over the other. It was a strange, silent aerobatic maneuver, but graceful. To see it performed twice, minutes apart, and involving three different craft, was startling. The craft were all drifting to the south, so I drove to follow, losing sight of them for a few minutes.I pause the tape. When I turned the corner onto George Thompson Road I saw one hovering over a cornfield and began filming again. As soon as I turned on my hazard lights and got out of the car it bagan to flare incredibly brightly, like a yellow-orange flame with an aura around it, like it was burning, on the videotape it seems more white than it did to the naked eye. It also seemed to get much bigger,as large as the moon, and totally round. It was larger and brighter than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the night sky besides a full moon. It may have come quite close to us, and I&#39;m a little concerned about that, I&#39;ve heard accounts of UFO witnesses being affected by radiation. To some that may sound a little far-fetched, but I guarantee you&#39;d feel the same if you were there with us. After a minute it started to move away from us, and then was clearly a flat triangular craft. As I continued filming it travel west over Route 67, we saw a second tria! ngle come into view going east. They were on a collision course,one was higher than the other and they even adjusted their altitudes to head right for one another, nose to nose. I expected one to veer off as they got closer but they didn&#39;t,they came closer than the width of either craft, literally feet from colliding head-on. We both thought they had collided until they passed each other. It was unbelievable, and I was thrilled to have this, any of this really, on videotape.Then the east bound craft turned around to follow the other and they flew out of our sight. I have sent a copy of this tape to Mr. Davenport and the NUFORC in Seattle.<n>

I saw an object with two red lights and one green light.  These lights were not flashing.  It was traveling NE paralell to Interstate 5.  It passed overhead.  While viewing it I could see no stars between the lights. Only a large dark triangular shape.  I drove my car NE to a friends home and continued to view the object traveling slowly over Redding.  It veried West toward Mt Bally or Baldy.  At my fiends home it was still visable. She and her neighbors came out and viewed it with binoculars. Our internet services also locked up at about the same time. I could not get on the internet for over two hrs.  It was 8:24PM PST when it went over me.  It was larger then the full moon. I heard no sound from the object. As it went west I saw an amber light or glow also. At no time did any lights blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a Genealogical Researcher and homemaker.

Jan. 4, 1999, my husband and I were returning home from the grocery store.  Just as we were about to pull into the driveway, I asked him to stop and look at a &#34;star&#34; that seemed to be flashing.  Once he had stopped the car, we could tell that the object wasn&#39;t flashing, but were lights that were changing colors.  We got our binoculars (we had just sold our telescope), and could see a circular object with four different lights on it: blue, green, red, and either orange or yellow.  Thinking that our friends may have a telescope, we called them to say we were coming over.  On our way over, my husband asked me to keep my eye on the objects, and that is when I noticed another one.  It was the same distance up in the sky, but seemed to be farther away because it was not as brilliant.  They were probably a mile or two apart.  When we got to our friend&#39;s house they came outside to look and saw exactly the same thing.  The brightest of the objects was slightly below the &#34;little dipper&#34; and lined up with one side of it.  The objects were not flying, but maybe hovering.  It was hard to tell because of the distance.  We all watched them for a while and went inside because it was cold.  We checked on them periodically throughout the night and they never moved, even though the &#34;little dipper&#34; did because of the Earth&#39;s rotation.  The next morning, Icould faintly see one of them, but it was much harder to see the lights because of the sunlight.  Later that afternoon, they were both gone.  The witnesses included myself, a college student on the Dean&#39;s List, my husband, a drafting instructor at a college, and our friend&#39;s who are a housewife and a computer programmer.  I also noticed a plane (not a commercial jet) fly very close to the brightest object about 30 minutes after I first spotted it.<n>

1/3/99 08:45|Bellevue|WA|Light|4-5 min.|Orange light seen in Northeast sky moving slowly upward, then stopping and then moving to right (south) - approx altitude 25,000 feet|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07629.html|123|ndxe199901| Orange light seen in Northeast sky moving slowly upward, then stopping and then moving to right (south) - approx altitude 25,000 feet<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I walked out our front door toward our car and I immediately noticed a bright orange light to the right and slightly downward from the moon in the Northeastern sky. The unusual color caused us to watch closely as it moved slowly upward, stopped for about 45 seconds, and then moved slowly to right (south). There was cloud cover which had clear areas. The light appeared to be above the clouds. At first we assumed it was a plane or helicopter, but the movement of the light was not consistent as we would expect of an airplane and the orange color seemed unusual. It moved to the right (south) until it was directly eastward from us. Although the brightness had been steady at first, at this point it seemed to wax and wane although not necessarily in correlation with the breaks in the clouds. The light then disappeared and although we watched for it for several more minutes it did not appear again. Several times I thought I saw a smaller white light leave the orange light going in a southerly direction for a short distance although it was very dim because of the distance. There was never any sound that we could associate with the light as might be expected in the case of a jet passing overhead. Shortly after the light disappeared, a small light plane passed over coming from the north and flying toward the area where the light had disappeared. This may have been entirely coincidental as we do have fairly regular air traffic flying overhead.<n>

SORRY!!!  now about myself.  i&#39;m the youngest child of a retired air force chief master seargent and his background was briefly described above.  i have been unemployed since January 1998 when i decided not to return to work after having my son in september 1997.  i worked as a customer service representative for a medical foundation in our area for approxiamately 2 years before deciding to quit.  i&#39;m married to a truck driver.  there is one other thing.  i don&#39;t know if you have heard of it but we have a large radar dish out on base called &#34;PAVE PAWS&#34;.  my understanding is that it is the missile warning radar for the western hemishphere.  i&#39;m sure if it was possible it would have picked up the &#34;blip&#34;.  also, one night around the time we attacked iraq, i think it was a couple of nights before, i realized that Beale was, what my dad calls, staging.  basically that means that they were flying aircraft out of Beale to wherever, probably Travis A.F.B., in preparation for the possibili! ty of attack.  but, on the night that i saw the ufo, i didn&#39;t see any planes go up.  i thought that interesting and is probably one of the main reasons i didn&#39;t tell anyone until today.  my dad thinks its aurora.  he has no real way of knowing that i know.  hope this was enough.<n>

I looked up at a plane flying past and a small light dot in the sky caught my eye. I asked my friend whether he could see what i was seeing and it took some time before he confirmed that he could see what i saw. We stood there for 20 seconds and we watched it move in a sharp parabolic path and then resume a straight direction as if it were turning on to a course. I got very exited and i asked my friend whether he had a pair of binoculars and he said yes and ran to get them from inside his house. Once he got out i still had my eye on this faint object. At the beginning of the sighting it was bright and then later it started getting darker as it moved over away from us towards the distant horizon in a diagonal motion. I managed to aim the binoculars at the light dot by using one eye to focus on the light dot and the other eye to search through one of the binocular lenses. Next, I saw the most remarkable sight that almost sent me into tears from exitement. I saw the little dot clearly in my binoculars and obviously it was much larger due to the binoculars&#39; magnification. It still was a light dot though but a bit larger and no real distinct features were seen. Further on through the sighting, I kept focusing on the light dot as it moved and then i lost sight of it due to myself shaking from the cold. I managed to regain the sight of the light dot but i also managed to gain sight of something even more astounding that i cannot comprehend clearly. The light continued on but it &#34;met up&#34; with a larger cigar shaped craft that was around 12 times the size of this light dot. I could see the whole craft and it was truly enormous compared to the light dot. The dot then moved towards this huge craft and went up very close to the cigar shaped craft and stayed really close for about 30 seconds and then started shining brighter and became a bit larger and move perpendicular to the cigar shaped crafts hull ! or fusel age. It moved away to the left in my point of view and i felt heart broken to have to be able to choose which craft to observe since they both were increasing their distance from each other. I decided to look at the light dot and it was bright for a short period of time before resuming to a darker shade like the shade observed before the approach of the cigar craft. I was describing everything that i was seeing to my friend who was standing next to me and asking what was happening. Once the craft was some distance away from the cigar shaped craft (I presume) then it started travelling faster and faster until i could hardly keep up with the binoculars. It kept going faster and became darker and darker and dissappereared into black. I tryed refocusing back on to the cigar shaped craft but i could not find it in the night sky. I knew that i was viewing all of this near the horizon but it was up in the sky, very high up. I was shaken because of the sight that i encountered and I till today remember it very clearly. It remains one of the greatest sights that i have ever seen in my life. I have sighted similar lights when i was out on holidays but i never saw such variations in movement and interaction with other lights in the sky. I currently go out in summer on hoilday to the country just to dedicate time into viewing the lights and/or even greater observations.<n>

I thought it was a meteor, but there was no trail and it moved about half the speed of the hundreds of meteors I have seen, but much too fast to be an airplane and made NO SOUND. The object emmited two bright flashes from the bottom portion and continued roughly 3/4 of the way across the lake on a very slight downward path, where it blinked out at about 1300 ft AGL.

1/1/99 21:00|Cheaha Mountain|AL|Triangle|40 min.|I saw it hovering in the air and it chased me down a field, eye level to my driver side window.The field was right next to the road.|12/16/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11222.html|133|ndxe199901| I saw it hovering in the air and it chased me down a field, eye level to my driver side window.The field was right next to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my boyfriend were going down the road and we saw a strange object come across the road up in the air.I had never seen anything like it before in all my life.It was triangle shape with red and green circular lights flashing all the way around it.We kept on going, but we kept seeing it in the sky as I took him home.When we got to his house we were sitting in the car while he finished his cigarette.We saw it fly around his house just treetop level twice while we sat there, it was like it was waiting on me to leave.And when I say fly, I mean it zoomed (whipped) around his house.I was scared to leave but I had to go home.As I was going down the mountain I saw it coming across the road in the sky treetop level.After I got to the bottom of the mountain I saw it hovering in a field right next to the road.I didn&#39;t know whether to go straight or turn.The field was between both roads.I turned right and stopped for one second to just look to see what in the world it was then I sped away.It looked to be only 10 feet of the ground because I could see it eye level out of my drivers side window.It was chasing me down that field.I was fixing to stop at an acquaintance house but another car came from the other direction and it went across the road behind some trees and I didn&#39;t see it again.I haven&#39;t seen it since but i&#39;ll never forget.<n>

You can see aircraft from along way off sitting in the sky of which they look as if they are not moving.  You can also see satellites moving slowly between the stars).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to spot a satellite when I saw a circular object the size of a meteorite moving (at the height and speed of a meteorite, but with no tail, which meteorites usually have) from right to left across the sky.  Towards the direction of where the sun had set earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects brightness increased and then suddenly it changed direction 180 degrees, near instantly and accelerated away, which the light of the object decreased and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was reports the next day to the local radio station of people seeing weird lights that night in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw at first what appeared to be 3 planes over the horizon East of me, this being very strange to me because of the larger number than normal planes in that area. A minute later I glaned up again and noted that the 3 objects were not moving nor did they have flashing lights that all planes do. I watched in curiosity for at least a minute at the 3 unmoving objects when I called out to my dad to come look. Just Then the dimmer objects shot south at incredible speed sinking behind the trees in time for my father to see them for only a second. The remaining brighter one appered to flicker like candle but stll remain sationery for another minute before it also falowed the other two in a sloping soutward direction bu much slower. They were all orange in color and stood out from ordinary aircraft because of reconizable planes flying behind them and their movment.<n>

I looked away for ten seconds, and when I looked again it did not seem to have moved at all. I looked away again for five to ten seconds, and when I looked again for the second time I noticed it had moved an incredible distance. That was when I knew it was something very unordinary. And as soon as these thoughts came to mind, it went over the mountain peak and vanished. I still cannot believe it. I am a wine salesman and my wife is a school teacher, with no experience at something like this. My wife was driving so she did not see it.<n>

I looked up to see where it was and saw a silver cylinder very shinney. I thought this must be the jet I heard but the sound of the jet was off to my left as I was facing about north. I tried to change my angle of view to see if I could detect wings but could not see any. The sky was clear blue with no clouds. The craft was directly over head moving very slowly toward the north north west. It wasn&#39;t making any sound. I watched it untill it went out of sight. I was in the Navy in navigation on a nuc sub and I am a private pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were driving at 20 to 25 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This being screamed for lack of better words at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I fully looked at this creature my heart just stopped.
