I lived near Central Ave. and Tuckahoe Rd. . My mom walked me out to throw the trash when we saw my neighbor from accross the street and his dog just standing there looking up at the sky. When we got to the end of the driveway we saw this ENORMOUS craft hovering silently in the sky. This object was atleast the size of an aircraft carrier and about 7 or 8 stories tall and the sky was crystal clear. It was lighted but the lights were strange and &#34;flashed&#34; in a pattern that made them appear as though they wer circling the craft. It was mettalic like a brushed aluminum or stainless steel with a very low gloss finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just stood there in aw when my mom suggested that I run accross the street to my uncle&#39;s house for a camera. My uncle always had a loaded camera on hand and he had offered to drive me to my friend&#39;s house. When I arrived at his house I yelled up to his window and told him whatr we were looking at. Being my uncle he did not pay any attention to me and assumed that I was trying to rush him to give me a lift. As I pleaded for the camera the object began to move slowly SW. Not wanting to loose sight of it I ran back to the position my mom and my neighbor were at and climbed a tree as the craft began to move beyond our sight. I watched as it moved past some apartment buildings located on Palmer Rd. and noted that it was lower that the buildings which would put it at about 50-75 yards in the air since the buildings sit on a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept an eye on it until it disapeared behind the tree-line still moving SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> O.K. this is where it should end right? Well, my uncle finally comes out with the camera and asks what all the xciment was about...I told him as we drove across Tuckahoe Rd. and eventually up Lake Ave. from Saw Mill River Rd.. Just as we approached Lake there were people stopped and getting out of their cars looking toward the sky. We of course stopped and saw a series of green lights in a formation very much shaped like a kite. As these lights passed overhead we could hear humming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I explained that this was not what I had seen a few minutes earlier the lights reappeared and seemed to be circling over the city. When I arrived at my friend&#39;s house we snapped a photo of these lights with a crappy poliroid, (they circled for about an hour), and then being a not-unintelligent child, I ran into my friend&#39;s house and called the operator for the FBI&#39;s #..LOL...The kicker is that I actually got to talk to someone in some office of the FBI who put me on hold for a min. or two and returned, telling me that there were marines choppers on manuvers over Yonkers that night. I insisted that perhaps the green lights were marines but that the first object was certainly not. They of course blew me off and said they had no further info. What the heck were marine&#39;s flying over Yonkers when the closest base at the time was 1  1/2 hours away in NJ???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Thought it might be a helicopter, but there was no noise|2/24/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01993.html|5|ndxe198803| SUMMARY:  Driving west on I-40 just after dark, saw lights strobing over median of hwy. Thought it might be a helicopter, but there was no noise and the unique pattern of lights. I passed almost under it and began to slow but it had disappeared. Two hours later,on same hwy., a brown cylinder shape hovered and passed over my car. I estimated the first sight to be 40 ft up and ~40 ft wide and the second sight to be 2 and 1/2 ft long and 1 ft around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting was quite large, at least40 ft wide, with lights centered in the middle.There were three large lights, flashing not on and off but in an alternating pattern. I couldn&#39;tsay if it disappeared after I passed under it,because it was quite dark, but the lights were gone. The second sighting was around Joseph City,Arizona, on I-40.  It reminded me of a large poster tube, light brown.  It hovered at the farthest reach of my headlights directly in front of the car for about 20 seconds, came straight at the windshield to about a foot and a halfand went over the car.  I was driving for a posting job I had held at that time for about 8 months. I had left that day from Santa Fe, NM where I was visiting a friend. After the first sighting, I called my husband from the very next truckstop.<n>

I looked out the window near my bed.  Our curtains were not drawn, as we were on the eighth floor where no one could really see in.  I noticed a flashing yellow-orange light flashing slowly.  At first I thought nothing of it, thinking it was an airplane light or a radio tower light.  Soon white, or light yellow lights began to appear one-by-one in a ring around the original light.  I was frozen, trying to understand what I was seeing.  After the last light in the outer ring appeared. the entire set  of lights began to blink in unison, faster and faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, the entire object zoomed out of sight, faster than anything I&#39;d seen before.  I&#39;ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My mother and I were going to the store to get some chips I think.  We got into the car and I saw this light in the sky.  It seemed to be changing colors and coming closer.  Its distance was has to figure maybe a few thousand feet or so.  It was still in the sky to the west.  For some reason I became extreamly fearful, freaked out is another word for it.  I remember an extreamly bright light hitting the car and looking over at my mom who was going to sleep.  That is when I really began to freak, and then I woke up in bed.  It took me a few months or so before I would sleep in my room again.  At the time I was perhaps 13 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was younger I had dreams that I would be woken up during the night an there was a small figure next to my bedside, it gave off a light like one of those light sticks.  I always though of it as an angel because of the light but really I dont know.  Perhaps they were only dreams, wish I could figure that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1988 is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was frightened to say the least and hid my head under the duvet on the bed.  The sounds continued, and I remember thinking that if someone had broken in, I would have heard glass breaking!  I looked at the clock - it was about ten past one in the morning.  I decided I was being stupid and that I must go to see what was going on.  When I sat on the edge of the bed I became aware of a small figure, that seemed to glow, hovering inside my bedroom by the window.  It was ochre coloured, with a small round head on a flexible neck emerging from an ochre-coloured leather-like cylinder.  I remember being surprised by very large flat &#34;feet&#34; at the base.  There was nothing frightening about it - just a feeling of niceness and fun.  It stretched out two long flexible &#34;arms&#34; towards me, and that was the last thing I remembered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have dismissed this &#34;sighting&#34; as just a dream if it had not been for the fact that the previous evening there was a lot of ribbon lightning - but no rain.  I went outside to get a better look, when suddenly two glowing orbs flashed in front of my balcony.  The impression was of two kittens chasing each another - fun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime later I read a letter in a magazine reporting the sighting of a large shiny object which appeared to be a space ship near the Jura mountains, close to where I live.  I have always regretted not contacting the writer nor keeping a copy of the letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I have not come across any similar reports, the possibility remains that the figure could have been a dream or all  in the mind.  But it could also have been a &#34;sighting.&#34;  I like to think of alien kids!

My children were all in bed upstairs in|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41266.html|10|ndxe198803| It was late and I decided to go upstairs to bed while my husband stayed downstairs to watch tv. My children were all in bed upstairs in their bedrooms. In our bedroom our bed faced a north window. I got in bed and saw that I must have left a light on as there was a reflection in the window. I couldn&#39;t figure out where the light was coming from so I got up to go to the window to see where to locate the light. That was when I discovered the light was in the sky not a reflection of some light in the house. So I watched it. For just a second it was a cluster of lights and then they all spread out into a circle like a ferris wheel. That is what I thought it was, a ferris wheel. If I had stopped to think I would have known there couldn&#39;t have been a ferris wheel up that high or that big but I wasn&#39;t thinking like that. I was just fascinated with the lights. There was an open field outside the north window I was looking out of and beyond that were tall pines and houses. As I stood there and watched the lights went out and then came on again and it had moved. The lights now rather than seeming to be rounded were inverted and had a bluish tint to them. Now it didn&#39;t seem so much like a ferrish wheel but just big lights in a circle like a ferris wheel. Then the lights went out again and it moved to the left again. It didn&#39;t roll or anything like that, the lights just dissappeared and then it appeared again. It moved like this until it was out of my sight because of the trees further away from me. I didn&#39;t even think of it as a ufo untill the next morning when I was telling my daughter about it. She was 20 at that time. I never heard any other reports of anyone seeing what I saw. Although if you were standing on the ground you might not have noticed since the lights were facing out instead of down.  I was upstairs which gave me some advantage and there was a big farming field next to the window I was looking out of. I do not believe this object came from outer space I think it was something the government was working on. Before the lights ever went out the object was normal and after it went out and then came back on it seemed to me it was like an imprint a computer would leave behind or something like that. It wasn&#39;t the same as it was in the beginning. I sure wish someone could tell me what it was that I saw or if anyone else has ever seen anything like this before. I wished I had called my husband to watch, but I just didn&#39;t realize what I was seeing at the time!<n>

Why? This Object passed directly over my head no more then approx; 70&#39;. It was Approx 5:20 in the morning , a clear starry morning, as this craft very slowly passed from my right then over my head silently then perhaps 20&#39; over a tree. This craft had one softlight Big white light on each &#34;wingtip&#34; and the nose light consisted of multi-color lights neatly packed in an oblong shaped area. The big white lights were easy on the eyes,The nose lights did not blink or pulse. I felt no downward air or heat as it glided over me.Only I think a slight very low blowing noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this object in 1988 while at my job outside a cottage at Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center as I was about to re-enter &#34;Bell&#34; Cottage after a task given Me.  I learned a little over a year later another Officer had watched it from another Cottage Window.  He told me &#34;It was a &#34;wedge&#34; shape with lights that was hovering by the Infirmary then started to move slowly down Cottage row then suddenly speed away very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always since have belived this craft was trying to sneak over me as I approuched Bell Cottage  But my eye caught it as it moved toward me overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I want to say I served 4 years in the Air Force in &#34;Fuels&#34; and know alot about aircraft.  This object is like nothing Iv&#39;e ever witness before.  And these Objects are real without a doubt!  There is NOTHING WRONG with my eyes!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The color was orange and gold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The course of the object was Westward from over the Pacific Ocean toward the inland and it was a couple hundred feet long. The object rose in altitude at a very fast pace and began to break apart in the sky. Parts of the object looking like glowing embers dropped off as it continued its ascent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many “embers” dropped off in a minute long period as the main object shrank and reduced to barely visual.<n>

Then changed to a play jack shape with clustered balls in center and at end of each spoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my bedroom and typing a letter.  Looking out the window, I observed what I first thought was a plane in trouble . . . seemed to be falling downward.  Soon afterward, the object changed and took the shape of a game jack, having golden balls clustered around the center and at the end of each spoke.  I watched as some of the balls left the object and started floating off.  I got excited and went downstairs to alert my husband and get my binoculars.  We went outside and noticed that two neighbors were also observing the object.   They also thought, at first, that it was a plane in trouble.  Soon more neighbors came outside and joined us in viewing the object.  By this time, almost all of the golden balls had separated from the main object and were floating around the sky.  Remember, this sighting was in broad daylight on a rather sunny afternoon.  Some of the neighbors commented that we were merely looking at a cluster of balloons.  However that explanation was not possible since the spoke object flew in and out of the round golden balls like a &#39;mother hen&#39;, seemingly arranging them in patterns.  The whole group was moving slowily to the south.   While watching this, we saw a commercial airliner going from north to south and though high up, it was lower than the objects.  We counted the balls and came up with an approximate number of 34.  A strange mood came over all of us and the group broke up, returning to our homes without much comment.  It seemed as if we did not want to have further discussion on the sighting.   Several of us had binoculars and the objects just looked like bright golden spheres   The jack object was not as brilliant.<n>
