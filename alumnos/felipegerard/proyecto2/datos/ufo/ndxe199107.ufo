I was fascinated so I just stared. At the time I didn&#39;t know it but I didn&#39;t know that we weren&#39;t supposed to stare at the centers of eclipses but I remebered that there were no eclipses due to appear so I just stared. All I remember was the after blinking a few times I seemed to have lost track of time and so I just went out...I just closed my eyes. The next thing I know, I&#39;m in my living room standing in wonder, &#34;How did I get there?&#34; I know that the ufo was circular because it made an eclipsing effect on the full moon. When I tried to check my watch, it had stopped and didn&#39;t show any time. Thank you for listening to my entry, I&#39;m glad to get that off my shoulders.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother came in late one evening about 11:30 and told me she saw a UFO. She went out to put the horse in the barn, and she saw a bright flash from behind the trees to the east, which made her think of shooting stars. So she looked up to see if she could see any more. She noticed something moving in the big dipper, and initially thought it was a meteor, or satellite, until she realized there were 4 groups of either 2 or 4 starlike lights, in a rhombus formation, with 1 group in front, 2 on each side, and one trailing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> :<n> <n><n> :        :<n> <n><n> :<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one &#39;waggled&#39; or yawed a bit in mid-flight, and then carried on until she lost sight of them behind the trees to the east, roughly where she saw the flash (the flash was like a flare that descended and dimmed, but she could not see the source for the trees). There was no noise. It was travelling at a pretty good clip, faster than a typical airplne, slower than a meteor. If it was a plane/jet, there would have been sound and colored/ blinking lights. Left no trail. Very clear sky. The whole thing she estimated to be the size of a dime at arm&#39;s lenght, or smaller. Each group of lights was as bright as a moderately dim star, no brighter than one of the big dipper stars. Whole time from flash until the craft disappeared behind trees was probably 15 to 20 secs max. The fir trees to the east are tall, and obscure the sky up to about 45 deg. I have noticed similarities in this story to the one from the man in Knoxville, TN, also in your database. I hope the diagram I drew above will work. (It likely will only work in the font used to enter it into the database.)<n>

Geroge Nori had a guest on, talking about UFOs. I have never really given much thought to whether there are really UFOs visiting our planet. I guess you can say that I am skeptical of the idea. However, I do have an instance that happened to my family and me about 12 years ago. I have only told a few people about this incident because I still believe that there is probably some explanation for what we saw that night. In 1991 I was 35 years old, my wife 32 and our sons 9 and 12. We had moved into our new home on 40 acres only a few months before. Our place was in a very rural part of the County. Our closest neighbor was approx. 2 miles away and it was 8 miles to the closest small town of 1000 residents. The largest city, and the only major airport was about 70 miles south of our place. On this particular night we had just returned home from our 12 year old son&#39;s little league baseball game. It was around 11:00 pm and He had immediatly went upstairs to his room because he was upset that they had lost their game. My wife and other son were in the family room and I went up to try and cheer my 12 year old up. Our house was built on a hill in the middle of our 40 acres and my son&#39;s room faced the west. There were 3 six foot windows side by side in his room. The back door to our home was right at the bottom of the staircase. As I sat down on his bed I just happened to glance out of his window to the western sky. That is when I saw something in the distance headed right toward our house. This thing was very large with many lights and at a low altitude. My first thought was that a commercial jet was about to crash on our land. I yelled to my wife that a jet was about to crash into our field. My son and I got down the stairs very quickly and we met my wife and my other son at the back door. We all ran out into the back yard. I was expecting to hear a plane in trouble. instead, we all stood there and watched this thing with many lights and a string of lights behind it go right above our heads. As it traveled over us there was no noise at all and it was moving very slowly. We just stood there and watched it as it disapeared to the east. The next morning I was really expecting to hear some kind of news about it, but I heard nothing. To this day, I have no idea what this was that we saw, but I know that I will never forget that moment as we stood in our backyard and watched this string of lights silently fly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date os incident is approximate.

I estimate that the craft was less than 1,000 feet in altitude but it made absolutely no sound. The lights were yellow/white in the center and red on the outside. The lights were on the sides or wings of the triangle but not on the base. There were about six or seven lights in all. It was a large object, about the size of a B-52 flying at that altitude. I did not see any surface features, all I could make out were the lights. I was laying between two houses so I only saw the craft for about 3 or 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We used to walk around the city late at night in the summer months...or go out into the woods...essentially, we were trying to sneak around the city without anyone seeing us.  We were on our way home one night in July, and through the trees that lined the street, we saw somthing that scared us both to death, and that we did not talk about untill just recently.  Through the trees, we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a very large triangle.  It was easily 150 long and at least 50 feet wide.  It was floating very slowly, heading west.  There was a noise coming from the craft...a very low humming sound.  It was almost undetectable - as a matter of fact, if we wouldn&#39;t have been looking right at the craft, we probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed any noise at all.  It traveled slowly, maybe 10 miles an hour.  Neither one of us could believe our eyes, and we continued to chase it all the way down the street.  The most incredible thing about the craft was how low it was flying.  At most, it was 50 feet off the ground.  The white lights on the corners of the craft did not illuminate the craft so much as the street, so we couldn&#39;t really see what color the craft was, or what kind of material it was made of.  As we reached the end of the street, we were almost directly underneath the craft.  It then started to bank to it&#39;s left (south, tward the woods).  It traveled a bit further, at the same pace, and then we lost view of it because of the trees.  We could still see the white lights through the leaves, and then, abruptley, their was a huge flash of purple light from the center of the white lights (and if I remember correctly, the humming got more irritating...the pitch didn&#39;t change, it just got more intense), and then it was gone.  Neither one of us saw any of the lights lift up into the sky, they were just gone after the explosion of purple light.  I also remember a few seconds after it dissapeared, when the two of us were virtually shouting at ! each oth er &#34;Did you see that?&#34;, I heard a boom - or a loud quick rumble in the sky - but very far away...in the distance.  He and I both ran to his house, which was only a few houses down from where we were watching, and told our parents what had happened.  They didn&#39;t believe us, or thought we were imagining it.  We didn&#39;t talk about it after that night until just recently, but both of our stories are still the same.  It was a terrifying and incredible experiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/91 21:00|Houston|TX|Triangle|45 minutes|Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15045.html|11|ndxe199107| Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It the summer of 1991, before my senior year of high school.  I lived in the suburbs northwest of the city of Houston, TX, which are near FM 1960 (not sure if the road is still called that).  Ambient light in the area was tolerable for skygazing, and there were no military bases in the area. One evening around 9pm CST, I had just come home from eating dinner at a restaurant with my mother.  She had observed an object in the sky after I had already gone inside the house.  She came in and said I should go look outside, that she had just saw something very strange.  At the time I was extremely skeptical of UFOs, but she is a very logically-minded person, and so I indulged her. By that time the object was already gone, but I decided to wait outside for a bit.  Around thirty or forty minutes later, as I was about decided to give up and go inside, I saw a triangle-shaped object rather high in the sky.  The object was comprised of about twenty greenish, hazy lights.  The whole surface of the object was rather nebulous in this fashion;  there were distinct lights, but their coronas blended together to form a unified triangular object.  It was difficult to judge its distance or altitude from me, as the night was clear and there were no reference objects to compare against.  It had to be at least 5,000 feet in the air;  it definitely had the appearance of having a high altitude.  It was probably a mile or two away from me on the x-axis.  Its size between my fingers while at arm&#39;s length (i was around 6&#39;0&#34; at the time) was about 1 inch long and about 3/4ths of an inch wide.  Since I was viewing it from an angle of probably 30 degrees from its side, and it had the shape of a slightly-distorted isosceles (two sides longer than the base) triangle, it was either flying at an angle, or its side was actually triangular. The object moved silently and smoothly across the horizon in a matter of five seconds, and because it appeared to be so high, I found it to be impossible to be a commercial plane or satellite.  And since in the over ten years I had lived in Houston up to that time I had never once seen a military jet fly over, I felt I could safely rule that out, especially given the lack of contrail and running lights.  I have seen military jets in flight though, and this seemed to travel at a speed far in excess of any military craft.  It also could not have been a spotlight since there was no cloud cover to reflect off of, and the pattern was not predictable as a spotlight would be. The object moved back and forth across the horizon about three times before disappearing. The shape of the object reversed when it came back into view travelling the opposite direction (i.e. the triangle was pointing the other direction). I had the distinct feeling that I was being watched or observed.  Given the highly skeptical nature of my mindset at the time about UFOs, I cannot readily attribute this to a sense of UFO &#34;expectation.&#34;  It was a very primal sensation that registered almost unconsciously.  I went in to discuss the sighting with my mother, and then she and I came out together to look for it, and we saw it once again briefly as it once again glided across the horizon.  Though I waited outside for some time, I did not see it again. As a sidenote, several months later the show &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; ran a special on UFO sightings which my mother and I both happened to be watching on separate TVs.  Some amateur footage of this object was shown which matched exactly with what I saw.  We both independently confirmed this. Background of observer:  I consider myself fairly intelligent, educated and fair-minded.  I have a degree in Advertising from a well-respected university, and am a web designer.  My mother is also intelligent, educated and fairly conservative in making &#34;fanciful leaps.&#34;  She has a Masters degree and teaches.<n>

It was a very clear starry night (which is very usual in our part of the world) when my attention was drawn to a passenger aircraft flying over (I would like to point out that I like watching them fly past,night or day, beause I have a huge interest for Aviation).  We have an International airport in the city, so I guessed Commercial Airlines used it as a waypoint, thus frequently passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, on this occasion, a strange thing happened.  As I stared at the aircraft&#39;s strobes flashing away, an object like a star (but without the twinkle) suddenly appeared at some distance behind the aircraft.  This object then suddenly sped up towards the airplane at incredible speed and stopped right behind it, then it started moving from side to side, as if studying the airplane.  It would move back abruptly, then suddenly flash forward, but never overtook the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What fascinated me was the irregularity in speed and distance to the airliner.  There was no pattern that would suggest some sort of light reflection or something like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after trailing the Aircraft for about 20-25 seconds, it changed direction completely to the right, traveled some distance,(to scale with the aircraft, I would say about 10-15 lengths of the wingspan) then simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stare at the airplane until it vanished, thinking it might uccur again but nothing happened.

It was a clear sunny midday. The other gentleman noticed this &#34;classic&#34; saucer shaped object overhead.  Could not tell the size.  (ie. large and far away or small and closer) Nothing to compare it too at the time.  It appeared to look very similar to the poster that is now shown on X-files.  It was saucer shaped, domed and had dark areas around the lower part of the dome.  Windows?  It was slowly rotating with a slight wobble.  No sound, no lights, no exhaust trails, nothing.  Since we were close to an Air Force base at the time, I went into the station and asked the clerk to come outside and look.  Since there were no planes/jets around, I figured it might be a military protype.  She said she had never seen anything like it before.  It was moving slowly away.  No one thought to take a picture and by the time I though of using the binoculars, it was far enough away that the detail was no greater than when we first saw it.  Everyone at the gas station was staring and pointing at it.  I have been searching the net for years now to see if there were any reports in the newspapers of that time -- but have found nothing yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

During the summer of 91 or 92 I saw the following: My friend and I were flying kites at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.  If it wasn&#39;t for that fact we would not have saw what we did.  We were seeing how high we could get our kites on a light windy day when out of the corner of my eye I saw three disks.  I pointed them out to my buddy and we stood there speechless.  They were traveling on an approximate magnetic heading of 360 to 010 degrees at a 80 degree angle from the horizon so almost directly overhead. From my perspective it was from the right to left.  They were solid luminescent white in appearance in a close triangle formation like military jets.  They were at high altitude traveling at extreme speed on a straight course.  At arms length they each would be the size of a dime.  They traversed the sky in about 6-8 seconds.  Traveling much faster than the speed of sound.  They made no sound, and no sonic boom.  About me: I&#39;m a private pilot with about 5 years flying experience.  I&#39;ve been an aviation enthusiast since I was a kid attending many air shows at Edwards Air Force Base, Point Magu and many other locations.  Including the Edwards 50th anniversary where the SR71 flew at plus mach speeds.  I&#39;ve also seen the Space Shuttle land there many times so I know these disks were traveling at extreme speeds.  By silhouette alone I can identify every aircraft know to the public.  I&#39;ve also been reading Aviation week magazine for years.  These disks are not conventional aircraft to say the least.  Thank you for your work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My cousin said what is that, so I turned around and looked up in the sky.  I saw an airplane pretty high in the sky and said an airplane and turned back around and he said no look lower.  I turned around again thinking he was pulling my leg, but this time I had to look for a second and then I could see it.  It was very low to the ground, maybe 150 yards up and very close to us.  The first thing we did was run to it.  It was moving very slowly from West to East.  It blended in with the night sky, with a few exceptions.  We ran directly beneath it and looked up at it.  It stayed at a constent speed, very slow.  It was long, about 50 yards from our view point, looked like a string of lights or string of stars moving through the sky. The one way to know for sure that there was something there was to look at the stars in front of it, while we were beneath it and watch it move over them, the stars would disappear and the lights that looked like stars would just be moving along at the same speed.  It looked to me like it was reflecting the image of the stars above it to the bottom of it.  Some of the lights would twinkle a little.  I seam to remember som kind of round windows on the side but am not sure.  I could not tell the exact shape since it was the exact same color.  You could tell that it was one very big object and it was silent.  It didnt slow down or speed up, we walked under it for about 10 blocks until the T in the road.  We watched it slowly go over the factory at the end of the road and went back to the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The wind had no effect on thier flight. they seemed to be only 100-200 feet from the ground and less than a quarter of a mile away.

7/10/91 00:00|Victoria (Canada)|BC|Sphere|15min|Then I defiantly saw a melon sized ball of white light pass us traveling faster than I thought possible.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45652.html|18|ndxe199107| It was the summer of 1991. My older brother and I were going to walk to the end of our street to meet some friends. It was late and a clear night full of stars. We lived on the outskirts of Victoria, BC. I had grown up on this road and new every corner, tree and even where the deer would cross the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about one kilometer into our walk, starting up a hill after walking the only straight stretch of road. Suddenly the hair on my face and neck stood on end till it hurt. Out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a flash of light pass. We walked on. Then I defiantly saw a melon sized ball of white light pass us traveling faster than I thought possible. I asked my brother “Did you see that?” He said, “I thought it was just me.” Then there was another and another until they were about six or ten (It is hard to say with the speed they were traveling.). They seemed to be in a range of sizes from a large grape fruit to a honeydew melon. They did not light up their surroundings but seemed to contain their light. They were moving it would seem with purpose weaving away from us and then stopping and launching into our close vicinity again. I asked my brother if he thought we should run but as soon as the words left my mouth I knew the futility of my thoughts. My brother said we should turn for home but just walk calmly and not run. I was glad he was with me for he was a few years older and I had not yet graduated and was still unsure of myself. We descended the hill and rounded the corner leading back to the straight stretch of road. One of the lights sped ahead of us two hundred meters or so in the blink of an eye and stopped instantly under one of the few streetlights on the road. It hesitated there for perhaps a half of a second and the came directly at us. It wizzed past me head silently less than an arms length away. I was terrified, sure neither of us would be seen again and pitying my mother who would never know the fate of her sons. Then a car came around the corner ahead of us and I realized the lights were nowhere to be seen. We flagged down the car and begged them to take us with them. I am sure that our pleading to save us from the UFO lights convinced them that we were crazy. They sped off and once again I was sure we were doomed; but after a few minutes with no return my fears started to subside. I began to build up enough courage to lookup and into the starry sky. Behind us in the distance was a field and far above it I noticed a triangle of lights, just sitting in the sky motionless. I asked my brother if he could see it also and what he thought it was. He said, “ It’s probably a radio tower or something, lets just go!” It wasn’t a tower though, no stars shone through the center of the triangle, and as I confirmed later in the week during the daytime there was nothing that could have confused with what we saw. I don’t recall how our when we arrived home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I awoke seemingly oblivious to the night’s events. I went to the bathroom to shave and shower. While shaving I saw in the mirror falling from the ceiling next to me, bright shiny sparks falling to invisibility before hitting the floor. Immediately all the night’s events came rushing back to me. I ran to my brother’s room and found him awake in bed with the most astonished look on his face. When I asked him what he said he awoke to find his bed covers covered in sparks. We spoke of this to our parents and friends but few believe us. For months after this event when I would drive home from work, occasionally when I approached, or passed through the area of the incident I would hear from behind my heard a loud clap. It was like two hands coming together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event has defiantly had an effect on my life and my beliefs. I look for answers and get more questions. I search for truth and find mystery. And sometimes it still terrifies me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Everyone in the house was sleeping and I was laying out on the pool deck, watching the stars because the sky was perfectly clear.  Then I see this thing come up very low over the trees and became quite stunned.  It was triangular in shape and metalic with a large, crimson globe in the center.  This light was on because I could see it reflecting on the sides of the craft, but it was very dim.  The craft silently flew over me at altitude of no more then a few hundred feet, and then arced around behind some more trees.  It had disappeared. While this had all been going on, I ran into the house to wake everyone up...no one would get up.  So, I came back outside and looked up and it hadn&#39;t disappeared yet.  I guess that convinced me that it was real. Over the years, I have searched the internet for triagle UFOs to see if I could find someone else that had seen it.  It may be interesting to note that I have found a few additional reports from Cleveland, OH (on the other side of the lake from Buffalo) and Pennsylvania (about 100 miles from Derby, NY, where my sighting had been).<n>

It went silentley through the trees then dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was a car so I ignored it. Suddenly 3 gigantic spotlight beams blasted from the treetops and began scanning the ground, they were spinning in huge sweeping search patterns. We were awestruck and wide-jawed and then one of the 10 foot wide beams scanned us passed us and immedeatley swept back on our bodies. Both other search beams then shot on our bodies, we were completley exposed and frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran, hearts pounding and completley freaking out under a tree, where the lights followed and shone through the folliage for a horrifing breif period of time. I think I was praying by then. The lights shut off with a klunking sound and we each fealt safe that we were not going to be harmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked out from under the tree and saw a large triangular shaped object floating over our heads. We watched it drift off over the glistening water as it made a very low frequency humming sound. There were 5 lights on the back of the ship that blinked in sequence from right to left one at a time, very slowly and methodiclally, amber in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It drifted ever so slowly over the silent surface of the water for several min. untill it faded into the horizion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both went back to our park bench, sat down began talking about what we had been talking about before like it had&#39;nt happened. 20 min. later I remembered what had happened and asked my freind, &#34;what was that?&#34; and the said &#34;oh, you mean that ship?&#34; I said &#34;yes&#34; then he said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;. How did we forget what had happened? How did we remember? I was always affraid to let this information out to the public but now I know that my story is a dime a dozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, who elects to remain totally anonymous, indicates that date is approximate.

During the time it took me to smoke a cigarette, this object came to within 75-100ft of the roof of the neighborhood homes, and was on a path that would take it directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS it passed over my head I could see tat it was triangular in shape, with three lights (one at each corner).  It was almost completeley silent with the exception of a low humm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after it passed over me it changed direction abrubtly and instantly made a slight course adjustment.  From what I obseved this object was not beholden to known principles of flight.  It traveled at I would estimate 3-5 Mph., it&#39;s turn was the most baffling becuse the objects speed remained a constant and as the object itsef rotated to the right its direction simultaneousley changed, there was absoluteley no delay between turn and direction change!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 50ft across and had windows.  As the object left going south in the distance I turned and noticed another light where I had originally saw the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited to see what this new object was and to my surprise it was an identical triangular object, identicle path and trajectory as well as speed.  The weirest part of the sighting to me was that the second object turned at the exact same point,at the exact same angle (vector)and the exact same speed of 3-5 mph.!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> These triangles that I saw definately were not reliant upon any air flow for flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Definately had the feeling they could be man made.  Not too sure but I think there are/were Air Force bases near there point of origin. (weymouth)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On the night of the 5th, we were sitting around the campfire as usual. I have been interested in astronomy for all my life (16 years at that time) and was looking up at the night sky. Out there at the lake you can see a lot more than in the city. While looking up into the Eastern sky, I saw a flash of light about the size of the moon, but about as bright as a 1/4 moon. Instantly after the flash, what looked to be a shooting star came streaking out of the flash. It shot across the sky for about 1.5 seconds and stopped instantly. When it stopped, it was about as bright as an average star. After it stopped, it waited for about 1 second and began traveling back the way it came from, at about the speed of a satelite. Me and my famiily saw this, and we can not explain it. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star, because they don&#39;t stop and go back slowly. It wasn&#39;t a satelite because of the way it acted. And as for the flash, I have no idea. We were all sobor when we saw this.<n>

I am educated and a Science teacher now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the what we saw that night...  My friend and I were talking about teenage things when we both saw one bright red round dot - circle - bubble (words to describe it) which seemed very far above us.  It was not moving at all.  We discussed, was it a planet reflecting red?  A laser pointer?  Was it a satellite, because it did appear to be far away?  A plane?   Lastly,a UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, since it wasn&#39;t doing anything while we were talking about it, we continued socializing about other topics.  We would look back at the red luminous sphere every so often, but it wasn&#39;t moving.  After about 20-30 minutes, we started looking around the night sky again, and again the attention on the red brightness brought us back discussing the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, with our attention on it, the red dot split into two identical red round objects; like cell division division had taken place, the two bright red objects started traveling in opposite directions at a steady, medium speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Freaked out, my friend and I became scared, and tears welted in my eyes, because I didn&#39;t understand what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched with tense anticipation watch the red spheres travel apart.  Within 2 minutes of the splitting, the separated red Unidentified Flying Objects disappeared.  I don&#39;t know what we saw that night, but it was something I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From time to time, I think back to what I saw and it still makes my eyes welt with uneasiness.<n>

The object made no noise and just hovered in the same spot for at least 10 minutes, it was almost directly above us in the middle of the sky.   It then shot clear across the horizon, to my left; it was clearly visible until distant trees finally blocked the view.

The only sound we heard was idling of trucks at the rest area. The object was not high up, it was cloudy and we watched as the object slowly started to disappear into a cloud bank. The shape of the formation was triangular. Lights were fairly large and diffuse (did not look like searchlights or conventional sources of light-did not cast a beam) and they were white. The lights numbered about 5 or 6 on each leg/side of the triangle, the triangle was open ended.<n>

I was at a boy scout camp at a place called Hawk Mt. in Pennsylvania. We were walking up to the phone to call home, because the cabin we were at had none, and up in the sky we saw a light. It is weird, but it really caught our eye, we couldn&#39;t stop looking at it.  We (((four names deleted))even started trying to guess what it was, it might be a helecopter we thought, but it made no noise, it couldn&#39;t be a plane, it was not moving at all, we had no idea what it was.  Then while we were still looking at it, what seemed to takt forever, it just took off like a shot, I mean it was gone!!!  I have never even heard about anything like this, and frankly am a little imbarrassed about telling this story, but I had to get it off my chest.  It was the strangest thing that ever happened to me.  I&#39;ll never forget it.<n>
7/1/91 00:00|Hale|MI|Sphere|2 minutes|Hovering UFO, Bright white spear shape, no sound, extreme speed, green exhaust beam|1/26/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/116/S116888.html|35|ndxe199107| Hovering UFO, Bright white spear shape, no sound, extreme speed, green exhaust beam<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story begins when I left from work early to go home, which would be around midnight in the summer of 1991.  The drive home is about 25 miles from where I worked.  The road that I traveled on goes through heavily forested land with many curves and no residences.  It was a dark, clear night, in a rural area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is what happened, it’s like a scene out of a SYFY movie…  I was driving home through the woods, coming to the end of all the curves on the road, when all the sudden a man was standing out in the middle of the road (in the middle of nowhere) with his hands up in the air motioning me to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed he had blood dripping from his head.  I was hesitant to stop, God only knows why there is blood dripping from his head and I see nothing around us, no car, no homes, no one!  However, I did stop.  I made sure my doors were locked and I rolled down the window just a crack to speak to him.  He said “I just got in a car accident and I want you to drive me back to another city.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was a young female, and I didn’t see any evidence of a car accident, I told him to sit on the shoulder of the road, and I would go get help for him (no cell phone at the time), so I continued driving.  After arriving on the last curve, I came upon an accident scene, the police were there searching for the driver/victims of the vehicle.  I pulled over and told the police, “There is a bloody man back there a couple curves away.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> The police jumped in their car and sped off.  Meanwhile, a guy I knew from high school was there at the scene.  He was passing by on his motorcycle with his buddy.  He said to me, “This accident was pretty bad, pull up your car and put the headlights on it to see it.”  So I jumped in my car pulled it around so the headlights lit up the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back out of my car, I continued to talk with them.  I was facing them and they were facing me, and that’s when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye!  All of the sudden, it appeared out of nowhere, hovering above this huge tree in the woods. It had no sound, and it was sphere shape (like a ball).  It was the brightest white light I’ve seen and you could actually look at it and it wouldn’t hurt your eyes.  I couldn’t see anything other than this big ball of white light, but you know something was in it, but all I could see was the illumination of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was seeing this unfold before my eyes, all I could say was, “OH MY GOD.”  When I said that, the guys saw the expression on my face and asked me, “What”? What?&#34;  I couldn’t even speak to them at this point because my eyes were fixed on it, and this UFO moved so fast that it’s unbelievable!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the UFO going from hovering to the heights of the heavens in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the UFO traveled it had a fluorescent green exhaust beam come from the back of it!  I remember the night being so clear and you could see the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this happened within 30 seconds or less.  The UFO’s speed and destinations have no limits.  I used to watch the Stealth fighter fly and this UFO&#39;s speed makes the Stealth Fighter look like a standstill compared to it.  By the time I got the words out of my mouth, “Oh my God,” that is the amount of time the UFO needed to go from hovering at a standstill to going out into outer space!  How on earth do you measure that speed?<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO flew in an upward Northwest direction.  I’ll never forget this night.  I was standing outside very close to the UFO, I was on the ground, and it was above the tree.  I was scared and shaken after this.  I knew UFO’s were real, they do exist!<n>
