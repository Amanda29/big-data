I looked out the window and clearly saw 3 silver flying saucers hovering above a big field of red flowers. They had a slight woble to them as they were sitting stationary in the air about  200 feet up. They had a circular pattern of red and white lights around the bottom and were about 40 feet across. I also remember seeing a small antennae on top of their dome.  I revisited the site recently and estimated that we were between half and a quarter mile away as we were driving closer.  After about 20 seconds, within a blink of an eye they were gone. I was twelve at the time and was very impressed by what I saw and told my folks about it as soon as we got home. The next morning when I awoke to my radio alarm clock, set to KCBQ, the DJ announced that over 150 people phoned in to report seeing 3 flying saucers throughout San Diego County. This event ocurred in clear daylight and I often wonder about what flew these things and where they come from. They seemed to be checking out the impressive sight of the red flowers from above. Thanks for letting me share!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Eran de una blancura tal que contrastaban con el negro de la noche. Continue mi camino a la tienda de la esquina y ahi comprobe con 4 vecinos, 2 matrimonios, que lo que habia visto tambien ellos lo habian visto. Los objetos viajaban de oriente a poniente y emitieron un zumbido un poco grave al pasar por mi cenit.<n>

It was night time.  I was watching television, and my mother had fallen asleep in front of the fireplace, on the floor.  My stepfather was sleeping in the bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The living room lit up with flashing, brilliant, multi-colored light, like police car lights flashing. I ran to the window and saw a circular craft, landing behind our property, behind one of the near by foothills. I tried to wake my mother, who would not wake up.  I called out to my step father, who didn’t wake up either. I was terrified. My memory ends there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I told my mother about it.  She didn’t believe me at first.  Then, in the following days, she read the articles in the Yakima Herald newspaper, about approx.  8 other people who had witnessed similar sightings in the area.  One father and son even chased one down the road trying to follow it, until they nearly ran off the road.  The explanation that the &#34;experts&#34; gave, was that it was a reflection of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Hundreds saw it. The eve. news confirmed UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 13 at the time and was playing outside a church while my parents were in choir practice. It was dark. From the hill where the church sat, I could see the terminal station of the Sao Paulo subway system. Suddenly I noticed an orange light that changed intensity, sometimes changing to red. I called my parents and the other church members who came out to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. The location of the light was exactly on the path of the Sao Paulo International Airport (Congonhas) final approach. As airplanes would align with final, the light moved very fast and dissapeared, to reappear when tha plane had passed. Later that evening, channel 5 (Globo television network) reported the incident and interviewed several eye witnesses, who reported the same story. They also interviewed officials at the airport who reported an &#34;unidentified object&#34; on the radar screens at the reported location. Airline pilots also reported seeing the object. No further explanations w!ere given, and airforce officials declined to comment.The date is approximate, since I don&#39;t remember exactly when it happened. But it was around then.<n>

- There&#39;s no tower over there...&#34; The instant the words had left my mouth - Almost as if on cue - From the direction of that unknown light - Came a blur - The type of blur movies try to depict when a spaceship goes &#34;Warp Speed&#34; - And in the time it took one to snap one&#39;s fingers - There hovering at treetop level above the bridge - Was a dark object - Rectangular in shape - With one red &amp; one green &#34;running light&#34; positioned together on the lower part of the craft at its center...We stared in amazement - But said nothing...After about 5 minutes we noticed the craft&#39;s position had moved to the right - (As we faced it) - But to look at it you could not tell it was moving at all - It was only after it noticeably left its position centered over the bridge - That we had any idea it was moving...It continued its &#34;slow motion&#34; - Again movement so slow &amp; undectectable - That it was only in elapses of 5 - 10 minutes of time - That we could see that it had progressed more to the right than previously...After approximately 20 - 30 minutes - It sat directly across from us - Facing the passengers side of the car - At treetop level - On the other side of the river - Now 90 Degrees from where it originally was...<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staring silently at it for another 5 minutes - My partner turned to me and said: &#34;Is THAT what I THINK it is?&#34; - Whereupon I replied: &#34;NO, NO - There are NO such things as UFO&#39;s - There are NO such things as UFO&#39;s&#34;...After another 30 seconds my partner said &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here&#34; - Whereupon I started the car and started back down the access road to the county road...As I turned onto the county road &amp; subsequently onto the cement bridge - We saw that the craft had now returned to its original position - Treetop height - Above us and slightly back from the bridge...As we started to cross - My partner said: &#34;STOP - STOP - I&#39;ve gotta see if it&#39;s real - I&#39;ve gotta see if it&#39;s real...&#34; I stopped the car center-bridge - We got out and looked up at a craft - Approximately 20-25 Feet wide - Again with a round red &amp; green light at its base - And a rectangular glass window - Or what appeared to be glass - Running across the middle third of its front...Standing to the left side (As we faced it) - Looking down at us - Were 2 &#34;Beings&#34; - And although I could only see them from the waist up - Were around 4 feet tall - With abnormally large upper heads - And large black eyes - I describe as &#34;Insect Eyes&#34; - Just staring at us...I&#39;ll never forget those eyes - They were like a shark&#39;s - No feeling - No emotion in them - Their skin was pure white - Like the moon - Not grey - And the texture appeared like - I know no other way to describe it - Like that of an albino salamander...Very similar to what you see depicted in books etc. - Except the fronts/tops of their heads are larger/more bulbous than I&#39;ve seen depicted - And their eyes - Ran almost north/south with their heads - As opposed to the angled versions - Again that I have seen depicted...Their craft hovered silently the whole time - Not even a hum - And no flashing lights - Just the two &#34;running lights&#34; - Which in retrospect - I imagine were there to convince anyone who might see them from a distance - That it was just a conventional aircraft...After about a minute of &#34;eye contact&#34; - We got back in the car - And rapidly - But still not panicky - Headed the two miles up the dirt road to the main paved road...I kept my eyes glued to the rear view mirror the whole way - And when we turned onto the paved road to head back to town - We could see the craft was still hovering where we had left it...Nothing like this had ever happened to me before - And nothing like it since - But the events are as clear to me today - As they were that night...The ironic thing to me is that although my experience really couldn&#39;t have been a better one - Regarding my determination of &#34;Aliens&#34; being &#34;Real&#34; - I have a very hard time believing others about their &#34;experiences&#34; - And have concluded that - No matter how much one wants to believe - The only way one CAN believe - Is to experience this firsthand - The old &#34;Seeing Is Believing&#34; adage...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Me and my family lived in a place vary far from downtown Brasilia. My sister and I were going back home after a school day along with two other grils who lived in the same place. My mother parked the car just in fornt of these two girls&#39; house and we were received by their parents on the porch. I stayed in the front seat of the car. I felt like watching the sky when something started moving. First i thought it was a bug on the windscreen moving sideways. I walked out of the car and could see that there was nothing on the windscreen, then I turned my face up and I could see a small silver circle shaped object making turns very fast, moving sideways and stopping every now and then. I called the people that were just a few meters away from the car and they witnessed the same phe****non. All of a sudden this small object went upwards and a black ring formed around it and it desappeared. This was the first sighting there were another one but this one was really scaring. My sister had to see a psychologist after that. All I can say is that in that place lived the top ranking military generals in the brasilian army and it was well guarded. One of the witnesses was a major in the army. From that day on my life changed. It was like a new understanding of everything. After these two sightings my father invited two military jet pilots for a talk about UFOs. These two pilots confirmed that they had already followed lots of targets over brasilia sky but they were not allowed to speak about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 7:00 pm in the evening I was walking to my friend’s house about a block and a half away. As I was walking I looked in the western sky and noticed a bright star, which was 90 degrees from me. It was unusual but I didn’t pay much attention. As I walked along I looked again and it not only had moved ahead but had gotten bigger which I began thinking was unusual. Walking along about 100 feet further I looked again and it had moved farther ahead and became much bigger. At this point I was nearing the end of the block and started to watch it continually. It started moving closer and became much bigger. The last time I looked I had crossed to the next block and it was hovering almost directly above me. It was a ball perhaps 150 feet in diameter, without sound and had a red light on the bottom. At this time I sprinted the half block to my friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/7/75 19:00|Fort Lauderdale|FL|Disk|10 minutes|The craft hovered directly over a resturant called pier 66 about 50 to 100 feet above it.|9/12/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31406.html|8|ndxe197503| The craft hovered directly over a resturant called pier 66 about 50 to 100 feet above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been many years and I&#39;m not even sure if I have the right year , month and time but once I tell you of the sighting it may coincide with another report of the same sighting if someone else reported it. I know there were others that saw it because several years ago someone I met mentioned that thy knew someone that saw the same thing as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a craft that was heading south over the intercoastal waterway in ft lauderdale. It looked like a bright light, kinda like a headlight on a plane. A friend and I were traveling east over the intercoastal on 17 st .Looking north I saw this thing and said to my friend, What the heck is that  ? I was driving so it was a little tricky for me to keep my eyes on it . Suddenly in a flash it moved to a different locaion which was directly above a resturant called Pier 66. Funny thing about this resturant is that it rotates , or at least it used to and it looks like a round ufo .Pier 66 is like 10 stories high so it looks like a space ship on top of a building. This made us think that whoever was in the ufo might have looked at the building because it really looks like a saucer shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway when we were going over the bridge the ufo was roughly the same size as the top of the pier 66 round building and it hovered what looked to be something like 50 to 100 ft above it. It was there for just seconds then it traveled across the sky to a distant location (in a split second) to a point that it looked as small as a star. Then in a split second again it traveled to the top of pier 66 and hovered above it again.Let me tell you this all happened so fast that we were still crossing over the bridge when this happened. Once we crossed the bridge we were heading east towards the ocean and then the craft started to move slowly east . It flew at a slow speed so we were able to watch it as we headed towards the beach.I could only glance at it from time to time because I was driving.My friend was watching it all the way .It flew at an angle and had some what I seem to remember red lights at the bottom. ( my friend drew a picture of it that year , he is an excelent artist ).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got to the ocean I was trying to pull over into a parking area on the beach so I could stop driving and just concentrate on looking at this thing. I pulled over and the craft was just crossing over the road A1A and heading over the ocean. It got over the water and again it a split second traveled across the sky to the point that it looked like a tiny star in the distance and just as fast came right back to the same spot it was just at. Then it slowly started moving east again over the ocean and then there was a big flash of different colors at it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I could remember the exact date and time but I never wrote it down. I hope someone else has reported this sighting so I can have more eyewitness accounts of it. This sighting made me want to see another one but to this date that was the last time I saw one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know more people saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We lived on a ranch in Cowiche. I was watching television, my mother was napping on the floor in front of the fireplace. My step-father was sleeping in their room. I saw a brightly colored prismic type light coming from outside. It had multiple lights, flashing different colors. The light filled the room as it lowered behind the small hills along side our house. I tried to wake my parents, but they wouldn&#39;t wake up. I remember the horses outside running back and forth along the fence from being frightened. The dogs outside were barking and growling. There was no noise from it. The next few days, The Yakima Herald, printed stories of other witnesses to the lights. One man was chasing it in his truck. There were 8 witnesses on the night that I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Our drawings were identical;hexaganal,orange. except my drawing showed the occupants(2) flying around with backpacks.My parents heard the vibration and humming noise and would testify today, Now,at 33yrs i still get clear images of the sighting in my mind, and sometimes a feeling of a presents in my room.
