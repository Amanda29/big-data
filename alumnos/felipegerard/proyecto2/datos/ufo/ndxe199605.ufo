My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &#39;tail&#39; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &#39;curves&#39; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island. This island is approx. 80-100 miles WNW of ourlocation.<n>

Strange person(s)|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01884.html|6|ndxe199605| SUMMARY:  Friend and I witnessed &#34;flare like objects&#34;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&#39;s #ing above 20. Strange person(s) watched us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back from LV at approximately 20:30 hrs myself and a good friend were just driving down the road when we noticed a light in the Eastern sky.  We stopped the car and watched for a moment.  At first wethought they could be flares, then we noticedthat they were acting quite strangely.  Not intelligent type of movement, but they were staying up there for quite some time.  They were almost stationary for about 3 minutes in the skFriend and I witnessed &#34;flare like objects &#34;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&#39;s #ing above 20.  Strange person(s) watched us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then they started thier slow decent.  When I say slow, I mean it took them 7 minutes to come down aproximately 100yds. That is the thing that intrigued us the most.We could see a visible trial of smoke as ifthey were flares, but they were much brighter and acted in a way that neither of us couldjust dismiss as something that was normal.  They very well could be just flares and we don&#39;t know anything. But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued.  I don&#39;t believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or &#34;plasma displacment&#34;.  They could have been a number of different things.  We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve.  The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion.  It was a straight fall.  But took way too long to be a &#34;fall&#34;.  It was aided by a rocket type of engine more than likely. Ifthat is so, it would more thatn likely havegone up, or been a little bit more eratic.  The light was at first RED.  When it startedto make it&#39;s &#34;fall&#34; it turned almost WHITE.I would very much appreciate it if someone would respond and tell me that theyknow what it is.  And I hope that this willnot be taken like a &#34;stupid person reportinga light in the sky that is more than likelyjust a flare or a normal aircraft.&#34;   As I havesaid; I do not think that it is alien.  But I felt that it is not something easily achieved with any normal flare gun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC NOTE:  Location of sighting reported as &#34;just north of Amargosa Valley on State Route 95.&#34;<n>

My apartment was situated very near the central part of the Chico, a well lit, bustling with nightlife, college town, suburban atmosphere city in Northern California.  Suddenly from behind my apartment or coming from the opposite direction from where I was looking out, a massive, triangular shaped object flew over my apartment, moving towards the central part of the city.  What scared me almost as much as it&#39;s unnatural appearance, was the fact that it didn&#39;t make even the slightest amount of noise.  There were no lights on it that I could see in the short amount of time it was visible to me, and I believe it was black in color, although I could be wrong as it was quite a dark night.  The funny part of this story, would be that I&#39;m pretty much a non-believer in everything, but my boyfriend, who was in the living room when this occurred, believes in UFOs, aliens, and all of that kinda supernatural stuff.  It was with that, that I entered the living room, told him what I had seen, only to find that he didn&#39;t believe me!  Am I the only one whom has seen such a craft?<n>

It was dusk about 8:45pm and I had my 2 boys with me. The area is well populated with houses with wooded lots. Right along the road, about 25 feet above the trees, I saw a huge aircraft. I said to my son, &#34;Look, what is that?&#34; The aircraft seemed to be at least as big as half of a football field. I was traveling about 35 mph and was passing this thing. It made no noise and just was hovering there above the houses. I slowed down to get a better look. It was dark gray. It was triangular shaped and I could see a white light at the end of the wing on the underside. It was so low and large that I couldn&#39;t see the other wing. I remember a red light in the middle of it. It was so close to me that I could see the square panels and what looked like the rivets that held it together. I drove to the shopping center on the corner of Margarit Wallace Road about 1/4 a mile down the road and pulled in to wait for it to fly over. It never did. I wanted to drive back but my kids were frightened so I went home. I never called the police or anyone to report it. I didn&#39;t think anyone would believe me. If I were close to a military base I would have thought it was some kind of test plane because it resembled a stealth bomber but Charlotte has none closeby and I don&#39;t think Mint Hill is where they would test fly. I watched the news that night and the next morning to see if the sighting would have been on. Nothing. I know someone else had to have seen it. It was so huge and so close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/24/96 01:50|Toronto (Canada)|ON|Triangle|1-2 minutes|3 dim trianglular lights on a black trangular base moving slowly low to the ground over Toronto W to E.|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39522.html|15|ndxe199605| 3 dim trianglular lights on a black trangular base moving slowly low to the ground over Toronto W to E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Victoria Day weekend in Canada...the Saturday Night and my friends and I were out having a few drinks (yes we were *slightly intoxicated*).  After leaving a Bar around College and Bathurst in downtown Toronto we ending up in a children&#39;s playground of a school near Harbbord &amp; Bathurst.  3 males and a female and we where having a cigarette when the female member of our group said &#34;Hey, check out the seagulls&#34;...Since I am an avid amateur ornothologist I immediately lookup up (so did the other 2 males).  Instantly we all recognised that they were NOT seagulls.  All our impressions of the object/s vary slighly including altitude and size.  My perception is as follows:  What was originally percived as seaguls were actually white occolating/slightly-glowing triangle shaped pads (flat on the bottom but seemed to be wobbling, which originally looked like wings flapping to the female who first spotted them/it).  The 3 slightly glowing triangles were in the formation of a triangle - this made it hard to tell if they were 3 seperate objects or all part of the same object.  Indeed it was a dark moonless night with almost no wind at all (I could lite a match and it&#39;d burn to the end).  The Object/s were moving from W to E (direction of the wind) at a low altitude (again, our perceptions differ).  To me it appeared to be about 100 ft (twice as high as the city tree tops and standard Seagull hight) and there was no noise.  Although it only seemed to be moving about 10-15kph there didn&#39;t seem to be enough wind to propell anything at that speed.  The 3 glowing triangles never varied in distance from each other - which led us to believe they were attached/tethered to each other or perhaps there was a large dark object (we could not see anything between the smaller triangles though it could have been a very dark object against a really dark sky) and the smaller triangles would be at the bottom 3 corners of the black triangular base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the entire time, from when it was first spotted (directly above our heads) until it dissapeared into the eastern horizon (about 1.5-3 minutes).  We had lots of time to discuss between us what were were looking at.  2 thought the object was more like 500 ft up.  1 (the female) thought it was just at tree level and I figure it was twice tree level (about 100-130 ft)- I am into bird watching, amateur astronomy, amateur aviation and amateur meteorology aswell as entomology...so if it&#39;s in the sky I have a good idea about it...I&#39;m also an excellent judge of distance and hight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my perspective the size of the object (if it was around 120 ft) is: each glowing triangle was about 3 feet square and about 13-18 feet apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly, the next day (Sunday of that long weekend) I saw a military jet moving from west to east along more or less the same path as the object from the night before.  There were no airshows going on in the city and it is unusual to see a jet fighter over Toronto otherwise.  The jet was moving fairly slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to report this to MUFON at the time but they didn&#39;t have website reporting and I never received the reporting form from them as promised over the phone.  We were all pretty well affected by our sighting and were anxious to discover what it was...to this day we still don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

It was about  40 feet above the roof of the 2 story house I was living in at the time.I can only assume the color was black as it was around 1 am.the shape was triangular with circular lights at the corners and a row of  8 square lights arranged in a rectangle near the center of the craft.It moved very slowly  across the valley,making absolutely  no noise at all and had no rush of air ahead or behind like an airplane would. It moved so slowly it almost seemed to stop a few times.  When it got to the top of the facing hill about ½ mile or so it just vanished. I couldn’t tell you with any real certainty if anyone else saw it, but,it is possible as it flew directly overhead of a populated area next to a molybdenum  refinery.  I feel good about my estimates on the distances because I am a construction worker and am q! uite accustomed to sight gauging lengths and distances.  From front to back it appeared to be about 100 feet long and at it’s widest point  I would say about 40 - 50 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was preparing the house for sale.  I was taking things to the curb when I looked up to the north, the house faces east, and saw a small round silver colored dot, like the head of a pin held at arms length, sitting stationary in a clear blue sky.  I watched it for some time remembering how some groups used flashlights and other methods to contact ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing if what I was looking at was a high altitude weather balloon or not I took the &#34;what the heck&#34; attitude and waved at it and said, &#34;come on over here!&#34; several times. I swung my arm inviting what ever it was down.  It didn&#39;t move.  I walked into the house for more things to take to the curb and when I walked out front again I looked north and the small silver dot was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to my right I caught sight of a round Mylar looking object the size of a silver dollar held at arms length tumbling end over end above the trees moving from the south to the north. It was thick like a Mylar balloon but had no edges. One half was shiny, reflective, and smooth the other side had a four pointed black star covering most of it.  I wanted to run inside for my video camera but didn&#39;t want to miss a second of what I was watching so I just stood there.  The object was tumbling in a straight elevating ascent to where the tiny silver dot used to be.  I&#39;ve seen many balloons going up in the sky over the years but never saw anything tumbling like this.  No strings, no noise, just tumbling in a straight line. I stood there watching it till it disappeared. Several seconds after I lost sight of it a very fast jet flew from east to west at the same altitude as the object right across my line of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Twinkling red,blue &amp; white lights on the 3rd up, left  side of the Orion Belt(?) Seemed to move in repeated designs and flashed mssgs to two other simular objects, one to the southwest, the other west. A falling star caught our attention, then suddenly the sky lit up and a huge white ball streaked across above us. I beleive I heard reports of meteor showers...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband,aged 21, our daughters aged 11 &amp; 7, and myself sat around a campfire. The kids were getting ready to go to sleep when we spotted the lights. I recall sitting in the lawnchair with my husband standing behind me. The kids had gone to bed and I noticed the lights in a barely moving pattern, like a pyramid shape that spiraled inward. Another repeated movement was short distance spikes, like an EEG reading. I don&#39;t have any idea of how long we watched, but I do recall seeing a shooting star. My husband remembers that too, but right after that the sky lit up with a brilliant ball of white! I KNOW that I asked him repeatedly,&#34; Did you see that? &#34; After that we put out the fire and went to sleep in the tent.  We never really talked about it until last summer, and I would really be intrested to find out what it was we, or I saw.<n>

It was about 200 feet away from the northside of the house too close to not be heard....Brilliant lights! When our friends came out we were aware of some missing time? 2 days.

5/12/96 14:00|Sewanee|TN|Sphere|20 min|Saw a perfect silver, metalic sphere move with unnatural physics in a crystal clear, afternoon sky.|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46654.html|48|ndxe199605| Saw a perfect silver, metalic sphere move with unnatural physics in a crystal clear, afternoon sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a female, raised in TN, who at the time of this sighting was about 26 years old. While friends and family members have had very vivid UFO sightings, this is only one of two sightings for me, but this was the most vivid experience that I have ever had.  I have never heard of anyone seeing an object like this until I read about something eerily similar tonight on your web page (sighting dated March 23, 2004), so I thought that I should maybe share this. I can not remember the exact date, but I clearly remember that it was between 13:30 and 14:00 hours. I was traveling down a long, straight road that usually has frequent activity, like plenty of birds, squirrels, cars, deer, wind, etc.  It was a lovely, crystal clear afternoon and my windows were down. Halfway along, I realized that there was total stillness - no breeze, animals, cars, nothing. I slowed the car from around 55 mph to about 20 mph and began actively looking for signs of life.  There was NO movement except an airplane very high in the sky until I noticed, in a separate part of the sky, an absolutely perfect, shiny, smooth, seamless, metalic silver sphere at an undiscernable altitude. I slowed down even more and tried very hard to evaluate what as going on here.  My mind kept trying to make it something, like how the mind will fill in the gaps for a cartoon strip without conscious effort. I calmed myself and tried to just take pure data.  I couldn&#39;t pull over because there were no shoulders, but I used the tree horizons to establish a spacial context for myself and the flying object. That was when I began to see the true peculiarity of this object. Fundamentally, it was flying in a straight line, maybe a very slight curve, from west to east. But what I saw was a display of confounding physics - the object appeared to be going very, very slowly but it was gaining sky-ground quickly. I tried hard to determine if it was jumping, coming in and out, but no - it practically looked stationary, but it would have suddenly moved a good sized distance. I feel almost unable to describe how strange this was, how clear but confusing. This unnatural physics disturbed me more than it&#39;s unfamiliar and very captivating shine and shape.  I kept my eye on it. When I arrived at a spot where I could pull over, I stopped the car, still watching it, slowly opened my door, kept watching, got out slowly (still no birds, cars, or even a breeze), had it with my naked eye for about 3 seconds and then it vanished. Just there then gone. I continued to watch the sky for about 1 minute and then there were two cars, birds started flying, and then I realized I could hear all the usual, daytime sounds where before there only had been that very still, stifled silence.  Life came back into action.  Everything went normal. The stillness and silence lifted like a frickin&#39; blanket pulled off.  I felt worried that I had lost time, so I checked when I arrived at the library. I don&#39;t think I lost any time, but if I did, it was 15-20 minutes at most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me, what was most striking was the crystal clear day, the seeming simplicity of the shape, and the bizaare accompanying stillness and silence, like time had stopped.   What confounded me and convinced me that the entire event was a UFO sighting was the peculiar and unexplainable physics of the object&#39;s non-motion/motion across the sky. I felt remarkably clear-headed and calm for the remainder of the day, which I also found a bit bizaare. Why I&#39;m reporting it now is because I just read, for the first time, that someone else saw perfect, shiny spheres on a crystal clear (exact words!) afternoon.  This struck me.  Same shape, same conditions.  So I wanted to add my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for collecting the data.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/12/96 02:00|Idaho Falls|ID|Light|1 minute|I never have told anyone about this because of the illegal nature of what we were doing when the event occured. Given the anonymous nat|5/28/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44125.html|49|ndxe199605| I never have told anyone about this because of the illegal nature of what we were doing when the event occured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the anonymous nature of your reporting requirements, and the fact I just found your site, I figured what the heck because I have dwelled on the issue for some time and just need to get it out. Plus I&#39;m at work wasting time reading your case files, and I do have one to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and my friend were 21 at the time, in his Ford Escort parked just outside the city of Idaho Falls, ID, near the High-C waterpark about a quarter mile from a railroad bridge.  It is called Zombie Bridge by the locals. It is fairly isolated, with only a few homes dispersed over about two square miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car was parked facing approx. northwest along the road, steep hillside to the left, creek to the right.  Not sure if road is paved now, but in those days it was graded gravel only.  If you head the opposite direction from the car&#39;s orientation, there is a sharp right turn about fifty meters behind where we were parked.  We were being naughty at the time, in that we were ((alleged minor infraction deleted)) (hence my reticence about disclosing the incident), just sitting there in his car in the dark, ((deleted)). Only other sound were the multitudes of crickets out and about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to leave as we both had to work in the morning. I get out to relieve myself in the bushes by the creek and when returning to the car, saw an erratic light.  Best way to describe it was akin to when someone flicks a still-lit cigarette butt in the dark.  Erratic in movement, orange, and very dim in apparent magnitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the direction in front of the car, over the car, decended just like if it was falling, and then it looked like it &#34;bounced&#34; on the ground about forty meters behind the car.  Never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought someone was nearby and had actually flicked a cigarette butt at first, and looked around. Realized it would take some pretty impressive cigarette butt flicking to launch one forty meters or so, and no one was around, so I got in the car somewhat perplexed at what I&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had seen it too, and queried me what it was, and I replied that I didn&#39;t know.  He also noted the crickets had stopped chirping, and I noticed that as well when he said it, which was eerie.  We both looked in the rearview mirrors, and noticed the &#34;cigarette butt,&#34; or at least its glow, was shining on the road behind us although the source was obscured by the intervening hill beyond the right turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The source must have been on the hill itself, and not airborne judging by the angle the glow was hitting the road. By the size of the glow on the road (about ten meters visible diameter), we realized it wasn&#39;t a cigarette butt either, and we both got a little bit of a shiver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell my friend it might be a good idea to go, and he heartily agrees, we both are a little scared at this point.  He fires up the Escort, and we promptly flip out.  See, the car started fine, but every electronic device in his car that can make noise, his radar detector, his pager, and his stereo, all are making a pulsed high pitched and very loud noise.  Sounded almost like when a CD player malfunctions in your stereo, like a pulsed digital noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turn the volume down on the stereo, nothing happens. We turn the stereo off, nothing happens...unplugged the cig lighter power to the radar detector, nothing happens.  Speakers in these devices seemed to be working off of pure inductance in their voice coils without any amplification from their supporting electronics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear we both we&#39;re going to fill our pants we took off out of there so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten seconds of frenzied driving, the EM effects ceased, and his equipment began behaving normally.  Never bothered to see if the glow we had seen was behind us or what, too scared while speeding away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never reported it to the cops or other authorities, would have just gotten a ticket for smoking dope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have reflected on this numerous times with my friend, don&#39;t believe it was anything &#34;E.T.ish&#34; or whatever.  Sometimes I wonder if we got hit with a beam from a JointSTARS or some other military aircraft in the region.  That could potentially explain the inductance in the speakers, which have a much lower threshold of resistance to outside EM effects then say the car&#39;s ignition system.  But I have no clue what that oversized mystery cigarette butt was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just totally weird night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We do not know what a JOINTSTARS aircraft is, but it seems to us that the metal body of the car would have served as a Faraday Cage, and therefore would have shielded all, or most, of the electronic equipment in the car, particularly the radio, which probably was shielded by the metal in the dashboard, and the metal of the hood and the firewall.

They had no real formation more like a mob going in same direction from the Delaware river direction in broad ark going West. against a strong wind, with one trailing slightly behind the others going extremely fast from horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to spot them, point and yell (did not see anyone else) for about 10 seconds before they were behind the 3 floor tall Victoria twin houses with high pointed roofs roughly 4 doors away from me on the sidewalk. Then I ran that distance to my house into the back yard in time to see them from behind briefly. They were still in a broad  arc but the direction  was changing more to the North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Norwood is  South of Philadelphia PA. about half way to the  Delaware state line off  I 95. I have been watching the sky often for 30 years and have never seen anything close to this except in old VHS video taken in Mexico in 90&#39;s  the UFOs were called &#34;Pearls&#34; or string of pearls. They looked almost exactly the same. I will probably remember this clearly forever. but they were so high and fast I don&#39;t think anyone else in my general area got a good look due to narrow streets in this urban/suburban area with 3 and 4 story buildings everyplace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/6/96 21:00|Big Rapids|MI|Light|6 minutes|UFOs performing geometric patterns in the sky/Fireball/Possible alien encounter.|11/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/115/S115477.html|63|ndxe199605| UFOs performing geometric patterns in the sky/Fireball/Possible alien encounter<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time that this incident happened in 1996, I did not know that any UFO reporting center existed, otherwise I would have reported this shortly after it happened. In the last couple of days (I&#39;m writing this in November, 2014) I was listening to a podcast where Peter Davenport was interviewed; in the interview, Mr. Davenport encouraged anyone who had ever had a sighting at any time, no matter how much time had passed, to please write and submit their report.  That is why I am submitting this report at this time. I do believe that this incident was quite significant and should be documented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 1996 I was 18 years old.  I grew up and had lived in the same house in rural Michigan my entire life at that time, my parents still live there to this day.  Our house was located on a small lake, it was and still is the only house on the lake.  There is a trail from our house around the lake which leads to a small public access area.  I knew this trail very well and I would often take walks around the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular evening (unfortunately I don&#39;t know the exact date, but I do remember that it was late spring of 1996, and for some reason I believe this happened on a Monday) I wasn&#39;t tired and I decided to go for a walk around the lake.  I remember thinking about the fact that I was about to graduate high school and that soon I would be moving to Chicago for college.  I remember looking at the lake and the sky and thinking about the fact that I wouldn&#39;t have access to this beautiful piece of land for very much longer and I was trying to absorb the location as much as possible.  I mention this only to try to give further verification that although this happened almost 20 years ago, I still remember very minute  details, even down to what I was thinking about at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the trail around the lake and although I carried a flashlight with me,  I didn&#39;t turn it on as I knew the trail so well.  It was a very clear night and there was a moon in the sky which illuminated the area enough to where I could see quite well.  The trail to the primitive public access site was approximately 3/4 of a mile from our house.  Not surprisingly, I was the only person there at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood on the shore of the lake and looked up at the sky.  On a clear night, the stars are very bright in that area because there is no light pollution to diminish their radiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking north over the lake at the sky for several minutes when I noticed what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky slowly from east to west. There was nothing spectacular about this, it looked like a small, white, illuminated satellite light that I had seen countless times before, it emitted no sound at all. I thought at the time that this was a satellite because it was just a solid, slow moving white light with no blinking red or green lights that would indicate that it was an airplane. I watched this light move, really just because it was something to look at when, out of the corner of my eye I noticed another &#34;satellite&#34; moving from the exact opposite direction, from west to east at the same slow rate of speed, also emitting no sound. This seemed odd to me because, normally satellites only move in one direction, not two in opposite directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched these two objects slowly move across the sky and as they moved closer to each other, I realized that they were moving on exactly the same, but opposite course. As they moved closer to each other, it appeared that at some point they would either crash (I didn&#39;t think that would happen) or they would totally eclipse each other to where, for a split second, it might appear that there was only one light. They got to where they were almost going to meet, then they both suddenly came to a complete stop very close to each other. Both objects were now almost directly overhead of my position, approximately at a 70 degree angle from my point of reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen any moving object in the sky come to a complete stop, much less two of them, that&#39;s when it happened. The first object shot slightly to the north, while the second object, in perfect synchronicity, shot directly to the south, they then turned and one suddenly moved east while the other moved west, then south,north, east, west etc... in opposite motions, making a perfect square pattern. It&#39;s hard to judge the size of this &#34;square&#34; that they were making because although I do believe they were outside of the earth&#39;s atmosphere (I&#39;ll explain why later) I really have no idea how big they were, how far away they were, or how large this square pattern was. The only reference point I can give is if you were to take any two of the stars on Orion&#39;s Belt as you stare at it from our vantage point on earth, and if you were to &#34;draw a line&#34; between these stars, you would have the approximate size of one of the &#34;sides&#34; of this square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The description of this square pattern is easier to convey in terms of a two dimensional surface like a chalk board rather then the three dimensional universe that we see. If you were to imagine two independently moving pieces of chalk on a chalk board representing the two flying lights, if one moved north or &#34;up&#34; the other moved south or &#34;down,&#34; one &#34;left&#34; the other &#34;right,&#34; over and over again and in such a fast rate of speed that it created a perfect geometric square with precise 90 degree angle turns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these two lights making a perfect square pattern for about a minute or so. I couldn&#39;t believe that I was actually witnessing this, so much so in fact that I literally didn&#39;t believe my eyes. At this point I actually looked away to try to confirm that I wasn&#39;t imagining the whole thing. I remember touching my tow into the water and watching the ripples emanate from my foot. I grabbed a piece of bark from the tree directly behind my, I smelled the bark and I took it and rubbed it briskly on my arm, I felt it scrape along my skin. I did this as sort of a &#34;systems check&#34; mostly just to confirm that I wasn&#39;t dreaming and that I was in fact in complete control of my body and my senses. I then looked back up into the sky, the square pattern was still happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I became so overwhelmingly excited. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing but I knew I was seeing it. The two objects creating the square pattern were moving so fast and it was mesmerizing. I began to feel, actually to realize, that this was something that was happening for my benefit, or at the very least for my entertainment. I knew at that moment that I was as aware of &#34;them&#34; as they were of me. I can&#39;t quite describe how I knew that they were aware of me other than that I just knew that they were. It&#39;s sort of like if you were to look across a crowded room and make eye contact with a random and complete stranger, your eyes meet and then you both smile or perhaps even wave at each other, you don&#39;t need to be telepathic to know that you are both aware of each other; that&#39;s how this moment felt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since wondered if there was something telepathic going on there and I can&#39;t honestly say for sure. All I can say is that I know I was aware of a living presence and it felt overwhelmingly positive. It could simply be that this was the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever seen before (or since) and I felt so fortunate to be seeing it. I didn&#39;t feel that there was any underlying message being given to me other than at least two very advanced beings, with capability beyond anything humans could create just wanted to say, &#34;hi, we&#39;re here and look how cool this is!&#34; I remember smiling from ear to ear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for at least four or five more minutes. It went on for so long in fact that I remember thinking that no one would believe this, I wished that I had a way to bring everyone I knew into this situation, or to somehow document it with a camera, but unfortunately I couldn&#39;t do that, so the only thing I could do would be to enjoy it and to remember every detail as best I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what felt like a very long time (again, I&#39;d say four or five minutes, it felt so long that I began to wonder when it would end) the two objects then stopped and rested in the same position where they first came to a stop in the sky originally. Then, just as they came in, they both departed at the same slow rate of speed that they first emerged, but in opposite directions. One object departed towards the east, the other towards the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved farther apart, suddenly the object moving to the west seemed to emit something, a gigantic fireball. This looked like a meteor entering our atmosphere (this is why I believe these objects were just outside of our atmosphere) but probably ten times the size of any &#34;shooting star&#34; that I had ever seen. It took up an enormous part of the sky, it was larger than almost any Fourth of July firework that I&#39;d ever seen. It dropped out of the sky and appeared to come almost straight down across the lake to the north. It was a brilliant flash of light that lasted for only a second or so but it was so big and so bright that it made me yell out with excitement. I didn&#39;t see any object dropping other than the fireball itself and I have no idea if it &#34;landed,&#34; burned up in the atmosphere, traveled for miles or just came straight down. Like the other two objects, the fireball made no noise. The object that appeared to emit it, as well as the other object, ! continued on their course until they were out of range. I was left standing there trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began walking back around the lake, my mind reeling with what I had just experienced. I had walked about 1/4 of a mile and was just on the other side of the lake from where I had seen everything, still about 1/2 a mile from home, when I began to hear something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sometimes hesitate to tell this part of the story, because I honestly have no idea if this is at all related to what I had just witnessed, but in the interest of full disclosure, I feel it is important to document this. Something in the woods just behind me and over my left shoulder, began moving and walking towards me, I didn&#39;t see it, but I could hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to remember that I had grown up in these woods and that I was very familiar with the sounds that animals make. If I hear a bluejay, I don&#39;t need to see it to know it&#39;s there, the same with the scampering sound of a squirrel, the waddling of a raccoon, the soft step and startled &#34;snort&#34; of a deer etc... The sound that I was hearing was unmistakably the sound of footsteps on the leaves. The footsteps approaching directly behind me and over my left shoulder. The only sound that I can compare this to is the somewhat heavy, bipedal sound of human footsteps, in a very rhythmic, &#34;crunch, crunch, crunch,&#34; pattern. It sounded distant at first but it slowly began moving closer. Very few animals move around at night, unless perhaps they are injured or sick. Nocturnal ground animals like racoons don&#39;t sound anything like this. There are no bears or wolves in that area that I&#39;ve ever seen, and although I&#39;ve heard many animals walking through the woods,! I&#39;ve never once had one follow me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously this was terrifying, especially considering what I had just seen. I got to a fork in the trail where I stayed to the left to get home. After taking this part of the trail, this thing was still following me and moving closer. I stopped. It took a few more steps then stopped. I started walking again and it started walking again. It slowly kept getting closer. My heart was beating through my chest at this point and my mind was racing, not just because I didn&#39;t know what this was but also because of everything that had happened to me so recently. I remember being very scared, by now I would estimate that whatever this was had to be about 15 feet or less away from me. Scared or not, I needed to know what this was. I wasn&#39;t going to walk the entire way home with something following me, and the idea of running away from it actually seemed worse because for all I knew, it might start chasing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped again. I turned on my flashlight. I quickly spun around and ran as fast as I could in the direction that I could hear this thing. My adrenaline was working overtime and as I started to sprint. I think I heard the sound of  leaves scattering, but I can&#39;t say for certain as the sound of my own feet were now the loudest thing in the area. As fast as this happened, I didn&#39;t see anything. I ran off the trail and into the woods, my flashlight now brightening the woods. Branches were whipping across my face but I didn&#39;t care, I needed to see what this was. I zigzagged back and forth, back onto the trail and off again looking on the ground, into the trees, everywhere that I could see, but I saw nothing. If this were an animal, you&#39;d think I would have seen a tail, or legs, or something scampering up a tree, but I saw nothing. To this day I have no idea what that was. For all I know this could have been an animal behaving strangely that got away from me very quickly, perhap! s it was something else entirely, I really can&#39;t say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t exactly remember what happened after that. I&#39;m quite sure I remember walking home along the trail and going up into my room and directly to bed, but this now feels like a distant memory. I sincerely regret not writing this down immediately after it happened, or at the very least taking note of the time and date that it occurred, but I guess I just assumed that I would remember all of those details forever. Obviously I know now that is not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other strange thing about this story is that I really have no memory of telling anyone about this until years after it happened.  I have a great relationship with my parents and I&#39;m sure I must have told them, my high school girlfriend or any of my other friends, but I don&#39;t remember doing that.  I remember telling one of my roommates this story about six or seven years later.  I remember when I told him that I had already told some other people about it but I really didn&#39;t think about it that much since that night.  To this day, even when I try to talk to someone like my parents, who know that I wouldn&#39;t make something like this up, they believe that I saw something, but they definitley don&#39;t believe the details that I absolutely know are true.  I used to get very angry when I told people this story and they didn&#39;t believe me. I&#39;ve received a lot of ridicule from other people who trust me and are very close to me as well; perhaps that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t tell! this story very often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Probably because of this incident, I&#39;ve become very intrigued with Ufology over the years. I&#39;ve read many books and watched many videos. I&#39;ve of coursed wondered if I may have been abducted that night, but after revisiting this incident many, many times and given it much objectionable thought, I really don&#39;t believe that I was. As I&#39;ve stated, aside from that brief scare in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I&#39;ve learned not to get angry about the fact that it seems like only a small handful of people take this story at face value, basically that it happened and I don&#39;t really know much more than that. I&#39;ve accepted the fact that many people don&#39;t know how to deal with something like this, and also that I have no idea who or what this really was, where they came from or why I got to see this when so few other people haven&#39;t had an experience like this. What I&#39;ve learned to take away from this over the years is that I&#39;m extremely grateful that it happened. Aside from the few terrifying moments in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience, filled with wonder and hope that there is something greater than us. I have no idea if these things are from other planets, other dimensions or perhaps right here on earth from something other than human origins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I know for certain as that this happened and I was fortunate enough to be in the right time and in the right place to experience it. For that I am grateful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for all of your tireless efforts into this field of collecting data and for providing a place to submit this report like this.<n>
5/6/96 20:00|New York City (Queens)|NY|Light|2 hours|4 light s in formation|7/16/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50709.html|64|ndxe199605| 4 light s in formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this back in 2003 on this site and it is posted.  Today I saw a new entry (occurrence 3/25/2006, reported 4/2/2006, shape circle lights, duration 2 minutes)from someone in Almherst NY which describes exactly the same thing I witnessed.  My posting information is as follows: Occurrence date:  5/6/1996 - Reported date  6/18/2005 - shape:  lights - Duration:  2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw these lights, exactly the way described by this person.  The lights followed me all the way to Exit 63 on L.I. Expressway.  At one point they lost me somewhere around Deer Park and they followed a wrong car similar to my car.  I proceeded to exit 63 and then when I came back to get on LIE, I saw them again, waiting for me.  They again followed me all the way to exit 41 N. Oysterbay.  At that point I pulled to service road and stopped.  They stopped toO.  We (me, my husband &amp; 3 children) hangout there for about 15 minutes, they stayed too.  Then I took Rt. 106 going up north.  they came north with me for about couple of miles until the sky ran out of clouds and there is where they stopped.  They waited a while and when the distance became too far (but I still could see them in the sky), then they went back to LIE and proceeded going toward City.  The strange part is that when I saw the lights the first time I was coming from city on LIE, it was around Elmherst area near those gas tanks and they saw me too and started following me.  If you want to read my full report, go by posted date or occurenace date, I am not sure, and look for category light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until today, I have been trying to explain this logically to myself(earthwise logically that is) and I could not come up with any answers.  I don&#39;t think the lights were coming from any solid objects such a flying spaceship or else, but I believe we are being scanned by other beings in the universe.  They may not be able to come here for distance&#39;s sake but they can send their intelligent lights to monitor us and they can control their lights from where ever they are.  It freaks me out to say this but I think they can see us too otherwise how could they find me again.  One thing is for sure,  WE ARE NOT ALONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/6/96 20:00|New York City|NY|Light|2 hrs|We were followed by 4 dancing lights for over 70 miles|6/18/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29180.html|65|ndxe199605| We were followed by 4 dancing lights for over 70 miles<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were chased by 4 dancing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long time ago.  Probably Fall 1995 or Spring 1996.  The date and time I have listed is just for the purpose of being able to write this.  My husband and I left New York City heading east on Long Island Expressway.  Time was about 8 O&#39;clock at night.  The sky was hazy with a low thin cloud which was faintly illuminated by city lights hanging may be about 1000 feet or less above.  About 5 miles after leaving the city I noticed four lights that at first I assumed are exhibit lights beamed from the ground.  The lights were formed in a shape of rectangle, each at one corner.  They each were doing a nervous kind of dance like circling an imaginary axel rapidly and every so often they all join each other at the center and cross over and go to the corners again.  At the same time the entire formation kept moving from one place to another with no pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first when I saw the lights they were about 100 ft. diagonally to the left of our car.  Then they moved up above our car and start moving in the same direction with us.  For the first few miles that the lights were moving with us, either directly above us or a little to the left or to the right, or a few feet ahead or back, I still looked at them thinking they are exhibit lights.  As we kept putting distance between us and the point when I first noticed them, I started to wonder what kind of exhibit lights would move this far without changing shape or losing brightness.  Furthermore I could neither see any beams nor could I hear or see any object in the sky to be source of these strange lights.  I started looking at them more intensely now and I mentioned to my husband that we are being followed by some lights.  Of course he laughed at me and refused even to look at them (he was driving).  The highway was at times very slow and at time it opened up so we could move faster.  The lights kept up the speed with us.  25 miles later, they were still with us.  Now I was quite aware of something strange going on and I felt having kind of a connection to them that I cannot even explain.  Another 10 miles a car very much like our car passed us and then where the highway forked ahead of us (right fork leading to another highway going south) drove quickly to the right heading south and the lights started following that car.  I was really very disappointed and told my husband that they lost us (of course he made fun of me again).  The lights went southward for about 1/4 of a mile and looked like they realized they have made a mistake and stopped, then started looking around by coming back a little and then going south again a little and stopping and just moving around.  Finally they gave up and kept going south and then eastward on the parallel highway to the south of our highway.  I could see them from distance.  I finally lost sight of them and we went to exist 63 (which is 55 miles from New York City).  Then we! wend south about a mile and picked up my stepson and two of his friends (ages from 9 to 13) and started heading back toward the Expressway.  I told the kids about the lights and they had a good laugh about it and made fun of me.  When we reached the Expressway, I saw the lights again.  They were standing right above Exit 63, I firmly believe waiting for us.  Our destination was heading West to Exist 41 which is about 35 miles from Exit 63, then going up North to Oyster Bay, about 9 miles.  Sure enough as soon as we got on the highway and headed west, the light started moving with us again.  They kept with us all the way to Exit 41.  When, at Exit 41, we got off the highway on the service road, I asked my husband to stop the car.  I wanted to know if the lights would stop.  And they did stop.  Now everyone else, even the kids were amased and exited by this and we all started waiving and talking to the lights and they stayed right above us doing their dance.  After 15 minutes we had no choice but heading home, we couldn&#39;t stay there all night and shouting without getting arrested.  As soon as we started so did the light.  We headed north and so did they.  They came north for about 3 miles with us until they had to stop.  The sky ran out of cloud and became clear with stars shining.  The lights stood at the edge of the cloud.  I kept looking at them for a few miles.  I could see that they gave up and finally went a little south first and then west toward New York City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came home I was extremely curious also afraid to tell anyone without being suspected of being crazy.  I finally gathered up my nerve and called channel 12.  I wanted to know if there were similar sightings.  I spoke to the person who claimed to be the night eitor.  He did not take me seriously and brushed me off by saying  there has been report of light exhibits in the area.    I immediately hang up and since then until now I haven&#39;t told anyone.  We don&#39;t even discuss it among ourselves.  But this never left my mind.  I think about those lights often.  I recently logged into this site and I noticed some of the reports were not that far away from what I saw.  This is why I am writing.  I don&#39;t remember the day or the time exactly but I vividly remember every moment of the time lights moved with us and every move they made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same lights again once more (even though I don&#39;t think they were the exact same lights) about 2 years later in Greece.  I was traveling on the highway by the water in Attiki.  Around Anavisos, which is about 20 miles east of Athens, I saw similar lights.  They came across the water and passed over us and kept going northward until they disappeared behind the hills.  Again no ground beams or anything in the sky (such as helicopter) that might have been the source of the lights at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a logical person and I have been trying ever since to explain this to myself but I have not been able to come up with anything.  I don’t think anyone else can either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not see something like the object in this video, I saw the exact same thing! I drove up a hill on 39 connector, 5 miles from Lumpkin westbound.  This object was hovering above some pecan trees approx 30&#39; to the right of the highway.  It had a bright white light shining to the ground, and all the colorful lights depicted in the video link i&#39;ve supplied of a like sighting.   I cannot express enough, that the object in this video is exactly what myself, and one other friend observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car, stepped out onto the road, and the object floated directly over us: giving me a clear view of the underside.  The object was round, with cylinders extending from the center out to the edges.  The cylinders appeared to be spinning, and thermal distortion could be seen under the craft, indicating a heat source.  The craft was very quiet.  Only as the object was directly overhead could it be heard.  The sound was that of a gentle hum.  The object was close enough that a rock couldve been thrown to strike the underside.  It quickly passed over the trees and into memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

This was a long time ago but I will never forget these incidents. The funny thing was I didnt really care that much at the time but as the years go by I realize I saw something amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one happened in the fields outside of Cody on the Powell highway. A friend and I were driving back into Cody from Powell at around 10-11 pm. We were coming into town and all of a sudden a  bright set of two orange lights slowly lifted out of one of the fields off to the right of the highway.  They were obviously attached to some sort of craft and possibly the light from some sort of engine, similar to a helicopter taking off but it moved slower at first and than faster , it slowly rose up out of the field and shot into the sky gaining speed as it ascended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were quite close , maybe within a mile of the object.  It was dark outside so I could not tell what shape the object was but it definitely had a solid mass to it. I would estimate the size to be about the size of a small to medium sized aircraft , perhaps 50 feet across. It had two orange lights that almost appeared to be rocket engines but not exactly. I could clearly see a huge cloud of thick exhaust coming from the object as it moved into the sky, illuminated by its own orange glowing “engines”. It was far to big to be a fireworks device or anything like that. It moved up in an arc but it rose up slowly , not really like a rocket, more like a helicopter. We were in a car and did not stop but we heard no noise which a helicopter that close would certainly have made.   The other strange thing about this is anyone from Cody knows this is only about a mile from the airport up on the hill. If this was a conventional aircraft why would it take off from a hayfield and not the airport, which was only a mile away?  I can not remember the exact date , I would guess this was April or May.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next sighting was about 8 months later in January. I lived in Wapiti and was driving home from Cody at night. It was eerie and very quiet that night and snowing lightly. As I was driving past the Buffalo Bill Reservoir. I noticed an extremely bright white light to the left of me in the sky maybe about 500 feet in the air directly over the reservoir. This time I stopped my car because I thought it was a helicopter with a search light looking for something in the water. I turned off my engine and stepped out of my car. To my amazement it was dead quiet outside and not a soul was around. Very spooky. I watched the light shining down through the snow and it was mesmerizing. It was a brilliant white , just like a very bright searchlight.  I watched it for a few minutes and then something even weirder happened. As I watched it it slowly faded out like someone turned down a dimmer switch and at PRECISIELY the same time another white light faded on about a mile away toward the dam. The two lights were unmistakably connected somehow because  exactly as one faded out the other came on, almost like the object just teleported to another location a mile away. I suspect it was two different objects that were coordinating their signals. . This actually scared me and I got in my car and left. I never heard a single sound at all. It was absolutely quiet. The lights never moved at all , they stayed hovering in the same spots the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since talked to friends and two other people I know have seen similar things over the same reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since the whole array covered a huge area of sky, we think each v- shaped unit was independent.  We observed this strange sight for approx. 30 minutes<n>

I never knew who to report what I had witnessed to - until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving on a secondary road with a friend we both noticed a bright light in the sky - at about the same instant we both commented that that &#34;plane&#34; had not moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend had binoculars in the car so I retrieved them to look at the light and was shocked at what I saw. It was a huge round jet blacl object with huge lights similar to traffic lights in that they had a sort of roof over each light. There were many lights but only two were on. I could see a sort of fog swirling around the light. I remember saying &#34;Oh my God - pull over.&#34; All I could say was &#34;Oh my God, Oh my God&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend pulled the car off the road and I was now looking at it through the passenger window. When I took the binoculars from my eyes all I could see was the light but with the binoculars the entire object was visible. It was silent and huge.  Of course I could not tell how close to me it was but it appeared bigger than a football field as it blackened out the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I turned away for a moment and then looked again the lights that were facing me were off and the lights on the back of the object were now on and looking in the opposite direction. By the time I handed the binoculars to my friend the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did contact the Pittsburgh newspaper and the Air National Guard and they just politely thanked me and told me nobody else had reported a sighting.

It was around 3:00 AM in the early summer of 1996 (to my best recollection).  I was driving north on a one lane country highway near the Indiana/Ohio border.  I am not sure of the city or county I was in, having been on the road for 7 hours or so.  At first, I saw what I thought to be the biggest &#34;shooting star&#34; ever witnessed.  If you were to put a drawing of it on my windshield for perspective purposes, it would have been about 3 inches wide and the tail would have been about 3 feet long (almost the entire width of the windshield).  I could see what appeared to be molten metal flying off of this streaking ball of flame as it fell through the atmosphere for several seconds.  I semi-expected to hear or feel a great thud as it hit the earth.  At that time I was just amazed at the size and duration of this &#34;shooting star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, a very large &#34;hershey kiss&#34; shaped brilliant orange, yellow and red light appeared to my 10 o&#39;clock position.  The light and colors merged and moved together like a fire.  I would guess it to be within 1 mile of my location.  There was a field on my left with a forrest behind it.  The object was just above the tree line by 30-50 feet.  I estimate that the object was about 300 yards wide by 200 yards high.  Of course, not knowing exactly how far away it was, I can not be certain.  I drove for a few minutes further until the object was at my 9 o&#39;clock position.  I knew at that time I was watching a UFO.  I pulled over and told myself, &#34;I am not taking my eye off this thing until it zig-zags into the atmosphere.&#34;  After watching it, motionless, for 10-15 minutes in amazement, it appeared that someone just pulled a curtain in front of it from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued my drive with a renewed energy and arrived in Wabash, IN at my girlfriends house around 5:00 AM.  I went to sleep for a few hours and met with the family at the breakfast table.  At first it seemed I had forgotten the entire event.  Then, all of a sudden it hit me and I blurted out, &#34;Oh my God!  You&#39;ll never believe what I saw last night!&#34;  After telling them what I had witnessed, her father set down the local paper and showed me the headline: &#34;Over 300 UFO Sightings in Indiana/Ohio.&#34;  Not that I needed that as confirmation, but it could be helpful in putting an exact date on the event if needed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best guess as to what I had seen would be that an extra-terrestrial space craft had crashed to the earth (&#34;shooting star&#34;) and a salvage was taking place.  The actual shape of the salvage craft is most accuratley described as: if you took your thumb and index finger of both hands, made right angles with them then connected your thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It makes a point at the top and the bottom with rounded corners on the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just made aware of the National UFO Reporting Center tonight while watching a TV special hosted by Peter Jennings, or I would have submitted this years ago.  I am certain that what I saw was not made on this planet.  It looked like a perfect campfire in the sky.  I hope that this report might help piece together what actually happened that night.  Maybe someone else saw what I saw from another angle.  I would also like to figure out what the exact date was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly.  When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20&#39; above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30&#39; tall or more and about 20&#39; across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn&#39;t tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn&#39;t think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone.<n>

It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft.<n>
