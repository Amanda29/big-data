I only recall what happened or thought of what happened a few years ago, I remember walking to the house and the next thing I remember is sitting in my fathers car back at the first house where we originally started from wondering what I was doing there , I started the car and drove to the other house, where I looked for my cousin and nephew, everyone there asked where I had been, because they(my cousins and other family peers)had gone out to look for me. On my way out to go and find them, they st walked in, shouted me for leaving without letting them know and that was that. I never thought about what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is this a common occurance or did something happen that I do not remember or what? If you have someone or group I could contact please let me know. I now reside in Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/22/92 18:30|Beaumont/Sour Lake|TX|Unknown|30 min|It was a huge craft with several lights rotating on and off in a circle manner located under the craft.|2/22/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21746.html|2|ndxe199203| It was a huge craft with several lights rotating on and off in a circle manner located under the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work on Hwy 90  towards Houston.I was in between two small towns China, and Nome.It was about 6:30 pm. When I noticed something strange in the sky. At first, I thought it was an Blimp with an advertisement.Then I noticed there were no advertisements, but it was a huge looking craft. It had different colored flashing lights blinking on and off. The lights seemed to be in a circular arrangement under the craft. I found myself drawn to it and kept thinking I was going to drive close to it. I cannot believe, that I kept driving towards it, without fear.There were several cars on the highway heading the same directions. No one stopped, or turned around. The craft was further from me than I thought. I thought the craft was located on the corner of Hwy 90 and Hwy 326. But when I got to that intersection it was further ahead. The craft was to the right of the highway, and I am guessing it was about 100-250 feet hovering above the ground. I am not exactly sure what date, or month. It was in 1992, between January and October of that year.The shape is hard to describe.I am curious if anyone else reported a sighting around this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

3/15/92 23:00|Leirfjord (over) (Norway)||Flash|5 minutes|single flashing light, suddenly hundreds or thousands of flashes, then back to one single|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67682.html|3|ndxe199203| single flashing light, suddenly hundreds or thousands of flashes, then back to one single<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the end of winter 1991/-92. My mother, my little sister and me where driving the E6 from Harstad to Fauske (two towns in nithern Norway). When we exited the Kannflog-tunnel, declining down to Sommerset, in Leirfjord, I noticed a flashing light in the sky. It was a cloudy night and no stars where visible, so this light It was a single bright flashing light (minimum 10 flash/sec(can&#39;t judge my mind to separate more)) flying on a straight course about west-norhwest (left to right in our wiew).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s hard to estimate things like speed, altitude and size on an unidentified object in the night-sky, but I guess the altitude was about 600 meters above the fjord. Since the surrounding mountains are 3-500m with peeks up to about 1300m. I remember the clouds to be about 800-1000m above the sea. We kept a speed of 80km/h or 50 miles, so we also got kind of a 3D-perspective of the course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If my altitude-estimation is about correct, this object where flying way too slow to use conventional aerodynamical wings. My first thought was a helicopter, but the flashes where on a much higher frequency, and appered much brighter than I have ever seen on a conventional aircraft. (and I&#39;ve worked as airport-groundpersonell for two years!)  And out of nowhere. When the object was about the middle of the fjord, hundreds or maybe thousands of flashes, in an area of at least 200 meters in diameter (if all my estimates are somewhere close to accurate) kept on fireing for about 2 - 3 seconds(nothing systematical or symmetrical about them) And then it was just that single flashing light on the same low-speed steady-corse crossing the fjord and finally dissappearing behind the mountain towards Sagfjord.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are interrested, I can mail you a map of the area and draw things like the objects course, our possition(s)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3/15/92 19:00|Boonesboro|MD|Cigar|10 minutes|Approx.3/15/92 an object  with lights was hovering at tree level ,silent and no downdraft, over my car, as I parked to observe it.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64775.html|4|ndxe199203| Approx.3/15/92 an object  with lights was hovering at tree level ,silent and no downdraft, over my car, as I parked to observe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work on approximately 3/15/92 in the evening when I thought I saw a private plane about to crash, it was a row of seven lights at tree level going at a slow speed. This was a small valley,  I was driving on one side and the object was on the opposite side.  I rounded a corner to find that the object was now directly in front of me, over the road, and not moving.  I drove up to it and parked under it.  When I rolled down my window to get a good look I realized that their was total silence and no downdraft.  I watched it for several minutes then continued on to work<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/15/92 15:30|Tampa|FL|Disk|10 minutes|UFO Saucer was seen hovering beyond trees as we were driving towards home and then disappeared.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37439.html|5|ndxe199203| UFO Saucer was seen hovering beyond trees as we were driving towards home and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding with my Grandmother from high school one bright spring day and we were going down the street where my house is located on.  We were one block from my house when the radio started messing up.  Now, my Grandmother had only AM Radio, but the reception was never this bad.  Then, my Grandmother noticed something very odd in the sky beyond the trees.  She alerted my attention to it and I was shocked when I saw it.  It was the biggest thing I had ever seen.  It was in the typical UFO shape, but this one had like a half-dome on the bottom of it.  I have included a link to the image of it HERE.  We didn&#39;t think anything of it and she finished taking me home.  Well, she soon forgot about it, but I didn&#39;t and I kept reminding her of the encounter.  She didn&#39;t want me to keep mentioning it until, a few days later, she called me over to her house and she showed me a newspaper article where some people reported a sighting in Lake City, Florida only a few days after we saw that UFO in TAMPA, FLORIDA!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

3/5/92 06:45|Florence|AL|Oval|Unknown|I dont know if this is a dream or not|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45696.html|6|ndxe199203| I dont know if this is a dream or not<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been having a reoccuring dream as of late, all i can remember about it is that it takes place at early morning (the sun has just come up over the trees), that it is winter time(there are no leaves on the trees). I awake and am drawn to look out the window of my bedroom(it faces the south) and I look up in the sky towards the east and just above the rising sun, I see a black oval shaped disk. i turn to run out of my bedroom, I get down the stairs, turn to run to my parents bedroom, and just as I get there im stopped and I cant go any further, I try and call out, but I cant make a sound. after that the dream goes blank. That is all I can remember. Ive been afraid to tell anybody for fear that I will be considered crazy. As far as how old I was at the time, I would have to say 9 or 10.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

3/1/92 21:30|Whitewood (Canada)|SK|Cigar|5 hrs|2 UFOs over a truck stop.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79889.html|8|ndxe199203| 2 UFOs over a truck stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a trucker and drove throughout north america.  I was parked at the truck stop in .... over night.  I went to sleep around 2130 and shortly after found myself aboard a craft that was white with a blue stripe.  There were windows on both sides but I dont remember seeing any passengers from the outside.  I was within 20 feet of it.  It was shaped like a passenger jet complete with a rudder from the side but had no wings when viewed from the ground underneath the craft. This was the craft I went inside.  The other craft was sguare, like a platform.  There were many beings inside some looked very human but others were quite pale.  They were normal height, all under 5-6 i would think.  We all communicated telepethically.  They were friendly.  I knew this not just because they appeared friendly but i could communicate openly with their minds or at least the mind of the one I assume was the leader.  He was the one who communicated with me anyway.  I never did ! remember everything that happened that night.  I do recollect that part of my memory was erased.  I was made aware of this.  As well it was I believe 19 years ago and my memory isnt that great.  I do remember that i had the propulsion system explained to me in some detail.  I was always interested in mechanical things and this craft was powered by some form of hydrogen.  in the fog they could run forever without fuel by taking in water from the air.  It was a very foggy spring that year.  They showed me 2 fuel tanks that appeared to be white poly.  They were around 2 and a half gallons.  They told me how far they could go on one of these tanks of water, it was very impressive but i dont remember the distance.  They showed off a little bit with the blue and white vessel.  The maneuvers it did were quite impressive.  I was standing beside my truck while they did figure eights over my head.  I became conscious that I was sitting in the cab of my truck on the edge of my bunk.  ! I dont recall how I got there.  It was around 330.  I dont like to call it an abduction.  It was more like a friendly visit.  My diesel was idling all the time this occured.  That is all I am willing to share at this time.<n>
3/1/92 19:00|Lovelock|NV|Light|10-12 minutes|Huge ball of light traveled behind mountain tops, raised up briefly, accompanied by small colored lights, then left in electric flash.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77813.html|9|ndxe199203| Huge ball of light traveled behind mountain tops, raised up briefly, accompanied by small colored lights, then left in electric flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked for years for a report on this matter. I’ve never found one. There were no reports of it in any major (or minor) newspapers in Nevada at the time that the event took place. I have recently, however, seen similar sightings listed that took place in different areas, so I decided to place my sighting here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Interstate 80, in Nevada, heading north, between Trinity Junction (where Highway 95 to Fallon intersects I-80) and Lovelock, in the Humboldt Sink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 7 p.m. but dark because of the date. I was driving a Ford pickup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 11 miles south of Lovelock on I-80 when I spotted a glow behind the mountains to the south of the interstate, approximately three miles away. The interstate here runs southwest to northeast for about 10 miles, so the mountain range, also runs the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow would sometimes grow dimmer, then brighter, but always like a ‘moon’ glow. It was incredibly bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove along the interstate, watching the glow moving eastward along the mountain range. No light appeared above the mountain range at the point, it just moved northeastwardly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it came to the end of the mountain range, it curved and started moving north, still keeping behind the next mountain range. I kept traveling on I-80, and it kept traveling just below the top of the next mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes later, at Lovelock, I got off at the main exit, which I believe is exit 106, still watching the light as it traveled at the same rate of speed that I did. I got off the freeway and pulled over at the side of the off ramp. I stood up in the door of the truck and watched the light over the cab of the truck. I was approximately three miles from the top of the mountain range at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light lingered below the mountain tops for less than one minute, then suddenly rose up. The mountains in this range are from about 4800-6000 feet in altitude, and when the ball of light rose up, it dwarfed the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way that I can describe the size of the round light is thus: if the world were flat, and I was standing at the edge of the world, and the full moon was rising and taking up the entire horizon, that is how large this light would be. It was a lighter color than a full moon, but was the same size and shape. I cannot accurately state how large the light was, but judging from Google Earth and trying to estimate the size, it may have been up to one mile in diameter. It was certainly not much less than one mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood watching it, small lights suddenly appeared around it. Small blue and red lights blinked off and on, moving rapidly around the giant ball of light. There may have been about 10-20 of these small lights. I cannot recall exactly. But they moved extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the ball of light descended back down behind the mountain and began traveling south, in the direction from which it had came. The little colored lights stayed above the mountain tops but moved along with the initial light. The ball moved, not rapidly, not slowly, but at about the same speed it had been moving during the entire time that I had been watching it. It traveled this way for at least one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a bright light flashed, like a gigantic arc welder lighting up the eastern sky around the light, a bright, electric-type blue light -- and the ball of light disappeared completely. The little colored lights stayed for a moment longer -- perhaps two or three seconds, and then they too just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never shared this with the media of any type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is nothing located on the opposite side of the mountain range. Farther east lies the old mining town of Austin. There is a lot of military activity in the area; Fallon Naval Air Station is located within 50 miles. Shortly afterwards, I worked with a man who had retired from the Navy and after retirement had worked at the military base. I told him about the incident. He said the military could have missiles that could act like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I told him the size of the light, he became dumbfounded, and when I told him that the light turned around and changed its course, returning the direction from where it came, the only answer he had was “the military doesn’t have anything that can do that.” Evidently, the  light’s ability to maneuver in this manner was something that distinguished it from a missile. And there is no missile that could be this large or act in this manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was. I wish someone else had seen it. If anyone else did and reads this, I hope they respond so I don’t feel so alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father and I was quite curious so we went on the porch to see what was going on and my mom begged us not to go outside but of course we went anyway.  And what we saw appeared to be a UFO and I said.....What in the world it covered the whole Oak Cliff area it was a big and round shape object and the lights were outlined the object and they was constantly blinking and as the light blinked it was make a noise at the same time that I really can&#39;t describe in writing. It was down very low (Just a few ft. above the street light poles)it stayed about 5-7 minutes and then just disappeared heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
