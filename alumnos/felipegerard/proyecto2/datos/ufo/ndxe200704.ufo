These dots retained the same formation throughout the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an aura around these objects, which was not caused by my eyes, as I shielded them from the dots and could still see the aura.

The range in which the clouds were lit was only to the left and right of the dots, not above or below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout this whole observation, the dots were pulsing(approximately one second to fade in to bright, and one to fade out to dim). Every few minutes they would stop this smooth pulsing and flash, as it seemed, randomly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From 10:03PM to 10:25PM, the dots were stationary, at least 30,000 ft ASL over the ABQ area. At 10:25PM, the dots began to move, whilst retaining their formation. By 10:55PM, the dots had moved several miles west of ABQ, and descended to half of their previous altitude. I could not stay awake any longer, so I was not able to see if the dots landed, faded out, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the two video stills, one at 10x zoom, the other at 20x zoom, one can see the formation of the dots, the surrounding clouds being lit up, and the color of the dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple-type UFOs are witnessed multiple times, in multiple states, near U.S.A.F. bases in LA and CO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several other individuals and me have been observing clandestine military &#34;UFOs&#34; for approximately five years now. Two to four distinguishable crafts have been observed during this time period. The locations I speak of are Shreveport, Louisiana area and the Denver, Colorado cosmopolitan center and Bailey, Colorado, approximately 45 miles south of Denver. Both in Shreveport and in Colorado, United States Air Force Bases are nearby. In Colorado the sites are the U.S. Air Force Academy plus NORAD within Cheyenne Mountain in and near Colorado Springs. In Shreveport, Louisiana, the site is Barksdale Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will first comment on the history of others and my observations. Beginning in 2003, my brother, a friend and me began seeing large, glowing and color-changing objects over Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish about 20 miles from Shreveport and near a very small rural town called Hall Summit. Periodically, on a darkened road very near Hall Summit, LA, my brother and I (and occasionally others brought along)witnessed several aerial crafts in the night sky and depending on the evening of observation, one or more different crafts were observed. Typically, the activity in this country area peaked in the late AM hours, before dawn. However, there was some activity as long as it was dark. The most prominent and constantly witnessed UFO was a large, bright orange oval object in the sky which was capable of hovering, moving at an variable speeds, none of which were considered to be &#34;high-speeds,&#34; as seen in LA, anyway. These identical crafts were also seen hovering above the lake named above with the same light/shape configuration and rapid color changing properties. These &#34;color-changers&#34; were discoid in shape, appeared metallic and when viewed by high-magnification binoculars They all moved from side-to-side or if viewed from directly below,they made small concentric circles as if their propulsion was possibly related to the harnessing of the earth’s own (geo)electromagnetism as the movements were identical to that of two magnets of opposing poles when brought close together. The propulsion of these type crafts were silent. The most often seen color was orange, however, all colors of the visible spectrum were viewed at varying times; often the type of craft mentioned cycled through this spectrum rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;color-changers&#34; were often but not always associated with faster moving crafts we termed &#34;strobers&#34; as they displayed strobe-like qualities flashing intense bluish-white light at extremely high frequency when moving and a slower frequency when  approaching a landing area on government land, in the middle of virtually zero population. They were difficult to look upon as a prolonged gaze requires.Their propulsion was, too, silent. These crafts &#34;buzzed&#34; our vehicle at a very low altitude while stationary or when driving--multiple times over the years. I cannot comment on the shape of these crafts, due to the light intensity. These were much smaller than the above crafts that appeared at least 100-200 ft.in diameter and were rarely witnessed hovering except as they were about to land. They were capable of high-speed maneuvers such as small angle turns and abrupt stops and change of direction without deceleration. These accounts of the aerial ships seen in the country were near government owned land and is inaccessible. One evening at about 4:00 AM CST while driving on a small rural highway nearby, an orange-glowing &#34;color-changer&#34; passed over us at a very low altitude (150-200 ft. perhaps) and my bother and me were within 1 mi. of our usual observation point and we sped there, eyeing the orange ship until we reached our stationary observing position. The huge craft proceeded to land about 1000 to 2000 yards away. Two &#34;strobers&#34; buzzed by us as the larger craft passed over us toward its landing spot. Upon landing, either the orange ship’s lights were turned off or it proceeded underground. Too, we had seen lower hovering crafts &#34;cloak&#34; or shutting down their lights.These UFOs seem to be of military association. Gasoline? Free energy appears to have been harnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In Denver and Bailey CO, the hovercrafts (&#34;color-changers&#34;) were seen yet in massive numbers, at higher altitudes and typically emanating only bluish-white light. The same small movements--as if magnetically-related propulsion was used--were identical to the ships in LA. An extremely large hoverer appeared over the same mountain peak nightly and the intensity of its white light was remarkable. It was viewed from a much greater distance (~1.5-2 mi.)and using the LA crafts as a reference,was at least 1000 feet across. In Bailey, (not seen in LA) the crafts at higher altitudes often zipped away with no apparent acceleration and, too, could stop on a dime. On an average evening, barring unfavorable weather conditions, there were 30-40 of these objects scattered in the sky. Other times there were much fewer present. They were over the urban area of Denver, also, at relatively low altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not returned to the country viewing area in LA for several years. Now, the same &#34;color-changing’ discoid crafts hover over Shreveport proper, a few at higher altitudes and typically one or two at lower altitudes. The lights however appear to remain white. While hovering, if viewed from binoculars, rapid color changes are seen. Many I know have witnessed these crafts and agree they are presumably military. The last time I spent time observing one of these was April 30, 2007, with a friend, within the city, from my front porch. Their presence in the evening sky is constant. The sightings are regular yet the crafts over the city do not maneuver, they just hover and make their small nutated  movements. The fact I’ve read absolutely  no reports of these highly visible &#34;UFOs&#34;  is incredible to me. They need to be evaluated by experts with the proper equipment and brought to the largely unknowing public’s awareness given the potentiality for a cheap or free energy source. They are obviously higher aerial technology that has been disclosed and I feel as though they are at least partly used for surveillance/security. They fall under the definition of a UFO as they are not identified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two other type crafts were witnessed in the country, both similar: rectangular shuttle-like crafts heading in the direction of the Air Force base. Propulsion could be heard (a low uniform hum); these were of such a low-flying altitude (~60 ft.) that 6 (on one of these crafts) to 8 (on the other)circular propulsion devices were viewed beneath each &#34;shuttle.&#34; Windows were present on the crafts&#39; front which were very small and rectangular. Side windows were large and square with yellow light inside seen along with human shaped figures near the windows. There were no exterior lights present on either and an estimated speed of both is 40-50 mph: an atypical, very slow speed for an object of their size and apparent weight. The rectangular humming crafts appeared 40-50 ft.long by 15 ft. wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The high level of activity in the region warrants investigation. I have seen the same hover-type crafts not only in the two locations mentioned but everywhere I have traveled within the U.S. I am an M.D. and a trained observer. To let this slip by without investigation would be tantamount to continuing to allowing the government and its military to fund and operate these specialized crafts without inquiry and to continue to use hidden, inexpensive propulsion, likely in most cases presented above, to be geo-electromagnetism harnessed and likely regenerated--for free.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (You may contact me by email (or by written mail or phone if requested).<n>

The two lights moved together in a wave-like fashion, much like a sine wave with a low amplitude, like flying fish or flying snakes.  There was an airplane in the sky and the two crafts were moving about 10 times faster than the airplane, and were at a comparable altitude to the moving plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly a two craft formation as the crafts moved independently, but in the same way, so they were clearly flying in formation and rather close to each other.  As it was dark, all I could see were the steady amber lights of the crafts.  The crafts moved across much of the high-altitude skyline and and appeared over the southwestern skyline and disappeared above the northwestern skyline.  If I was the center of a circle, and the path I was viewing is thought of as an arc of a circle with me at the center, the crafts moved in an arc of about 120-150 degrees.<n>

I’ve been hearing this ongoing story throughout at my work placement at my job, people on the buses and commuter trains and even at the bar that I go to every so often. Everybody that I’ve seen or heard were talking about the missing woman from Plainfield IL as everyone had referred it as a UFO abduction that had kidnap the Plainfield woman over at Silver Springs State Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story event is about a UFO sighting taken place in some small town called Millhurst IL. Which is right next to Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County. Something about a 38-year-old mother who had taken a walk into the woods and mysteriously disappears, vanish in mid air without a trace. One evening I was scanning around on my short-wave radio station on the AM band at around 1340 KHz, I heard a small radio station which is talk-show radio program where people were calling in to this station and saying that they’ve seen this large disc shaped object with multi colored lights on it, as it was passing through Millhurst IL as it was heading towards Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One person who called into this small town radio station said that this object appears to have multi color lights and it was changing all different colors. Another person had called into the radio station and said the he was camping out at Silver Springs State Park, and saw this saucer disk shaped like object hovered towards the southwest for about 20 minutes, and then this saucer shape object had shot down a white laser beam as if it was looking for something, then it just took off way up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other phone calls had came pouring into this little radio station, in fact one person had said that she had seen from a distant had saw a young woman walking alone into the woods area, as this saucer shape object had a white laser beam had shot at this woman, as she vanish right into mid air without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if this radio station was telling the truth or making this as a phony story, by making a mountain out of a molehill? Whatever the case may be, I heard that this radio station is mostly half-fiction and half-truth, but everybody that I had run into at work on the buses and trains; just keep on talking about this strange UFO incident.<n>

The sky was bright blue with no clouds. Directly in my line of vision was a silver ball motionless in the sky. It was either very small or very high. I figured that it was either a planet somehow visible during the day or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My main concern was in trying to identify the object, so I went into my house and got my binoculars and digital camera. I got back into the hammock and attempted to look at the object through the binoculars. Because of the hammock’s movement and my arms moving I couldn’t keep the object steady in the binoculars. The image was moving back and forth so fast that I couldn’t really tell much about it except that in the binoculars it looked more cylindrical with some sort of darker areas at the ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Getting more frustrated at not being able to see the object better, I got down on the ground and tried again to get it in the binoculars. About this time I noticed that without the binoculars I couldn’t see it at all. I grabbed my camera, a Canon A610, and ran the lens out to maximum zoom including the 4X digital zoom. I took a series of 12 pictures of the area where the object had been. One of the pictures has a bright white spot that I’m sure is the object. Another picture has a small black dot that may or may not have anything to do with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole period of time that I was able to see the object was approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It never moved during that time except to fade from view at the end.<n>

The cloud, strangely enough, was almost square and about the size of my thumbnail when viewed at arms length.  I thought that to be quite odd, pointed it out to my wife and we both continued to look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the cloud slowly dissipated, fading out completely and then amazingly reappeared in the same place in much the same shape and form.  My wife, not nearly as interested as I was, watched for a second and then something in her purse, perhaps her cell phone--I don’t remember,   attracted her attention.  It was at that point that the cloud dissipated again and I saw what appeared to be a small gray craft, its features somewhat blurry and indistinct but squarish in feature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Look I said &#34;it’s a UFO,&#34; but in the fraction of a second it took for my wife to look again it was gone.   Of course she didn’t believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have submitted this report sooner but I just now found this site.   However the above report was written as soon as I got home that day - about an hour after the viewing.  I have not altered it since then.<n>

He said that the plane should be blinking because the light it had was solid.  Looking at the aircraft, I noticed that it resembled one of those planes from star wars. A circular body with to rods parallel to each other on each side of the body. We joked about it and didn&#39;t pay attention to it as it could have been some unknown plane.  I felt that this was one of the three things I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting had me baffled.  In the very far distance we saw a light, very similar to that of a star and it was moving.  We all acknowledged it and after a few seconds the light started to go very very fast to the right, then down for a short distance, move right again, down a short distance and then right one more time.  It looked like 2 steps of stairs.  Anyways, the light stopped moving and just stood there.  I was very confused and scared because I was trying to find a legitimate explanation.  I was wondering if the military had a new and very quick airplane.  While my friends and I were talking excitedly, the light seemed to have vanished.  Or maybe it just flew behind some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third sighting was odd.  I am not too sure if it was UFO but considering the strange things that we saw that night I felt I should include it here as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of the star, in the same vicinity but just lower, we noticed a bright light illuminating the sky.  At first we thought it were fire crackers because it lit that area of the sky quite well.  Then we saw a very very bright light starting to come up but then it froze in mid air.  We had a very poor position for this because my neighbor&#39;s tree was in the way but the light made it very easy to see.  We all saw this bright yellow (almost white) light through the trees branches and leaves. Then that bright light started to move up and the next thing we know, we see this aircraft to our right very low to the ground making a loud noise. It was like humming and it was very loud.  It was moving quite slow.  It first appeared from the left (where the bright light was) and then proceeded to go right.  Since it was low to the ground, we all saw it crystal clear.  Their were numerous lights on the bottom of it.  All yellowish white in color and very bight.  The outline of the aircraft was triangular and the lights were like this...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two small circles on top of each other and two cigar like lights parallel to each other and in between were those two circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, it was low to the ground and the humming sound was very audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose the first sighting was nothing.  And I suppose the third sighting could have been a military aircraft.  But what about the second sighting? what kind of aircraft can move as fast as I described and come to a complete halt?  I thought of getting a camera but I was just mesmerized and stunned by what I witnessed.  I&#39;ll try to get some pictures next time, if there is a next time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I noticed right away was the brightness of the light. Far brighter that anything I had seen. It never moved from its postition but did fade in and out. Becoming very bright.  At first I thought it was a plane but soon realized that the light was not moving.  It stayed in the same spot for at least 5 minutes and then faded from sight.  Prehaps it was my eyes playing tricks but I swear I could see an outline of a triangle.  It looked to me like it was not far above the City and not up as high as the planes here fly.<n>

They must&#39;ve been close because the lights were bigger than the average stars that are obviously seen far off.  The sighting and where I live are just 2 blocks from the shores of Lake Erie and over the town&#39;s court house/jail.  As they were moving from north to west, the one light flew around the other light as if it just needed to be on that side of the other craft.  All in all, they did not move that fast in speed.  But in timing of the whole senerio, they were there, they were gone. I was stunned to say the least.  I have never wittnessed anything like this before. It was very cool!<n>

As i watched the object i saw it hovering moving in all directions. It lasted about 5 min then it sped off to the north at a very high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was above South Mountain.  We were walking on Route 34 and directly in front of us, above the mtn, I noticed a silvery light-reflecting &#34;thing&#34;.  I told the others and we looked.  First we thought that it was a helicopter, then a small plane, then it stopped moving so we thought it was a helicopter again.  We got really creeped out when it turned and disapeared into the sky.  Not flying fast, just, disapeared!  We assumed it was a disk-shape object although we were at an extreme angle so it actually looked more like a small silvery line in the sky.  This object was EXTREMELY shiny!  We also started to think maybe a bird had a mirror or something crazy like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We calculated its size to be anything from 15 feet in length, in a horizontal position.  It looked cylindrical in shape, with &#39;fins&#39; at one end. It was a bright white color - perhaps reflecting the sun, against a clear blue sky. We didn&#39;t see any lights on it. As we drove further along our route, towards the object, we could see that it seemed to be in a static position approximately 500-1000 ft up, directly above what looked like a radio tower. There was no sound or motion observed at all, and eventually we left it behind - above the &#39;radio tower&#39;. We could not see any tether, but we are left wondering whether this could have been a simple weather balloon or similar man-made device? If so, others may have reported seeing this same object there in the past. Unfortunately, , being at the end of our holiday trip, we had no film left in the camera to photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, we are both senior citizens, in good health both physically and mentally, and our backgrounds include the arts, sales/business, and health care/medicine.

My Fiancee&#39; was digging through his wallet for his pass, and I was looking to the south, up at the sky.  The sky was bright blue and the only clouds to be seen were two thin, wispy clouds at a very high elevation.  It was a very bright and sunny day. As I looked at the sky, I noticed a flying craft appear directly in front of where I was viewing.  I had not noticed the craft at all in my peripheral vision. The craft seemed to be flying at about the elevation I see helicopters flying at frequently.  Maybe a little higher.  The craft had the look like it was surrounded by a haze, and it appeared to be a solid dark grey color.  It also looked like it was flat on the bottom and hill shaped on top.  I did not see any wings or propellers on the craft.  It was flying in an easterly direction, and it appeared to be going pretty slow. Slower than I&#39;ve ever seen an airplane fly.   It appeared to be gliding along.  I didn&#39;t really think much about the craft, figuring it was probably a helicopter or something, until it disappeared right in front of me.  I observed the craft for probably a couple of seconds, and then it appeared to fade and disappear completely.  It did not reappear.  I was going to say something to my fiancee&#39;, but, he was busy with the cashier, and I really didn&#39;t believe my own eyes enough to tell my fiancee&#39; that I thought I saw a ufo.  I stared at the spot where I had seen it, hoping it would reappear, when ANOTHER craft materialized where the last one had.  This one was a little higher in elevation (not much) than the previous one.  It looked identical to the previous craft and was moving at the same speed.  This time I wanted to tell my fiancee so that I could have another witness, but he was still talking to the cashier.  It glided by for a couple of seconds and then proceeded to fade and disappear at about the same spot as the previo! us craft I think from the time I saw the crafts to the time they disappeared they might have traveled 1/4 mile.  They were moving very very slow.  There wasn&#39;t anything blocking my sight anywhere around me.  I had a clear view all around me of the sky.  I continued to watch for another couple of minutes to see if they did infact reappear somewhere else, but, I did not see the crafts anytime again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/28/07 22:06|Santa Rosa|CA|Light|2 sec|Meteor-like object seen while watching an Iridium flare.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56616.html|23|ndxe200704| Meteor-like object seen while watching an Iridium flare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to Heavens Above, a very bright (-8 magnitude) flare from Iridium 49 was visible from my location. It was to be seen in the ENE at 39 degrees elecation, starting at 22:06:06. The distance of the flare center from my location was 2.7 km.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flare (a reflection of the sun) came right on time, but because my eyes were fixed on a spot a little higher up and a little further north, I missed the beginning of the flare. I did catch it in the corner of my eye and looked directly at it when it was at its brightest. The flare was quite spectacular but it faded quickly. The duration of the flare was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than 2 seconds after the flare had faded from view, a bright and very fast moving light came from the north, heading south. It flew horizontally less than 5 degrees below where the flare had been. I saw the moving light first in that location and followed it until it was obscured by a tree. The entire event lasted no more than 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object (light) had the general appearance of a meteor but it looked like no meteor I had ever seen and I have seen my share of them. Besides, meteors do not fly parallel to the ground. The head was about the diameter of three Jupiters (or about 2 arc minutes in angular size. The front was convex and the back was concave. Two very  thin &#34;streamers&#34; came off the end points on the concave end. The color of the light was white with a yellowish tint. It remained steady in intensity over the brief duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated the angular distance between the location of the Iridium flare (and the appearance of the object) and where the tree blocked the object as about 45 degrees. The object traversed that distance in 1.5 seconds. These facts give the object an angular speed of 30 degrees per second. That it ten times faster than the Space Shuttle flying over CA for a landing in FL, and 60 times faster than the angular speed of the ISS (International Space Station) when it passes overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brief duration of my observation leaves me with the impression that the object was not at a very high altitude, although I have no facts to support that impression. If the object was as low as 10 000 feet, my calculations show that it flew at a speed of 1.26 miles/second, or more than 4500 miles/hour. If it was at any higher altitude, its speed would have been proportionately faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then there is the element of coincidence that I find difficult to accept. How can two visually spectacular but otherwise totally unrelated events occur in the same patch of sky at essentially the same time. What are the odd??  What did I see. Can someone enlighten me?<n>

The sky was clear and windy and cold. The moon was almost full. The wind kicked up quite a bit and I saw a patch of clouds pas by the moon. Just then to my left, I observed 2 bright spheres traveling across the sky. The one sphere was steady and the other was moving around it. The one sphere was on top and then it would move around to the front of it and below, very eradictly. I observed these spheres for about 15-20 seconds. they moved faster than any airplane i have ever seen and they were above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just out of curiosity, I glanced at it several seconds later and was surprised to see the bright orange light vanish suddenly and completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not seen anything of that nature before and have no knowledge of what behaves like that.<n>

It was much faster than an airplane (or even a military type jet) and there was no sound associated with it.  It looked like two lights that were connected or two lights moving with extreme precision in tandem.  I said to my husband &#34;look at that -- what is that?&#34; And he looked up and saw them just before they disappeared to the north of us.  He agreed they looked unlike anything we&#39;d ever seen before.  It wasn&#39;t a spotlight and it did not look like a meteor or shooting star.  It looked like two lights that were connected in some way moving very quickly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I stepped outside I looked in the sky and noticed a white light in the sky above the trees.  It was in a sort of triangular shape and looked completely out of place.  It resembled a white street light that was not supported by a pole but just suspended in midair.  It did not move in any direction but quickly faded out and was gone in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly went into the dispatcher&#39;s office as the dispatcher was the only other person there that night and told her all about it while I tried to get my thoughts back together.  I later called the nearby airport and asked a guy in the tower if they were sending off weather balloons or if he had gotten a report of something like this.  He said that they weren&#39;t sending off weather balloons but he did recieve a report of a similar object 2 weeks prior from someone in a nearby community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best explanation for the object is that it was an airplane moving away from my direction which gave the illusion that it wasn&#39;t moving and that it appeared to fade away when it got far enough.  The airport is close by and I know what airplanes look like flying over at night but this was very different and I haven&#39;t seen anything like it since that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were hanging out in my car on Friday April 27 around 11:45pm. We are both 18, in honors classes, and have never seen something like this before. We don’t believe in UFO’s but like to keep an open mind. She was laying on the backseat when she told me to look at the sky. I didn&#39;t quite understand what she was talking about, but she repeated herself and when I looked up through the window, the sky flashed and the whole sky was illuminated, but there was no sound. It lasted for almost a second and it appeared that the eastern part of the sky was where the illumination’s origin was from. The light wasn&#39;t as bright as daytime illumination, but was a little dimmer, most closely resembling the lighting conditions found not quite at dusk, but around 5pm when the sky begins to dim. It looked exactly like sheet lightening but there was no sound of thunder and it illuminated the entire night sky. After this last flash, emergency vehicles sirens seemed to appear all around us, gradually moving east. This period of constant sirens lasted for between 5-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I further asked her about the flash, she said that the first time she told me to look, there had been three flashes in quick succession, with the first two flashes having a shorter interval than the interval between the second and third. Three flashes again occurred after this, with a gap of around 15-30 seconds between the two sets. The flashes were again irregularly spaced according to her, but occurred very quickly. She said that I had seen the very last flash in the last sequence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes illuminated the entire night sky and for this reason other people on the road must have seen them. I&#39;m curious as to if anyone has reported night sky flashes on April 27, 2007 to your establishment or if you know what could have caused these flashes. I would be very grateful if you could email me any information that you know or have on this subject as my girlfriend and I are very puzzled as to what could have caused this and why nothing about was reported in the media (we checked the following two days and found nothing).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I often scan the skies for anything interesting, and I noticed what appeared to be a distant and slow moving object at about the 10 o&#39;clock position traveling from north to south. I went inside to get my Kodak P712 digital camera, which has a 10x optical zoom lens, hoping to get a better look. Upon, returning I did not see the object, and thought it might have passed behind a cloud.  I sat back down to enjoy the sunset, and after a few minutes a bright pinpoint of light caught my eye off to my left as it continued moving slowly south through a clear patch of sky at about the 11 o&#39;clock position. I could see the bright spot very clearly, and was able to point it out to my 5 year old son. My wife, who was also present, did not see it; she had been facing the opposite direction.  I momentarily lost sight of it while readying my camera, but decided to snap some photos of the area anyway. I was very pleased when one of them captured the object. My only regret was that the camera was set to 3.1-mega pixels instead of its maximum of 7.2-mega pixels. The object was definitely three dimensional, and traveling at a slight upwards angle as it moved from north to south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine once said that he did not believe in UFO’s, and if they were real, how come he had never seen one? My only question to him was “How often do you look up”?<n>

I walk the dogs at night out on the court yard lawn to my apartment complex on the border of Cranbury/East Windsor I have no obstruction to the night sky and not to mention my apartment resides on the second floor which faces west but I can see from the direction of north,west,a little east, and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway long story short the so called UFO this person was seeing is exactly as the police dept mentioned. It was spotlight for event gathering in plainsboro neighboring town. I cannot believe someone would stare at the same light rotating for 75 minutes and come to a conclusion that it is a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the other hand I have purchased a HDD camcorder with 80gig drive (HDD HARD DISK DRIVE) SOny I leave it running at night aimed out at the night sky and run it all night then during the day scan through in fast motion hoping to find some oddity. If I ever capture something I will post it here because evidence is what people want and its more credible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 3/30/2007 23:12 (Entered as : 03/30/2007 23:12) Reported: 3/31/2007 10:36:33 PM 22:36 Posted: 4/27/2007 Location: East Windsor (Cranbury), NJ Shape: Light Duration:Around 75 Minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I stopped for a minute and realized that it was changing it&#39;s shape. From an oval to a circle. It was shining very bright. A yellow object with a green outline. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I used my cellphone to take two pictures. At first, I didn&#39;t really think it was an UFO because I don&#39;t actually believe in those things, but I&#39;m not so sure any more.&#34; said the eyewitness. The picture was taken in Knin (Croatia).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Image was taken by Cyber-shot™ Sony Ericsson’s 3.2 megapixel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> forwarded from: http://life4tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=39&amp;lang=en<n>

The object passed under the moon and revealed a diamond shaped metalic form at aproxmatley 10,00 feet elevation. I watched the object for a few minutes noticing that it did not have the standard light configuration that is typical of modern commercial and military aircraft.(No blinking lights just an intense magnesium type light). It vanished shortly after passing out of the moons halo. Abilene is home to Dyess Air Force Base and I see military and civilian aircraft all of the time but this was something I have never seen before.The fact that it disappeared in an absolutly clear west texas sky considering it s phenominal brightness is weird to say the least.The object traveled approx 12 miles during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up to see if I could identify some constellations I have become familiar with, and I thought I spotted the three white stars of Orion’s Belt just slightly west of directly above me.  I debated whether it was Orion’s Belt or not, because I was pretty sure I had been seeing the Belt in another location in the sky on previous nights.  While I wondered about it, my eyes drifted to another spot in the sky.  Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I could see that the middle of the three stars now appeared to be moving.  I asked my fiancé if he was seeing what I was seeing, and he said he was.  While we watched, the unblinking white light continued traveling west very slowly.  I don’t believe it was an airplane because of the slow rate of speed which commenced from a stop and there were no standard flashing lights.  I don’t believe it was a meteor, as I have never seen one move so slowly and only be visible in such a small area of the sky.  As soon as both of our attention was focused back on the light, it traveled just a second or two longer, grew just a little brighter and then just disappeared.  It ceased to be seen in the sky any longer.  I don’t know what it was, but after debating over whether or not to report what we had seen, I finally decided to do so.  I am Personal Assistant and Marketing Lead for my fiancé’s martial arts schools.  He is, of course, owner/operator of the schools as well as a Department Manager for a North State Grocery company.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My attention was drawn to a bright light approximately southeast and 80 degrees above the horizon from our position. The altititue was unable to be determined but jet contrails appeared to be below the level of the light. The bright light decended irratically and then appeared to reach a steady flight path or level travel of flight.  No contrail or visual evidence of the flight path was apparent.  The light slowly dimmed and disappeared.  My wife and daughter also witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note:  This sighting appears similar to the Reno, NV sighting that occured at the same date and time.  I am hesitant to report this sighting due to my profession.  I have reported one other sighting when I lived in Tillamook, OR.  I am willing to talk to an investigator but I would respectfully request that my identity be kept confindential.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At about 10-15,000 feet it shifted to a level flight with the ground.  After about 20 seconds in level flight it dimmed out.  It had no flashing or color lights.  It was one single color of white, and was about as bright as a neighbors 40 watt light bulb.<n>
4/26/07 18:30|Fort Davis|TX|Disk|5 minutes|Daylight reporting of a large saucer shaped UFO in West Texas|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63663.html|48|ndxe200704| Daylight reporting of a large saucer shaped UFO in West Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April, 26th(Thursday), 2007, a group of four of us were traveling North to Miter Peak in West Texas, on Highway 90 from Alpine, Texas, close to Fort Davis. I did not take down the exact time but it was daytime and about twenty to thirty minutes before sunset. The driver of the van we were in saw the UFO and said, &#34;That is why people believe in UFO&#39;s&#34; and then said, &#34;Look at that!&#34; Three of us saw the saucer to shaped UFO that filled the saddle between two mountains to the West. The fourth passenger is visually impaired and could not see the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was up off the ground about 100 feet. It was the shape of two symmetrical wide shaped saucers with a small (1/3rd the size of the top side of the saucer) top hat looking top. The sides of the top were vertical and the very top was circular and flat. The coloration was a shade of silver that looked liked machined steel in coloration. There were no other visible markings, windows, lights, or anything else that wwere observable. It was daylight and the sun was shinning down on the top. On the bottom the UFO was dark but distinct against the skyline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the UFO had to be very large. I am guessing the size of a WWII battleship but perhaps it was smaller. It filled the center of the saddle of two mountains about two miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver continued driving while we were trying to figure out what to do. We drove for about a minute with the UFO still in sight and we all began to pull out cell phone cameras. We pulled over and got out of the van but the UFO had moved North about ten miles away in one moment and stopped slightly above the horizon. By the time we took pictures it had moved again only slightly more Easterly direction and another ten miles or so away. The UFO was small but distinctive on the horizon about twenty miles away but could not be distinguished on my cell phone pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have made a report of something sooner if I had a good picture of this daylight sighting of a UFO but with all of the news about UFO&#39;s in West Texas, I thought it might be a good thing to report. I looked all over the internet to see if any of the pictures of UFO&#39;s matched the one we saw but none were the exact symmetrical shape or the top was rounded top where this UFO’s very top was flat. I hope that reporting this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a tornado near Fort Davis on April 29, 2007. I doubt this is UFO related but I thought I would report it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/26/07 11:55|Hiko|NV|Unknown|3 minutes|Hovering orb, brilliant illumination, falling debris, vehicle collision with objects|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88691.html|49|ndxe200704| Hovering orb, brilliant illumination, falling debris, vehicle collision with objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a prelude to subsequent events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 26, 2007 at 11:55 a.m., my husband and I were traveling south in our 18-wheeler through the Nevada desert when a series of dramatic events took place!  We felt a &#34;concussion&#34; of some sort and everything became brighter.  We witnessed several meteorites hit the ground directly near us (some still showing a tail behind them as they hit), and many, many shadows passed over us.  One, in particular, was extremely large and made a loud &#34;whoosh&#34; sound as it passed overhead.  I looked forward and there was a large orange, brownish color meteorite heading directly toward us out of the heavens.  I said to my husband, &#34;it&#39;s gonna hit us,&#34; and braced for the impact.  While waiting for the impact, another one headed toward us in a swooping upward direction from the gully on the right side of the highway as if it had ricocheted off another rock or something. It became suspended in mid air right in front of me, four feet away from the windshield!  This one was round, the size of my fist! and looked like a molten ball of solid bubbling gold!  The larger one that I was bracing for must have missed us by inches, if that!  Since we were traveling at 70 m.p.h., we believe it was more likely wind force that then flung this second one to the right side of our truck where it landed on our air breather with a very loud crash and hissing noises. It then flipped back up onto the lower right hand corner of our windshield, spinning and chipping the windshield as it spun across to the center. It stopped or got “hung-up” right in front of us on the windshield for a brief moment as if it were frozen in time, and began screeching, hissing and sounding as if it were emitting electrical charges like it was going to explode or something. Then it flipped up underneath our visor bending the frame, and hit the sleeper. At that same instant, two other meteorites impacted with the top front of our trailer causing a momentum delay in our forward motion. The marks on our trailer are! approximately 4&#34; wide and 9&#34; wide, and the hits on the sleepe! r made a 2&#34; diameter paint chip and smudges of some sort. I forgot to mention that during this incident I saw what appeared to be black globules falling within a foot of my window along the side of the highway and collected some of this material for research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately contacted a meteorite laboratory (we will leave unnamed at this time). After hearing our story, examining our truck and taking photos, the lab representative told us that he knew of only one other instance of a meteorite striking a moving vehicle in this manner and that it was just a small stone that was never found.  He continued to agree that our incident is an extreme, very big story, and that he had connections to get the story out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that date we have collected numerous rock specimens, including the items we came face to face with, along with photos and other strange material from our “fall” site. We have shown the meteorite lab many, many specimens and each time they come up with a different reason why these items are not involved in our fall, yet we are the eye-witnesses who were directly involved. They tell us the rock specimens are earthly &#34;basalt,&#34; or  “rocks with desert varnish,&#34; and things that do not make common sense about other items we have shown them. Nor would they explain why our fireball and meteorite report was not filed or even if anyone else had reported a fireball on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found a photo of a shiny golden meteorite that looked exactly like what we saw, and the lab representative appeared extremely shocked at what he was looking at. He turned green and threw himself back in his chair. Then he stated &#34;Oh, that&#39;s an achondrite - those are rare.&#34; He then admitted that he would not even recognize one if he held it in his hand because they are too similar to earthly rocks and would have to be tested. We told him time and time again that what we saw was yellowish in color and he kept telling us to go look for a black one. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter how heavy or solid they are, the appearance of metal and possibly olivine and pyroxene materials inside of them, or the fact that magnets are attracted to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As of this date, our story has not been reported and/or told to the general public.  Although we could have easily been killed and were involved in such an extreme incident unlike has  happened before, we cannot even get scientific interest, documentation or recognition regarding this event.  We are only told &#34;no&#34; even without further investigation and/or examination.<n>

As I came to the end od the trial about 300 yards to where it meets the San Francisco bay, I saw 2 figures and a large object out of the corner of my eye to my right about 200 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occasionally I am looking down at the gravel road as I am riding and as I began to look up I saw the figures. This startled me, causing me to veer into thick gravel and look away from the figures as I tried to regain control. I quickly came to a stop and looked to my right just as the figures which appeared to be looking at me turned away and began walking away as they suddenly became translucent and faded away. Immediately afterwards the large object that was about 50 feet in length which I had not focused on also became translucent and faded away.  All of this occurred in 5 seconds or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do wear prescription glasses, I am near sighted, I did not have them on and I am not required to wear them while driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to focus to see if I could still see them again but I did not. I then began to look around me as I sensed a presence near me. This spooked me and I quickly got back on my bike and began to peddle away towards the bay. I stopped about half way and began looking around again, but saw and sensed nothing. I then went to the end of the trail and waited there probably 15 minutes and was spooked again by what sounded like foots steps on the gravel. I then got back on my bike and I took the longer more difficult route along the dikes towards the Dumbarton Bridge instead of going back in the same direction that I had originally came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I had seen 3 UFOs in my life, 1 of which occurred on the Menlo Park side of the Dumbarton Bridge around the time and before the lights sighted by many in Phoenix Arizona in 1997. These lights were very similar, were south west of Menlo Park/Palo Alto. There where 5 lights all in a row and they did not move. A passenger plane also passed behind them. I did not stay long maybe a couple of minutes as I called my brother on my cell phone and left him a message telling him what I was seeing. I was very excited when I saw the original news footage covering the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; as it was very much what I had witnessed just a short while before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was on Town Center Blvd in Orlando Florida heading towards landstar.  I was going over a bridge when suddenly, I noticed to my right, above the trees four red lights.  I would say they looked like lights one would see on a call phone tower; only there was no tower.  They looked as if they were about 100ft apart from each other in a box formation.  It seemed like a rectangle, but more like a square.  The lights lasted for about 30 seconds.  Then after about 30 seconds, they vanished.  I had no idea what I saw, but there were four red lights suspended in the air over a patch of trees.  I was very frightened, needless to say.  This all happened a little after 3:00AM, it was a Monday.  I’m sorry that I cannot remember the exact day it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It all happened so fast, I barely had time to gasp.  And yet, it was so very clear, there was no mistaking it really happened, and was not anything like I have ever seen before, and it moved so fast, like something not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

4/25/07 13:00|Albuquerque|NM|Rectangle|2.5 minutes|White rectangle seen falling and then speeding off apparently under power of two "cones" of orange lights that suddenly came out|3/16/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87662.html|54|ndxe200704| White rectangle seen falling and then speeding off apparently under power of two &#34;cones&#34; of orange lights that suddenly came out<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a technical writer with a degree in geology.  On 4/25/07, I was at a meeting being held near the local airport and Kirtland AFB. I went outside during a lunch break and was just standing on the sidewalk, relaxing with a cigarette (sorry!), looking around. Several people were walking to their cars, etc. However, I was apparently the only person who looked up and saw what appeared to be a very stiff piece of white paper or cardboard in the air, seemingly close by and floating down toward the ground in a back and forth motion. (I feel like wincing since it seems so trite, but it was making that classic &#34;falling leaf&#34; motion that so many people report.)   It did not bend as a I expect a piece of paper would, but remained stiff the entire way down.  It had about the same relative dimensions of 8.5 X 11 paper, which is what I first assumed it was, and was coming down with the longest side on the vertical axis. The shorter, top side was tilted toward me at about 20 degrees, which became progressively more acute until the &#34;flat&#34; side was almost horizontal to the ground.  However, I could continue to see almost the entire rectanglular shape. I thought this was odd as I shouldn&#39;t have been able to see that much of the rectangle if the object were as small and as close to me as I thought it was (I wasn&#39;t directly under the object so, if it was a piece of paper at that angle and assumed distance, I should have seen no more than a sliver of the rectangle from the new angle).  I did not have any sense of there being any substantial &#34;depth&#34; to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, believing this was an 8.5 X 11 piece of stiff paper, I thought to myself that it would surely hit me in the face very shortly.  However, as time went on, this &#34;piece of paper&#34; did not appear to get any closer to me as it was falling, which also convinced me that it was much larger and much higher than I originally estimated.  This made me more curious so I continued to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After at least 2 minutes of slowly falling back and forth, and slowly tilting from vertical to horizontal, the object seemed to catch an updraft and went spiraling back up very quickly.  It started with wide circles that got progressively tighter and tighter until it suddenly stopped moving after about 10 seconds. At its greatest height, it once again started falling toward the ground in the &#34;falling leaf&#34; motion, only was now oriented horizontally to the ground.  This time it fell for only about 15 seconds before it again spiraled upward for about 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was then astounded to see two garish, neon-like orange &#34;cones&#34; of light/flame suddenly spew out of the northernmost face of the rectangle and the entire object quickly and silently left the area very steadily and heading southeast in a straight line. It no longer looked like a piece of paper, but looked like a rectangular vehicle that was being confidently driven. It&#39;s trajectory should have taken the object directly over the airport, if not also the air force base. It was out of sight in less than 5 seconds and never deviated from it&#39;s beeline course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to the meeting, I did tell my coworkers what I had seen. I had never seen a UFO and had never heard of a rectangular one. I thought at first it may have been a giant piece of cardboard that had presented some &#34;flip&#34; side to me that had orange cone shapes painted onto it, creating an optical illusion. However, the white rectangle did not change its height/width ratio as one would expect if one side were completely white and the flip side was only 2/3 white. (The orange flame-like cones were about 1/2 the size of the rectangle. If they were painted on there, the rectangle on the painted side should have looked more like a square). At any rate, I do not know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About two weeks later, one of my coworkers excitedly told me she had heard there had been sightings of a similar object in Alaska around the same time, but I was never able to find any such reports. I called MUFON to see if they had reports like mine, but they said they hadn&#39;t heard of any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE TO EDITOR: I have two more odd occurrences to report which I will be doing under separate cover.  They are each unique and would be just a mishmash of sightings over the years if I were to combine them here.  I was diagnosed as terminally ill recently and wanted to document my UFO-ish experiences before I am no longer able.  This is most certainly not exaggerated, embellished, or fabricated (it&#39;s not that great or dramatic of a sighting anyway); but I freely admit it may have been nothing more than an optical illusion.  Nevertheless, this experience has always puzzled me, especially since finding out that there are, indeed, rectangular UFOs. Were it not for the cones of orange light/flame popping out just before the object took off on its steady southeast course (after acting like nothing more than debris in the air for several minutes), I probably would have forgotten about it, but now I just don&#39;t know what I saw that day.<n>

I live in north India. I have witnessed a strange happening and I was unintentionally involved in it. I still doubt what actually I saw but I am sure that whatever it was, it was not human. Not even earthly. It was God, devil or an alien. It had tremendous energy and I felt the force in the proximity of the thing. In fact I fainted due to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I was coming home at around 2:00 AM as I work in an MNC and do night shifts. Suddenly the road disappeared in front of me. There was a huge bus like thing with no wheels, hovering over the road, blocking it. I flashed the high beam to get a better look. The thing then split into two. There was a bright flash of light- brighter than anything I have seen. For a moment it seemed almost like daytime. A creature descended from the machine and looked at me. I was so scared that I turned the car’s lights off. I kept the engine running so that I can escape in event of an attack. But the creature did not seem to bother about me. It looked like a human but around 7-8 feet tall and quite huge, bulky and hairy like a bear. And the head was slightly bigger than that of an average human. It was carrying an instrument that looked like a crystal cube with a handle. The creature just raised the instrument and waved it. Then it took out a box like thing and put the instrument in it. Then it approached my car. As it neared my vehicle, I felt heat and force of high magnitude. When it was around a yard away from me I fainted due to the intense pressure- like G force. I regained consciousness after about 10 minutes and the thing was gone. It left a hole of about 1 feet depth and 10-12 feet in diameter on the road where it was hovering. I just rushed to home. I was not able to sleep for whole day. Next day while going to office I stopped at the spot and the strange thing was that the road had been repaired. The question I have is that when the creature approached my car, why did it leave me and my car unharmed?   Regards, Elvin.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We have seen many things in the nights sky that we cannot explain. Tonight was a little different. We saw multiple bright objects in the sky that seem to be paralell to each other. A great distance apart. These light were moving very fast as if they were moving in a circle and up and down in all directions. They would stop for a short time and start moving again. My brother and I seemed to think there was a pattern after staring at them for a long time. The moon was very bright tonight and there were two straight across from each other, one being closest to the moons light and was moving in all directions but staying in the same area where we first saw it. Anyway, after watching these for a long time I thought I would try and find some information about posting what we saw tonight. Well, If anyone else has seen the same, we would love to chat about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The lights had a red tint and were brighter than a normal star or planet. They were not very far apart, maybe the width of two fingers if viewed from an out-stretched hand. A few seconds later, the same pattern appeared about 30 degrees to the north. I had the sense that no normal aircraft could have covered that amount of distance in that short of time. The lights stayed on for a few seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later, a single light was seen for a few seconds. At this point, I went inside a told my wife and daughter. About ten minutes later, another display occurred, which was witnessed by all three of us. This time, there was a larger light, consisting of three segments, plus two small lights to the right of the big light. All lights in the whole episode had the red tint. They always appeared for several seconds and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At their next appearance, the lights seemed to put on the grand finale.  At least six lights appeared. They seemed to move. It was an awesome display. I want to see them again.<n>

As I approached the window, the light remained in a fixed position as it flipped upward into a semi-circle triangle, composed of three distinct semi-circles. Slowly it began to move from southeast to north across the sky. The lights lingered within a thin, low, transparent cloud, illuminating the cloud, I got a good look but I could not detect any cohesive form holding the lights togeather. There was no other hint of shape or sound.  My window was open.  As the cloud drifted revealing the black sky, the lights moved quickly north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Then I really started looking at it and it was moving back and forth in the sky, when the object was moving fast it was blinking a reddish color, when it slowed down and was moving more in a straight line than curving upwards that’s when the light would get extremely bright and more of a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also cats; I saw at least three to four different cats walk across during the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another one of my employees came out and then we started taking pictures. When we zoomed in on the picture it was an oval shape. I didn’t see the object disappear but it did go behind trees until I couldn’t see it anymore. I talked to one of the witnesses the next morning and he said he saw it again on the way home that night, but that it was closer to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the light outside of work we could tell that it was getting closer to us, and we could also tell when it was moving farther away.  It was definitely moving faster than a plane, or helicopter, and the way it slowed down, and how the lights were moving on it- there was at least three different lights on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Much larger than a plane, and the way it maneuvered in the sky was unlike any plane-much bigger than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM:  Witness called on May 11, 2007, to state that she was facing east, at the time of her sighting.  If this report is correct, the object could not have been Venus, as we suggest above, but we do not have confirmation of the witness&#39;s estimate of direction.  PD))<n>

I noticed it about 11 pm while watching for a reported meteor shower expected.  I noticed at first it was entremely bright. Then noticed that an obvious commercial aircraft seemed to be heading for it.  The questioned unidentified aircraft &#34;flashed&#34; lights at the commercial aircraft and the commercial aircraft veered away to an entirely different direction of travel. I got out binoculars and looked closer at the unknown &#34;light&#34; in the sky and realized it was NOT something normal.  It appeared to be cigar or saucer shaped with 4 very bright lights acroos.  Occasionally the lights would dim to the point of being not visible to the naked eye. While observing thru the binoculars I observed that when this happened, the lights on the craft would change shape becoming shaped like a blackslash which grew more and more narrow, over a period of several seconds.  Then the lights would open fully again becoming very very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this aircraft for approximately 2 1/2 hours.  During this time NO airplanes whatsoever flew over, which is quite unusual because this is a normal regularly busy flight path for San Francisco airport as well as San Jose. The craft simply hovered there in place.  There has NEVER been anything shaped even similarly in the sky, there is no way this could have been an airplace, helicopter, nothing commonly known.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my brother, who lives several miles closer to the approximate estimated spot the craft was hovering.  He went outside and IMMEDIATELY spotted it and said, oh *hit, I think we are in trouble.  He too observed the lights on it changing but described that as a &#34;sweeping&#34; function, as tho the craft were searching around it&#39;s perimiter, then would return to the simple hovering state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed my cell phone reception was very poor during this time - background noise, static, bleedover noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a point of observing for a long time, so that i would be certain this was not a product of my imagination or blurred vision or misinterpretation.  IT WAS NOT.<n>

Their distances were evenly spaced out, and the object&#39;s exterior lights seemed to pulsate. As they were grouped, they were moving at somewhat of a straight line. They were moving straight, parallel to the mountains, and slowly changed their position SE of the mountains. The shape I could not tell, because they were pretty high up in the air, but their pattern of movement could not have been that or a normal aircraft, because there are not airports in Pasadena. I wear glasses, but can see well. My niece was with me, and she saw exactly what I saw, and she has 20/20 vision. There were no clouds, nor anything that would distort visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/23/07 08:00|Elmore|AL|Triangle|10 minutes|A seemingly cloaked or disguised craft|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56408.html|72|ndxe200704| A seemingly cloaked or disguised craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4/23/07 Elmore, Alabama<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a Correctional Officer with the Alabama Department of Corrections and work at one of the prisons in Elmore County, Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon.  What we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from Star Trek, &#34;cloaked,&#34; so as to be unseen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened:   It was around 8:00 AM and was the morning count time and I was a dorm officer.  My dorm partner and myself counted &#34;A&#34; side of the dorm. Then as she went through the &#34;cube&#34; in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side I went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. As I was walking along I felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. I thought; What in the world? It is a nice day, where did that come from?  I looked in the direction of &#34;B&#34; Dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me I had to shield my face and eyes.  It was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. But to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when I looked up.  A dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip.   But what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny.  I wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!? 	  As I stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the &#34;camp&#34; (slang name for a prison) it I noticed a group of officers, &#34;Yard Rovers,&#34; standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. I then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. But others watched it until it was out of site (see below).<n> <n><n> <n><n> But it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. It was as I said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. It was not shaped like any cloud that I have ever seen. It was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. And above this aft end was a section of it, of &#34;cloud &#34;,  that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. All along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated.  Sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind.  That stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. Then a bit later a single word came to me, &#34;artificial!&#34;  That was what I was trying to think of , what was nagging at me!  It had almost an artificial look to it!!  Maybe I have been a &#34;Trekky&#34; too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like &#34;Star Wars&#34; and &#34;Star Trek.&#34;   But the terminology on Star Trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a &#34;Cloaking Device!&#34;  Something similar is what the United States was trying to perfect with the &#34;Philadelphia Experiment&#34; during WWII. That experiment failed as far as I know and cost the military some lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But not wanting to be laughed at I kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. But as it turns out I was not the only one who had witnessed it! 	  Later, as the day was winding down, and I having forgotten it,  three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something..  It dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing I had seen!  But they had more to tell;  One commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called &#34;cloud.&#34;  They agreed that it was sort of like the &#34;fore blast&#34; in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does.  Someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the &#34;cloud.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> One officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it,  kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something.  Another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the &#34;back&#34; or aft end of some sort of craft visible.  She said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that I had seen trailing behind it.   And then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the &#34;fore blast&#34; of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased.  	   That last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called UFO landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered! 	  One of the rovers said that he had been going to the Back-Gate at the time to let in the &#34;Farm Squad&#34; inmates. He chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. And he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the Farm Boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp?  This Farm Boss more or less saw and felt the same things too.  Of course by then I had chimed in with what I saw, my observations, and my feelings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as I am asked,&#34;Officer Edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow &#34;Cloaked&#34; or in some kind of disguise?  I readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien UFO of some sort of a top secret craft of the United States, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise.  I of course even commented that I had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft: One;  it was flying too fast,  Two;  it kept a set course until out of site,  and Three; it retained it shape until it was out of site.  And Four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment.  She said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then they all agreed that they had seen  three Air Force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the &#34;cloud&#34; but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it.  At that time we called Channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over Elmore, Autauga counties. The guy I spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now these officers that saw this: I have right at14 years in with the Alabama Department of Corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over.  They all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional Correctional Officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only APOST Certified Correctional Training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the &#34;sighting,&#34; that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. I told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am tendering this report in the hopes that perhaps someone might find it interesting, might even already know about it, or to see if others have reported any thing similar..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely yours,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elmore.,  Al.<n>

When our aircraft was less than four hours from destination, perhaps in the vicinity of Iceland, sometime after 5 a.m. GMT, the sky was still dark.  While my sister went to the lavatory, I moved over into her window seat to see if there was light on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Situated several rows behind the port wing, I noticed a spherical red light toward the rear of the aircraft. At first, I wondered if it was attached to the tail, since it appeared close and much larger than the stars, the same apparent size as the wing light, though less bright.  That I immediately ruled out, as it was too far away from the plane.  It was impossible to tell if this sphere was a glowing object at some distance or a light on some larger, dark object at closer range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my sister returned we both observed this light – not the regular wing lights and strobe of conventional skycraft, but a single, deep red light or glowing orb that flew at our altitude, keeping pace exactly with our airliner.  We watched it a good thirty seconds before it veered off to the side and receded quickly into the distance.  We must have been flying in some cloud cover because the red object appeared to be increasingly enveloped in fog, the farther away it traveled.  This probably indicates it was closer than another plane should have been or it would have been obscured in the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon landing, I decided to quiz the captain, who stood outside the cockpit as we deplaned.  &#34;Did you see that red bogey that was pacing us on the port side at around 5 o&#39;clock?&#34; I asked rather loudly.  He replied that he hadn&#39;t, chuckled and said jokingly, “It might have been a UFO.”  It was there long enough that I don&#39;t know how he could have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told all the people we visited in England about our sighting, and one woman said she was relieved to hear someone else describe such a thing, because she had seen something very similar on a night flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will gladly speak with any investigator interested in this sighting but doubt there is anything further I could add to this report.<n>

I than told him about the noise and he he also heard the same noise.  When I observed the sky as I stepped out of my car I noticed two arched white clouds, like what you would see from a jet but but they were near ten times the width of what is normal to see from my yard.

There were some neighbor kids playing ball in the street.  I overheard them say, &#34;What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at them; they were looking in the sky.  I saw what started out as a dark circle moving slowly across the sky; as it moved it rotated around where I could see it was flat or like a disk; then it would continue rolling and it was a circle again.  Kind of like a Frisbee rolling from top to bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called to my wife, she came out, ran back in to grab the binoculars, she said it was gray with dots on it.

This sighting occured between 4:00 and 5:00 in the evening.  At first my boyfriends cousin saw what he thought were constilations in mid-day but as he kept looking at them the &#34;constilations&#34; kept moving into different formations.  These formations were changing pattern in groups of two&#39;s, three&#39;s and fours.  He came into the house and needed witness to what he had had seen.  When we joined him outside it appeared to be what he had descibed to us.  The patterns of light seemed to be hiding behind the clouds. During this time aircraft were in the vacinity and we were unsure if they had seen them.  A few minutes later we noticed a steamline of jets pass through the formations.  As they proceeded through the sky the formation of lights looked as if they had followed the streamline of the aircraft.  As the sky cleared, little by little the formations desinigrated until they were no longer visible.<n>

My boyfriend (laying on my left) points out that he sees a star-like object above him (coming towards us) pointing it out and I could not see anything right away until he noticed it now above the tree line to my right so it made an L shape from above him to the right of me. Many planes were visible that day and this object was higher than any plane could go and pretty quick. It continued from that tree line straight away from us again so its path was like an open box shape then I lost the object because it went to far away.<n>

On April 22 2007, the Blue Angels team performed again even after the crash had occurred.  They performed as a salute to number 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not long after the air show, I was in my bedroom and I heard jets flying around, I live very close maybe 2-3 miles from the Beaufort Marine Corps Air Station, I thought maybe the Blue Angels were leaving, so I leaned out of my window and looked toward the direction I thought the jet was traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I seen the object.  It was very thin and long, it looked like it come to a point at either end. It was very white or the thing its self was made of light, it was very bright against the brilliantly blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was to go outside and get a proper view, instead of having my upper body out the window, so I pulled myself out the window, and went outside, which took about 45 seconds and it was gone nowhere to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was very odd at first my father, sister, and boyfriend  assumed that it was some sort of blimp by my description, but I know it was not a blimp it had no wings, no anything on it. It almost looked like a really thick line but pointed at either end. I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a seventeen year old girl at the time, I have always lived in a military town, I&#39;m used to seeing aircraft off all sorts jets, the  b52 stealth, helicopters, all different types just by living here  I grew up watching the Blue Angels, they come every few years and perform.  I have never seen a crash or that object before but neither were enjoyable.  I am now eighteen.<n>
4/22/07 10:30|Longwood|FL|Oval|7 min 30 sec|3 craft come 500 ft above us|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56352.html|88|ndxe200704| 3 craft come 500 ft above us<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am writing again, because the unusual objects came back again. This time I brought my 2 brothers with me, because the last sighting I had was that they would be back again. Tonight was a chilly night with the half moon to our far right, as me and my siblings lay on the ground. I told them they had to not talk, and to just think. Despite my instructions, they continued to talk. One of brothers is 16 and the other is 14. I kept on trying to tell them not to talk. My brother named ((initials deleted)). (16 yrs.) told a story about some guys using a flash light to communicate with &#34;UFO’s,&#34; but I did not take it seriously because it seemed somewhat simple. So as we lay for about 2 minutes after his comment, their was a flash, thousands of feet up. My younger brother noticed it, and then we all noticed it, as it flashed again. It was a white flash thousands of feet up in the air, but I told them that we have to be critical of what we see, and skeptical to every degree as the &#34;UFO&#34; subject is a taboo one. In the preparation of our night to see what I saw last night, I told them to observe all the craft in the air for a better comparison of when the objects do show themselves again, or if they would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night before the lights indicated they will make themselves shown to me again, and that is why I brought witnesses the next night. So as we looked at the flash that occurred every 11 seconds, I told them to wait and see if it moves into any direction that would indicate it was a plane with a flashing light. I thought it could have been the space station (maybe) or a satellite that happen to give of flashes every 11 seconds. As time went on, all indications showed that most likely it was neither of my guesses that I proposed. There was a sudden flash every 11 seconds and lasted a total of 5 minutes. My brother T.J. said that he was going inside because it was making him uncomfortable, but I reassured him that it was just a flashing light and nothing more. But I did add on that it was just the beginning of our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the flashes stopped, 2 minutes later 3 lights in perfect formation came down out of&#34;nowhere&#34; and was moving in a southeast to northwest direction, and when it became closer, the lights went out and the 3 objects where 500 ft. above us without any lights. A good comparison would be that of a car without any headlights that would pass by on a dark street. So when the 3 lights came down, I pointed it out to my brothers with excitement, and we observed it as it went on its path. Again the difference between objects that we are familiar with that fly in our air is that they seem mechanical in movement rather than a natural way of moving. The three objects seemed as big as an SUV, 500 ft above us, with no lights, and a white surface that seemed like a oval shape but a not exactly (it was a very unique shape). The objects were visible for 30 seconds as it moved behind a cloud. The expectation of it following its direction was very high, because why would anyone expect anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as the expectation of it exiting the cloud was high, it never exited the cloud.  I stared at the cloud as it moved away; making sure that it was not going to exit it.  The clouds were about 500 ft above us moving swiftly across the sky in this chilly somewhat breezy night.  If it was a bird that was as big as an SUV moving into a cloud, you would expect it to exit it, but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11 pm we decided to go inside and take an hour break and go back outside to see if we can see them again. What is unfortunate is that my younger brother (Robby 14 yrs) did not see the 3 objects because he wears glasses and his eyes were improving, so I needed to get him new ones, but he did see the sudden flash every 11 seconds. We went back at 12 am and waited for 30 minutes to see any indication that we will see something again, but we gave up and went to bed. This life is interesting, and interesting things happen. I am just glad and honored that I got to see what most people have never seen, and enjoyed it with my brothers. I just feel that the last 2 days was a way of letting the world know through my 2 sightings that we are getting closer to the day where the boundaries that we have set for our own kind will be broken, and we will truly embrace freedom.  This is just the beginning and I am glad for it. My story of seeing unidentified objects is not a new one, but it is a unique one that should definitely be looked into by people that have good intentions, and the resources to do it. But truly I don’t even think we have to go far anymore to get answers, because the answers to this mystery will be coming soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source.

Just diamond shape moving across sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sky was extremely clear, no overcast.  I had just noticed the luminocity of a few stars towards the southern hemisphere.  I went inside to grab my telescope.  When I came back out I noticed an object flying at an altitude of a jet.  At first I thought jet, but it was moving way to fast and graceful.  After about 7 seconds the diamond shape object was slightly overhead.  The object was a faint white but as clear as day against the night sky.  The object moved at the same velocity from start to finish.  The object vanished when it was about 7/10 through my possible view.  It seemed as if it was moving straight but not realative to gravity.  Like it flew straight out of our atmosphere.  The bottom of the object may have been chrome, or mirror.  Due to the object vanishing before a well reasonable vanishing point of sight, I beleive the object could of been reflecting more of the ground than the sky.  The object had no lights.  I have seen many documenteries, and live near an airport.  When a jet moves you can see its left over trajection in the atmosphere.  It seems to be a ridgid but straight line.  Seeing this object move through the sky was a great gift.  Not because of the possibilities of alien life.  The way the object moved through the sky was so graceful.  It moved so straight, at such a constant.  It was as if the object had a desination straight ahead.  Like the object belonged in every spot it was in at every milisecond.  It appeared as if nothing was realitive to the object but it&#39;s self.  It was not effected by turbulance in anyway.  This description may seem mentally disturbing, but you would half to see it to understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Backround: Architecture<n>

It was immediately apparent that it was moving in a jiggling manner. At first we thought it might be a helicopter (one of the observers has an aviation background) but from its dramatic and precise movements this was quickly discounted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next four hours it rose in the sky at roughly the same rate as other stars, but on several occasions it darted between 5 and 10 degrees left and right, up and down.  Throughout the observation it jiggled perceptibly, particularly noticable when we positioned ourselves to watch it through stationery objects such as trees, rooflines, etc.  This movement was always at sharp angles, never as curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright white with a steady (not twinkling) light, though sometimes it dimmed. Eventually we got bored and went to bed with it still moving around (like the dot from a laser pointer) in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I turned to the sky to ponder, I saw a bright orange light move up and down quite easily and knew immediately it was a craft of some sort.  I turned to tell my friends to look at it, turned back and of course it was gone.  Ten minutes past and I looked up again and saw the same orange light hovering in the sky.  This time as I turned to tell my friends to look up into the sky the light in the sky dimmed as you would dim a living room light, and when I told them to look of course it was too late again for them to see.  It makes me believe that some sort of mental connection must be there to view or notice these ufos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When they looked up they noticed what appeared to be stars, yet these were not on any map that we had ever seen.  These &#34;stars&#34; had intense flashes of yellow green red and blue, and seemed to be stationary at the time.  Three of us saw blue lights shooting from one &#34;star&#34; to the other.  Upon further monitoring with binoculars we discovered that the stars were infact moving at rapid speeds, faster then any plane that any of the nine people had ever seen.  Also these &#34;stars&#34; looked like round disks through the binoculars. Once looking through the binoculars an older member of our group estimated the disks to be around 15 miles away. The disks themselves were a gray or silver color.  After about 30 minutes of looking to the western sky we noticed that there were more of these disks above us and to the east, in all totaling around 8 disks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later the disks then began to move to the east.  What was also strange was that even though these objects were moving we heard no sound.  Also through the entire event we did not see any planes. I mention this because we usually see planes headed to Lambert International Airport in Saint Louis.  One of us called a relative who lives in Saint Louis and asked if they could see the disks and he confirmed seeing the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all we are a family who loves nature and star gazes often.  Some of us are extremly well educated and some of us know alot about the planets and stars.  By far this was the strangest thing anyone of us had ever seen.  But one thing is certain we all saw the same thing.<n>
4/21/07 23:00|Cancun (Mexico)||Unknown|30 seconds|Star like object on northerly course makes 120 degree turn, moves erratically and stops, vanishes|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56375.html|95|ndxe200704| Star like object on northerly course makes 120 degree turn, moves erratically and stops, vanishes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the balcony of my hotel in Cancun at approximately 11 PM, Saturday, April 21st, stretched out on my back, looking straight up at the stars. I had never been to Cancun and looking at the sky between sets of a card game; the stars were more clearly visible than in Seattle, where I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of looking at the stars, I observed what appeared to be a medium-bright star moving in a nearly due north direction. The object moved at the same speed and at first I assumed it was a satellite or a plane, perhaps. Then, it abruptly changed course (without stopping) approximately 120 degrees to a southeast direction. It then began to make erratic, darting sort of movements, accelerating and slowing, moving in different directions within a relatively small area of the sky, before appearing to come to a complete stop. A couple of seconds later, it vanished. This entire episode lasted approximately 20-30 seconds. I did not lose sight of the object until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one witness, a friend of mine on the deck with me. Two other friends on the deck did not see this phenomena in time before it disappeared. They could not pick out what I was pointing at. I alerted my friends to the phenomena when I saw the initial 120 degree turn, as it was an extraordinary movement of an object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was easy to discern the motion of the object, as there were palm leaves just below my point of reference, so I had a clear definition of the object&#39;s path relative to my surroundings. It was perfectly easy to track the flight path of the object, there were no obstructions and I did not lose sight of it during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, with few if any clouds. Other stars were visible in the vicinity, none were moving. If it had been a mylar balloon, as was suggested, caught in the breeze, it would have likely changed the intensity of light reflection as it moved, but this was a solid unblinking light, exactly like a medium-intensity star. A balloon would not have moved in such a perfectly straight course for the 8-10 seconds I saw it before the initial course change. There were other stars of that intensity out that night; it was easy to compare its brightness to other objects in the sky. It was not as bright as Venus or as dim as a star you&#39;d have to squint to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, my friend thought it was a satellite because of the brightness, until its movements were clearly not that of a satellite. It left no trail as a meteor would; I sometimes sit out and watch the Perseid Meteor Shower when it occurs in the summer and am familiar with what a &#34;shooting star&#34; looks like. I have seen satellites pass overhead and the luminosity was comparable to a satellite or a medium-bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Venus was visible that night to the west, nowhere near the flight of this object. Mars was also visible; it was neither of these planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the skies for about twenty more minutes, and did not see anything like this again. There were no apparent laser light shows in Cancun, as anything of a promotional nature would have likely been repeated in the time we watched the skies after the initial sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sober and alert when we witnessed this object. My eyesight is 20/20 corrected with glasses, which I was wearing at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work in engineering for a large telecommunications company, and my friend who witnessed it is also a professional employed in project management. The two others who did not see it are a CEO of a financial institution and an automotive project manager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not consider myself a UFO buff, or a believer for that matter. But what I saw, a star or object that made an approximately 120 degree shift in course instantaneously without stopping, quite frankly, startled me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel a little embarrassed telling people what I saw, because I have received a bit of ridicule already by telling a story like this. I am not claiming to have seen a UFO, I did see something exhibit motion not possible by our understanding of physics. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was not a plane, a meteor, a bird, a balloon, a star, a satellite or a reflection of anything. The sky was clear all around our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also not known as a storyteller, someone who seeks attention. I wasn&#39;t looking for a story, I was enjoying the stars. Until I saw this phenomena. I don’t know what it was.<n>

I thought at first it was an aeroplane on fire.  Within a few seconds another &#34;fireball&#34; appeared following the first one. The 2 fireballs travelled across the sky, then hovered in the same spot for a while.  Then a 3rd fireball appeared, and travelled to the area where the first 2 were still hovering, where all 3 formed a triangle.  As the 3rd one appeared I called to my partner who had gone to the toilet upstairs.  She came down and also witnessed the 3rd one travelling towards the still remaining 2 fireballs.  The first 2 were now getting smaller, whilst the 3rd one hovered for a while...probably 30 seconds before starting to get smaller.  As the 3rd was getting smaller a 4th appeared.  This 4th one travelled the same way as the previous 3, and again hovered for a while before getting smaller until it had also disappeared.<n>

Several times in the past I’ve been able to watch a satellite crossing the night sky near the same time of night. The satellite always moves across the sky in a consistent straight flight path from West to East at a speed much faster than airplanes but much slower than meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However when I looked up tonight the Big Dipper constellation was to my left when I noticed 3 distinct white lights of slightly dimmer brightness than the satellite (which is as bright or brighter than most stars) and even dimmer than some of the stars. The lights were in a pattern shaped loosely like this ) pointing Northward. At first they appeared to be standing still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I continued to watch they began to move very, very slowly toward the North and as they moved they began to pick up speed, and then abruptly slowed again. As one staying in the same ) shaped pattern they changed direction from moving South to North to moving toward the East. They moved a short distance in an Easterly direction stopped then turned to face north again then separated until they were in a straight line then one by one they seemed to fly upward and disappear. The entire incident lasted between 3 and five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sole witness I’m a 43 year old former manager of a medical Practitioner who’s been on medical Disability since 2005. Though my illness prevents me from working it doesn’t have any adverse effects on my thinking, reasoning, nor does it interfere with my sight.<n>

As I was walking to door he stated he had to go outside to turn off sprinkler.  I then departed to return home as I drove into my yard I observed unknown in northern sky and appeared to be app. 5 miles away at app. 5000 ft. altitude moving at supersonic speed (700/1000 mph) with no noise of any kind, it very rapidly was obscured by tree line on my property.  My brother also lives on this same mutual farm property and we are seperated by this same tree line and about 300 meters distant.  I knew my brother had just went outside to turn off irrigation I immediatly called him to see if he had also observed.  My brother had also observed and reported that craft had also disappeared beyond tree line.  I have a background in sport aviation and I consider myself to be knowledgeable of aircraft types and am not fooled by things such as landing lights or military aircraft and I have observed many meteors and manmade debris entering atmosphere and this had a markedly different appearance in the very few seconds I observed.  The object was bright white illumination(not burning) w/flat trajectory and no debris was falling off as in space junk   I have previously seen(if norad releases any statement on this please contact me with info)<n>

There were clear skies, and I was driving south on I-81 near Woodstock, Virginia when the anomaly in question passed overhead, also headed southwest. It was roughly parallel to the ground and just to the left of the interstate, with multiple green lights contained in an oval shape with trailing sparks. It was visible for maybe 2-3 seconds before it simply disappeared/vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a virtual duplicate of a sighting I had several years ago further down I-81 near the Rockbridge-Botetourt County line: same time, direction and description, albeit 80-100 miles further north – an experience I called in to the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s Department at the time. The difference? I had a witness riding next to me, my wife was dozing in the front passenger seat when I told her to look up.  The thing was visible long enough for her to awaken, look up, and see it to.  Other traffic on the highway at the time had to have viewed it as well, but I found nothing in news reports the following day.  I couldn’t judge altitude, size or speed, but if the spark tail was from atmospherical re-entry it was quite large and flying at a speed well above the posted (65 MPH) limit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

A white dot is stationed motionless in the sky.  Two planes pass right under it, showing that this dot lies somewhere higher in the stratosphere.  These &#34;stratus&#34; clouds pass over it, which dims the object, so it&#39;s obviously higher then these clouds. As the sky clears and the sun shines you can see this white dot much clearer.  After about 20 minutes it, the white dot starts to move across the sky at a steady pace, as it moves a fair distance it appears to shed another white dot.  So now there are 2 white dots traveling across the sky, and they end up traveling out of my range of vision.  This is the third time I have seen these shapes.

4/21/07 16:30|Bridgend (UK/Wales)||Disk|5 mins aprox|daylight sighting of a classic disc type object.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56534.html|106|ndxe200704| daylight sighting of a classic disc type object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Firstly I have had 3 daylight sightings in my lifetime. Firstly, I would like to relate to you the most shocking sighting.  I was working as an IT technician and was on location at Cardiff High School. I was waiting for a windows operating system installation to finish and was looking out of the library window feeling quite bored. It was quite cloudy, very overcast and the cloud cover was quite low. It was December 05 and we had had some rain earlier in the morning and through the clouds I could see a diamond type shape making its way through the could cover. I continued watching it thinking that it was a hot air baloon as it seemed to bob through the clouds like a cork would on water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer it broke through the cloud cover it was a cylider, gun metal grey in colour that was slowly rotating. When it broke through the clouds it was at a left angle. It straightened out! and leaned to the right still rotating and then went back into the clouds. It really felt like I was seeing something that I shouldn&#39;t be seeing and it was so large and onimous that it kind of freaked  me out, so much so  that I quit my job to be closer to home. I now work in Swansea at 5 grand less a year to be closer to my family incase anything should happen. It seems a bit of an extreme action but either I was badly halucinating or I actually saw something that was totally out of this world. I cannot tell you what it was but I can tell you it was no plane, baloon, venus or swap gas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My earlier UFO sighting happened to me when I was 11 years old, in the middle of the day at my local Junior school.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was always the last to be picked for football being a short fat kid and was hanging off the raillings of the school yard waiting to be picked as goalie as usual. It was a clear sunny day and visibility was really good. I heard some of the kids in the yard start saying things like they were looking at a flying saucer.I glanced up but couldn&#39;t see anything. I looked around to my left and saw to my astonishment what can only be discribed as two dinner plates joined together top to top and viewed from the side. It made no noise at all and shot across the sky from one mountain at the top of the valley behind another valley into the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went from the Llynfi valley (town called maesteg) into the Afan valley. It left a shadow on the ground and was below the height of the mountain which it passed behind. Literally a few seconds later there was an almightly roar as two RAF jets, Jaguars I think  chased it behind the mountain it disappeared behind. It really freaked me out. The ufo literally left the planes standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I approached a teacher along with three other pupils and tried to explain what I had seen. I asked him why the ufo never made a sound and he told me the wind must have been blowing the other way???? Neadless to say that the incident changed my views on things for the rest of my life. If it was a government aircraft why was it being tested so low over a populated area?  Don&#39;t they have test ranges for that sort of thing?  Why did I hear the jets and not the ufo?  Why would a government risk testing prototype untested aircraft over populated areas, when there is a danger of these &#34;aircraft&#34; failing?  The object in my third sighting however was picked up by my digital camera using night shot in daylight.  Nothing was seen at the time of the shot but when checking my pictures later a disc was clearly seen.

I pointed out the smoke cloud to my son.  As I looked more closely I saw a glint of something near the top of the smoke plume.  It was at approximately a 45 degree angle, very high in the sky. The weather was mostly clear with clouds over the mountain.  The area of the sky where the glint came from was blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at a Circle K on the corner of 6th Ave. and Valencia Blvd. to get a better look at the glint.  I realized that it was a white orb, glinting on and off.  Soon I saw three, then five.  They were changing places with each other.  The smoke plume cleared as I watched.  I called my friend ((name deleted)), who was a MUFON meeting in the NE of Tucson.  I asked her to look for the objects.  She didn’t see them from where she was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for about seven minutes.  Finally they all disappeared and I left the Circle K and went on my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They could not have been helicopters, as they were very high up and too small.  They couldn’t have been birds because of the same.  I wondered if they were floating ash from the fire, but again, they seemed too high.  They were glinting on and off.<n>
4/21/07 12:30|Karues - Patras (Greece)||Formation|7 min|A UFO , what is going on?|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57824.html|108|ndxe200704| A UFO , what is going on ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was midday and I was having some time with my family at my aunts house . I was sitting near a window , alone-the others were one floor above me, while I was looking outside the window , I saw an object increasing its altitude slowly over the sea ( near that area there is NO airport , the nearest airport is 50 km from there ) ... The object had two parts , two round parts , that were connected to each other by a thick curved line ... It really looks like a helicopter , but it is not ... It flied to high for a helicopter and after that , it had no propellers , it made no sound and both round parts were to big and seemed too heavy for a helicopter to carry , its color was gray . I was totally terrified at that moment , the only thing I thought of is to take my dig camera and snap it , I did !!! I have a picture of it and it can be seen very well if you zoom on it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weirdest thing though is that after I couldn&#39;t see unidentified flying object any more two fighters of the Hellenic Air Force flew over the area and towards the place that the ufo flew ...<n>

I was walking east toward my apartment complex on Flamingo Road from the Sunflower Market on the NW corner of Rainbow and Flamingo.   I was just looking into the sky and to the north I saw what appeared to be a streak of light heading east. During the next seconds I could make out a disk or oval shape still heading east at what seemed to be a constant velocity.  The object had no vapor trails nor sound coming from it and it continued east until I could no longer make it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were vapor trails from military craft far in the eastern sky near the Nellis AFB so I would be suprised if there are not other reports of this object.<n>

They appeared to be larger than a star, somewhat flat and cicular, and there ligts were reddish in the center and more white around the edges.  The lights did not blink or pulse and was more dual than bright. As they approached from the soiuth, they were moving quite fast then slowes down, the two objects in front seemed to be jocking in the sky then moved very close to one and other as the third in the rear followed.  They moved very swiftly and made a big turn to the west then ascended upward until they disappeared.  There was no noise and they moved like nothing I have ever seen.<n>

A large, bright green, spherical object appeared suddenly and proceeded to fall downwards at a diagonal angle pointing roughly north for approximately 3-4 seconds at around 11pm on the evening of 4/20 (no - we weren&#39;t stoned, the date is coincidental). It left an orange fiery trail. It appeared to be slightly larger than the moon and was extremely bright. It gave the appearance of burning up - almost like a plane crashing or something. Far too bright and large to be a meteor or a piece of space junk - especially with all the light pollution from the town. It appeared to be extremely close, 15 miles at the most, and very low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was actually a jet aircraft crashing.. the igniting fuel could explain the color... but there were no reports of anything of the sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about the possibility of a flare or fireworks... but the altitude seemed too high for that, plus there was no explosion, and the light appeared suddenly in the sky and continued on a steady trajectory heading diagonally downwards at what appeared to be free-fall speed - I don&#39;t know of any pyrotechnics that can behave like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since it looked as though something had crashed and it was extremely nearby, we drove up to the reservoir in the foothills just west of town and looked around. We didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this have been some kind of military exercise? The nearest USAF base is cheyenne , wy - about 1 hour drive north, along with another about 3 hours drive south in CO springs. Was there anything scheduled for that night?  Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I was scared and terrified as I initially thought that the object was a plane about to crash on the highway.  I felt so scared as it seemed so near I got off the highway and it seemed so close I almost didn&#39;t think we would safely make it off the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would tend to think many other drivers witnessed this as well as there was quite a few cars on the highway.<n>

I happen to look right above my house at about a thousand feet or so , i noticed this big object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was kinda of in shock cause i didn&#39;t know what it was , then i told my daughter and her boyfriend to look above the house in the sky and we were speechless,and couldn&#39;t believe our eyes.  It was not an airplane, it had no lights on it, no engine noise.  It just was gliding very slowly, it was gray in color and very big, as it passed our house it just made it&#39;s way into the sky as if it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daghter called her son who was walking his girlfriend home, and went to pick him up cause she was scared for his safety .<n>

A fireball, there was smoke, I thought to myself a plane, a government test item, space debris?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know and still wonder about it.

My split second reaction was that it was a plane or helicopter since the light was the right size, color and distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it was moving quickly at a downward angle so my second thought was a plane or helicopter crashing.  I moved quickly to the window and watched the blueish fireball descend behind the trees.  It was large enough and low enough in a highly populated area that I expected to hear a boom or sirens afterward but haven&#39;t heard any reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was with me at the time and even though I startled him with my reaction, he missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all took about 3 to 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.

4/20/07 21:45|Mainstee|MI|Unknown|15 min|Lights spotted in Michigan Forest, bizarre, unexplained...|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56351.html|118|ndxe200704| Lights spotted in Michigan Forest, bizarre, unexplained...<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and myself recently experienced a very unexplained site. We had both taken some time this weekend to drive up to Manistee for a weekend of backpacking.  We decided to take the Manistee River trail up the river and than the North Country trail to loop back around.  We unfortunately arrived later than we had planned and set onto the trail knowing that it would be getting dark in only a few hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we hiked along, we made the decision to veer off the path and followed slagle creek North East from the place where it passed under the trail bridge.  It was already getting dark, but a sense of adventure and flashlights assisted our exploration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, as we were seeking a clear and comfortable spot to set up camp for the night, it became quite pitch dark.  We began to observe however, that up ahead of us some ways was what seemed to be a rather bright ring of light illuminating a section of forest up ahead.  It was obscurred in distant trees, but was assumed by us to have been a camp set up or possibly a few vehicles parked in a clearing with their lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued in a direction that brought us closer to the spot where the lights were, we were surprised to not hear human voices or the sound of engines, rather, a different sound, one more like fans running or the hum of a dehumidifier only much more intense, almost pulsing.  We were at first very intrigued, then when we couldnt explain the scene we became confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We approached carefully with our flashlights now off as the spot with the lights was 50-75 yards away and seemed bright enough to allow us to navigate safely towards it.  We got to a point where I could tell that the spot in which it was seemed to be a clearing or treeless spot, and the there was a definite structure sitting there which looked as if its sides or its underneath had lights surrounding it.  I would guess from the position of the lights that the object was round, but I cannot be sure.  Also, we both believe that it was most likely and aproximately 20 feet in di ameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We probably came within 30 or so yards from it, but at that point I refused to get any closer.  In fact, after watching it for about 5 mins.,  I was ready to get the hell out of there.  My brain could not explain what my eyes saw, it was not normal,  and the only explanation I have was that it must have been something extraterrestrial, or extremely experimental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned around and started heading back in a direction away from the scene, our backs turned toward the lights.  It was a hurried but carefull flight to find somewhere we felt more safe.  I remember hearing the humming sound fade as we pressed our way back through branches and brush.  I had to turn my flash light on and we were concentrating on what was ahead of us, but when we did look back the lights were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally set up a camp near the creek and resolved to go back to where we were durring the daylight.  The next morning we did explore the area we had hiked to, but were not sure and unable to agree on where we had been the night before.  We found a few clearings and open type areas, some with pressed down and flattened grass that could have been the spots but niether of us were sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next two days we finished our layed back hike, although I still feel that we experienced something not of this world, and I cant even begin to describe the oddity of seeing something that you cant explain, even after ruling out all logical possibilities in your head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home I got out some maps and tryed to determine exactly where we were at at the time of the sitting. I know for a fact that we were east of the Manistee River and the trail but certainly west of No. 1 road, and we were most likely North of S. Slagle Creek Rd. and somewhere south of Slagle Creek Rd./Blueberry Ln.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the strangest thing I have ever experienced in my life.  I feel like I have seen something no one was intended to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We telephoned this witness, and spoke with him about the alleged event.  We wanted to be certain that the report, which seemed serious-minded to us, was submitted as a sincere account of the person&#39;s experience.  He assured us that his report was sincere and accurate, and we found him to be exceptionally sober-minded.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was a star or the planet Venus but Venus was in plain view in another part of the sky.  That made me curious to look at this bright “dot”.  After about 2 minutes of staring at this object sitting in the sky I noticed it was more glowing than just a bright light. Then suddenly it got bigger and brighter. NO SOUND! It went from being a little dot to what looked like a bright baseball size glowing light.  Maybe 10 seconds went by as this object got brighter and brighter and then just like that, it was gone.  No sudden movement, no right angle turns at ridiculous speeds.  It was just vanished. There were no clouds in the sky so it couldnt of been a planes fog lights. I wrote this all down on a piece of paper about 7 months ago and put it in my desk.  My girlfriend found it cleaning and is making me post this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I took about 20 shots with Canon EOS 5D digital SLR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Camera was set on tripod with shutter release attached. Camera settings were ISO 1600, aperture 4.0, and shutter speed 2 seconds. I took one picture every 3 minutes to document the moon and Venus setting over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 6th photo, as I opened the shutter, something flew into the frame moving  right to left. I immediately thought this was an airplane and it was going to ruin the shot. I decided I would wait until the object moved across the frame and immediately take another one. Unexpectedly, the object just disappeared. There was no evidence of it anywhere, the object only made it as far as what is seen in the photo and then nothing, I scanned the sky and no planes were visible anywhere in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This should be an airplane, as this is close to the flight path from Seattle to Portland, normally flown by Horizon Air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To verify, I set up the camera the next night, same weather conditions along with camera settings and took several photos of planes entering the frame.  There is a huge difference between a plane and what was captured on the night of April 20th.<n>

It was a perfect triangle , pale red with a pale red light on each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking lights and the lights were not bright . I waited for a sound to follow what I was seeing but it was absolutely silent . The object was about 2-21/2 inches against the sky if I were to hold my fingers apart at arms length . It flew straight from east to west .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only had about 4 seconds to observe it , but that was long enough to realize it was nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a UFO before and this was unlike any sighting I had heard of in that it was very pale. If I had not been looking directly at the sky where the craft was I would not have seen it due to the fact that it was lit so faintly. As I said , it had a pale red light on each corner ( 3 ) and the craft was a paler red all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for some kind of sound but there as none. One of my first thoughts was , I wonder if they saw me? I sat in the tub for another 1/2 hour or so saying to myself &#34; I just saw a UFO &#34; There was no way to guess the size. If there had been a sound from it the time lag would have helped at least with judging the distance away the object was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I haven’t gone out in almost a year to absorb the beauty of the night sky, but today was the day that I will never forget, and will never regret for doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stepped out into my backyard, my eyes were trying to adjust from the computer that I was staring at for sometime.  I lay on the concrete floor and relaxed to enjoy the night sky.  I live in a city where lights do obscure most of the sky when one stares out to the distance from ones zenith.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student at my local community college and have taken astronomy and other sciences to give me the ability, to some degree, to determine what has validity and what doesn’t.  I routinely have helicopters and airplanes fly over my house, but what I saw this night was not such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lay for about 5 minutes, the stars in the night sky became much clearer.  I was telling myself how I must get away from technology, such as the internet and T.V. for starters.  I told myself that I need to go out on a regular basis and take in my surroundings, and as I finished that thought, a light came from &#34;out of the sky&#34; and into my view. It moved swiftly and at a very steady pace. I was waiting to see some pulsating lights and to hear some sounds to determine if it was a plane, jet, or anything that I can relate it to, but it never came. As I boggled to determine what it was, I noticed that it seemed as if the lights where joined. As I finished that thought, it split up into three different lights. The light (then lights) were moving in a southeast to northeast direction. When the lights broke off from each other, the middle one did not stay in formation, and pulled closer to the one left of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The perimeter of my backyard has trees, and when it reached that area, I was still capable of seeing it very well. Then a fourth light came out of &#34;nowhere&#34; and started following it as well. The middle one kept on moving back in forth from the center of the formation towards the light left to it. The lights kept its speed and that’s when I told myself that I still have time to get my fourteen-year-old brother to enjoy this fascinating and boggling experience. I say boggle because when describing it to someone else, that is all that they would be capable of comprehending. Truly I was not boggled but sure that there are other people like us out their, with fascinating advancements in their civilizations. As my brother hurried towards the backyard, his eyes were not adjusted to see what I was seeing. I felt alone in enjoying this, but none the less it was beautiful. As my brother was out in the backyard with me, only three were remaining heading towards the northeast sky, and eventually the city lights obscured it from total sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were like that of a medium star that you would see in the night sky, but it did not pulsate or give off rays, (as if a kid were to draw the sun where rays are being placed around the sun) such as the stars exhibit at night. The light was oval shaped but not totally, it seemed like a solid light but not emitting light out wards (it’s as if the energy of the light was contained in its structure), and it was definitely thousands of feet up in the sky.  I know that we have bad depth perception when estimating the distance in the sky at night, but I have looked at objects fly over my house at night, so I have some confidence in my statement. Also the estimation has to be drawn by how big the object was, so if I were to guess the size, just one of the lights that split up had to be bigger than a conventional airplane. Their were no other planes or conventional objects in the area. It did not move in a straight line in the southeast and northwest direction, but swiftly and naturally. The main word is that it was so natural the way they moved. My brother went on playing his video games, but I am changed forever. I have studied and researched &#34;UFO’s&#34; all my life, with the disclosure project research and other sources under my belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to tell someone my background in what I know about&#34;UFO’s,&#34; I think it would add less creditability to me, but since I know so much about it, subjectively I have a better chance at determining what I saw. I ask myself, &#34;Why am I so special to have these lights tell me to come out and see them move so naturally and beautifully?&#34;  They wanted me to see them, they wanted me to do what I have been meaning to do, and that is to go back outside, and meditate, and get away from technology like I have before. This sighting was meant to be personal. I don’t mean to be so dramatic but this is my TRUTH, my reality, my life, my experience and overall this is FACT. To sum up what I learned tonight, it is this message that they wanted me to give. &#34;They are here, and they are almost ready.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called coast to coast but it rang endlessly and maybe it was because it is a Saturday, so I remembered the ufo center website and called them, but I only left a message.  I immediately started writing about it to get everything that I saw and felt in detail so it will not slip into memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just really hope I was not the only special one this night, so that this can be collaborated on by many other eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your consideration to take my account seriously.

The only sign of distress was a tattered sail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Police said they thought the men may have fallen overboard during a storm eight days ago and ruled the chances of finding them alive almost zero. The search was called off Saturday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “This is one of those cases in which there has been a lot of speculation, but there is nothing to indicate other people were involved or there may have been some kind of crime,” Townsville police spokesman Warren Webber said. “We can come up with various ranges and hypotheses and theories as to what may have happened.”  A forensic examination of the boat and its equipment has not unravelled the mystery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sailors point out that a table laid for a meal and neatly folded clothes don’t jibe with the rough seas that Webber says may have tipped the trio overboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David Dellow, a Townsville sailor, told Australia’s ABC Radio that he suspected the boat had been boarded by pirates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “How do you get three guys to disappear at once?” he asked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His scepticism about a weather-related catastrophe was echoed by Whitsundays Yacht Club chief Jeremy Cooper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Even two is explainable, with perhaps one going in after the other. But three? You just can’t imagine why that would happen,” Cooper said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Credit:  Khaleej Times Online, April 23, 2007.<n>

I had just picked up my friend from his house, and as we turned a corner looking ESE we simultaneously said &#34;Whoa!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearly stationary in front of us at about 1,000 feet over Lake St. Clair was a formation of lights.  There were 5 of them in a line at about a 45 degree angle, as if an airliner was banking in front of us with an array of lights on it&#39;s wings.  The center light was the brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We followed the same direction and watched as the craft banked north and it&#39;s bottom faced us.  What we both saw was a triangle of yellow lights with a white flashing light at it&#39;s rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it headed north, light after light went out until there were two blue lights at it&#39;s tips and then it disappeared past the trees faster than we could keep up with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spend a lot of time looking at the sky.  We have a couple major airports in our area as well as a National Guard Base.  I have seen a lot of lights from all kinds of aircraft, and this was the first time I&#39;ve looked up and questioned anything I have ever seen before.  My friend was in as much surprise as myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It defied all logic of modern aircraft that I have witnessed.  It was as large as a 747, yet behaved like a slow helicopter with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if anyone else in the area saw anything similar.<n>

Some were remaining in line formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:00 pm, two military planes began approaching at extremely high speeds (drastically faster than commercial jets) and were approaching a grouping when one plane flew past the grouping and made a very sudden and precise right turn in the sky and began flying towards another grouping in unison with the other plane which was simultaneously approaching the same group as though planned. They both continued to fly past that group and then circle once more by a different grouping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes were obvious in their approach towards the objects.  One object in particular seemed to move slightly out of the line of the plane and after that is when the first plane quickly changed direction towards the right.<n>

As I watched it I started to see that it was moving around so I went and go a pair of binoculars. Then I looked at it through them I could see that it was wiggling or some thing. I went and got my dad and had him look at it and he said that he didn’t no what it was then he went back into the house. I started calling all my friends to tell them about it. In the end there where four people who saw it. It was about 11:30 when it started to like fall and then it would shoot back up. All it was was a bright light in the sky that moved around it and it wiggled. It lasted about 30 minuets and just before I went away it started to change colors.

There was no sound whatsoever which I found strange and quickly tried to point it out to the three others with me. As my girlfriend was already looking in that direction, she saw it and we both tried to point it out to our other two friends.

It was really dark out.  All of a sudden something big and even blacker than the night sky came across the road in front of me from my right.  My headlights didn&#39;t light it up or anything.  There were no lights around it so it was just this huge, black thing.  I was so startled I said, &#34;Whoa!&#34; and momentarily crossed the dividing line in the road while looking at it.  Believe me, I have never done that in my life!  As I kept looking out my side window I could make out two huge lights at the back of the black thing.  I couldn&#39;t get a sense of the shape of this object against the night sky, but it was huge, low, moving steadily, and only had these two huge, round lights on the back end.  They had to be the size of plate glass windows.  I was really confused because I didn&#39;t understand why, if this was a plane, it didn&#39;t have the usual lights on it, and why it was flying so darned low.  No lights but those two huge lights at the back.  I&#39;ve thought and thought about that night so many times and the thing that really stays with me is the fact that there was no glare from those lights.  Even a street light has a glow around it and lights on houses have a kind of glow around them from the distance.  These lights didn&#39;t have a glow like they were an exhaust.  You couldn&#39;t see anything but bright white, and the way they were lit made no sense.  Why didn&#39;t they glow, you know?  If it was a plane and those were the tail ends where engine heat should be coming out of, why didn&#39;t it appear to be doing that?  And why was there no sound?  A plane that low would have been noisy.  I didn&#39;t even notice the thing until it was right overhead in front of me.  I&#39;ve looked online at lots of airplanes since I saw that and I haven&#39;t seen the back end of one plane that looks like that thing did.  I would have pulled over that night to look at it, but there were two cars a ways behind me and there was not enough space for me ! to get s afely off the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4/17/07 22:00|Irvine|CA|Circle|5|Circle of blue lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Excellent report from an individual with engineering background.  PD))|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56283.html|150|ndxe200704| Circle of blue lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of April 17, 2007 I went out onto my front yard for a smoke before bed.  It was about 9.55 p.m. PST.  My house faces NNE.  The planes approaching Orange County Airport approach my house from the NNE and go past North to my left to the NW to land at OC approximately 8-9 miles away.  Normally I can see the planes unaided and hear them as they descend. This night was overcast so I could hear some but not see them as they broke cloud cover once they had passed my house.  As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it&#39;s not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don&#39;t have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t really want my name associated with this.  I&#39;m a 55 year old engineer and I&#39;ve never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would like to contact me, please respond to my e-mail address.  If you would like to speak to me, let me know and I&#39;ll call you, or respond to you with a phone number to reach me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I would find crazy about this is if no one else saw it.  As said, although the community is quiet and most people are in bed or in home at that hour, there are enough people around here that someone else should have seen this to collaborate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would to contact be, do so at the e-mail listed in witness information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from others who may have been witness to this object.

One object was Northwest and the other was Southwest. Both were at the same distance in the sky and directly across from each other, by a considerable distance. The object northwest was brighter than any star we have ever seen. Very white and seemed to be flickering mildly. The other object southwest had green and red lights, but fainter in color. Both objects were stationary. My son told us they were probably planets, and we went in the house, not wanting to make a scene in front of the kids. We went back out about an hour later to check and see if they were still there, and they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object appeared bearing about 080, proceeded to track NNE, speed indeterminate-perhaps 250 knots.  Estimated distance from me between ½ and ¾ miles.  It was at the altitude of bottom of low clouds.  I Lost sight at bearing about 350.  The bottom was silvery, it appeared to be round from the bottom, kind of a fattened disk in cross-section.  Above the mid-plane, there was a dark patch.  No sign of wings or empennage.  No sound, although this could have been obscured by a jet departure from DIA.  I believe this may be of the same type my family saw flying in close (20 feet) formation above Westerly Creek park 2 summers ago-those two had silvery bottoms and straight leading edge, forward sweeping trailing edge wings.  We saw those from about 500-1000’ straight above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All at once, one sped away at a very fast speed horizontally from the other. The other one just stayed there in it&#39;s place, not moving at all.

It flattened out and surfed, and it had a line of lights on it (the bottom) it cruised, I was paralyzed star struck stood up not knowing what to do it surfed and next thing you knew it went straight up.

After repeated communications I deem this witness highly credible. The description of the event and the responses to follow-up questions were consistent and articulate. The witness is cautious in drawing conclusions. The witness also has been employed in the past by agencies where expertise and integrity would be required. The witness expressed reasonable concern about reporting this event due to professional standing, but believed what was observed was so far out of the ordinary it needed to be compared to other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> TIME/DATE:  April 16, 2007 at 2130 hours (Pacific Daylight Saving Time). (Sunset occurred at 1903 hours according to the Naval Observatory Table.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOCATION: My house is about 70 ft above sea level and I overlook the Fidalgo Bay Marina. I live in Anacortes, Washington and my house is on top of a hill looking south towards Whidbey NAS. Whidbey NAS is approximately 6 miles straight line from my house and is SSE. My view towards the south is mostly unobstructed but there area few trees that block 20% of the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Miyauchi 77x30 astronomical binoculars. The optics have excellent color correction and are high quality. They were mounted on a tripod during this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DIRECTION OF OBSERVATION:  I saw some aircraft lights departing the Whidbey NAS so I pointed my binoculars south to watch the aircraft. The NAS is approximately 6 miles from my house and is SSE from my point of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBJECT: It had a very large and very bright red light that pulsated on and off slowly which is very different from an aircraft red rotating beacon or red strobe anti-collision light. The red light was on top of a dimmer but large white light that was separated by some structure. The object was stationary and hovering and was absolutely still. I thought it might be a military helicopter but there where no red or green navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SIZE / DISTANCE: Witness could not estimate distance as I don&#39;t know the size of the object. (Rationale: Exact shape could not be discerned and thus, could not be estimated in comparison to known aircraft.) This also relates to one of my follow-up questions about whether or not the object was in restricted air space. The witness reports, &#34;I am not sure if the object was in fact in restricted airspace as I am was not able to determine the distance of the object.”&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> DURATION: Witness observed the object for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OBJECT FLIGHT MANEUEVERS: &#34;When I first spotted the object it appeared to be south and west from the NAS but. It slowly started moving in an east direction towards the NAS. But it was moving in a weird wave oscillation motion. It moved a few degrees to the left or east and then stopped. Then it sat motionless for maybe 30 seconds and then shot straight up. I can only guess that the altitude was very low when I first spotted it and was below 1000 feet. When it shot up it moved extremely fast and stopped. It could have covered a thousand feet in a second. But then it accelerated at an unbelievable rate to the east and covered several miles in 2 or 3 seconds and then stopped dead. It sat motionless again for a few seconds and then slowly moved off to the east and disappeared from sight.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> POSSIBLY RELATED RESPONSE: As the object slowly moved off, a fast moving aircraft depart the NAS moving west and then turned sharply left to the south, climbed to 1500 to 2000 feet and appeared to accelerate to the south towards where the object had disappeared from my view. I lost sight of that aircraft as well.  The aircraft may not have had anything to do with the object but thought it was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Submitted by: James E Clarkson State Section Director Mutual UFO Network Olympia, WA olymufon@comcast.net<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We share our sincere gratitude to James E.

My room is on the third floor with a window to the street. As it is the summers, so I usually sit in the open window different times of the day to relax. It was around 9pm that i sat in the window with my DSLR just to get some night shots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking around, I just pointed the camera towards the street with a 50mm lens on the hood and clicked. Previewing the pic, i see the bright object, which seemed like a saucer, tilted, with its right end higher than the left one, as if going up to the right. As I have a digicam, so I took another shot just to confirm that it might be or might not be a sensor fault. Previewing this image I found that the object has moved. This time I found the object on the right upper corner of the frame. I took a third shot, but couldn&#39;t get anything this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comparing the two images, it seemed as the flying bright object, coloured green(might look different due to white balance, but as colour balance was normal, so I suppose it&#39;s green), was flying up towards the right. The direction of the object in both the images was aligned to my approximation as the images are slightly from different points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Zooming in on the object, its green and bright in the middle.<n>

It took me only a second to realize that the size, shape and movement of the light was all wrong and definitely not a reflection.  I got out of bed and was astonished to see a ball of orange light, emanating a sort of fiery glow.  I cannot stress enough the image of fire in this situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that it was an airplane on fire in the distance or a flare, but it wasn’t falling and there was no smoke. Instead it moved from west to northeast in a very controlled motion.  When I determined that it was going slow enough that I would be able to alert my father and mother before it disappeared, I ran from the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon 4 of us were gathered on the front porch watching it move further away, getting smaller until it was only a pinprick of light and then gone. The weather was immaculate: clear skies and a very minimal amount of wind. The object made no sound and was visible to us for about 4-5 minutes. We debated who to call and finally decided to go to bed without doing anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:15 P.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just reentered my room and was in front of the window, opening my curtains a little more &#34;just in case&#34; when an even bigger &#34;orb&#34; came into sight from over my neighbors roof (the same direction as the first object.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as size goes, it started out a little bit bigger than an aspirin held at arms length, gradually getting smaller as it moved further away.  I yelled for my family again and 4 of us ran out onto the porch once more.  My father snapped two pictures with a 35 mm (the film of which hasn’t been developed yet.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did the exact same thing as the first - slowly fade into the northeastern sky - but seemed to move a tiny bit quicker, lasting around 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. Our neighbors were outside and we cried, &#34;Are you seeing this?!&#34; They said it was like nothing they’d ever seen before. Back inside we called the National UFO Center in Davenport, WA and I spoke to a man and answered questions about what I had seen. He told me it was not a meteor and there were no scheduled missile launches in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:45 P.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting down to write our own personal accounts when my youngest sister called out, &#34;It’s back!&#34; My entire family, this time including my other sister (making a total of 5 of us) stood on the porch staring in disbelief at the third &#34;orb.&#34;   It behaved in an identical fashion as the first two.  Though the three did disappear in the same region of sky, they not disappear in identical places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness: 54 year old male   Approx. 9:05 P.M.  my daughter called me to come and look at a strange, glowing object in the sky.  I was in my bedroom upstairs and walked out of my room. There’s a window that looks out to the N.E. I saw an orange, glowing light moving slowly in the eastern sky.  It was clear night, no clouds. It appeared to be moving slowly away, getting smaller, but the light appeared to be pulsing and becoming dimmer. Not sure if it was because of distance as it moved away or was dimming.  We watched it for another few minutes.  I called my wife to come and see it. She saw it for a minute or so before it disappeared from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all excited and mystified. It did not appear to be a plane and made no sound that we could hear. We talked about reporting it but decided we felt silly. I started to go back to bed. After another couple of minutes my daughter called out that she sees another one! I bolted out of my room in disbelief and witnessed another glowing object at 9:15 in the same location. I ran downstairs to run outside for a better unobstructed view. It seemed larger and very bright orange. It almost appeared to be on fire, like shimmering rising from a slow-moving, floating orb. I could not make out any details - only orange-red glowing as it moved from west to east. My daughter came up behind me from inside and handed me her 35 mm camera. I snapped 2 photos. We then called the Nat’l UFO Center in Davenport, WA. My daughter reported the incident to them on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly, my youngest daughter, who was able to see the 2nd orb was looking into the eastern sky and and yelled out that she sees another one! We thought she was joking, but we ran to the front door anyway and witnessed a 3rd identical object traveling in the same direction. We were somewhat alarmed by it by now. My neighbor was outside standing on his driveway, talking to a friend. I called over and said, &#34;C--, do you see that? What is it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he had never seen anything like it. We watched it disappear in the same direction after several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness: 13 year old female  On April 16, 2007, I saw an orange fiery ball in the sky that I thought was a UFO. It started at about 9:05 and they were about 5 minutes long in the sky. My other 4 family members saw them in the sky. When I saw the second one it scared me and it looked like a ball of fire traveling northeast in the clear night sky. That one started at about 9:15. When I spotted the third one through my living room window, it was a little smaller than a full moon. When it traveled across the sky, it went left to right and then stopped. When it stopped it started to fade away. That was about 9:45 to 9:50 or 9:55. My dad got two shots of it with his camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other witnesses: 50 year old female, 17 year old female, several neighbors.<n>

Each object was a triangular arrangement of lights; white in color, not blinking, and about second magnitude.  They passed very near Mizar and Alcor, the southernmost object within a degree north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The separation of the base lights of the triangle shape was almost equal to these previously mentioned stars, with the forward light about twice that separation.  Each object was about 4 degrees apart on a north-south line, and maintained that arrangement during the 45 seconds of observation.  They became too faint to track as they passed from 25 Boo to 36 Boo in Bootes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no associated sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer, 50 years old.

I frequently see planes heading for descent and leaving into and out of O&#39; Hare Internation Airport. The Airport was appoximately 10 Miles SE from the spot I was at in my car eating lunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I see planes all the time as I have lived in this area for 20 years, and this object was very strange in shape and was moving in a strange fashion enough to make me get out of my car to get  better look at point it out to someone in the strip mall.  The &#34;Object&#34; looked like 3 connected rectangles with a triangle shape at each top portion of the 3 rectangle shapes it was very long up and down a full fingernail at arms length but width being far less than a smaller passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the movement was dialognally down and the dialognally up and then the next instant, I could not not see it as it went farther over the horizon so I got on Golf Rd, to go east to follow is as it was not as high as the air traffic it looked about 5000-8000FT when I followed it for a minute and then stopped and looked down at my cell phone for a second and looked back up and it was completely gone in an empty sky.  Balloons would not disappear, and planes would would not either, also the shape was extremely odd, like a shape that would not even fly, it looked like three rectangles with little triangles up on each top and i saw a small green hue at the tipe of the top one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is a Diagram I created using Google Maps Showing the Incidence in Relation to Airport and Air Traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;z=11&amp;ll=42.036034,-88.014908&amp;spn=0.387591,0.6427&amp;om=1&amp;msid=108427926028705255190.0000011203e85682ed726&amp;msa=0<n>

Then the disk turned so I could see the bottom,it was also chrome. The strange part was the sun was almost in front of me,but just a hair to the right.  So that means the sun was behind the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So how did the chrome body shine the way it did, but the strangest part is after a few seconds it disappered, just like some one turned off a light!!!  I never reappered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was compelty clear,not a cloud in sight. The reason I weaited to report this is I wanted to see the local news papers and news on tv, to see if anyone else saw the disk, they didn&#39;t.<n>

Let me start by saying that I was not tired and I had not had anything that would impair my vision or other senses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside at approximately 4:30 in the morning and saw a bright star, or so I thought.  I thought that’s weird, it looks like the North Star in brightness, but I was facing due south.  I then noticed a sort of tail so to say pointing down.  It almost looked like the Star of Bethlehem, however flipped upside down.  As I sat and watched this thing, I thought is this an airplane?  I then noticed these red attachments to the object, which kind of attached themselves to the bottom of the tail like an upside down Y.  At one point it appeared that there were also Y attachments to the top that were green, but I only saw those on two short occasions, so I can’t say if that’s really what I saw or the brightness changing as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat and watched this object, it hovered about moving from the east to the west not fast, but just enough to where you could see it moving.  When I took a step back because I was alarmed, it sort of moved with me.  Not fast, but you could tell that it moved.  I took another step back, and it moved again.  It almost made me feel like it was watching me.  At this time I was beginning to get a little freaked out.  Ran in the house, made my husband wake up from bed to come and look at this object.  He did come, and he did see it, but he disregarded and went back to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the object for 40-45 minutes.  Again, the feeling of it watching me made me uneasy.  I did see faint beams of light on two occasions go thru the sky.  Not far, but almost like a spotlight effect.  I moved to my right, the object hovered to the right, I moved to the left, the object hovered to the left.  I tilted my head to the side, the object moved it’s apex to the right, so on and so forth.  I did notice six star like objects that blinked on and off.  I did look around at other stars to my east and west, and did not see any stars blinking on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this object rotate on two occasions, like it almost wanted me to see its full self.  During rotation it looked like the inside of a Mercedes Benz symbol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never disregarded the fact of UFO sighting, but I never expected to see one myself.  I haven’t really ever explored or investigated these occurrences, but I definitely know what I saw was not an airplane or a satellite in the sky. Did anyone else see this object?  I’m going to attempt to give you a diagram.  The top like I said was star like, with the tail resembling the Star of Bethlehem and then two arms so to say which resembled an upside down Y appendages that were red in color.<n>

My sister and I were on our way home from dropping our grandmother and mother off at the casino for a little Saturday night gambling. We pulled into the driveway at our house, and I then proceeded to put the car into park. We stepped out of the car and began walking up the sidewalk to our patio door. Our sidewalk makes a 90 degree turn halfway up it. As we began to make our turn, I happened to glance to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw amazed me. It was in the clearing of a tree that is diagonal from our yard. I could not tell what shape it was, since it was very dark out. All we could see were 3 extremely bright white lights, and 1 dimmer red light, and 1 dimmer blue light. The pattern went like this. White light, red light, white light, blue light, and then the last white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I stood there captivated by it, and watched it for what must have been 4 or 5 minutes. The lights were so bright, that it hurt my eyes just to look at them, but I could not look away. My sister and I didn&#39;t know what to do, so my sister kept her eyes on it, and we got in the car and began to drive. We saw it, and then when we had to pass the tree, it disappeared. It was there one second, and gone the next.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove for what must have been 15 minutes trying to find it again, but it was nowhere to be found. So when we could not find it, I got on my cell phone and called my mother. I told her to meet us outside the casino and that I had something major to tell her. When we got there, we proceeded to tell her what we saw. She asked me if I was finally a believer, since I had been a big skeptic before. Now I am a believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were a constant light, not blinking or anything. the object was about, 7 stories in the air (it was near a parking structure) and was hovering for a few seconds, then proceded to move towards my direction then away from me. For a few moments everything became very still, and quiet, my radio stopped working and for a slpit second everything became dark. The object then floated in a swaying mannor floating up towards the sky then disappered. It occured around 10pm, dark black sky, with no stars around and could not be mistaken for a plane or helecopter since there were no flashing/blinking or colored lights and was silent. It occoured near UC Irvine, near the corner of Bridge and Campus. I only obsereved one of them. Other people in their cars slowed down to view this amazing sighting, and people on the streets stopped dead in their tracks and pointed upwards. I feel different, i can explain how i do, but i do not feel how i did seconds before viewing this UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to observe the light I noticed that it kept changing color from blue to red to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought that it was an airplane as there was some air traffic in the distance.  But as time went by it appeared as though the light stood still while the air traffic passed by at a higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staying in one spot for almost 30 minutes (at least from when I began observing it) it suddenly began to climb in altitude and then it vanished.<n>

At first i thought i was just some airplanes or helicopters, but as i looked the clouds got a little less thick and i saw it was a huge triangular mass, it looked like a ship, about a mile in each direction. it was moving so fast that i didnt have enough time to take a picture, but it sure creeped me and my mom out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Watching the planes landing as usual, we located a medium bright light in the sky,  moving horizontal in a speed not usual for a plane. Looking thru the binoculars, I saw an oval light moving south on an unusual speed when all of the sudden it moved backwards (northwest) in a 90 degree angle and immediately continuing south in another 90 degree angle. The incident was no longer than 60 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving home from work, I worked 3 pm until 11pm and my days worked rotated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was exiting on Wade Ave from I40 East, and as I drove towards the RBC Center I saw it.  I had my 2006 F150 Lariat’s windows and sun roof open.

All i saw was five white lights moving faster than anything i have ever seen before and doing things that didnt seem logical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time i jumped out of the hot tub and ran to the front of the house they were gone and i couldnt find them in the sky again.  The front of the house was also lit up with lights from the street so it wasnt ideal to see anything there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before i saw the moving objects out over lake michigan i was watching several airplanes in the area sky and there was absolutely no comparison in the speed or the way these things moved and reacted with eachother.  They seemed to be moveing together but like i said they were going up and down and across from each other as well as moving forward and a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, there is no doubt in my mind that it was not man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We addressed the possibility that the objects might have been migratory birds, but the witness stated that he thought that they could not have been birds.  We received another report from Muskegon, just two hours after this report was submitted, and the second report also caused us to wonder whether the objects might have been birds.  However, both witnesses rejected that theory.  PD))<n>

As they were about to intersect they then moved back apart again then traveled along side each other till they disappeared.

It then stopped on a dime and just disappeared abruptly. The sky was clear and there were no hills, buildings or end of horizon which it could have went behind.

I then saw what appeared to be a small dimer star come out of the big bright star. I then figured this was an aircraft and checked for movement by standing so it appeared right next to a telephone pole a stationary object, to check for movement.  There was non.  The dimmer light took off to the north and went out of sight by this time. The very bright one just stayed there.  I then went in and got my night vision goggels what i believe to be russion helecopter pilot goggels no brand name if its important only markings are a c inside a triangle inside a circle and the letters OH 1x 20 if that information is needed. Looking at the starlight object was way too bright but could clearly see total cloud cover above it as the could cover was reflecting light very well. I then decided this was no aircraft or star and did what i always thought was a bad idea.  I took my dive light and pointed it at the object and began to flash it, seven flashes twice. The object which had been very bright and totaly still up till that time then shut off the light. An orange afterglow still was visable and it went skyward very fast through the cloud layer. this whole even took about 10 min. I waited and went in and out for about 15 min, and started looking over my house by the way to make sure it wasnt over me. After about 15 min the object again came back to the origanal location.  Wanting to get a better view i got my binoculars a pair of stiner comanders, they are old but work well.  what i saw was an object inside the light that appeared to look like the capital letter D. I watched it for about 15 more min as it changed color from bright orange to white.  It looked very much like a star but with the binoculars you could see an object insid! e the light quite well. I viewed the object till about 10:15pm and attempted to call my wife at her grandmothers house at the time, the phone didnt work at this time but gave me the option of leaving her a message. I since talked to her this morning and that message never made it to her.  I dont know if that is related or not.  I do know the object did take notice of me flashing it with my divelight and turned its lights down and took off. I also belive the object was small as it didnt seem very far away less than a mile, but cant be sure.  I do know it was much closer than an average helecoptor flying over the area and belive it was over the houseing track behind mine. As for the size and this is only a guess I would say the size of maybe a city trash can.  I will be looking at the sky much more now and if i see anything i will let you know.<n>

I was at a local gas station talking to some friends and saw what I first thought were two (2) planes on nearly converging vectors. #1 was coming from South to North &amp; the other (#2) from West to East. There was likely less than 1,000 feet of distance between them at the nearest point. At the &#34;cross-over point&#34; the #1 craft (ufo?) was seen to only have RED lights...whereas the #2 craft was a normally appearing/sounding plane. At this point the plane veered swiftly left as if to &#34;chase&#34; the #1 object. The #1 (ufo?) proceeded into a left (West) turn and was closely followed by the #2 craft (plane). The plane was never able to &#34;catch&#34; the #1 object but seemed to stay in trail by perhaps a distance of 1,000 feet. They continued in a West-Northwest direction till out of sight. I observed the objects with a small pair of binoculars and could readily ID the #2 craft as a light plane, but could NOT do so with the #1 object. All I saw on the #1 craft was RED lights EXCEPT for one instant when I observed a WHITE light at the rear as it was moving West away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just had a &#34;feeling&#34; that the #2 aircraft had just taken off from Orlando Executive Airport and saw the &#34;unknown&#34; &amp; recognized it as such and decided suddenly to try and get closer to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope I&#39;m not being out of line for &#34;reporting&#34; this incident...but it just had that sense of &#34;unusual&#34; that made me wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was roughly 4 miles from the Riva Road exit near Crownsville. It was a clear day, sunny and cold at 11:30 in the morning. The Orb was roughly 20 feet above the tree line, off to the right at about 20 degrees (or at 1:00).  It appeared to zip to about the 3:00 position in a split second.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I got my camera out of my console and snapped a quick pick. The orb did nothing else but hover there in the sky.    I couldn&#39;t pull over at that time because there was a car to my right (as you can see in the picture) and my exit was coming up fast. Once I made my exit, I pulled over and got out, but it was gone.  &#34;This is too good to be true, I guess I can&#39;t get a better, second shot&#34;, I thought.  It&#39;s definitely not a weather balloon, because the way this thing moved and at the speed it moved, it&#39;s just not possible.  It all happened so fast, in the blink of an eye it was across the sky to my right.  The next thing I know, I check my camera and there it was, I had taken a decent pic of it thankfully.  I added a small red arrow to the first pic, otherwise, the pictures are unedited and untouched.

We live in Hither Green, right next to Lewsham in South East London. Lewisham is apparently known as the tenth most likely place in the UK to see UFO’s according to a recent survey. She has asked me to try and contact  the UK national press for her, but I have been trawling the internet to find similar sightings and I can’t find any corroborating information before approaching anyone. The closest I have found is on your website:  Occurred : 5/13/2005 21:15 (Entered as : 05/13/1905 21:15) Reported: 5/16/2005 5:54:33 PM 17:54 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Emory, TX Shape: Rectangle Duration:about 1 minute  The sketch offered by the above report is very similar to the footage that my friend has captured, in that the lighting configuration is as close to what I have seen on her footage. The collection of lights is very similar being in three rows, but there is one difference in that the red lights in Emory,TX were reported as being fixed. In the footage, there was only one and it was independent of the collection of lights above. If I had to make a supposition, I would say that it was a drone controlled by the larger craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, it appears that this craft remained in position for some not inconsiderable time. This to me, is totally incredible as we live in a very busy city. On one occasion it was still visible into the early hours of the morning, whereupon it appeared to be able to either generate a cloud, or be sheilding itself from view behind one. All this time in the same position. It is in this footage that the craft appears to pulse light, at a slow strobing pulse that lit the cloud and the edge of the window frame in shot. There was no audible noise in the tapes that I have heard, with the exception of my friends various comments and, well frankly, expletives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is extremely reluctant to come forward; but I have seen the footage myself and I am frankly baffled. I have had some military and security services experience, and have travelled extensively since a very young age. I have filed numerous arrest reports, worked closely with the Metropolitan Police and acted as witness in many court cases, and consider my judgement and recall to be sound. In all my years of living and flying abroad, I have never seen anything that would come close to describing what I have seen on these tapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

So at this stage I was pretty certain it wasnt anything common.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a camera available to take pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this it moved away into the sky, much like the way it came down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in, checked the time, and wrote it down with what I saw on a piece of paper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bit subjectively, Though I would have estimated I was only watching for a short time around three or four minutes, according to my clock ,I was outside for about 20 minuites (I checked the time when I got home, and saw the light a very short time after).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next day I also asked the neighbours , none who were awake at the time saw anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> coincidentally , though one said that her dog sleeping in her bedroom went &#34;nuts&#34; around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to note that, I&#39;m 17,a busy university science student ,and very &#34;strong&#34; sceptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was quite unnerved by the clarity of what I saw, and I&#39;d rather it didn&#39;t happen in the first place. Nevertheless, I&#39;m still sure there could well be some explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I first saw this object in the sky while passing the IKEA in Emeryville, CA.  The object was stationary, but far in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights I saw were clearly in motion, moving in a circular pattern, but in a pattern that varied from a solid circular pattern of uniform shaped lights, to certain areas flashing while other areas are black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it had lasted only a minute, I may have ignored it, but this went on for more than ten minutes, and as I moved along 580, it was clear I was approaching the object.  While I originally thought it stationary, it must have moved at some point because I lost eye contact with it for approximately 2 minutes, then it came back into sight.  I cannot say the exact place I &#34;passed&#34; the object, but it was on my right-hand side, somewhere nearby the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after I passed where I thought it was above, I saw what I thought was a helicopter moving towards the location from the Southwest.  By the time I reached the Richmond Bridge, I had seen an additional 3 helicopters in the area.<n>

When we were approaching the Tobaggan Rd./Towerline Rd. intersection, we both seen a light in the sky that must have been quite a few miles away, it resembled a star because of the distance, but something tells me it was an airplane or some type of object. We seen this object fall very quickly, it didn’t fall in the blink of an eye, however; it fell gradually but quick.  This object was south east of Towerline Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part of this is that after we seen the object falling all of sudden it disappeared without any big light (sign of explosion) or trace- it didn’t fade away whatsoever, it just completely disappeared. The object looked as if it was crashing to the Earth, it was falling at around a 45 degree angle, and must have been traveling 200 mph or faster- from the speed I seen it falling as far away as we were. My girlfriend witnessed this first, then I seen it as soon as I looked in the sky ahead of us while we were driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to guess, I would guess that the object had to be at least 20 miles or so south of Towerline Rd/Tobaggan Rd. intersection, and at least 5 miles east. Of course, it could have been as far as 100 miles however for some reason I had the idea that it was closer- it just didn’t appear to be a star even though all we seen was one white light. We seen this object falling for around 10 seconds before it dissapeared out of thin air. This object didn&#39;t leave a &#34;trail&#34; of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you need further information or have any questions, my email is ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, ((name deleted))<n>

As I exited the highway, my boyfriend commented on what looked to be the only star in the sky, in both of our opinions. I immediately had a feeling he suspected a ufo for some weird reason, but had no idea what we were about to witness. As I came to the bottom of the ramp, I stopped for a moment and just watched as this flying craft came towards us. It seemed to have no steady path. It had incredibly bright white lights and immediately, in mid-air turned those lights off seconds after I stopped at the bottom of the ramp. As we watched, the craft, which was Absolutely Not an airplane, and didn’t appear to be a helicopter either, it dropped straight down about 250 feet in the air, hovered, and then started to rise again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned right at the stopligh t(at the bottom of the ramp) and then proceded to my restaurant.  My boyfriend told me within 20 seconds from leaving the bottom of the ramp that it was directly above my car.  It stayed above my car as I drove to the restaurant.  My boyfriend told me he looked straight up at it and it was just spinning fast.  It was only about 4-600 feet in the air above us. It looked in the beginning like it was going to land right before our eyes.  It appeared to have 3 little lights on it, one was red and the other two were yellow or white.  This was too low to be a helicopter or plane.  After placing my order I remarked to my boyfriend that I was going to ask someone if they had or could see this thing too! Just as quick as I said that and I pulled forward it was gone- not a trace in the sky. We had seen it from such a distance, but yet it disappeared in a split second. This all happened in just a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was an exceptionally clear night sky and I was impressed by the clarity of most of the brightest stars in the Eastern sky, including Regulus, which is the first star I was able to identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to come inside after a couple of minutes of stargazing, when I noticed a very subdued and somewhat translucent object appear in the Southern Sky above the angle of my garage roof that caught my attention for just a second or two, due to its very fast South to North motion in the sky.  It appeared as a single object and then rapidly dispersed into several, 9 to 12 egg-shaped, very uniform objects that scattered in shotgun like pattern and then completely disappeared.  I would estimate the angle above the horizon and my garage roof to be about 30-35 degrees; was unusually horizontal and low to the horizon for a meteoric atmospheric contact.  I have witnessed hundreds of meteor showers over the years and have seen countless satellites in the night sky.  Most of these types of observations have had a distinctive brilliance or very noticeable luminosity to them.  In this particular case, which only lasted a couple of seconds, had a relativity low luminosity and certain amount of translucent quality to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suppose this event could most likely be classified as a low angle, low mass, meteoric atmospheric contact, which didn’t have a lot of rarefaction to it and thus very low luminosity or brilliance as most of the meteoric displays that I have witnessed in the past, however, this even I would consider to be of importance due to the uniformity of the object and dispersion pattern and its low level luminosity and translucence that I have never before seen in the sky.  After this occurred, I came inside to note the time on the clock on the stove, which was 10:47pm.  I went outside again, to see if there were any more meteoric activity, when I noticed a cloud formation in the Eastern sky , above the city, which wasn’t there previously.  This cloud formation was very small and somewhat rectangular and eventually disappeared in a matter of minutes.<n>

I thought it might have been a satellite as the speed was similar to low orbit satellites I&#39;ve seen before ( but about half again as fast). As it passed me ( about 110 degrees vertical from us) it quickly dimmed and diminished in size (i.e. rising). There was no aircraft sound and satellites I&#39;ve seen before can easily be tracked across the sky with minimal change in magintude. It was definitely different.<n>

This went on for about 2 minutes and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in my car and was driving West bound on US 52 in Sciotoville, Ohio, and over the hills of Sciotoville I saw something that streaked across the sky zigzagging up and down and it was on fire.  The object left a trail of what looked like fire in the sky as it went.  The whole path the object followed was not on &#39;fire&#39; all at once though, I would compare the firery trails in the sky to condensation lines left in the sky from commercial jets but they didn&#39;t stick around as long, the trails disappeared very quickly after the object left that part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object headed from north to south and unlike any meterorite I&#39;ve ever seen it didn&#39;t just fade out; the object stopped in the sky, got real bright, and then just disappeared.  This happened about 5 minutes after I saw the disappearing and reappearing lights in the sky and was at a different location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was heard at either of these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Also a commercial air carrier was heading approx. 005 T degrees, some 25,000+ ft. altitude, 15 seconds before this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The elevation of the object was difficult to estimate however it was higher than the refueler and appeared lower than the commercial jet aircraft. I could hear the engines of both identifiable aircraft however the UFO was completely silent traveling 4 to 5 times faster than the commercial jet. It had 4 round amber lights arranged in a semi-circular pattern with a slight flickers, similar to a star flicker. The lights appeared at a point of about 45 degrees azimuth eastward (facing southeast) and stayed lit to about 45 degrees azimuth southwestward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a seasoned celestial sailor with many months of night sailing, I have never seen this type of light arrangement nor the speed and silence they displayed. I have observed the ISS pass eastward overhead about a month ago from this same spot and am familiar with it’s light reflection and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would think it reasonable to say a radar signal would be more apparent on a military aircraft than one on commercial aircraft radar of such a flying object.<n>
4/12/07 20:45|Colorado Springs|CO|Triangle|30 sec|Triangular light configuration indicated low flying hover-craft in fog and snow above Powers Blvd.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56232.html|217|ndxe200704| Triangular light configuration indicated low flying hover-craft in fog and snow above Powers Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on Powers Blvd in Colorado Springs, headed to the current/new airport to pick up friends who were flying in that evening.  The weather was foggy with a fair amount of snow beginning to fall, accompanied by a moderate breeze.  I&#39;d stopped at a stoplight, located near the old Colorado Springs airport.  To my left (east), about 50 or 60 feet above the ground, I saw 3 identical, white colored, down shining lights (appearing similar to those housed in recessed &#34;can&#34; lighting fixtures); they were very, VERY slowly, smoothly hover-gliding forward, together.  Two slender blue-colored bars of light were positioned behind, and perpendicular to the &#34;nose&#34; light, but within the boundaries of the triangular configuration formed by the larger 3 white lights.  There may have been a small red light located between and/or just behind the blue bar shaped lights.  Due to the time of night and poor weather conditions, I could not see the body of the craft... just the lights on its under belly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought the lights were reflections on my windshield, but I couldn&#39;t determine their source.  I looked at other drivers around me to see if they had noticed the lights but they appeared to be oblivious as the weather/visability was poor and the drivers were concentrating on the stoplight, waiting for it to change from red to green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thick fog and snowfall reflected the street and city lights to provide a sort of overall orange glow.  Thinking that the lights were reflections, I remained still, using the frame of my windshield to verfiy that the lights were indeed moving, and that they weren&#39;t reflections.  The lights continued to glide, VERY slowly, foward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 lights formed an elongated, triangle configuration; one round light in front (&#34;leading&#34; the direction of movement), with 2 identical round lights behind.  The overall size was approximately the size of an USAF F4 or F15. Since all the lights moved with identical speed and direction at the same time, it seemed probable that they were attached to one body.  There was no noise and the craft&#39;s movement left the fog and snowflakes undisturbed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After moving forward, the hovering craft paused, then VERY slowly, smoothly made a slight banking action to it&#39;s right, then slowly and smoothly, (without rotating)it drifted in an easterly direction, to disappear, uncerimoniously into the fog and snowfall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft&#39;s hovering was steady and constant, without bounce, shake, waver, list, or yaw; it moved much smoother than a helicopter, seemingly unaffected by the poor weather conditions. It reminded me of a British Harrier, but, again, its movement was much, much slower, unwavering and smoother than that type of craft.

Then something strange happened, dribbles of fire shot straight down from the object and burned out 200 to 300 feet blow the object. {similar to tracers being fired from a automatic weapon except the burning objects where different sizes and not even spacing like what would happen with tracer, and only burn for a few hundred feet } this occurred three times before the object went behind a cloud and was out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Salem Police; they had no information on any stricken aircraft.  I called the Stayton Police they had gotten a 911 call about 8:30 PM of a similar sighting and directed them to call the McMinnville FAA.  I called the McMinnville FAA and was told they did not know of any aircraft reporting any malfunction in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I happen to glance up and over to my right and noticed black dots in the shape of a triangle moving across the sky toward the left, the pointy side of the triangle was facing left also.  Between the dots you could see blue sky so it seemed to be somewhat cloaked.  It was very high in the sky.  It was moving at a steady speed and suddenly it was as though the triangle flipped and was pointing back toward the right.  It shot through the sky at a superfast speed and disappeared.  There is no doubt had I not been looking directly at it I could easily have overlooked it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My partner and I were dogsitting. The dog came over to me whilst I was in bed and started nudging me with his nose. Thinking he might not be able to wait until 6.40 when I normally get up, begrudgingly I got up and went down stairs with him in the pitch black, my own dog following us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t put any lights on in the kitchen and went to open the glass door, just as I did  I saw 2 objects totally still, next to each other in mid air in my garden. They were head-height and probably only 3 metres away. I looked around in the kitchen to make sure no lights were reflecting, but it was totally dark. I wasn’t scared at this time but opened the door and stood in the doorway. I probably saw the objects for a total of about 4 or 5 seconds. It seemed like a long time because I was trying to remember everything about them and was checking with myself that I wasn’t dreaming. I remember thinking at the time that they looked like really big corks but were more angular than corks and rectangle (around about credit card size perhaps but a bit slimmer). They didn’t look like ‘lights’ although they were bright againsed the pitch black sky. They were kind of cream in colour and didn’t particularly look ‘other worldly’, more like new tiny remote control type gadgets or something. They didn’t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my face just outside the door for a second then they both kind of sped off to the left at exactly the same time. At this point I think I suddenly got really scared and couldn’t even move my head or go out to follow them, which now I am annoyed about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally the dogs didn’t rush up to the objects when I opened the door, they just went out to pee  and then came back in. I stood there for  some seconds and then came back in as I was freezing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was far off, so I went and got my feild glasses, It was moving father away from where I was standing. It was the only thing in the sky Blinking. It was not an airplane.  Looking through my feild glasses I could see it changing colors. Since it was the only thing blinking I thought that was strange. I never thought I would see something like this!<n>

My friend and I were standing outside our apartment when I looked up and saw 2 glowing rectangular objects spaced evenly apart cruising smoothly across the sky towards the north. I told my friend to look and she also did not know what we were looking at. It was not birds, bats, or planes as there was no sound and they emitted a eerie yellowish glow. They were flying quite low, lower than all of the usual airplanes that fly over our area, and they were moving smoothly at a very high speed, we only watched them for about five or six seconds before they were out of sight. It&#39;s possible that they were military as they were flying in the direction of Ft. Hood, but I don&#39;t know of any unclassified silent glowing military aircraft that could travel at those speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They passed over from North southward and had no flashing beacons like other conventinal craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend was a witness however is skeptical of these things and wasnt really interested.  As far as i am aware over our airspace, flashing beacons are a requirement.  There were none on this/these craft. there was no noise associated with the craft and they were moving at the speed you would see a commercial aircraft going at about 15000 feet. (20 miles from the airport)   If they were 2 separate craft then they were flying absolutely together in a perfect tandum formation maintaining a perfcet distance both apart and infront/behind eachother. If it was a single craft it must have been at least 100 meters in width.<n>

I will keep her name anonymous for now but will give my information and will temporarily serve as a contact person:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))   ((address deleted)) RD Westbrook, CT 06498 Telephone: 860-((telephone # deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother’s report:<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 8:45 P.M. on April 11, 2007, my mother saw what she described as a sparkling object in the eastern sky that appeared to be a huge star about 2-3 inches in diameter at first sighting. My mother observed the blinking object for approximately 10 minutes.  Suddenly, the object ascended straight up within 3-4 seconds.   Immediately, the object changed direction going directly west and downward toward her at a speed that would compute to be thousands of miles per second.  Within 2 seconds the object appeared in her yard  before her as she looked through her storm door.  This object filled the whole area in front of the door and in front of her entire sight.  She felt like she saw only part of the entire object at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother felt like she could reach out and touch it.  She saw motionless oars or blades - like looking pieces of machinery of the object which she assumed was the bottom of the object. One area  was green among the blades.  There was a circular red light to right 10-15 feet from the main part of object. The red light appeared to be 4-5 inches in diameter.  She stated that the intensity of the light of the object at the time of close observation was equivalent to looking into a well - lit store window at night or of television screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother’s overall impression of her close view of the object was as if she were looking at the inside or bottom of an enormous machine.  Everything appeared to be constructed of shiny metal which was thick, heavy and extremely large. Within 2 seconds, the object disappeared w/out movement or sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was sitting in the same room as my mother but was unable to observe because of his immobility due to medical issues.  He can confirm that my mother was awake and communicating this information to him. My mother and father are of sound mind and can produce witnesses of this from relatives, doctors, town librarians, neighbors, friends and others. She is very gifted and well read.  She also is known to be conservative of thought and in her communications with others.  We would be interested in talking with a contact person who also lives in Coventry, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Case turned over to MUFON/Connecticut for investigation.  PD))<n>

I noticed it to left in the distance above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was all white with no distinguishing marks or details, and it had a slight oval shape. The longer dimension of it went side-to-side and it was tilted left-side-down, about 20 degrees, and moving in that direction. It looked to be descending slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have thought that it was nothing more than a wisp of cloud except that it was moving extremely fast. I can not make a fair estimate, but its speed was orders of magnitude faster than a prop-plane. I witnessed a plane flying much closer to me (I was passing a small airport at the time) and the speed of that plane seemed almost nill compared to the UFO. I would estimate that I first noticed it at a distance of several miles and it traveled several miles in the time I witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The highway I was on was bending right while the craft was moving left. The tree line was rising and I quickly lost sight of the craft. What I saw was unlike any UFO report I have ever heard. I saw what seemed to be a pure white, opaque, slightly elliptical, non-luminous thing moving at a very high rate of speed, with no apparent effect on the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were emptying our trash when we saw a light in the sky off in the distance (North) that resembled the light of a helicopter.  However, it was moving around in circles, loops, and flips at such a high rate of speed that both we and our neighbors were sure it wasn’t any kind of normal aircraft.  After about 3 minutes, it steadied itself and continued off westward as normal looking as your every day plane.  Anyone else see it???<n>

I heard the people from the apartment above comment on something in the sky, it took me a minute to spot it myself. The object was over Lake Ontario. at first it looked like a ball of haze with a dark nucleus in the center. I whent to get the binoculars, I came back to see in better deatil, but it had move maybe 2 kilometers across the lake to the right. When I cought to the object with the binoculars, I could rule out anything that I&#39;ve seen in the sky before. I watched it for about a minute, I guess it could have been a disc, but to me it look more like a pen. It had a shiny silver top and a black bottom. I watched for another couple minutes, it didn&#39;t move. Then finnaly, it slowly started into the clouds and disappeared, and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Have u ever heard of a door being marked with red, green, blue lights? Why didn’t I notice it when I was driving the other way?  I think the blue light was on top and the red and green was on the bottom, this is 2 years ago so I don’t exactly remember how the order of the colors was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way from Notodden in Norway to Porsgrun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it be that this was some beings not humans that chased me, and those lights where coming from  landed craft?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m hoping this site allows comments because I would really like to figure out what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I’m majoring in Astronomy and usually gaze at the stars as I drive home during the dark stretches. On Monday night this was the case. Through the front windshield a BRIGHT blue object raced across the sky from East to West at amazing speeds. Keep in mind I’m familiar with objects in the sky. This object was blue, It took only 6-10 seconds to cover the WHOLE sky, 180 degrees. It was brighter than any star in the sky, It was too slow to be any debris entering the atmosphere, the color also supports this. It was way to fast to be any earth made aircraft of any kind. Its path was direct and its brightness did not fade as it reached the horizon. I have seen many object in the sky including satellites that I have manually tracked with my telescope. This object was absolutely not a satellite. I hope others saw this as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw a bright red light come on then go out. Then four bright orange lights lit up from left to right, then went out one by one from left to right. Then 5 orange lights lit up from left to right and went out one by one from left to right. These lights were really bright. The red one was round, but the orange ones were shaped like rectangles. They were right over the tops of the trees in my neighbors back yard directly behind us in the northeast, within 5-600 ft. from me. The orange ones had sort of a screen look to them. Like they were windows from a craft. They were lighting up as though they were going around something circular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very next week they were back and my husband and I both saw them plus, we heard that two other people about 4-5 miles from us saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 16th of April, the same thing happened. The red light showed up first. It was followed by bright orange lights (as bright as tail-lights on a new car). This sighting lasted about an hour. The orange lights looked different than the ones I saw by myself the week before, though. These looked more like flares, or fireballs, but they didn&#39;t go anywhere. Not up, not down, just around something like a disk shaped object that we couldn&#39;t see. They again came on left to right and went out left to right. It was like a sequence of a different amount of lights coming on each time. One set was three, one set was 9-12, one set was 2, etc.  Then, as though another craft was answering the first one, (this set of lights was straight east instead of northeast) Four bright yellow lights lit up. These lights were bigger than the orange ones, and that is the only time they lit up. Then the orange ones in the north east went RIGHT to LEFT, as though they were satisfied with the answer of the other craft. That was the end of the sequences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got video of the bright yellow lights, and two of the last four orange lights as they were going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next week (April 23)I got a video of a craft going over with no sound, and a smaller light came out of the craft. These had no sound, even though it was directly over my head. There was no flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane of some sort. The smaller light that came out of the bottom of the craft, came down and then went west as the larger object was flying north to south. Then there was another smaller light flying east to west over the larger object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a truck driver with a high school diploma, and I am a registered nurse/truck driver, with over three and a half years of college, plus more college credits from the internet. We are reasonable, christian people who never expected a UFO to show up in our back yard!

4/9/07 18:05|Elmsford|NY|Circle|2 seconds?|Dark circular object floating stock still in the air. Was not seen when photo was shot. It's not in any of the other photos taken.|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56169.html|238|ndxe200704| Dark circular object floating stock still in the air.  Was not seen when photo was shot. It&#39;s not in any of the other photos taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in Elmsford, NY with business and had some time to kill before a 6:15 appointment. I decided to fiddle around with my new cell phone&#39;s digital camera and started taking pictures of an industrial park across the highway. It was a beautiful spring day, and the sun was still high in the sky/just beginning to go down in the western horizon. I took two or three photos before this one and there was no spot or other anomaly on the photographs. I only noticed this anomaly IN the camera, as this last shot was kind of facing a very bright sun, and did not see the object when I was taking the picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought when I looked at the image (after shooting it) in the camera frame that it was a glitch due to pointing it into/near the sun; that maybe the camera didn&#39;t like that, but as stated, the other images taken didn&#39;t have this very obvious defect. There were no birds, planes, weather balloons, balloons in general or blimps flying overhead. It was a very bright day. I don&#39;t know what this is, but it was there and gone in an instant apparently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had another strange thing happen with a singular stationary star-like bright light shining VERY brightly over my apartment building the other night as well (about five or six  days ago), but I don&#39;t want to send it as it has identifying street markers and I am extremely nervous about sending it via the internet due to the violent/anti-civil rights atmosphere in our government at the moment... I&#39;m not paranoid, but let&#39;s just say I am extremely wary of the possibilities...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to analyze this image, do anything you want to the photo, just please don&#39;t publish my name. If you can get back to me and tell me anything about this, it would be greatly appreciated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

When I was walking back up the drive, I turned to take in a deep blue sky with large cumulus clouds. That is when I saw a large disk-like object sitting next to a big cloud in the southeast at approximately a 35 degree angle. It looked a little shiny because it was probably reflecting the sun from the SW. I would estimate that it was about the size of a large, commercial plane. It did not move for about two minutes, but then moved very slowly to my left and stopped. When it started to move to my right, there was a bright flash of red light from the bottom of the craft. It continued to move slowly to the south until it disappeared from my view because of some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first the object appeared to be moving in a staight line but sudenly it reversed its direction and gained significant altitude.  From the new position it would appear to bob up and down a few times then move again at a high rate of speed toward the north-west.  The sky was bright and sunny with almost no cloud cover or haze.  The oval looked to be either white or silver.  The total time that it was in view was around two minutes.  I do not think that the oval was a airplane or a helicopter as there was no noise and the aerodynamics was beyond anything that I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was bright orange and started shooting off a row of  4 yellow/orange lights,they went up instead of down like a falling star. This lasted a few seconds. About a minute later it happened again. This time it was more to the east. By this time we were about a mile south of Cross Timbers when on the east side of 65 highway half hidden in the clouds was the edge of an oval object with the same row of lights. It was just sitting there. The lights this time were really bright,lighting up what ever it was. We slowed down but didn&#39;t stop until we got home. It was a dark night with no stars out. We have lived here all our lives and never seen anything like this. People have seen stelth boomers, but, this wasn&#39;t shaped like one. We aren&#39;t sure if it was one or three dirrerent objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

THE LIGHT/PULSE WERE APROX 10 SECONDS APART AND STABLE IN THE SKY. AS THE STARS IN THE SKY MOVED DUE TO EARTH ROTATION THE FLASH/PULSE REMAINED IN THE SAME LOCATION.

Shining red orb shaped craft in the west-northwestern sky at same time as the previous sighting (10:35 pm).  This time it was only observed for 2-3 minutes, but the object was moving in the same manner.  This time it did not pick up speed as it went over the horizon, it just slowly made its way over the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/8/07 22:00|New Milford|CT|Light|1 week|Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.  PD))|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56150.html|247|ndxe200704| Formation reapper/dissapear in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the last week, every night after 9:00 pm, a light sometimes in more of a disc form, shows up in the sky and can be seen from my backyard.  The first few sightings were of a blueish formation of lights and seemed to be in the shape of a baseball diamond.  This blueish formation got bigger and smaller, and seemed to hover in the same area and stayed all night.  The next night the same blueish formation was seen again, however this sighting was slightly farther away from the original spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night it was consistent with the day before&#39;s sighting.  Over the last few days, it has been cloudy here so if the formation was there, it was not seen by myself or the other witness.  Tonight was the most interesting of all the sightings so far.  At 9:00 pm est, I went outside and there was a new light, this time it was a bright white/blue light, and seemed to be in a disc formation.  Over the course of 10 minutes, the light got dimmer.  In an effort to take a picture, I let the flash on my camera go off, which in turn, seemed to cause a reaction to the formation, because the formation lit up at least ten times brighter than before.  Over the next five minutes, I also noticed that the original blue formation was visible, but both formations were still very far from one another.  As I was looking at the new formation, I noticed a commercial airplane flying towards the formation, and the airplane was going to fly over the formation.  As soon as the airplane was about to fly over the formation, the lights on the formation dimmed drastically, and seemed to disappear in the night sky.  The most interesting part was that after the plane was out of sight, the formation lit up again, and stayed lit.  As far as I can see, the formation is still presently in the sky, and has stayed extremely bright.<n>
4/8/07 22:00|Winslow and Blue anchor|NJ|Changing|1 minute|Object was low flying and presented itself as a bright blinking strobe, blacked out, re-appeared as 2 circling blinking white lights|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56153.html|248|ndxe200704| Object was low flying and presented itself as a bright blinking strobe, blacked out, re-appeared as 2 circling blinking white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were traveling northbound on the Atlantic City Expressway at approximately 9:45 pm on Sunday April 8th 2007 at mile marker 31.2 through 30.8.  The object was low flying and presented itself as a bright blinking strobe.  It flew west to east and had an erratic flying pattern.  It was absolutely amazing.  It went from a single strobe then blacked out for a second then re-appeared as two blinking white lights.  The two lights seemed to circle each other for approximately 10 seconds then blacked out again only to re-appear as a single strobe.  At this point I pulled the car over just before mile marker 30.8.  My wife and I watched it black out and turn into two blinking white lights again.  At this point it started to disappear behind the eastbound tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is Easter night so traffic was somewhat heavier than usual for a Sunday night on the expressway.  My point being that someone else may have seen this.  Actually I hope someone else has so that it may further validate this sighting<n>
4/8/07 21:05|Baltimore|MD|Light|8 seconds|Stationary white light then picking up speed from the east to the west; arcing across sky; too fast for plane|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56152.html|249|ndxe200704| Stationary white light then picking up speed from the east to the west; arcing across sky; too fast for plane<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stationary light (slightly larger than a star &amp; slightly brighter); then travelled at an increasing speed from almost due east, going towards the south. Angle of original trajectory was about 20 degrees upwards towards the south and bending in a south-southeasterly direction; slowly, at first, then increasing its speed (was much faster than a plane, that would appear as the same size). Travelled in a small arc (towards the west), until going out of sight. There were no colors; just the bright white star-like dot. No sound (although it looked too high for any sound to be detected.)When first seen, it was slightly above the tree-tops in the east of my position. Could easily be seen, even with the ground lights below it. (Had a similar sighting about 10 months ago, which was not reported)<n>
4/8/07 03:20|Ft. Lauderdale|FL|Other|5.5 to 6 seconds|Iluminated straight line in clear blue sky|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56161.html|250|ndxe200704| Iluminated straight line in clear blue sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> 04/08/07 Time 3:20 pm Location East Ft Lauderdale Florida Weather Conditions: The sky was perfect and blue. Not a cloud in sight and there was no sun to obstruct my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was lying out doors in my back yard on my back and looking directly straight up into the clear blue sky I noticed an illuminated thin straight line that appeared directly in my site of view. It shined for a second and looked like it was glass or metallic. At my first sight of the illuminated line it was vertical. It then switched to a horizontal position in a split second and was about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in length against the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the horizontal illuminated perfect straight line tilt up on its right side and move up and down and to the left and to the right. Then I watched it tilt up on its left side and move around the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved with such speed and accuracy I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It then leveled off to a horizontal position, hovered for a second and then took off crossing the entire south side of the sky in a split second. It had easily covered a 180 degree angle if not more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was always a perfect straight illuminated line and never did it bend. It broke every law of physics regarding speed and flight capability. I am very lucky, honored and privileged to have experienced something of this magnitude in my life time. It was truly something that was NOT even close to being of this world or man made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sighting lasted for about 5.5 to 6 seconds. If one wasn’t looking into this exact section/area of the sky at this exact moment one would not be able to see what I saw. It was not visible to all. You really had to be focused on that exact area. The speed of the object was like taking a laser pen and pointing it against a wall and moving it rapidly around up and down to the left and to the right. It was moving that fast in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is only something one could see if they were watching a sci- fi movie. The technology we have in our armed forces and in this world today are (stone- aged) compared to what I have witnessed and I would take a polygraph test 100 times just to prove what I saw was in fact real.   I am so happy and excited that I was able to witness such an extraordinary event in my life time and it was even on Easter Sunday 2007.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you,  MH<n>

I turned off my TV to hear a group of people raising their voice. I walked to our backyard to find out what was going on and overheard a party adjacent to our house. I then heard several male adults yelling in a very excited voices,”What is that”? One male voice yelling, “I think it’s a hot air balloon”? And then another saying, “No way, it’s going to fast.” I walked out from under my patio cover and looked up towards Mt. Baldy area. The sky was overcast with low clouds. When I looked up, I caught a glimpse of a bright light through the cloud cover traveling from West to East. Just as I focused on it the light went out and then 2 seconds later it lit up again. It looked to me like a bright orange ball of light. It was traveling at a high speed parallel to the 210 FWY.  I know this was not a Jet airliner because of the speed, the close proximity to the mountains, and the absence of noise coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I never saw anything out of the ordinary at the time. It wasnt until I was reviewing my footage that I noticed a spherical object floating and then rising. The object is very clearly round...it is definently a sphere of some kind. I can&#39;t see how it could possibly be a balloon being that it was hovering at first. The only possibility I can think of is that I was witnessing a launching of a weather balloon, however this seems highly unprobably being this happened over my neighbors farm. I&#39;m going to go talk to him and see if he saw anything that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using other colors, and objects in the background such as cows and light poles to judge the size of the object, it looks to me to be metallic and larger than a cow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They thought it was a joke at first but quickly found out it wasn&#39;t. They had dispatch call the Air force to see if they had any air craft in the area and to see if they had anything on radar, they said they had no air craft in the area and showed nothing on their radars. The deputies followed it for a long time and listening to them on the scanner i could tell they were shaken up a bit, you could here it in their voices. Nothing was ever printed in the paper or reported as far as I know. I do remember that one deputy sayng that he had never seen lights like that before and that the lights changed colors from time to time. He had gotten within a hundred feet of the object and also said it was not making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

4/6/07 23:15|Allison Park|PA|Light|3 minutes|Very small object seen above north park lake in pittsburgh,|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56135.html|260|ndxe200704| Very small object seen above north park lake in pittsburgh,<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving by north park, right by the drying up lake, when on the other side we saw what seemed like high beams shining directly at us.  It was strange because there isn&#39;t a road passing directly from that angle to get a light from that direction.  Looking low across that way we saw a very small area of light shining on the lake, definitely not a moon or star shine, very direct and focused, like a very high powered flashlight shining on one specific spot of the water for probably about 15 seconds.  We were stopped in the road previously, but pulled over at this point to the no parking, jogging lane.  We thought it was a helicopter with no thought of it being anything more than the police looking for some convict who idiodicly jumped in a freezing lake.  But there was not a sound to be heard, literally nothing but wind and the sound of ourselves walking and breathing.  I was then focused on how intense the beam was on the water, by that I mean that I could actually see some detail beneath the murky water, which I never noticed before on a clear day, yet alone at night.  This didn&#39;t last much longer before the light dimmed significantly and moved towards the edge of the lake, past the top of a pavilion close to the edge of the lake and moved off over the trees in the opposite direction.  I&#39;m just guessing time but this whole period was very short, enough to for us to pull over and walk out of the car to move closer by moving over the guard rail and towards the lake thorough the narrow line of trees.  Then my friend said that the light is over there and pointed up above the trees, I felt like an idiot for not noticing until now but the source was right above us just barely over the treeline on the opposite side of the lake, which was only about 200 yards or so from where we were standing, if that.  Now I don&#39;t know if it really moved away as it seemed and this was another one, or it was the same with a roving light source  The thing itself couldn&#39;t have been large enough for any norma! l sized human being to even come close to fitting inside of.  It was miniscule, not much bigger than the size of a large streetlight and it definitely was not part of a larger object.  It then turned from white to a darker amber shade, but was still bright and very noticeable, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any noticeable direct light shining off onto any objects around us at this point.  The only point that was noticeable now was the source itself  Then it slowly started to move off to the side, moved down below the treeline, back up above, then moved slightly faster, but still slowly, away from us.  I&#39;m not sure if it just turned off, disappeared, or we just lost sight in the trees at this point, but that is the last I saw of it.  We drove over to the other side after this and went right down below where it was.  Maybe we just couldn&#39;t notice in the dark, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary to any of our senses.  Literally, it passed barely over the treeline here, but nothing was out of the ordinary to direct sight or smell.  The three of us were 100% free of all intoxicants except for diet cokes (caffeine) from dinner at a local restaurant at this point.  The one glass of wine I&#39;ve had to this point has only been half enjoyed while I am writing this.  I thought it very strange by the size of the light/object and now that I&#39;ve had time to think about it I&#39;m wondering if the light we saw on the lake was in fact this object itself, or a light shining down from this object while it was above the trees.  I&#39;ve only read about strange objects this size in connection with crop circles, but we&#39;ve never had anything remotely like that in this area and this didn&#39;t seem to be causing that type of phenomenon in any way whatsoever.  If anyone has seen these in the area, or knows more about what this might be we would be very interested in hearing about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Here it goes:   Myself and boyfriend we&#39;re laying on our porch Friday, 4/6/2007  at about 10:30ish?, smoking a ciggarette, when all the sudden I saw 3 lights(plain color, just plain ol&#39; lights, they we&#39;re not blinking either) in a line form with the lights looking like the same distance from eachother, coasting through the sky! It was going pretty dang fast and quiet, no nise...My boyfriend said it was high up there. It was very erie let me tell you...  It went so fast but not fast enough to stick to my mind. I turned my head to (name withheld) and was somethin like, &#34;Did you see that?&#34; &#34;What the fuck (name withheld)?&#34;  was that a UFO&#34; &#34;WtF&#34; He was pretty caught in the moment as well, as far as I remember his resopnse, it was something like &#34;Ya, I saw that?&#34; &#34;I think it was a UFO too!?&#34;  This weekend I told some people and they reacted how I would have reacted..before I saw it, wow.<n>

It was clear and and unusually cold for April in Alabama so I urged the dog to hurry.  I noticed a steady white approaching quickly from due south at what to me seemed a low altitude. There were no flashing lights like I normally see on planes.  As the &#34;light&#34; flew directly over my head I was able to see 4 distinct points of white light forming a diamond shape but still saw nothing flashing.  I followed these lights to the northern horizon but never saw any flashing.   When the light was to my north I noticed a plane crossing east to west.  I could clearly see the flashing lights on the plane and could hear its engine even though it was at a higher altitude than the light.  After the light passed out of view on the northern horizon I noted that were 2 other planes in the air at the time (one to my south passing east to west and the other to my west headed south -both headed toward birmingham) Both of these had flashing lights. I could also hear the engine of the plane to my south as it passed. All 3 of the planes were in &#34;normal&#34; flight patterns  (where I expect to see air traffic)- the light was not.  In fact, I can never remember seeing any plane cross directly over our house like this thing did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;light&#34; passed from southern to northern horizon in less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed it out to the front passenger and they spotted 3 more bright lights, hovering to the right of the freeway and 1 more hovering to the left of the freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The passenger then looked out and up to her right and said, &#34;We are going under one right now!   It is very low and &#39;they&#39; don’t care if we see them.&#34;   She described the craft (her word) as triangular in shape with a light at each rounded corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not able to pull over safely at that time but continued to view the other lights seeming to hover over the huge Arizona Public Service power line that runs north to south, intermittently crossing and re crossing Interstate 17.<n>

The object appeared as a small, star like object near motionless in the western sky.  The object appears to be at approximately 60,000ft. Elevation, bearing 275 degrees from Shelton, Washington, in Mason County.  I estimate it to be approximately 20 miles distant from my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear to be a star but was metallic looking and brightly lit from beneath by the setting sun.  The object remained fairly stationary for well over 15 minutes.  It was the stationary nature of the object that caught our attention.  I used a pair of binoculars to look at the object and found it to be too distant to discern any additional detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD))<n>

I saw a string of 12 or so red lights behind me in my rear view mirror.  Because I made that drive so often I knew the lights didn&#39;t belong.  I slowed way down and took a closer look in the mirror.  It seemed as if the lights were not high at all and looked slightly larger than a major star.  They also seemed to be only about 1000 yards away.  The thing that really freaked me out though was that when I looked behind me rather than in the mirror I didn&#39;t see anything and then after taking two looks behind me and not seeing it (yet still seeing it in the mirror) it disappeared from the mirror to.  The objects were to the west of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking towards the left and hovering over the tree line I saw a very bright light which seemed to be flashing and changing colors: white, red, blue and green.  I figured it was a plane getting ready to land at the Chatham Municipal Airport which is roughly 9 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it continued to hover above the tree line I stopped and watched it for about 15 minutes: it did not move, and kept flashing different colors. I went back to my house to get my camera and it had moved to the north and much higher up. It was also still stationary. I also observed a number of other aircraft in the vicinity of the light (which I am guessing were planes from Logan Airport in Boston?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for an additional 15 minutes and the light (continuing to flash colors) again seemed to be stationary: hovering. I also noticed this time that there appeared to be more of the same lights hovering in an angled formation very close to the bright flashing light which were red. I do not have a camera that can take night pictures or great distances so I could not photograph it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Awhile later (around 10:30 pm) I went outside and looked for the lights but they were gone.<n>

The lights did not appear to be moving or moving very slowly.  My first thought was oh a airplane. But then immediantaly I said no that is not an airplane because the two lights are way to far apart to be an airplaine and there was no blinking light on it like airplanes have.  The two lights were probablly 3 times the wing span of an airplane accross.  I kept watching the lights as I went down the road and the two lights were fixed to each other and not making hardly any movement.  Then I turned off university to go to sparkman and just as I was right near uah I looked up and ther was a huge traingle shaped craft above my head.  It was grey and black in color and I could see it very clearly.  It had a red light on the bottom.  I kept traveling and as I turned north onto sparkamn I saw the lights moving to the northeast I could no longer make out the triangle shape I just saw the two widespaced huge lights.  This event caused me to call the 3 local tv stations and ask if any one had reported seeing a triangle in the sky.  The respone I got from all 3 stations was no.  They did not seem to even want to know what I had seen.  At this point I started to doubt what I had seen bec there was a lot of traffic on the road and someone else had to have seen it.  The only thing that makes me think I did not just imagine it is that I watched it for about 5 min.  before I actually was underneighth it and saw the shape of it.  My impression is that it may be some kind of exp aircraft because we live right near redstone arsenal.  The object was not making any really unsual movement except that it did not appear to move at all but hover or move very slowly and I heard absolutely no sound coming from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Some cloud cover, but plane in sky at same time frame moved from north of Hunt Hwy to south of Hunt into same vicinty.  This plane did not &#34;disappear&#34;.

I was sitting I&#39;m my room playing a video game when I noticed a bright light in the sky that was not there earlier.  It was positioned over lake michigan blinking in and out numerous times.  During this event it looked as if little red lights were coming from it but I&#39;m not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Our base is about 35 miles from O&#39;Hare airiport and you could see other planes flying around but this one object did not move. It only seemed to get higher in the air.  To make sure I was not seeing things I called my roommate to come and look and he also saw the same thing I did. It just does not seem right.  As I am typing this report I am still looking out my window looking at this light or what ever it is blinking in and out.  I have been around the military all my life and have seen many different airplanes and this was not any kind of plane I have ever seen.  It might be a planet or something I don&#39;t know. I just thought this was interesting enough to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

4/3/07 22:00|Phoenix|AZ|Other|30 minutes|Parachute shaped object over North Phoenix|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56104.html|294|ndxe200704| Parachute shaped object over North Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my backyard at approximately 10 PM, looked up in the sky, and noticed an object that appeared to be floating in the sky.  The moon was behind me so the light was reflecting off of the object.  I initially thought it was a paraglider, but it was not moving across the sky and there was no sound.  I called my wife out to the yard and she brought binoculars.  I used the binoculars to view the object, it looked like a a group of about 10-20 large white balloons (shaped like a parachute) with a cable pointing towards the ground.  It seemed to be pretty high in the sky, but as it was night I can not say exactly how high it was.  I watched the object for about twenty minutes, it moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  I then went into my front yard and walked up the street about 200 feet, the object was above me and off to the side.  I thought that maybe it was some kids playing a prank, flying an odd shaped kite in the sky at night, so I got in my car and drove to the park up the street.  I didn&#39;t see anyone at the park, but I did see some odd flashing lights on or beneath the playground equipment.  I didn&#39;t get out of my car so I don&#39;t know if there were people on the playground, but I definitely saw some flashing lights on the ground.  I then drove home, viewed the object from the front yard and then the back yard, and then went inside to quickly search the internet for images of weather balloons.  I went outside approximately 5 minutes later and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke the next morning to my alarm clock, it wakes me up to KTAR 92.3 FM, a local talk radio station.  The very memory I have of that morning is listening to a quick story about some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership and a plane almost hit them, and then the announcer quickly moved on to the next story.  I felt like I was awake, but I can&#39;t say with 100% accuracy that I did not dream the story.  However, I do have a very clear memory of waking up to that news story.  I searched KTAR&#39;s homepage for the balloon story and also searched azcentral.com, but did not find any stories.  The nearest car dealership is about 8 miles away to the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought of three explanations for what I saw.  The first is that it was someone playing a prank and flying an odd shaped kite or balloon high up in the sky on the night of the full moon.  The second explanation would be some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership.  The third explanation is that it was a UFO.  I doubt the second explanation just because the object was &#34;floating&#34; above my neighborhood for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I did I was greeted not by the sky I&#39;d been expecting, but by the dark night sky.  I looked around for the source of the light, and not finding it, I went to get a glass of water.  I figured I&#39;d imagined it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came back to bed the light was back, and this time I could see the source.

She said she felt and heard the vibration of strong energy or what felt like electricity  in her room.  Then she looked out her window and saw a round shape object spinning into a green and white colors.  She said the thing was flying south until she lost sight of it.  She then jumped out of bed and ran out of her room.  She came to me (mom) in a state of confusion and shocked looking pale and unable to talk  Until she calmed down she was then able to tell and describe what she saw.  This is her first sighting.  I believe she probabley was able to sense thier energy flying over our home.<n>
4/2/07 21:00|Downingtown|PA|Formation|unknown|White,green and red orb seen in Chester County PA|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56093.html|302|ndxe200704| White,green and red orb seen in Chester County PA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lights in the sky observed while driving home from night class from local university.  At first they looked like small aircraft (twin engine sort), then noticed that they were in a formation over crest of a ridge near Downingtown PA.  Never seen small aircraft fly in formation and wondered why and tried to watch them as I drove.  The colors were normal yellowish golden in color like of an airplane heading in the direction of Philadelphia International Airport. As I approached the ridge, the lights disappeared over it as if flying backward with headlights in front.  There were no other blinking lights such as red and green as on regular air craft, just the yellowish gold light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the golden lights went over the ridge, one craft continued on as if to land at an airport further West such as Lancaster or Harrisburg.  It continued traveling West as I headed West.  The appearance of the object had changed from small aircraft shape to orb-shape sometimes appearing to rotate end over end.   The color changed from yellow/gold to bright white with bright white beams of light protruding from the orb.  There were also bursts of red and green colors emitting from the circumferce of the orb (as seen through a lousy pair of binoculars).  Family member came outside to investigate the object as it continued to hover in the Western sky from my house.  A half hour later, object seemed further away than before, but still hovering and emitting the three colors of light.  Last night was cloud covered so the object wasn&#39;t visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/2/07 17:30|South Amherst|OH|Cylinder|1 minute|Two backward slanted cylinders flying in a "momma duck" formation.  One huge, one smaller (still large in size)in broad daylight|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56069.html|303|ndxe200704| Two backward slanted cylinders flying in a &#34;momma duck&#34; formation.  One huge, one smaller (still large in size) in broad daylight<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went outside while talking on the phone.  Sky was clear blue with no clouds.  Clear visability.  Very windy day with wind gusts up to 26mile with a WNW18 wind.  As I was talking, I was looking up at some buzzards gliding in the wind....I saw two objects that looked like clylinders that were tipped at a diagonal...with the slant going left to right...like this:   \ \ The top cylinder was twice as large as the bottom one. Both were slanted the same way and heading INTO the west winds....I was trying to figure out what the heck these things could be.  They were both stark white and pretty big as they seemed to be pretty far up in the Northern sky.  We get alot of Cleveland and Elyria air traffic, and this was definitely not anything I have ever seen.  They were gliding or flying smoothly and kept the same space distance between them.  The smaller object was below and slightly behind the larger one....and as they flew they kept a precise distance between them.  Definitely two separate objects. No overhead noise and no chemtrails....but as I was watching them, an aircraft flying east and higher than these objects came by...this jet/aircraft made noise and had a chemtrail, just as this aircraft was about over or on top of these objects they just disappeared....or blinked out...right in the blue, blue skies!!!  The larger one must have been really huge because the smaller one was big, and they both just &#34;stood out&#34; in the blue skies because they were so big and stark white.  I am perplexed.  As I said they flew against the wind at a steady pace.....faster than normal air traffic and with no noise, no trail...and vanished before the jet was going to fly on top of them....They were very smooth in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I noticed a swarm of buzzards or some type of bird of prey so I watched the circle overhead.  I then noticed a small black sphere moving across the sky at about the same speed an aircraft would fly.  At first I thought it was some sort of military craft, which is not unusual around Virginia Beach.  But then the craft stopped abruptly, backtracked dropped slightly in altitude and then continued in the direction it was originally heading.  It continued behind a cloud and then reappeared even slightly lower than it was before.  It then paused, hovered for a moment and then shot off amazingly quick up and to the left, back into the cloud.   I stared at the sky for a few more min, hoping to see  it again, but I didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Reminds me of a basket ball in shape not very, very bright like a light but more of an internal orange glow.  Did not bounce or move at all just seems like someone placed it in the sky like a picture.  Got out of my car in the subdivison with mouth open and just stared.  There was a person who pulled up along side of me also staring.  He ask me do I see that!  I asked him does he see it!  Very strange first and only experience! Proceeded to mothers house to see if she was o.k.  Woke her up to see if she heard or saw anything.  Went back outside and walked up the street to turn and see if it was still there.  It was not!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I saw a semi-circular outline in the sky with yellowish/orange lights. I did&#39;nt get the best look as I turned the corner towards Dodge St. As I turned West on Dodge I saw it again but now it was further in the distance. Then as it moved SW very quickly and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She acting strangely and was just staring with the dog back inside already, so I asked her what she was doing and she said something about looking at a star, but she thought it was twinkling too brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said,&#34; it&#39;s probably just Venus or something. I looked at this star for a moment which seemed to be in our N by NW sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright moon was behind me and I tried to see if I could see any other stars in the sky and or if I could see what I thought were planets versus stars so that I could explain it to my mother that it was probably just nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked behind me I saw what seemed to also be a bright star but it was moving and then slowly at first then seemed to speed up and then resume previous speed. It  moved in and out of the clouds as there was some medium cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed that there were two objects, then I noticed there were two objects the second was behind the other but not following directly behind it but to the left and behind to the indication of about 12 inches if I put my fingers apart as an indication as I looked up in the sky. The objects looked to be of similar size and brightness to the planet Venus when it is the biggest and brightest in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that was strange so I decided to go around the house into the backyard to get a better look without the roof of the house obstructing my view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking for navigation lights and strobe, so I was looking for green, red, or strobe of normal aircraft that fly over our skies as this is a heavy traffic area, but I saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I scanned  sky to my left to again see if I could locate any stars planets etc or anything else to compare these objects to, and I saw another object slowly moving through the sky as the others and identical, I was  looking south southeast  I could see no other stars just these objects in the sky an a very bright moon that was partially obscured by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I was looking at three objects that were different than the one I originally witnessed that had the attention of my mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to judge distance and altitude if you have nothing to gage by, so all I can say is if I were holding my hands up to the sky out at 45 degree angles and my armpit being a tangent line that would be going straight out then the objects were that far apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to better explain if I was holding my hands up in front of me the first two objects traveling west were 36 to 40 inch&#39;s in front of the solo traveling object, also moving west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So two objects were traveling west as I was looking south, south west and another also traveling west as I was looking south south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now here is the weird part and i have no way to explain how this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking s se at the third object traveling west, I turned to look back at the other two objects and they were right back in the same place they had been when I first saw them and then they started to move west again as if the entire event had been rewound on a video and that disturbed me greatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time my mother had come out in the back yard.  I was asking her to watch them move and I pointed out the other object in that was traveling solo and it too was in it&#39;s original position as I first saw it,as I looked back at it  Then I went back to looking at the two traveling west together and my mother was looking at the single object which she said had stopped and then started to move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized at that time this situation was indeed strange to say the least and I immediately without hesitation came to my computer which was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered in the search for peter davenport UFO reporting center and had the number to call within seconds and within one minute was making the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was instructed to call another witness immediately and  then proceeded to follow that instruction as best I could. I called a friend that I had been visiting earlier in the evening as said go outside and look. That person witnessed three object as I did and also when she looked back at the two they appeared to be in the original position that she saw them in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So the objects were continually moving west and at varied speeds and then if you looked away for any reason and then observed them again the objects seemed to be where you first saw them, but they never appeared to stop moving,  However when I first saw the single object looking S SE at first it seemed stationary then moved slightly and then moved in a continuous manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the witnesses including myself were under the influence of any type of drug or alcohol and had not partaken in any drugs or alcohol or any stimulating substances as we are all non drinkers and do not take drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Civil Air Patrol cadet squadron commander and held the rank of Second Lt. having served in CAP for five years. I was cadet commander of Squadron 130  Group One  based at Van Nuys Airport  Prior to that I was a Search base radio NCO, Squadron 10 Group Two in Northern California and was based at Reid Hill-view airport, in Palo Alto California  I am a trained CAP Air Search and rescue observer.I have also served on ground teams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I participated in more than 25 searchs in five years and attended flight training school. I learned how to fly at 16 years old, however I am not currently a licensed pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was strange indeed and the objects in the sky did not act or move like conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion is that what was observed can only be filed as unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned back outside after calling the reporting center and my friend, the cloud cover was heavy and not medium and none of the sky was visible which I also thought was strange indeed, as only medium cloud cover was visible during the observations of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this witness for the excellent report he submitted, and for his having done everything right, i.e. for his having attempted to have other witnesses observe the object.

It was close. Maybe 3 - 5 miles away. Could have been closer. The light was a very bright white. It was moving towards the NNE, can&#39;t say how fast, but it was about the normal speed of a low-flying airplane or helicopter. Something about it&#39;s movement seemed odd and really caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I realized there were no blinking lights at all on it, so I decided to watch it closely. It appeared to slow down and almost completely stop just for a moment and get brighter, then the light went out completely and left no trace whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled to the side of the road and watched for a few minutes and to see if I heard any noise from a plane or helicopter, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At one point I was examining the sky at about 2 or three inches at a time.  I was looking towards the northwest and I saw a blue light with no aviation lights flew from nw towards the southeast.  I thought it was strange but when on with my observing.  About 1 minute later I saw 2 more identical lights and then more and more.  I saw at least 6 to 8 identical lights crossing the sky.  These binoculars are powerful enough to see galaxies and other messier objects.  At first I thought these lights could be sattelites but the research I have done says there are only about 14 sattelites that can be observed from earth and they are only visable for a few seconds at a time as they tumble in and out of the sun&#39;s rays.  I tracked all of these objects from horizon to horizon.  Since then I can go out every night and if I am patient enough, I can see these lights every time.  Have you ever heard of this phenomena.

It was moving fast and there were no blinking lights to indicate an airplane. I kept watching it when it just disappeared almost as if someone flipped of a light switch that powered the light. There were no clouds in the sky where it vanished; the moving light just went out. Not sure if it was a UFO or not but it was very interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He called nine year old son to lay on the bow with him and asked him to just look at the one star.  The boy said &#34; oh my god, it moved! &#34;  We had the radio on, myself witness #3 heard their talking abruptly and stearnly turn into,  it&#39;s a UFO! and several whooos and oh my gods and you got to see this from both of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I blew them off for five minutes or so as I continued to make my leader lines for casting and made sarcastic comments with,  Witness #1&#39;s wife, who is witness #2&#39;s mom and herself witness #4.  Their voice and concern grew greater as he insisted for his wife to grab their low memory digital video recorder.  I soon realized that whatever they were seeing, they were seeing at the same time.  He said to me &#34; come up here and lay still and dont take your eyes off that star for at least three minutes.  I believe in UFO&#39;s and government technologies, and I concider myself to be very sientific, very good with spacial reasoning. I&#39;m familuar with referencing to stars, earth, moon, and ground effect.  Let me add belated that we were at anchor with a good catch of something at 40 to 50 feet in gauge with my 100&#39; rope and depth finder.  I own the boat so I was very attentive to making sure we were not drifting, however, as you read on, drift, is not a factor in this equation.  There was ofcourse some light movment if positional swinging off our 50&#39; pivital point, but we were at a cove so the direction was within 15 - 25 degrees variance at the maximum.  NOw to continue with what happened.  I climb up on the sun deck of the bow with my friend and his son.  I laid my head flat with vigorous attention on this star.  My friend said &#34; do you see that,  it&#39;s slowly moving side! wats, no w watch.  It will change direction.  I did notice some unusual kind of movement but nothing conclusive at all.  As a scientist and engineer I imediatly use my fingers and hands to position other stars and hold as a referrence.  As my friend did as I did, I explained to him that the muscles in the human body can move so slowly that you never notice the difference making an unreliable frame of referrence, but for now well see if we notice.  He said  &#34; watch, I saw a light at the end of it and it moved much faster and the suddenly stop and suddenly make total direction changes.  As he is telling me this, I&#39;m recalling in my mind the video of the NASA Shuttle in orbit that filmed what I think they called debris floating along one direction and then a sudden small flash and it darted like 120 degrees if the direction it was heading.  He&#39;s got my interest but not yet his wifes or our friend the 5th witness.  As promised this object definetly made sudden fast burst of movment and then totally changed velocity.  I watched in amazment as we witnessed a few of the longer traveled burst that could not have, in any way, been any sort of misguided frame of reference, drift, pivot or spin of our boat, or ground effect or our eyes becoming lazy and moving.  Partly because we all saw they same movments at the same time.  At this point I am confident my friend&#39;s claim correct.  I start to report to his wife what I&#39;m seeing as he is begging her to start the vidoe recorder for him.  I then also grabbed my phone with short video and tried to record what we were seeing.  His wife at this time was still giggling and joking and really didnt take anyone seriously.  We both try to capture the object on film as it starts doing far more aerobatical phenominons.  I guessed that this object if it were the size of a commercial airliner, would have been approximatly 25,000 - 45,000 feet AGL and at one point I had to trace the object while holding my video phone pointed at around 50 degrees in the sky to 85 - 90 degrees in less than 1 ! 1/2 seco nds and then suddenly stop.  My friend has the very bright idea to then signal this UFO ( I am calling now a UFO because all 5 people on the boat are now convinced ) with a mag light.  I do not know if it was coinsidence or if his signaling actually provoked very rapid and major changes in velocity.  It started to look like a ping pong ball ( a little exsadurated but you get the point ) moving in what appeared to be erratic behavoir.  My friend says he suspects there is another below by 40 degrees and left by 60 degrees.  As we watched it as well, it appeared to have less abrupt and frequent similar movments.  We all concintrated on the first sighted UFO more do to the show it was putting on for us.  Because of the less amount of interest in the sighted UFO #2 we ended up noticing that it appeared to be getting closer and with my no-fear friend still flashing the light at it every so often,  the rest of us were starting to get pretty frightened so we all agreed to get out of there as fast as possible.  We fled to the North side of the Hwy 150 bridge.  It was still visable to us and maintained the erratic behavior until we stopped following it until around 5-6 AM.  It was by far the most unusual and appreciated experience of my life.  I almost forgot, could very well have been the shock and rush to catch this on video, but my PC phone by verizon, frooze up more than once and had to be restarted while trying to get to the video menus so I could record and the footage I did get was only two five second shots.  My friend appeared to have issues with their equipment too, however, they were new to their recorders functions.<n>

Noticed bright flashing lights white and pink in color. The tree tops were swaying back and forth and my initial thought that it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the object closer there were bright flashing lights and was a saucer about 15 feet above my car. It was about 200 feet in diamter and had small windows that was protruding bright lights. I drove under the craft and got the heck outta there, (there was no sound).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped about twenty miles later to get gas and as I got out of the car I got shocked my some type of discharge on my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note: We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report. PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> In reference to the above report, I cannot say whether it is a serious report or not. However, having lived in the Central Florida region for about 20 years, I can say that many strange things have been seen along State Highway 60 and US 441.  I have seen things in the Polk County and Osceola area many times and so have others I know.  This area is desolate cow country as well as farming areas growing sod for new homes and crops.  The most desolate is between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Fl. On the east to west 60 route and north south 441 area between Lake Okeechobee and Holopaw, Fl a small community where 441 meets 192.  Highway 60 and 441 intersect at Yeehaw Junction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add that south of Lake Wales on US 27 in Avon Park there is a military area known as the Avon Park bombing range.  This past spring south of Lake Wales in the direction of the Range, I noticed lights the same as those seen over Phoenix several years ago. The duration of the sighting was about an hour and I was not the only witness.  I should have reported it then, but I think the out come would have been the same.  They did not fall but where stationary, at times all lit, at the same time in a flat arc, and at other times the lead light would extinguish and immediately the rear light would come on.   Prior to this formation, all the lights were traversing through the night sky but staying in the same general area.  As I recall this was between 2100 and 2200 in late April or early May.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
