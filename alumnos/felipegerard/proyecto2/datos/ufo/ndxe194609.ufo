We had no &#34;running water&#34;, so every nite I took a bucket and went to the RR water car and got the water for the nite. It was a trip of about 300 yards each way. I was about 1/4 of the way to the tracks when there was a very bright flash of light in the sky.It was bright enough that it cast very black shaddows in front of my body. I stopped, turned and saw what appeared to be a very large object on fire at about 45 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be about 10 miles distance.I could observe what appeared to be strucural members (like the beams you would see on a bridge)that were outlined by the fire. I watched this object move acrost maybe 30 degrees till it disapeared behind &#34;castledome&#34; butte.It appeared to be below the mountains to our North-east, and the butte to our NW,and went below the crest of the butte. I told my mother what I had seen,and she said it was maybe an airplane,but I had never seen a plane that looked like that.There were no wings,or tail surfaces,and these would have been visible in the light it was causing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/12/46|Oak Lawn|IL|Formation|15 seconds|V-formation 5 silver disks with 1 trailing behind, size of small peas high & fast  heading NE  bypassing Chicago  to Indiana|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43077.html|2|ndxe194609| V-formation 5 silver disks with 1 trailing behind, size of small peas high &amp; fast  heading NE  bypassing Chicago  to Indiana<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the War II, I collected airplane cards, so I naturally looked in he sky and did observe many war planes in our area during the war.  One fall morning going to school and waiting in line to get on the school bus, I was looking up at the very blue sky.  It was a very clear day.  I saw six silver discs flying in V-formation and there was one in the following in back of it, like the war planes flew.  They were very high in the sky and about the size of very small peas, heading northeast as if to bypass Chicago and head into Indiana.  They made no noise (as the airplanes were quite noisy) and they were crossing the sky at a very great speed.  There were no jets at that time that I knew of and if there were, they would have made lots of noise and not have gone that fast.  I stood there and watched them and the kids were calling me to get on the bus.  I believe there was something in the Chicago newspapers about others sighting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
