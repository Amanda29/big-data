We were stationary as the roaad was blocked with traffic. As we waited for the traffic to move i looked to the right of me and saw a massive silver disc shaped u.f.o. I was amazed, it was early evening and hundreds of people were crossing the bridge. Some were pointing at the object others continued on there joourney as though it wasnt there. It was almost as though time had stood still for some others moved very slowly. The craft was the typical flying saucer shape it had portholes all around the centre and a blueish neon light came from under it, the portholes were bright as though a bright light was on i could see some of the windows looked darker than others, i thought someone was watching us. The disc then seemed to disappear but when i looked far into the distance i could see it. I looked at my boyfriend and asked him if he saw that, he said what, i looked at my friend and said did You see that she said yes. I could not believe that my boyfriend had not seen it as he was in the best position and it was right in front of him. Myself and my friend have spoken about this once since when i approached her about it asking if she remembered she said yes but she did not wish to discuss it further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

Sitting on a west facing beach a square object approched, it appaered to be made up of squares all joined together. It appeared to be standard grey metal no flashing lights, just moving at speed.  The object moved in from the sea  and disapeared over some hills out of sight.  Even now many years later i still remember this clearley.  Some years later we moved to the area (1986) and occaisionaly drive past and think of that brief moving object.  I dont have any memory of this being followed by any planes.

We saw an object that at first looked like a plane.  But, the lights on this object were NOT blinking on and off.  Instead, they were pulsating in different colors of green, red, and yellow.  There were three or four solid round color patterns of green, red, and yellow that seemed to pulsate as they traveled around the craft in a circle while it flew from south to north.  It would move very slowly before speeding up and slowing again performing maneuvers unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  We (my brother and I)  got into the car to go get completely away from the city lights, and we were able to keep track of it from the car, but lost sight of it about ten or fifteen minutes from the initial sighting. It was as close as an airplane, but made no sound. It definitely did not move like any known earthlike aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/20/83 22:30|Goldens Bridge|VA|Chevron|30 minutes|Immense Chevron Hovers Silently Over I-684, the wingspan eclipsed the 8 lane highway, shoulders and maybe another 50-100ft further|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84355.html|4|ndxe198307| Immense Chevron Hovers Silently Over I-684, the wingspan eclipsed the 8 lane highway, shoulders and maybe another 50-100ft further<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in late spring we (myself, my boyfriend of the time, and his 3 best buds) were driving down from North Salem going the quickest way to I-684 to get to Katonah.  As we were driving this winding tree crowded road, we saw glimpses of what appeared to be a strange “plane” with a highly unusual fuselage and even stranger lights through breaks in the tree tops.  My boyfriend was the first to notice this puzzling sight.  He was convinced it was a UFO and hit the gas to chase it.  We were flying down this backroad trying to get to an open spot for a better look before it was gone.  He shut off the headlights so that we might be able to track it’s path better.  Then suddenly we broke out into the road leading up to the over pass for I-684 South, we were near Katonah, and we stopped the car on the over pass and all got out.  We looked around for it and suddenly there it was, about a mile away, coming North directly over I-684, why no one stopped or slowed on! the highway to watch this still puzzles me to this day.  It was huge!   In the shape of a chevron, it’s wingtips  eclipsed the edges of the highway, surpassing it on either side by at least 100 ft. on either side.  We watched it come in silence.  We were all holding our breath, in shock watching this amazing site.  It was no more than 100 feet above the highway and moving slow enough that due to it’s immense size it should have just dropped out of the sky were it using any kind of propulsion that we were familiar with.  It was moving so slowly that it scared us.  We walked from the car to the bridge rails faster than it was moving towards us.  But we stayed rooted to our spots, watching it come.  There were lights all along the bottom outer edge of the vessel, the lights spanned the bow of the &#34;ship&#34; from port to starboard, but did not encompass the aft or stern; this area stayed in darkness for the most part.  The lights were multi colored and flashed in a pattern similar ! to a chasing pattern.  The lights were blue, purple, green, wh! ite, red , yellow, pink many colors and the raced about the edge of the ship one color chasing another.  It was amazing to watch, the pattern changed sporadically with some areas blinking a set of colored lights while the rest continued their chasing racing pattern about the anterior.  We stood there for at least 10 minutes watching this, and still it came closer.  At the point where it was almost completely over us we saw a glowing light of a color I cannot name emanating from an area in the center of the underbelly.  We looked for markings but other than the lights saw nothing.  We looked hard at the shell to discern it color and composite, but it seemed to absorb the night around it so that all we could tell was the outline of the vessel.  It was at this point that we realized the only sound we heard was ourselves breathing very hard.  The vessel was utterly silent.  There was an odd occurrence, as if all of this were not  odd enough... not only was the ship silent as the grave bu! t we did not hear anything else, not all of the cars rushing directly under us at 70 mph, this was a Saturday Night and there were cars constantly rushing below us 2 and 3 at a time on 8 lanes.  We did not hear crickets or anything else but the wind, and even that seemed like a faraway breeze.  As we stood frozen to that spot, all thinking similar thoughts the ship stopped for more than a few beats, not moving at all and yet it did not fall out of the sky and crush us.  Now, this hits us all at the same time and the spell breaks.  We all drop our eyes and look around at one another and without a word we all simultaneously start to walk backwards slowly from the rail watching this “ship”.  Someone tripped or something and we all looked to see if he was okay, when we turned back the vessel had started to move ever so slowly north again, we turned with it to watch it move.  And without even blinking our eyes it was gone.  We could not fathom how it just disappeared and looked ! to the skies to see if we could find it, and there it was...ma! ybe 10 m iles up I-684 moving slowly again, directly over the highway and not veering from following it north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a 18 and leaving for college, my boyfriend was an advanced degree engineering student at a NYSU school, his friends were all business men from NYC.  We were all sober and not under the influence of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was late, probably around 2200 hours. I sat up and opened the blinds to take a look.  Hovering outside at a height of around 10 meters was a saucer shaped craft of metallic construction. The total distance waway from my window was only about 50 feet. Encircling the outer edges of the craft were a series of lights, red, green, and blue. The lights created a soft glow about the craft, which was approximately 30 feet or so in diameter and rotated slowly as it hovered in place. The craft&#39;s hull seemed to have a bluish hue with a silver base color. The height of the craft was approximately 8-10 feet at the center, possibly a touch more. We lived on an old one-block dead end with only a few other homes on the street. Behind the craft was simply our next door neighbor&#39;s one story house, with a large pine tree off to the right and our garage off to the left. No other major lights were present (a couple street lights were on) and the sky was clear. The humming noise given off by the craft continued to pulsate throughout the encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for 1-2 minutes and then ran to my mothers room to get a camera, almost falling over the kitchen table. She told me it must be a helicopter or something and I persisted to tell her that it was no helicopter. I couldn&#39;t find a camera so I sprinted back to get another look, but the craft had already begun to fly away. The last I could see of it was as it flew at a good distance behind the large pine tree in our yard (it faded behind it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It is hard to explain the pipe-like pattern that covered bottom.<n>
7/15/83 21:15|Poughkeepsie|NY|Other|3 Minutes|1500-2000 foot UFO seen above Mid-Hudson Bridge by Poughkeepsie, NY in July 1983.|6/18/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37362.html|7|ndxe198307| 1500-2000 foot UFO seen above Mid-Hudson Bridge by Poughkeepsie, NY in July 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the passenger in a car that crossed the Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge to Poughkeepsie, NY at about 9:15PM. As we wended our day at about 25 mph (speed limit) down the serpentine on-ramp from the toll booths, both bridge stanchions were visible directly ahead of us. For less than 30 seconds, they were blocked from view as the road took us through blasted out rock. When we took a left turn out of the rocks and onto the bridge, an immense object was directly ahead of us, hovering just above the bridge(less than 100 feet). Though no surface was visible on the object, it&#39;s outline was traced by thousands of multi-colored lights, many in motion. My friend and I simultaneously shouted, &#34;holy shit,&#34; as we drove across the span, which the bridge authority later told me was about 3,000 feet. Parked at our end of the bridge, it&#39;s length extended 2/3rds+ of the way across it, or approximately 2000 feet, and certainly no less than 1500. As we drove across the span, it was visible out of every window in the car for most of our crossing.  About halfway across, I rolled the window down and looked directly up at it, as my friend white-knuckled the steering wheel, repeatedly uttering, &#34;I&#39;m not stopping, I&#39;m not stopping.&#34; It was completely silent, and many of the lights underneath were apparently rotating around a central axis at speeds that were changing often. The strange thing is that they didn&#39;t appear to accelerate or decelerate, but were instantly going different speeds, like the speeds were quantized. Some of the lights were detached from the main object and rotating around the central point at some distance. A glowing spherical orb of an orangish color was about 25 feet from my head, just beyond the bridge girders, moving with us. About a half mile south of the bridge, a smaller lighted object was hovering above the river channel, which may have been the more commonly seen-then and there-chevron shaped UFO seen edge on. As we got across the bridge, to the top of the hill, at Market! street, I turned and saw that it was still there, in the same position it had been. Note that this immense object had to have silently moved out of nowhere to just above the bridge in the 30 seconds that it was not in our line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night of this sighting, the local radio stated that 1500 people reported seeing it, including numerous police, doctors and nurses at Vassar Hospital.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I saw something moving slowly across the sky and what was strange about it was that there was a series of lights pulsing.  They were, to the best of my recollection, green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain it was NOT a plane or a helicopter.  It was a truly amazing sight.  It was hard to see the shape but it seemed to be like a Frisbee.  It was fairly high up in the sky, so it’s hard to say how large it was.  The series of light pulsing seemed to be on the near the bottom or the side of the craft and were pulsing from the front of the craft to the back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/15/83 18:00|Grand Prairie|TX|Unknown|6 Minutes|UFO cloud/Hollowgram seen over Dallas Texas in the 1980's|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69379.html|11|ndxe198307| UFO cloud/Hollowgram seen over Dallas Texas in the 1980&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around the middle of summer in the early 1980&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know the exact date because I was only around 12 years old at the time.  I was in the family room watching TV with a few other family members which included my father. My older brother was out in front of the house trying to make time with his girlfriend. He saw something in the sky and came running into the house to tell my father to come have a look. Being a big fan of Star Wars and Close encounters at that time I wasn&#39;t going to miss a chance to see something that maybe out of this world. We grew up down the street from a Dallas navel base. To this day my brother clams that it was directly over the base. I remember it being directly over the house. What we saw was not a disk or craft of any kind. It wasn&#39;t scary to me at the time but has become so, as I have still to this day never even heard of anything like this being viewed by any other UFO observer. It was a cloud that had the center of it&#39;s mass erased. In the center was a series of neon blue lines that changed every 5 seconds or so. First look it was parallel blue lines. Then the lines would change direction. Reverb and change into something like dots. Then wavy lines and continued to do this kind of thing for about 5 to 6 minutes. It looked like a TV that was having trouble getting a signal. As if this cloud was one big hallow gram that was having trouble getting the center portion to work.  By this time a crowd of about 10 people where standing in the front yard looking up at this thing. At first I thought it was a blimp. I know that blimps have display screens but at the time couldn&#39;t do this kind of thing. I stayed in the front yard looking up for the next 2 1/2 hours thinking I&#39;d see a blimp exit the clouds. Nothing! No noise, No craft, No blimp! I lived with my parents in the house from 1971 to 1993. I&#39;ve never seen a blimp that large Nor have I seen one in the area because of the naval base being so close (4 Miles). I&#39;ve been pouring over the UFO web sites to ! try and see if anyone has heard of or seen anything like what I&#39;ve described. I&#39;ve had no luck at all. I do have witnesses of the event. This includes 2 of my brothers, A sister and my father.I&#39;m 37 now and It would be great to talk to others that may have seen something like this. Was it a signal from something related to the naval base? This is something both my father and older brother offered as a possible explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We proceeded west on Baya to the intersection with US 90 west, a traffic light stopped us directly under the object that was hovering/with the sun roof open. There were many other cars stopped as well.  I knew that many others had to witness this event.  The object had a large round ball of light at the front with what appeared to be 2 prongs sticking out of the rear at an angle of 45 degrees, ladder like silver colored things seem to connect the prongs.  We were under it for the entire red light, it then made a sequence of beeps (computer noise) is what I called it then and diappeared within 2 seconds completely out of sight.  I did a u-turn at the light and went directly to the Lake City police station where we filed a report. I told the officer I did not want him to think I was crazy, but I was shaking, overtaken by the event.  He explained to me that he did not think us crazy at all, because himself and a group of officers were called to a home in south Columbia county where a craft hovered directly over 5 police officers and took off @ a speed as unbelievable as the one I had described.  I still get goose bumps to this day talking about it.  This is the only report of this kind I have ever made. I might add the car stereo and lights reacted strangley for a few moments.  The cassette player kept rewinding the same song.  The car stalled briefly. The clock lost time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/15/83 00:00|Vanderbilt|MI|Other|15min-?|Swirling inverted black-hole cloud with a brightly lit center and whisps of clouds and lightening coming from the center of the mass.|8/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24619.html|15|ndxe198307| Swirling inverted black-hole cloud with a brightly lit center and whisps of clouds and lightening coming from the center of the mass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fourteen years old, living in the family home, which was an isolated house in the middle of a field. Having grown up in that home from the age of four, I was familiar with all the sounds that would occur in and around the house. On several occasions I thought that I had heard noises, and I would grab an AR-7 22-caliber rifle that my uncle had given me and would pose with it in plain view in the front picture window to scare away anybody who may have been creating a noise by nosing around outside. Not the wisest thing to do, in retrospect, but I was a virtual child and thought that a show of arms might protect me when my family was away or asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular occasion, my mother was asleep in her bedroom while I was awake watching television. I heard two distinct bumps on the wall of the house just outside the familyroom. I was so sure that I heard the noises that I not only grabbed my rifle, but cocked it to load a round in the chamber, which primed it for a seven-shot semi-automatic operation. I walked out the garage door and around to the side of the house, thinking that either there was somebody out there or that an animal of some sort was causing the noise. I looked around the corner of the house, and didn&#39;t see anything. Then I looked up...<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw doesn&#39;t fit into any description of a UFO. The only way I can describe it is that it was a single swirling cloud much larger than my home, rising up into a funnel, which terminated in a brightly lit, white cloud. Inside the funnel there were both whisps of smoke and lightening, which went straight down the sides of the funnel, defying the flow of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so entranced by what I saw, that I hadn&#39;t noticed until minutes later that I had dropped my rifle. I grabbed it and ran inside my home to wake up my mother, who came outside in time to see the last remnants of the swirling cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed awake for the remainder of the night, watching the news for any report of a strange weather phenomenon that may have explained what I saw, but no mention of it was ever given by any of the local stations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been over twenty years, and the wonder of that object has never left me. I&#39;ve told very few people about it, since most people refuse to believe in anything unless they see it with their own eyes. I&#39;m writing this now in the hopes that perhaps somebody has seen something similar and can help me understand what it was. In all the years since the event, I&#39;ve never heard anything similar, weather-phenomenon or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this constitutes an actual sighting, but it was the single most impressive sight that I&#39;ve ever witnessed. The beauty of it defies description, but I&#39;ve done my best to give an accurate perception of what I saw that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My sister slept on the bottom bunk. Me on top. We lived in a trailern by the oldn schooln that resently burnt down. My sister had a window right above her head,2 feet by 2 feet. She would star at the stars just like every other night. She called my name ever so slowly and softley, then louder and LOUDER. I got mad because I was trying to sleep. What I said, thrusting my head across and under my bead. What I saw uas my reflection in the darkest, crystal eyes I have ever seen. It&#39;s face filled the little window, I could see inside it&#39;s slit like nostrils, I mean it was that freakin close or vise vera. Palish blue, green was the color of the face. I called my father, a tough, rough man, came in with a bat. He froze, didn&#39;t say a word for the longest time, like ice. Even though he has no recolection of being a stiff. We said nothing. 12 years later I seen a book in B.C, invaders from another world. There was the face. In the back ground was a forest. Freaky. I asked my dad was he saw. &#34;Don&#39;t know son, it was five feet tall and floated in the bush.&#34; I even went as far as to sit my sister down and started to draw a picture of a box (window) as a began to draw the head,&#34;Don&#39;t &#34;F&#34; around.&#34; and she crumpled up the paper and threw it in the garbage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/10/83 21:00|Mountain Home|ID|Oval|15 min|There was 6-7 oval, pure white objects of about 30' X15'.One circled my car twice and then shot away.|11/3/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47189.html|18|ndxe198307| There was 6-7 oval, pure white objects of about 30&#39; X15&#39;.One circled my car twice and then shot away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1983 at about 9:00 pm and i was heading back to pasco from Jerome,Idaho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was entering the area of Mountain home, Idaho I saw six or seven lights pop onto my left in the distance.  The lights seemed to be some kind of stadium flood lights, but to my surprise they started moving towards my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they were approaching hey started blinking on and off at differant intervals. After blinking on and off six or seven times one light came right up in front of my car as I was traveling down the freeway. The ligh , which was maybe four or five feet above me made no noise as I rolled down my window to see if it was a plane or helicopter.  All i could see was a brilliant white light flying around my car like it was checking me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What shocked me next was how fast it went down the freeway and stopped in the blink of an eye.  It had traveled about one mile.  I was in such of the speed, that I checked the odometer on the distance it traveled.  I pulled over to the side of freeway about 25 yards away from it, thinking I had better not drive underneath it.  This light was about telephone pole high above the freeway and was motionless and dead silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shielding my eyes from the brilliant light which was kind of oval shaped and 30 feet long and 15 feet from top to bottom. I was out of the car for what seemed to be several minutes.  By this time it was dark, but this light lit up a huge area around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I know was driving to Boise, Idaho, and this light staying with me off the side of the road all the way to Boise.  I told my brother about the incident or encounter and he asked me what time I got into Boise, I told him it was straight up 1:00am.  He then asked me why it took so long to travel about 40 miles in 4 hours.  I told him I had no idea and didn&#39;t even think about it until he mentioned the paradox.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats about it, except after the encounter I had feelings of itchness on parts of my body that when I tried to scratch the itch it would not go away.  This lasted a few years along with more then usual dreams of aliens and UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Early 80&#34;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happen so long ago in the early eighties i&#39;m not too sure about the year or day... but I&#39;ll never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends had some girl cousins that came over for the summer.  We really didnt have many girls on my block so we decided to make the best of it and play a game called &#34;catch &amp; kisses&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my block was a school CS 77 and we were all in the school yard chasing each other... well as I was being chased or chasing one of the girls from the small yard where your closed in (the school is a U shape and the small yard is in the U&#34;) into the big yard were it&#39;s out in the open... I  saw what appeared to be a huge fire ball.  I remember a few of us kids stopped dead in our tracks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was coming out the small yard which was on the Manor Ave side of the school and I was Running into the big yard  which allowed you to look from Manor ave to Ward Ave.  I was facing Ward Ave which was west and saw the fire ball coming from that direction.  It appeared to fly right above us.  It seemed to be flying really low.  You could hear this fire ball.  It sounded.... well like what you would expect a fireball to sound like... i guess..... I&#39;ve never heard anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And you could almost feel this thing as it passed over us.  It flew right over us east bound,  but once it pass over it disappeared from our sights because of a 6 story building on the corner of 172nd St. and Manor ave. We all started running around tripping out and asking each other if we saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough we really didnt make a big deal about it.... we all thought it was a meteor or comet.... and every couple of years it would be talked about as a weird unexplainable occurance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasnt until I got older that i started thinking UFO. This fire ball was or appeared to be flying really low... so low that a building only 6 stories block our view immediatly after it passed over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, this thing should have crashed.... exploded or somthing. there is no way somthing that was close enough to hear and feel.... like you feel when a plane is flying low..... didnt impact. and if it was a comet or somthing.... wouldnt the news report such a thing?  This is NYC!  Somthing like that doesn&#39;t go unreported!<n>

The lights on this thing were not of this world, they were so vibrant and different than any light we&#39;ve ever seen. It was a warm summer night so our car windows were down and we could not hear any engine sounds or anything. It hovered over our car and followed us until we neared our driveway, and then it rapidly escaleted into the sky, stopped and then took off towards the moon so fast we could only see a flash of light in the sky. We were scared but more in awe than anything,we will never forget the size of that thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/3/83 00:00|Lumberton|TX|Disk|10-15 mins|July 4th, 1983: disk shaped object with colored lights over Southeast Texas|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54483.html|21|ndxe198307| July 4th, 1983: disk shaped object with colored lights over Southeast Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never talked of this with anyone outside my family.  I didn&#39;t want folks to think I was a nut or something.  But, I&#39;ve never forgotten what happened the July 4th weekend in 1983.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in junior high.  We were having our annual family reunion that weekend. It was the girls turn to camp out in the backyard.  I&#39;d never slept on the ground before.  So, I couldn&#39;t sleep, but my cousins sure could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, after awhile lying awake in the tent, I heard a low droning sound.  Sort of like a low droning hum.  Had I been asleep I probably would not have heard it.  I got up and went outside of the tent and looking up through the young pine tree (I wasn&#39;t coming out from under it) and above dad&#39;s storage barn, I saw an object just above the larger trees.  It was disk shaped and had colored lights on the bottom.  It wasn&#39;t moving very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Going back into the tent I tried to wake my cousins, without sucess.  I went back outside the tent and watched the object move slow and steady in a ENE direction.  I went back into the tent obviously scared and was finally able to waken my cousins. They had no idea what I was trying to tell them.  I know I must have scared them too because I remember us all running toward my grandmother&#39;s mobile home (she lived behind our house then).  But, my mother met us at the back door of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The electricity went out and we ran as fast as we could to get inside. The lights were out only a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say we all slept on the floor inside after that.  It has bothered me that I was the only one to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that night when I&#39;ve asked my mother what woke her up, she always say the she just got up and the lights went out and she knew she needed to open the door for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never reported this to any organization or any person outside my family.  But, I&#39;ll always be curious about what I saw that night and wonder if there will ever be an explanation.<n>

I was just outside the city limits of Pittsburg, KS, on extended 4th street.  My car was following another car and an unmarked white delivery-style truck was approaching us from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were a few blocks from the trailer park that I lived in, when a large lightening bolt appeared to come horizontally out of the back-side of the white truck and struck a power pole.  The car in front of me kept going and I could not tell if they noticed this extremely unusual event.  The white truck continued on, giving no indication of anything else unusual.  I was scared to meet the truck on the highway, but did not have any other choice and passed the truck without further incident.  I drove into the trailer park as the neighbors were coming out of their homes, wondering why their electricity had just shut off.  I remember someone asking me what I had done, as it seemed that the power went off just as I drove in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would sincerely like to know what this could have been, as I have puzzled over this for over 20 years.  The date is approximate.  I remember the approximate time of day and that it must have been the middle of summer as the sun had not set.  There were no clouds that I remember- and definately no thunderstorms!  It was a clear, calm evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure that this qualifies as a UFO sighting, but I remember at the time that people were saying that the government was moving secret objects in unmarked trucks.  This is the only place that I have ever thought might be able to provide me with an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was only 6 or seven years old, was staying at my grandparents house in Strandburg, SD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been sick with the flu and had a fever, so I awoke in the middle of the night to get some water. While I was walking to the bathroom I peeked into my parents room and saw out theirr window a VERY VERY unusual object in the sky. Even though I was sick with fever and the flu, I am positive this wasn&#39;t a halucination! The mintute I saw this Creepy light, I knew that is wasn&#39;t supposed to be there. The only way I can describe it was this twinkling, strobing, fashing, circular, object that had either green(light) on the ouside twinkling or on the inside-I can&#39;t recall for sure. It also had gold twinkling flashing lights on the inside-or the other way around(opposite the green). This very strange light was not moving across the sky  fast but was twinkling or strobing or flashing very quickly-almost like an animation or a video game graphic. This object was probably 70 degrees up of the horizion and probably pretty far away-although VERY VERY noticable! I looked at it for only a short time and was frightend back to my room. I never told anyone else about it-until now...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you have any ideas what this might have been?  If you need anymore information I will fry to give it to you, although I was very young and don&#39;t recall all the exact facts, I know I saw something very unusual that night and I will never forget the creepy feeling a got when I saw it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks!

Huachuca.  We were on our way back to Tucson.  We left the dance about 02:30, because it was over at 03:00 and we did not want to catch the crowd.  It was a very lonely drive back, as far as traffic was concerned.  About 10-15 minutes or so into our drive, we came across a VERY bright light.  At first we thought there was an accident and that it was a helicopter, but the light kept getting brighter and brighter.  My girlfriend was driving and I yelled at her to pull over because what ever it was we were going to hit it.  The light was so bright that we each had our hands in front of our face to be able to see the road.  I believe we were both kind of scared because we DID NOT hear any motors or any other noise.  My girlfriend kept saying it was a helicopter, and I told her if it was, the rotors would make noise.  When I looked over to my girlfriend, I noticed that I could see every shape of every bone in her hand, as if though the light was x-raying her hand - then I looked at mine and told her to look at our hands, because the light was almost shining right through them.  The light did not emit heat, nor sound, which was even scarier.  At that point we did not know what it was, and the light got closer, and closer to to us, it was directly in front of the car.  Just as she was going to pull over, the light disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.  My girlfriend looked at me and said, &#34;Girl, I ain&#39;t never telling nobody about this and you better not tell any one either!  They&#39;re gonna think we&#39;re crazy!&#34;  For some odd reason, we did not get back home to Tucson, until about 05:15 or so, and we just looked at each other and said why the hell did it take us so long to get back home???<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was in an upstairs bedroom and had full view.  The lights which were green, blue and yellow, were then diminished but still could be seen.  I believe that whatever had been hovering over the wooded area landed.  I notified my stepfather and told him to look.  He did, but thought that it was a wrecker recovering a vehicle.  He later went back downstairs and I continued to watch the lights flashing.  Later I observed these lights hover again over this wooded area for about 10 seconds.  I then saw it shoot up into the sky faster than anything I had ever seen.  I was 13 at the time and I do still believe I saw something unidentified and can not be explained.  I never investigated the area where a &#34;Possible Landing&#34; occured, but I&#39;ve always wondered what it was or what it was looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
