I spent a weekend on a beach called Ein Geidi which is a reaort on the Dead Sea. We were sleeping on the beach, just as we got into our sleeping bags, we could see in the sky an object moving from right to left, and slowly up and down. We stood up and watched this object, which was quite far in the sky over the dead sea for about ten minutes. We were transfixed on this object as it stopped suddenly, then shot off at great pace. I can&#39;t remember the shape. As we sat down and talked about our experience, two jets flew from behind us up over the Dead Sea towards the object and into Jordan airspace. The country Jordan being at the other side of the lake. I thought that was strange as relations between these two countries weren&#39;t that good at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the sky because it was so clear out on the road. Then I saw a light moving very high in the sky and I observed it for a few moments then it splitt into 5 lights about the same size or so they started going in circles following each other and speeding very fast away from the formation then returing back and doing it over and over again,by this time my brothers were trying fo find them I was pionting my finger at the objects and they could not find them untill one by one of my brothers found them and we were all going did you see what it did what are they is it a military thing but no it cant be because these things were playing I am lucky to have experienced this fenomena if indeed thats what it was. but I will not forget the exicitement it caused us all the objects only looked like blue in color and some times redish after 10 min of this going on the objects went in different locations. If I continued looking one or two objects played and left I just got tierd of looking it was great.<n>
2/10/84 22:00|Marlow|NH|Fireball|30 - 45 seconds|Orange fireball with strange movement|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57533.html|3|ndxe198402| Orange fireball with strange movement<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about mid February 1984 at about 10 or 11 pm traveling south on Route 10 in Marlow NH heading to Harrisville, NH.  I decided to take a back road and turned left or west onto Route 123.  As I made the turn I observed what appeared to be a barn a top a hill fully engulfed in flame.  I pulled to the side of the road to take a look and thought I observed the fire move. I thought I must have been moving so I stopped dead still and I observed movement of the fireball.  That scared me because this type thing is not suppose to happen.  I did a U-turn on Route 123 and as I headed back south on Route 10, looking back once and observed unusaul movement again.  I stepped on the gas peddle and got away as fast as I could.  I considered reporting this to the police but figured it would just get a big laugh.  In about 1992, when I was back in the area with my Mom, Dad, and fiance&#39; I drove back to the area, retracing my drive. I found there was no hill that could have supported a structure on fire in that area.  I graduated with an environmental science degree in May 1984 and am currently a stable husband and father and business owner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

IT WAS SO CLOSE THAT WE COULD SEE THE PANNELS IT WAS MADE OUT OF AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD RIVETTS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO OUR STORIES IS THAT I REMEMBER IT SHOOTING OFF OVER THE LAND BUT MY MUM SAID IT SHOT OFF OVER THE SEA. NOBODY ELSE ON THE BEACH APPEARED TO SEE ANYTHING. BOTH ME AND MY MUM DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT DAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary time.  PD))<n>
2/1/84 21:00|Columbia/Denmark (between; on US 321)|SC|Unknown|~1 minute|Large object with lights at tree top level.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/099/S99003.html|5|ndxe198402| Large object with lights at tree top level<n> <n><n> <n><n> In winter of 1984, I had a sighting of a craft as I was travelling along US321 to visit my girlfriend who lived in Hilda, SC.  I don’t recall the exact date but it was later in the evening (probably between 8 or 9pm) when I left Columbia by myself.  I was driving down US321 listening to music when I noticed a bright white light in the distance shining in my direction at tree-top level to the left of the road I was on.  At first, it didn’t really register and, in the back of my mind, I thought “Wow, that is a really low plane”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer, I realized that it couldn’t be a plane since it wasn’t moving.  I also saw that it was not a single light but what appeared to be two large round lights shining straight ahead like large car headlights with a smaller single red light moving back and forth between them.  I would estimate that each “headlight” was probably at least 10 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed the object I could see that it was hovering at the edge of a f! ield about 150’ in the air with the two headlights shining straight ahead over the trees. It was very dark and I was trying to look at it as I passed but could not make out the shape or size of the craft as I passed it, only that the lights were big enough that they had to be attached to something fairly large in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not move and I did not hear any noise at all coming from this craft but my windows were up and I was listening to music. I almost ran off the road looking at it as I drove by.  As soon as I realized that I was not looking at any type of conventional aircraft,  I became very alarmed and sped up.  Even though it was dark,  I made it a point to look around in an attempt to find a landmark to locate the spot later on my way back home.  I noticed that I passed a house on my right across from the field where the craft was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, another vehicle passed me going in the opposite direction within a minute or so after I sped up so I am fairly certain ! someone else witnessed this object.  When I got to my girlfrien! d’s hous e, she was sleeping on the couch waiting for me.  I was very excited to tell her about what I saw but she dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter.  When I explained the details of what happened and why this could not be either of those, she said that it was probably a fire tower and that several of those towers were located in the fields on that road. I was fairly certain that it was no fire tower and, on my trip back,  I paid close attention to see if there were any fire towers in the fields. In the daylight, I did spot a fire tower but it was on the left side of the road as I was returning. It would have had to have been on the right side (same side as object I saw) as I was coming back in order to have been the object that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Further down the road, I found the house that I had noted and the field that I had spotted the object hovering over.  There was no tower in that field and I did not see anything out of the ordinary at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
