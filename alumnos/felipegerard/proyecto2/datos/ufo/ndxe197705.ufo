They stood there as amazed as all the other people who pulled their cars to side of street and got out to observe.  At that time anything the U.S would have that could hover above ground you wouldve heard all types of rockets going off and all this craft did was make a light humming sound like a transformer sound. The next day i was driving and listening to the radio and the dj said,I dont know what these people saw lastnite but at 10:00 last nite our phone lines began ringing off the hook, and no one could give them an explanation as to what they saw but they saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe 5 yrs. later i was looking at Jack Palance U.F.O sightings and he mention the same sightings.  I keep telling people about my experience cause I refuse to keep my mouth shut when I know that there something else going on out here that is more! intelligent than we are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be willing to take a polligraph cause I know what police,other drivers and myself all saw.  I called to the police dept and even though the officer isnt there they still remember other officers speaking about the incident.  I was about 200 ft.from it.I did not see any silver men or whoever was inside,but i did see craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

We were looking at how beautiful the stars were and as we both gazed upward, a large cigar shaped &#34;sillouette&#34; floated past us very slowly. It almost appeared to be a craft silently cruising without it&#39;s lights on. It was a black shaped that moved across the horizon. It lasted approx. 30-45 seconds, then it was out of view in the dark.I estimate by it&#39;s proximety to the ground, and to us, as well as it&#39;s scale against the various buildings around that it was aprrox. 300-400 feet long and approx three times the &#34;height&#34; of a large airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at each other and my friend, whos dad was a pilot and who was very familiar with aircraft said...&#34; I have  never  ever   seen anything like that have you?&#34;........I replied &#34;No____,...I have not&#34;. We got in and attempted to catch and pursue it, but were unsuccessful in finding back roads to follow it. We talked about it well into the night and to this day, we still believe we saw something very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

5/25/77 01:00|Marshall|IL|Cigar|20 min.|totally black object in the sky|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52465.html|6|ndxe197705| totally black object in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I,m not sure why i&#39;m doing this... My friend and I were returning from a county or state fair.  I would need to look up the road and state highways in the area to to exact about this. On the way back home, on the crest of hills, we noticed a black hole in the sky. It was a moonless, totally clear night with nothing but stars in the sky. On the way home, we started noting this hole in the sky. As we approached our turn-off, we decided our path was going to take us directly under the object we had been seeing for miles. It was just a couple of miles outside town that we drove almost directly under the object. I pulled onto the shoulder of the road, and we both got out of the car to check it out. I, being a tough guy, picked up a rock and threated to throw it at the object, directly over-head. My friend freaked-out and begged me not to, though I was also afraid and didn&#39;t really plan on throwing the rock. We stood there for a minute or two, looking at this black hole in the sky, got back in the car and went home. That is all. I would say the object was 100-150 yds. long. It was 30+ yds. wide, larger than a football field I think. It had no lights of any kind at all. It made no sound at all. I can not explain what it was, even by todays technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/23/77 21:00|Mettacahonts|NY|Circle|1 minute|Circular object with many lights moving very slowly at low height over rural upstate New York in the late 1970s|10/30/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/093/S93243.html|7|ndxe197705| Circular object with many lights moving very slowly at low height over rural upstate New York in the late 1970s<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all observed it; me, my 8 year-old brother, the 15ish year-old baby sitter, and my elderly grandmother. It was a perfectly circular craft with many lights of all colors. The lights seemed to be only on the underside, and were of all colors and flashed or pulsed, and it seemed to rotate, or at least the lights themselves were flashing on and off to give the illusion of rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to be very close to the ground, and viewing it through an old crab-apple tree that probably stood about 60 feet, it seemed to be very near to touching the top branches of that tree.  Given the distortion of that memory in the 35 years that has passed, my 10 year old mind at the time of the event providing further questionability as to the accuracy of my recollection, and the existence of that tree as a reference providing support for my conclusion, I would estimate that the craft was approximately 30 to 60 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my astonishment, my grandmother refused to discuss the incident when my parents returned home a few hours later, and took the details of the incident to her grave some 30 years later.  The baby sitter flatly denied that anything out of the ordinary had happened, possibly in fear of losing future baby sitting jobs. My brother also refused to talk, although I managed to pry an acknowledgement of the event from him decades later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several days after the incident, the local AM radio station, WGHQ ran a news story about a local man who had invented the first circular aircraft.  My mom made a point of bringing my attention to that radio broadcast.  At 10 years old, even my immature brain led me to the conclusion that this was some type of cover-up.  I don&#39;t know exactly what I saw that night, but the existence of that radio broadcast makes me ponder that event some 35 years later.  And to this day I have never seen another circular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw the full moon rise from behind the mountain, and someone said &#34;Look at the moon&#34; It rose so fast we knew it was not the moon. It was a very bright orb in the sky. moving quickly toward us and dancing around in jerky movements. Two of us ran outside to see better. It came closer, was very bright and gave off shadows, but no noise. We stood there awhile, I don&#39;t know how long. There was a feeling of awe and peace, but after awhile it came really close. The color went from orangey to whitish blue. Next I remember, I heard our other friend who had stayed inside yelling &#34;come back come back&#34; and the light slowly withdrew. We went inside and told him it was all right. The thing withdrew and danced off into the distance, then moved erratically and went straight out away. The clock was stopped, all power still off, so we don&#39;t know how long this took. It was really wierd and has stayed with me all these years, but I&#39;m not really sure of the date so the date and time are uncertain, only that it was in 1977 at Owl Head Ranch in the Tortilita Mountains of Arizona<n>
5/15/77 23:00|Minneapolis|MN|Unknown|10 min. +|The red and green lights were in a triangular configuration and just hovered above the airport with no sound|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43041.html|9|ndxe197705| The red and green lights were in a triangular configuration and just hovered above the airport with no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately May of 1977 a friend of mine and I were at the Crystal Airport (MIC), Minneaplis, MN, at approximately 2300 hours local time. We had both recently received our pilot&#39;s licenses and were avid flyers.  My friend&#39;s father owned a flying school at the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just returned from an evening of night flying and had put the airplane in the hangar.  The night sky was very clear with stars showing brightly.  At this time of night air traffic in the Minneapolis area was very light.  During this event there were no aircraft operations at the MIC airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were talking outside at the airport and noticed some colored lights hovering in a stationary position directly above the MIC airport.  At first we thought these lights may be a helicopter, balloon, or some other type of stationary craft.  As my friend was interested in star gazing and had his telescope at the airport building, we got the telescope out to look at these lights.  We both observed, over a period of at least 10 minutes, three lights, in a tringular configuration, consisting of green and red lights, each of these being in a triangular shape, hovering directly over the airport, altitude unknown.  We believed the lights to be maybe about 10,000 feet MSL because it took the power of the telescope to clearly see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three lights appeared to &#34;wobble&#34; in the triangular configuration and they did not move or change altitude.  We were both very surprised that the lights, which we believed were attached to some type of solid, trianglar object, ommited no sound whatsoever.  Other than the lights, we could not actually see any type of object to which they could have been attached as it was dark night at this time.  The MIC control tower was closed at that time, so we could not contact them for confirmation of what this object may have been.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation the lights just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Elmont is a rural area of Hanover County, Virginia, about 10 miles north of Richmond, Va. It was in 1977 and I lived about a quarter-mile from the school and was walking to get there early to do some activity in the school library before classes started. I was with my friend and we were in the second grade. We were walking along some pine trees on the side of the parking lot toward where the school office and cafeteria were. I looked up across the parking lot and saw a disk that was silver and glinting in the sun just over the top of some oak trees that were in a horse pasture across the other side of the parking lot, which is not very big. The lights around the side of the disk may have blinked or changed color but I&#39;m not sure. I just recall being in shock like I was rooted to the ground and we stopped walking and just stared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The degree of shock at seeing it was almost like an electrical shock and I was terrified. The disk made no noise whatsoever. It was just hovering in one spot. Then, and I don&#39;t remember how long it was exactly, it was just gone and nothing was over the trees anymore. We went in and later that day I told my second grade teacher who punished me for lying. I have never forgotten seeing that and I know I did not imagine it. I still wonder what in the world it was. My friend at first denied seeing it but when I asked her a few years later she said she remembered it too. I have a law degree from the University of Virginia and am not making this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/15/77 02:00|Kilmarnock (UK/England)|||20 minutes|Whisper quiet hovering craft.|6/12/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23168.html|11|ndxe197705| Whisper quiet hovering craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw lights flying in the same direction as the van i was driving, but about 2 miles to my right.  They got closer to me as i approached the town, and we met just about 100 yards into the first street of the town, opposite a golf course.  The craft hovered above a row of trees adjacent to the main road, so I stopped and got out.  What amazed me most was the lack of noise, with just a very light motor noise similar to a hairdrier or vacuum cleaner, but at 2am I expected it to be more of a disturbance.  My experience of attending airshows as a photographer meant that I was aware of helicopter noise and other aircraft noises.  It was a year later that I first stood near a Harrier vertical take-off fighter jet, and the noise was deafening.  That&#39;s when I knew I had seen something spectacular.  I did not report this sighting, indeed I have told only a few close friends for fear of being ridiculed, but I feel that your site is for serious reporting so I am entrusting this to you.  The date I entered is approximate as I am unsure, but it was definitely early hours Sunday morning and definitely summer 1977 between March and June when I drove the vehicle I mentioned.  Most likely May sometime.  Visually it was difficult to tell shape because all I could make out were four lights arranged in either a square or a cross depending on what the body of the craft actually was.  It hovered at about 200 feet, a height I estimated from being about 4 times the height of the trees, and I estimated them at 50 feet being the exact height of the local rugby football club goalposts.  After about ten minutes, the craft seemed to edge away slowly in the direction it had come, and then accelerated to a fantastic speed back in the direction of the local airport about 10 miles away.  I racked my brains to think what type of craft it could be, and at that time my best guess was a Harrier fighter jet until I saw my first one in the flesh a year later.  What I saw was not a Harrier, not a helicopter and not any type of aircraft I hav! e ever seen in time as a photographer at airshows or a member of Air Training Corps on Royal Air Force trips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer 1977 is approximate.

We looked up and saw a cigar shaped object slowly moving overhead with a humming sound.  The lights of this object were most unusual.  There were approximately a hundred lightsof various colors around the &#34;equator&#34; of the object (parallel to the ground).  These lights would blink off and on making it appear that there was a continuous circle of light moving around the &#34;equator&#34; of the object (like might be seen with an advertising sign or a carnival ride).  We watched the object for awhile, but quite frankly we were more interested in each other, and so eventually stopped watching this slowly moving object.  Eventually it was gone, but I don&#39;t know how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only aircraft that would be similar to this object would be a blimp, but I have heard that blimps don&#39;t travel at night.  Also, the lights were very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It appeared to do off in the distance 100yds or so depending on its size. It looked like it was matching our speed until we stopped and it continued slowly moving along. It dissappeared behind a tree and when we tried to see where it went it had gone without a trace. I am convinced I saw a UFO. I however, believe that UFO means Unidentified Flying Aircraft and not little green men in a spaceship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were lying in front of my house in the road. Our neighbor is very quiet at night and gets hardly any traffic and is very dark. Great for stargazing. It was anywhere between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Not sure on exactly the date and year. I believe I was around 16 or 17 when this occurred. My brother is three years younger than me. Our friend about the same or two years younger than me. I am 42 now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all three lying down on our backs and just talking about things in general and looking up a the stars in the sky. The sky was completely clear with no clouds at all. And the sky crisp and dark enough the faint hint of the Milky Way &#39;clouds&#39; as I call them. No planes were in the vicintiy. Suddenly straight up above us in the sky one of the &#39;stars&#39; started to move in a slow spiral pattern that gradually got wider. It then suddenly began to zig zag very quickly back and forth in long paths. After doing the zig zag pattern 3 or 4 times it zoomed off and disappeared. We all immediately looked at one another and said. &#39;Did you see that?&#39; We all confirmed that we did. The object was about the size and brightness of a medium white star. It was large enough to see fine.  The object blended in totally with the other stars in the night sky. It looked just like another star in the sky until it started to do the movements I describe above. There was no sound.The three of us still talk about that night and what we saw whenever we get together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/8/77 16:00|Kinder|LA|Sphere|20 minutes|Multiple Daytime sighting of silver spheres.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63701.html|15|ndxe197705| Multiple Daytime sighting of silver spheres<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was  home on leave from the U.S. Navy between May 6-12, 1977.  While home near Kinder, Louisiana, I went and met a couple of friends that were fishing in an irrigation canal about a mile North of town on Green Oak Road around 4:00 PM in the afternoon.  My friends were in a boat fishing about 100 yards from the road as I started walking down the canal levy to meet them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About half way to them, my friends started yelling like crazy for me to look up in the sky.  They were pointing in the sky to the North of the canal, but I was unable to see anything because of trees growing nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I yelled back and ask what it was, and they were yelling that it was a UFO!   At that time, I started running toward them and looking through the trees for an opening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared my friends, I saw the object in the sky that had them all excited.  It appeared to be a perfectly round silver sphere glowing against the cloudless blue afternoon sky.  Again I asked my friends what it was, and again they said it was a UFO as they paddled to the bank and told me to get in the boat to have a better look at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we paddled away from the bank and sat in the middle of the canal watching the object for a few minutes, it appeared to be getting somewhat closer like maybe it was drifting toward us slightly.  I thought that possibly it could have been a weather balloon at that point, except for the fact that it was perfectly round and not long like a weather balloon and the silver glow of the object seemed far more intense that any weather balloon that I have ever seen reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object became very stationary again and appeared to be the size of a quarter held at arms length. Without any reference to the size of the object, I was unable to determine if it was the size of a basketball and was just above the grown pine trees, or if it was a mile across and two miles away.  At its closest most stationary point, I remember remarking to my friends that there was something larger and transparent behind the glowing sphere in the sky.  It was difficult to see, but there appeared to be a much larger transparent possibly saucer shaped object on top of the sphere.  You could see the sky through the larger object, but you also see the outline of the larger shape above it as if you were looking through a clear glass object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes into the sighting, a smaller very intense red ball of light appeared at the bottom on the silver sphere that looked very much like a lit road flair without any smoke coming off of it. Very slowly the intense red ball of light started to lower from the silver sphere and appeared to be held in position by a very fine dark line in the sky. The much smaller intense red ball lowered a distance about four times the diameter of the larger silver sphere and then stopped in the sky and remained stationary as the dark line that appeared to be lowering the object appeared to turn into ashes and fall from the sky. The lowering of the red object took 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the period of the next five minutes, the smaller red ball of light started expanding and collapsing in size getting lighter in color as it expanded and redder as it collapsed. Each time the red ball of light expanded and collapsed it remained larger each time and lighter in color until it was finally identical in size and color of the larger silver sphere in which the much smaller ball of light descended from. Now the identical silver spheres of light sat stationary one above the other for another five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After five minutes, suddenly both spheres moved far across the sky to the West so fast that the eye was unable to see the movement. The objects were simply here and then all of sudden they were sitting far across the sky at a dead stop with a fine dark line in the sky from where each object was sitting connecting to were each object now sat. Again, the fine dark lines in the sky appeared to turn to ashes and fall from the sky in a couple of seconds. Both objects repeated these rapid unseen to the eye movements 4-5 times over the next five minutes leaving the fine dark line each time they moved back and forth widely from the East and West across the sky. Each time both objects stayed perfectly spaced one above the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After five minutes of unbelievable and unseen movement and instant stops that lasted about a minute each, one sphere darted quickly out of sight behind the trees to the North and the other quickly cleared the Eastern horizon in approximately two seconds. At least this time they were moving slow enough to actually see them move across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire 20 minutes or so that we observed the object(s) moving or sitting stationary in the sky there were no noise whatsoever heard form them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After both objects left the area, we quickly loaded up the boat and headed toward the home of one my friends in the boat that lived two miles North of our location. Upon pulling up at my friends house, his younger brothers and sister came running up to the truck all yelling “daddy saw a UFO, daddy saw a UFO”. My friend said, “let me do the talking” and then asked his dad what he saw. His dad said, “that he had saw a UFO straight above his property for nearly ten minutes and that it sprayed spider webs every time it moved.” When asked what he meant about it spraying spider webs, he said “every time it moved it sprayed spider webs that fell on his property and completely covered his ten acre pasture so that it looked like it was totally covered by white frost”. He said that he tried to gather the spider webs up in his hands and it would melt in his hands as soon as it touched the skin. By the time we had made it to my friends home all of the “spider webs” had melted off of the ten acre pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then headed to town (Kinder, LA) to see if anyone in town had seen the “UFO”. I met nearly a dozen different people shortly thereafter that I knew and they all asked, “did you see the UFO” before I would even have a chance to ask them. With so many people seeing the UFO, I figured that it had to be on the evening news so I headed home to watch it. Nothing was mentioned during the newscast, but at the start of the weather the weatherman announced that 200 people had called the TV station (KPLC) and reported seeing a UFO between Kinder and Oakdale, LA (a distance of 30 miles). However, the weatherman then announced that it was not a UFO. He stated that the National Weather Service had called the station and said that it was only a “special weather balloon that was equipped with rockets”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days after the above sighting while riding with my brother on Hwy 165 South of Kinder. My brother ran his brand new Ford LTD II off the road, jumped out of the car and unto the hood yelling, “I saw it, I saw it”.  Thinking he had nutted up, I ask him, “you saw what”. He said that he had just seen one of the silver spheres on the East side of the highway and that it had crashed into the rice field between the 3rd and 4th levy (maybe 100 yards)  from the road. He then attempted to enter the field, but I persuaded him not to enter the field as it was planted with young rice about 6 inches high and flooded with water. I assured him that if the object had crashed, we would have been able to see it from the road. I asked him if he had seen any water or mud come up from the ground when it crashed and he said, “actually it did not look like it crashed, it looked like it went into the ground”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just wondering if anyone else had seen a “weather balloon” that could move across the sky in excess of 30,000 mph and stop and go in an instant without making any noise. I have been looking for another one for over 30 years without any luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first we thougt our eyes were playing tricks on us but when it came to within 50 to 100 ft we ran. We didnt even make it 10 ft when our leggs got tangled and we fell down. We scampered on our hands and knees under a large bush in his yard. We kept quiet and I could see a laser light spot about 6-10 inches above the ground. Just a pinpoint of light about the size of a quarter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  had told the story several times over the years, its a pretty corny sounding story and did not fit the traditional saucer type ufo sighting.. until my wife and I were watching some ufo program on tv and one of the eyewitnesses schecthes showed a bean of light with a quarter sized pinpoint 10-12 inches off the ground and a dollar sized light on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed only the light 10 inches off the ground, I called my friend and he only witnessed the dollar sized light on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

(something a 25lb. dog can not do) We looked up to see an object that was NOT moving. Seemed to be just hovering in mid air like a harrier jet. It made no sound. It had red, blue &amp; yellow lights on the bottom of it going round in a sequence like morris code. We just stood there unable to move. Suddenly the object SLOWLY moved forward and to it&#39;s left. When it got over the neighbors house it just disappeared. It was black in color and was about 100-150 ft above us. Ifelt as if i could touch it. It looked smooth like plastic and had no rivets. It had a long spear shaped nose on it and the back was flat. It had no tail wing. It reminded me of stelth w/o a tailwing. The nose was far longer than a stelth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

After a 35 to 40 min drive I observed thru my right rear passenger window a Brightly lit cigar shapped object moving along a ridge. It seemed to be pacing my car but stayed slightly behind. I actually thought it was another car on a parralel road up on the ridge. I realized that the object was different and stopped and stepped out of my car along side the road. The object stopped when I did but slowly moved toward a saddle cut in to the ridge. I still thought that it might be a car but was shocked as the object started to move out to the center of the saddle still even with the ridge line. The object stopped in the middle of the saddle for about 7 to 10 sec. The object left in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

However I remember the evening with distinct clarity.  Orange Ball low altitude, cloud level, moving from east to west, took not more than 10 to 15 seconds to cross the entire sky from east to west. No sounds at all.  Everyone looked at it with a &#39;wow, what a sight&#39;.  I still remember clearly and have not seen anything close to it even after so many years. There were newspaper reports the next day  reporting the same sighting in nearby city of Nagpur as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She had happened to looked up into the sky; and there it was! She told me she had seen a strange oval shape object up into the sky. The oval shaped object had stood there for about 20min. then it started to headed out towards the West, and 15 minutes later, the object had headed towards back to my her house flying very low! Low enough where we can see it more up close. It made another sound that went &#34;Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop Bloop&#34;. She had notice that this oval shaped object was heading Northeast, My Grandma had told me that this object started heading towards over by the Glenview Air Naval Airbase. (in which it is now closed down known as of today) My Grandma would not admit that she had seen a UFO, because she&#39;s a very religious person, and the only thing that what it could of been was; either an top secret military aircraft or one of &#34;God&#39;s Mystery Suprises&#34; that we aren&#39;t not to suppose about???...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

He was excited and we were bored so we went looking.We went to the location and found nothing and left. Later we went to a lake to go parking. This is what hapened.We were parked in by an unlit country lake.There was a glowing, but very illuminating light in the truck. I loked out the back window and saw two crafts hovering( NOT MOVING) over the trees by the lake. They were about 20 feet from us. Once we looked, they slowly went right over the truck. We looked up and saw the underside. I did not hear a thing. I saw two oval objects surrounded with amber lights. The lights were amazing. The lights were a soft light but completely lite up us and the surrounding area. I could look straight into them without any discomfort. Anyway after they went over the truck they seperated. One appeared to land in a cotton field about 100 yards away and the other speed up so fast it just sort of blinked out. We tried to shine our lights out in the field, but did not see anything. We left. That is the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

John F. Kennedy [CV-67] during the late spring, early summer of &#39;77 while on the flight deck checking on our aircraft I saw what I initially thought was a meteor coming down at approximately a 45 degree angle.  The sky was clear with no moon and no clouds, there was no glow from the coastline of Florida and the ship was operating with red lights only above deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my crew away from the aircraft to look at this thing, which continued down on it&#39;s initial trajectory off of our starboard quarter.  The object was very high, about the size of a cigarette ember held at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got lower, we could plainly see that the front was white, the middle orange, and the tail a flickering red.  Then a contrail became visible, which we took to indicate it was in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 or so minutes a fog bank formed in that part of the sky with this object behind it, resembling a streetlight as seen through a heavy fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, a laser-thin beam of light blue suddenly appeared, aiming back up the way this object came from. After 2 more minutes, everything started fading away, the glow diminished, the beam of light faded and the fog dissipated to where stars could be seen again in that portion of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, at an angle approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, a dull silver colored object about 3 times the size of the largest star dropped down out of the bottom of the fog bank, shot forward paralleling our course on the starboard side of the ship then angled back upwards and was gone in literally the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking about the deck, I noticed between 50-75 personnel standing and watching this display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later I encountered one of my former crewmembers who was there that night and who asked me to please tell his wife that we saw what we saw because she thought he was nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Very bright at this distance, seemed to lessen in intensity the nearer we got. Still, bright enough for us to assume it was a monstrous fire ( from C-130 Crash, forest fire). Nearing the craft, it took on this triangular shape, perfect in symmetry, and eac corner of the triangle was luminious, a bright amber glow. These amber lights seemed to emit into alternating shapes, from straight, to something like wings of an insect. A clear night, could see the stars surrounding the craft. No sound; hovered entirely motionless; soundless, except for very light humming. We left at my dad&#39;s urgency!! We knew he meant business when he told my mother to drive away!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Its diameter was big enough to fit a couple of good sized houses under it.  Had windows, all the way around the top part, which kept changing colors.  Had many small lights around the outside edge on its underside,and it had larger lights in the center.  It made NO sound at all.  We watched it tip then right itself a couple times then it took off so fast it amazed us.  We were at St. Mary&#39;s beach watching this amazing thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a saucer shape with a domed top, which had opaque windows around the domed top which kept changing colors.  My husband is an Art Teacher and an Artist, and I am a Hypnotherapist and artist.  I was 27 at the time and he was 35. There were other people there, in their cars, but I don&#39;t know if they saw it too.  I hoovered over a house for quite a while, made absolutely no sound at all.  It had tinny lights around the bottom edge, and I don&#39;t remember how many larger lights at the center of the bottom of it.  St. Mary&#39;s is an area where there are large old homes, some newer ones, and it is right on the water.<n>
