I listed it as July 31 1969 but am very unsure about the date.   I do remember that it was hot, very hot.   So I&#39;m guessing it was in the Summer.  At the time, I was a very young boy.  My Father worked at the air base in Charleston but we lived in Summerville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t recall a lot of the specifics but will never forget what I saw and felt that night.  It started with a commotion outside.  I remember going out the door and seeing so many of our neighbors outside by the street all looking up.  As soon as I got to the edge of the carport, I could see it too. What is was is still difficult to say.  The only way I can describe it was like a glowing light, a light that started small and slowly grew large enough to fill the sky.  I don&#39;t know how long it lasted but at the time, to me it seemed to have lasted an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember everyone trying to decide what it was.. or more accurately what it was not. First thoughts were that it was from the air base but that didn&#39;t make sense.  There was nothing large enough there to cover the entire sky. I remember asking lots of questions about what it was but no one had any answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were at least 20 families on our street watching the sky.  I remember being scared to death and going inside my house with some of the neighbors.  When it was gone there were lots of phone calls and lots of discussions.  To this day, I don&#39;t know how it was ever explained.   I have told very few people of this incident for obvious reasons, most insist you are exaggerating or just not remembering the events accurately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I&#39;ve not seen anything that can fill the entire sky with that kind of light.  I&#39;d love to know what the news archives have on the &#34;event&#34; from that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I lived on the North Hill in Akron, Ohio. One summer night, I believe late in the summer there was a giant silver ball in the sky that just hung in the sky for about 3-4 hours in the middle of the day. It was hanging in the western sky. The whole neighborhood saw it, in fact I think they may have even talked about it on the news. There was a Goodyear Blimp Hangar in Akron so the first thing everyone thought was that it could have been a new weird shaped Blimp, but they said it wasn’t the blimp. It was just a great big silver ball and it didn’t move. The adults in the neighborhood did not seem to be afraid of it, so I wasn’t scared but I have always wondered what that dang thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF GRANDMOTHER&#39;S HOUSE ON BERVERLY ROAD. MY BROTHER AND TWO BOYS ACROSS STREET WERE PLAYING. I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A POSSIBLE FIRE ON OTHER STREET.  THERE WAS A BRIGHT RED GLOW IN SKY. I CALLED MY BROTHER AND FRIENDS OVER. I SAID LOOK A FIRE. THEY CAME OVER AND REMARKED HOW CLOSE THE FIRE SEEMED TO BE. I SAID LOOKS LIKE IT IS GETTING CLOSER. AS I WATCHED,I STARTED TO SEE SOMETHING IN SKY MOVING. IT WAS A HUGE RED BALL JUST ABOVE THE TREES. AS IT GOT CLOSER I COULD SEE THAT THE BOTTOM WAS TOUCHING THE TOP OF THE TALLEST PINE TREES. IT EVEN KNOCKED SOME OF THE UPPER LIMBS OUT OF MY GRANDMOTHER&#39;S TREES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BEFORE THIS EVENING ALL THE TREES WERE BRIGHT GREEN EVEN IN THE TOPS ON OUR BLOCK. THE HOMES ON AVERAGE, WERE 1500 SQ.FT. RANCH STYLE HOMES.  FRONT YARD WAS ABOUT 60-70 FT. WIDE AND 50FT. FROM HOUSE TO STREET. OTHER YARDS AND HOMES WERE OF EQUAL SIZE. THE OBJECT HAD AN OVER ALL WIDTH OF 3 TO 4 HOMES AND YARDS. I SAID OUT LOUD, THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. AND LOOKED AT MY BROTHER. I SAW HIM AND FRIENDS LYING ON GROUND OUT COLD. I COULD FEEL EXTREME HEAT COMING FROM OBJECT. IT MOVED ACROSS STREET OVER OUR HOUSE. I LIVED WITH GRAND MOTHER. AND ON OVER HOMES BEHIND OURS. I WOULD SAY IT MOVED AT ABOUT 1 TO 2 MILES AN HOUR. AFTER IT WAS GONE, I WOKE THE OTHER BOYS UP. AND ASKED THEM WHY THEY WENT TO SLEEP. THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING EXCEPT RED GLOW IN SKY. I TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED, THEY JUST LAUGHED. I THOUHT EVERYONE ELSE WOULD TOO, SO I DID NOT TELL ANY ONE ELSE. MY GRANDMOTHER DID ASK WHY WE HAD SUNBURNS. BECAUSE, SHE DID NOT NOTICE THEM AT DINNER.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WE DID NOT ANSWER HER. THE NEXT DAY I SAW THE TOPS OF ALL THE TREES THAT WERE NEAR THE OBJECT. WERE VERY BROWN AND SCORCHED LOOKING. I EVEN FOUND LIMBS &amp; PINE CONES IN YARD. THAT HAD BEEN BURNED BLACK AND CHARRED LOOKING. EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN VERY RESTLESS, AND HAVE HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING. I KNOW I AM NOT STUPID, BECAUSE I HAVE SERVED WITH THE CIA AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE SINCE THEN. I ALSO SCORED 125 ON MY MILITARY ENTRANCE EXAM (ASVAB TEST). INCIDENT OCCURED 2145 07/27/69.

We&#39;d had a barbeque and were quite laid back watching the end of the day over the valley.  The weather was clear, the sky darkening and our view of the town and valley below was perfect as the house was near the top of the ridge. The disk shaped craft seemed to materialize from out of nowhere. It was not there and then it was.  It was silver in color, but seemed nearly translucent.  The craft, which was approximately 30-50 feet across, widened from the narrow edges towards the middle.  As we were looking down on the disk, we could see a dome on top which appeared to have view ports or windows of some sort.  There were also green, red and white lights encircling the perimeter of the craft.  There also appeared to be a smaller dome on the bottom of the craft. The craft then began moving in a slow zigzag pattern back and forth over Fairfax for about a minute.  It then took off faster than I have ever seen anything move.  It shot straight up and was moving so fast that it seemed to leave a trail of light images behind it that then disappeared.  All of this occured with no sound by the craft at all. We immediately phoned Hamilton Air Force Base to check if they had possibly seen this craft on radar.  We finally got through to the tower at the base and they stated they had not picked up the unknown craft on radar.  I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt as the craft was below the ridge line and appeared and disappeared so rapidly that it could have done it between sweeps of the radar.<n>

At some point in the afternoon a group of friends and myself, all aged between four and six, chased a metallic disk flying low overhead in the sky.  I lived on Pinehill Lane in Peoria and the disk seemed to fly in the same vector as the street, roughly north to south.  I remember someone else confirming that there had been a saucer seen over the &#34;Hawley Hills&#34; subdivision of Peoria at the same time, although the &#34;confirmation&#34; I received took place some six years later when my family returned to the area.  I have never reported this before but have never forgotten it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

The problem with this is that I am not honestly sure that I did not dream these events.  When I was going into 6th grade, which would have been the summer of 1959 I had an event happen that happened at night and I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  At this time we lived on a farm with our house surrounded by thick woods.  Our closest neighbors lived about a quarter mile down the road on the other side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall being in a compartment or room and there was an adult male there with me.  I believe that he was about 25 to 30 years of age.  He just sat there on the bench which was attached to the wall with his head down, his legs spread slightly and leaning over with his elbows resting on his knees not moving nor talking at all.  I recall looking around wondering what I was doing there since I was supposed to be in bed sleeping.  My bed was in the basement of our home and I shared the room with my two younger brothers with my younger sister sleeping in the next room.  I stood up and walked around the compartment and thought it was strange since I was supposed to be home sleeping but I found myself in this compartment.  Three walls appeared to be made of a metal and the other wall had a very large window in the upper half which covered about half the length of the compartment in which we were.   The door into the compartment was between the window and the bench also under the window the bench continued on the other side of the door, I think anyway.  The bench which I had been sitting on and which the man still was sitting on was attached to the wall with the window in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The window looked out into a passage way and was slanted outward.  I was just a little afraid at that time and was looking at the window wondering why I was there and most of all wondering where &#34;here&#34; was since I had no memory of going to this place or even leaving my bed.  I was watching the window when this being walked by.  It was taller than I was at the time.  It was NOT the grey or whatever people normally think of as being involved with UFO’s.  This thing more resembled a &#34;woki&#34; as pictured in the star-wars movie.  This thing was not wearing any clothes or have any type of equipment on it that I recall seeing. I seemed to remember that the color of the hair or fur was a dark brown.  I remember then I became very afraid and was scared that that thing would come into the compartment in which I was located along with the man.  I yelled and screamed and ran and jumped onto the window, using of course the bench under the window.  I kept yelling and clawing at the window while laying against it deathly afraid that thing would come into the compartment.  I was totally amazed that all throughout this incident the man in the compartment did not even raise his head or show any interest in anything happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall nothing more and later in the night I woke in my bed, raised up and looked around then lay back down and tried to go back to sleep which I did.  To this day I am not sure this really happened.  I have told my wife about this &#34;incident&#34; several times but I never had the nerve to tell anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should tell you now that I WILL NOT submit to anyone trying to hypnotizing me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My friend Ricky had just turned 9 and I was 4 months shy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ricky&#39;s older brother Dougy was 12 or 13.  We were playing in the backyard when one or more of us noticed it above the trees across the road, adjacent to a cow pasture.  We were approximately 300 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> away from the craft at this time. The craft was long and had small colored lights along it&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of these lights flashed.  As it got closer we all agreed that there were windows and we could detect movement onboard and humanoid silhouettes. It hovered for awhile and then proceeded to cross the road still above the trees. At it&#39;s closest it was only 150 ft away with only an empty lot between us.  It slowly proceeded along the tree line, pausing occasionally for a moment and then continuing on.  It landed in a clearing in the woods a couple hundred yards from the house.  A place we new well near the power-lines where we used to hike and ride snow-mobiles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our first thought in our excitement was: let&#39;s go see where it landed!  As we set off fear set in and we decided to walk a half mile up the road to the nearest farm house and tell an adult.  We were headed to our friend Gerald&#39;s father&#39;s farm and when we reached the edge of the yard we saw a giant fireball headed towards the earth.  It was immense and it hung in the air like it was projected somehow in the sky.  Then it suddenly disappeared just as suddenly as it had appeared. We couldn&#39;t believe our luck. First we saw a UFO and now a fireball!   We told Gerald&#39;s dad exactly what we saw and he asked a lot of questions. He didn&#39;t seem to doubt the veracity of our story.  Probably because we were so excited and it was fresh in our minds. I also told my parents and my father said he believed me. I&#39;ve never reported it until now. I was looking at the maps on the NUFORC website and pondering how bright the map would look if everyone reported their sightings. It took me 41 years to write it down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting I never doubted that we were being visited by other intelligent beings. Once you see something like this you become a firm believer.  It wasn&#39;t until I read Whitley Striber&#39;s &#34;Communion&#34; around 15 years ago that I felt validated in a way.  Whitley reports that a number of people are subjected to &#34;screen memories&#34; such as images of fireballs to replace the memory of the actual encounter.  When I read this it was an &#34;A-ha!&#34; moment.  This is exactly what happened to us.  Except we happened to remember both the screen memory and the actual event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I stared at it for about one minute or so. It never moved side to side, up or down, never changed in size or intensity of brightness or color.  It was over the golf course maybe 400 feet up and seemed to be 5 to 10 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I dropped my stingray climbed under the fence.  I ran through the knee high grass as fast as I could toward the fireball for maybe 60 yards and stopped to look at it.  The ball was still there, so huffing and puffing I continued my pursuit at the thing.  Now I ran maybe another 50 yards again stopped to look up at it and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the Upper Dublin report!!!

(about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away) at about 30 to 40 mhp. It was very large maybe a 100 feet across. I could only see about two thirds of it as it was partially blocked by 40 to 60 foot trees. I could also see trees behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and watched it for a few minutes and the decided to go after it. I had a 427 Chevy Impala Super Sport at the time and drove down a side road at almost 100 mph to catch it on Susquehanna Rd. but we lost site of it in the trees and by the time we got there it was gone, nowhere to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove around the area trying to spot it again to no avail.

I was four years old. I don’t know why I remember this but I do. It was at night and my family and I was doing what families do watch television. Suddenly, the lights went out and I guess there was a noise or something outside because we all headed out of the house. There was something in the sky swirling around with illuminated lights which were multi-colored lights. It (the object) had no form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at it for, what I can’t remember, a while the air around me felt thick, as if I were under water because I felt like I was moving in slow motion. I also remember my uncle standing in front of me but not moving or speaking. It seemed as though he was frozen in time; I kept pulling at his shirt trying to get his attention but he didn’t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is touching some kind of machine with lights all around it and it was very cold. From what I can gather now thinking back it seemed to me to be a probe of some kind. Now, the funny thing about this whole thing is I thought that I was dreaming, except for this one thing, I wasn’t. I say that because years later when speaking to a few of my family members we all had the same experience. They remembered exactly what I did and perhaps a little more. So, I wanted to report this incident in case someone else has seen the illuminated swirling unidentified object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/7/69 23:00|Brainerd|MN|Triangle|20 seconds|While picking up hay bales at night, I saw a triangular shaped object speed through the night sky.|2/18/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15937.html|22|ndxe196907| While picking up hay bales at night, I saw a triangular shaped object speed through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had bales of hay to pick up on the ground, my father and I, and it was suppose to rain the following day so we went out at night with a tractor and wagon to pick them up.  While there on a cloudless night a triangular shaped object sped across the sky from horizon to horizon at incredible speed.  There was no sonic boom, no vapor trail we could see; no noise at all.  We couldn&#39;t see the object itself, only three bright lights of different colors, maybe green and blue, which defined the shape as a very large triangle.  There had been reports of an expected meteor shower that night, and at first we wondered if that is what we were seeing.  But it flew to low to be meteors and there was no streaking affect like you usually see with those. Also, the color of the lights didn&#39;t change.  We were speechless for we knew we had witnessed something highly unusual.  For many years we talked about it.  My father died in 1995.  He had been in the military and was quite knowledgeable about planes.  He was absolutely sure it was no terrestial aircraft, partly because of the color pattern he was. I am not quite sure of the year.  It might have been a year or two sooner.  I know I wasn&#39;t in high school yet.  But I wanted to leave a record of this on file so at least someone would know it happened.  The most important aspect of the sighting was the speed and size of the object.  As far as I know, nothing can fly this fast through the atmospere without burning up.  That&#39;s what I remember the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

As it seemed to stop moving we noticed the dark outline of what we called a stinger protruding from the bottom center of the craft. The craft looked to be about 125ft long and 35ft high, the stinger looked about 20ft long. after it stoped a lite shower of dull sparks (embers) emitted from the bottom of stinger in a cone shape. the glowing died out as the embers fell. (it looked like the embers from professionl fire works as they fall to the ground and slowly die out). the craft had lights and what looked like windows on different levels and most of the length of it. After the ember showers the craft started its zig zag pattern but going away from us. We would look at each other than look back up and everytime we did this the craft would start moving faster and further untill the last time we looked at each other and looked up-- it had diapeared.(we did not know at the time that this was a typical reported movement). We also swore to each other that we would not tell anybody because they would think we are crazy. today when I do tell the story to a select few all I get is rolled up eyes and looks that I am crazy.    My friend and I were about 17 years old at the time and we were not on alcohol or drugs. I have been a full time professional Firefighter for 30 years. I know airplanes, helicopters and weather balloons, obviously this was none of those. I forgot to say there was never any noise made by this craft and it was about 10 pm. We were not into ufo&#39;s back then and did not have any preconception of ufo&#39;s. one night about 5years ago I was listening to the art bell show and I thought I heard a caller say something about a ufo they saw with sparks emitting from the bottom but it was the end of ! the conversation and I was half asleep. Ive wanted to tell this story for along time. I hope to hear from somebody that has seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We left at about 7am and went out about 12 miles into the sound from Valdez.  at 10:53 I checked my watch because I saw an orange tint in the water and the captain had suggested we try another spot.  so four of us fishing for halibut started to retrieve our lines.  One fellow had caught a shark ... we killed it and threw it overboard just a moment before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the water fourty feet from the boat exploded into the air and the water really turned orange for three hundred feet around the splash.  A disk shaped object with windows and lights shot up out of the water to about one thousand feet above.  It hovered there.  The next thing I remember is the water around the boat was teaming with sharks and i had hooked one. after gafing a four footer and returning it to the sea...i again checked my watch and it was 11:10.  we headed away from the spot and i asked the others if they saw the strange craft.  NO ONE remembered seeing it at all except for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 25 feet in diameter had a rotating edge around it  near the bottom which was dark in color like black sand. it was about six feet tall  with portholes or windows 3 feet apart on the main body of the craft which did not rotate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think i should draw a picture instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will ask the witness to submit his graphic of the object.

My first report is dated 10/24/73. But I had seen something a few years before that. This sighting occured on July 4th, but I am not completely sure of the year. I was around 15 years old, which would have been 1969.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I lived in Jacksonville Beach, Fl. which is located on the Atlantic Ocean. Every year on the 4th of July my town would have a spectacular fireworks display, better than many large cities. They would shoot the fireworks out over the ocean. Huge crowds would gather every year, sometimes as many as 100,000 people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was near dark and I went out in my driveway to look at the sky. If it was dark enough, I was going to walk down to the beach to see the display. The sun had either gone down or was behind the distant treeline, but it was still fairly light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking up I saw a very strange Flying-V object. It had 4 or 5 bright red flares on each side connected by what appeared to be narrow black tubes. It was flying the way you would expect a V shaped object would, with the point going first. The flares looked like the red flares you often see on the 4th of July that glow brightly and float down slowly. The little tubes were narrow and very black. It reminded me of Tinker-Toys when you connect those round wood shapes with the longer rods they provide you. This object was very low in the sky. I would estimate it was only 100 feet high at most. It flew directly over my head, heading due North. This object did not look large at all. I would estimate its wingspan at maybe 8-10 feet. Somehow it reminded me of a box-kite. It also made a &#34;sizzling&#34; sound, sort of like when you fry bacon. Also, faint wisps of black smoke were floating off the flares. I would estimate this object was traveling at 15-20 miles per hour. I could see it plain as day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was some sort of new firework that I had never seen before. But it was strange. I could not figure out what was making it move through the sky. It was not shooting fire out the back or anything like that. And the faint smoke coming from it was not shooting backward like a form of propulsion, but just floating away from the red flare balls. I continued to watch this object, expecting it to eventually descend. But it did not. It maintained a steady altitude and speed. That was what really got to me. It just kept on going. I knew no firework could do that. I continued to watch this object until it sailed out of sight to the north. I watched it for at least 2-3 minutes and it never did come down. Finally it grew so small and disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not scare me like other objects I would see years later. It did not appear to be a craft that could be manned. It was just these balls and rods. It had no body to it at all. But it was under some type of control.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside to the lawn area next to the pool where our apartment manager was setting up tables for later in the day, to have a BBQ and get together. It was still early and no one was setting off their fireworks yet. We lived only 3-4 miles from Moffet NAS.  I heard a very deep rumbling sound which I knew was a sonic boom. But it was deeper and louder than I had ever heard before. We both looked up at exactly the right moment to see two or three eliptical disks swoop over very low and fast. The low one that caught my attention was dull silver on the bottom but burnished orange on the side and top from the reflected sunlight. It was only 150 feet off the ground. They may have been playing &#39;chicken&#39; to see who could fly lower. The higher one(s), were identical but I did not see any sunlight reflect off of it (them). They were a little bit bigger across than the wingspan of a P-3 Orion sub-chaser, of which I saw everyday in those years. It happened so fast I only got a good look at the lower craft. After they went by I looked at the manager and said &#34;Did you see those... I was was going to say, flying saucers, until I noticed his face was white as a sheet. So I said ...rockets&#34;. He went inside, probably to get a drink. I thought to myself &#34;Well, flying saucers yeah, their real what&#39;s the big deal?&#34; The only question I had at that time and still have whenever I see ufo&#39;s, (14 other sightings) is who does it belong to? Ours or theirs? Whoever these guys are they have a flight path that comes in low from the Pacific in a straight line from Daly City down to Sunnyvale then onward. Fun fact. Line it up on a map and it continues down to Southern Nevada. They usually come in on July 4th or close to it. Examples of other fly-ins I&#39;ve noticed, 8:30pm 7-2-87 VERY loud boom. Approx. 12:45am 7-5-91. This leads me to believe that it may be a re-supply of some kind for &#34;alien&#34; personel. As our guys usually have federal holidays off. Fair warning for &#39;03. Try to see them.<n>

I heard a lot of talk on the radio, and through local word of mouth about unusual sightings in the skies all over the island.  I often climbed roofs where on two clear nights I saw several fuzzy circles flying over the city near the airports (there are two airports in the city, one a military, the other a civilian international airport).  These objects were flying very slowly, and seemed to reflect the city lights (having no lights of their own).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another day, in our backyard,  I saw two dark gray oval objects in the distance on the flight path of our commercial airliners (our house is directly on that path).  However, these objects were slightly oval, dark gray, and made no sound.  Being aware that these might be UFO’s I made a point to observe them carefully as they flew almost directly overhead (see diagram).  They flew slightly askew from each other, as in formation, keeping a perfectly straight course northward (towards the Atlantic).  Because I was in the yard, the house overhang soon blocked my view of them, but I climbed to the roof on a tall iron gate: I was up in less than 30 seconds, but to my bewilderment they were gone!  Thinking they had gone inside low clouds, I waited for them to reappear on the other side, but after waiting several minutes, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years I wondered about these events, and only now I am reporting them officially. They could not have been balloons because they did not wobble, or altered their distance from each other, and, most importantly, they did not move with the prevailing wind (since they appeared to go diagonally into moving clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a serious person (I work in human services in my city); I would not deceive anyone by telling this story, and now, after many years have come to believe that the objects I saw may be extraterrestrial.  If so, we are living in a very special historical period.<n>
7/1/69 22:15|Chambers County (area of Al-Ga line)|AL|Circle|05 minutes|MUFON/GEORGIA FOLLOW-UP REPORT:  Two hovering circles of light(s)/objects|4/26/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12688.html|31|ndxe196907| Two hovering circles of light(s)/objects<n> <n><n> <n><n> This investigation was a joint MUFON of Georgia-ISUR (International Society for UFO Research) project.  The interview and investigation was conducted by this writer on 4Jan98 while serving a Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an ISUR FI. The two witnesses in this case were found to be middle aged parents living in Troup County Georgia. The couple have several grown children, one of which is a Police Officer with a major west Georgia police department. The couple maintain a very nice rural home, which is a focal point for their grandchildren and many neighborhood children. The witnesses go to great lengths to provide informal recreation in the form of various ball games for these grandchildren and others in the neighborhood.  The husband had recently suffered a stroke which affected his speech somewhat, but seemingly not his thought processes.  The wife is still employed by a major corporation in Troup County. During the summer of 1969, this couple was living in Freedonia Alabama, near the Georgia line, the state line being delineated by the Chattahoochee River running north-south. They were employed in nearby Lagrange Georgia on the 3rd shift at a major corporation.  On the event night, they were enroute to work at about 10:15PM.  Driving east toward the state line on Glassbridge Road, they had to cross two bridges very close together, the Weehatkee Bridge and the Chattahoochee Bridge. The Mrs. indicated that as they approached one of the bridges (she does not recall which one) they noticed a circle of lights hovering just over the tree tops at the edge of the water on the left (north) side of the roadway.  Her husband stopped the car in the road in order to get a better view. She said that the light/object was about 25 to 30 yards away, at an estimated height of 40 or 50 feet.  She added that the circle of light(s) appeared white in color and about the intensity of Christmas lights, the whole configuration being about the size of a china saucer held at arm&#39;s length.  She recalled no dimming or blinking, but could not recall if there were individual lights or one solid unbroken light circle.  She added that she did get the impression there was something solid and substantial behind the glow, even though there was no sound.  After watching this hovering circle for a minute or so, a second identical circle/object appeared, possibly coming out from behind the first, and they hovered side by side.  The Mrs. then picked up a large flashlight in the vehicle and reached across her husband and shined it directly toward the nearby objects (!). She indicated that the beam projected out, but seemed to &#39;get lost&#39;, as when you shine a flashlight straight up into the air and the beam disappears after going so far. Her husband knocked her hand down, telling her to stop (!!). At the same time, she noticed that the objects seemed to seperate a little bit as if from having the light shined on them. One object suddenly accelerated away over the top of the car to the south at a high rate of speed, and was immediately followed by the second (both still silent).  She commented that they seemed to go from a hover to this high depature speed instantly, and she had never seen ANYTHING move that fast.  She saw them quickly recede to the south, seeming to go upwards a little as they flew out of sight in just seconds. No human or EM effects were noticed.  Witness did not recall the weather other than it was summer and not raining. An interview was also conducted with the husband, who had difficulty speaking due to his stroke.  His personal account was similar to that of his wife with just enough difference to indicate the truth was being related i.e just a slightly different personal perspective was being accounted.  He recalled a bluish tint to the glowing lights and felt that they followed more closely the direction of the roadway when leaving with the incredible burst of speed. Both witnesses were shocked by this event and had held it in for 29 years. Their home in Troup County is within a location known as the &#39;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&#39; due to the extreme number of UFO reports by reliable witnesses in recent years. The publicity generated by these reports convinced this couple that they would be taken seriously if a report was filed.  (Note:  The event site in this case is also in the same &#39;Troup-Heard Corridor&#39;, although the creation of West Point Lake in the 70&#39;s has done away with the bridges described above and obliterated many miles of river). Both witnesses seemed to be completely truthful with this FI and the various cognitive and kinesic interview techniques uncovered no inconsistancies or indications of deception. This couple is exactly what they appear to be; hard working and loving parents proud of their successful grown children and doting on their many grandchildren.

It was quite remote at the time, you had to travel down a five mile dirt road to get to it and it was completely secluded.  The guesthouse in which they resided faced a pasture of approximately 100 yards, which ended at the base of a very high, steap canyon wall.  Behind this wall was a drop off into the canyon with a running creek at the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, one of my aunts, and myself were staying there for a visit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular night, they along with my grandmother were inside the house talking and my grandad and I were sitting out in the enclosed porch at the front of the house.  He was just beginning to tell me my nightly bedtime story  when we both noticed a yellow light, gradually growing and raising up from behind the far left side of the canyon wall at the end of the pasture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said &#34;What the hell is that&#34; and raised from his chair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attracted to the pretty light and went for the door to go toward it.  He yelled at me and grabbed me back inside and at that moment we saw the object itself rise up from the same location.  It was a dark night but we could see that it was disc shaped by the illumination of it&#39;s own light; bright, bright yellow came from each of the large square windows, and apparently that created enough light to cast around the object and allow us to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This next part is embarrassing because it sounds so science fiction, but the object made no sound except for the classic rather high pitched &#34;beep&#34; with approximately 1 second intervals.  It &#34;glided&#34; up slowly; I cannot describe the speed excep t to say that it was like counting &#34;1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, etc.  It was traveling slowly, almost like cruising.  It made no darting or quick moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandad yelled &#34;Oh my God, oh my God!  It&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  Then he started screaming for my grandmother and my mom and my aunt, screaming their names and jumping up and down.  During all of this I was just staring at the object, loving the color and wanting to go toward it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time he managed to stumble into the house the object had been slowly moving over the canyon wall to the right, and before he could get anyone to come out it had descended down behind the wall at the same speed at which it had appeared.  By the time the others got outside there was no sign of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years afterward, Grandad was laughed at by family members; it didn&#39;t help that he was a practical joker.  But one time years later when I was in my early twenties, I was visiting him in his apartment in CA with my mother when someone brought up the UFO subject and I made the casual remark  &#34;like the one that Gramps and I saw&#34; and at that instant the 80 year old man jumped up and went nuts yelling &#34;You remember! YOU REMEMBER!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, nobody laughed at us anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through the sands of time, the details of the object&#39;s description had faded from my conscious memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about four years ago, I was in the public library in Show Low AZ; I live nearby.  I was waiting for the person that I&#39;d hitched a ride into town with to finish up and I picked up a book on unsolved mysteries, UFO sightings, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was flipping through the book, a page turned and THERE IT WAS, MY UFO!  The reason I know it to be the same one is that the instant I saw the picture, all the breath left my body; I gasped and I fell back onto the wooden reference table and onto a man who was sitting there reading.  I&#39;ve seen lots of UFO pictures before and I&#39;ve never had that experience.  It was the same one; I&#39;d stake my life on it.  It was a black and white photo, and the caption said it had been taken in New Mexico in 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just thinking about my favorite color throughout my childhood, it was the &#34;lemon yellow&#34; from the 64 count Crayola box.  I have only recently understood why, it was the same yellow as the lights coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My Family (Father, Mother, Older Brother 12, Myself 5, and my younger brother 2) was driving home on a rural dirt road to our farm house near dusk (i.e. somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 at night in July). We were heading west down the dirt road that passes by our house when we saw a strange light emanating from behind our nearest neighbors house. The light was brilliant. As we drove nearer we asked each other &#34;when did our neighbor install a spot light in their yard?&#34;  We approached our neighbors house for about a mile and kept looking at the light, but did not understand why they had installed such a bright light in their yard. The road turns North directly in front of their house. As we headed North, my brother, mother, and I kept our eyes focused on the light and we determined the light was not coming from their yard, but instead was coming from a craft/UFO hovering behind their house. After traveling North for 200 yards North, we turned west again and all of us including my father could now see the saucer shaped craft hovering about 100 feet off the ground 100 yards behind the neighbors house.  The craft was a brilliant orange, metallic color and was 30-40 tall and 100-150 feet wide and it was the classical saucer shaped craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then turned into our driveway (North) and parked the car about 100 yards from the main road which left the craft hovering about 300 yards south from where we were parked.  We all got out of the car and focused our attention on the craft. It continued to hover there 100 feet above the hill in the neighbor&#39;s farm field. There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The color was a brilliant fiery orange and it looked like there were windows on the upper half of the craft. The light from the craft appeared to have similar characteristics to heat rising from a hot road. We watched the craft from outside our house for about a minute and then went in the house because I believe our parents were worried for our safety. We went in the house and watched the craft hover above that hill for 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 minutes it descended and landed behind that hill. We could no longer see the craft , but there was a brilliant halo of light coming up from behind the hill. We watched the area for another 5 minutes and the craft ascended to about 100 feet above the hill again. It continued to hover there (300 yards south of our house) for another 15 minutes, but then flew away to the south and disappeared in the forest in a swampy area south of our farm. The encounter lasted for over 30 minutes and I still remember it vividly even though I was only 5 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft left, my parents put us to bed and went to sleep themselves. My dad slept with loaded hunting rifle on their bed. My parents never reported the incident because they thought people would think they were nuts. There were other sightings in the area around that time and the people that made reports were labeled as ODD.  My parents never even talked with the neighbors about the encounter to see if they saw the craft which landed about 100 yards in back of their house.  My parents still live in that same town, so even 30 years later when we visit Minnesota, we talk about the event and drive past the site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

As I continued watching the non blinking red light come directly in front of me, now about 1 mile away from my view and below eye level, I could tell that this object was a saucer shaped vehicle with a small dome above it and very bright red light on top.

When my mom came home I tried to tell her what I saw, but she told me not to bother her because she had to cook dinner.  after dinner by mom told me to do my homework, wash up and go to bed.  I could not tell my father what I had seen, because he did not come home until I was fast to sleep.  The next morning at the breakfast table, while my mother, father and brother were sitting down and the radio playing music, I told them what I had seen yesterday.  All my mother and father did was looking at each other and then looked back at me.  Two minutes later while I was he my breakfast the radio announcer reported that there was a UFO that flew over the city and that there were over a thousand witnesses that called in to report the UFO.  After the radio announcer finished the news flash, my mother and father look at each other and then looked back at me.  They did not ask me any questions or talk to me about the incident ever.  Weeks after the incident I started having what was commonly called ESP, because my mother always watched game shows, I most of the time said out loud what the number was.  My mom even new I had the ability for numbers, because several times she would ask me to go with her to the race track and pick some h! orses, b ut I always refused.<n>

It was going really fast and it was a color ( don&#39;t remember what color) but I remember that it looked like it was going toward the sun, then it made like a 120 degree turn and changed color, then it completely disappeared.  We all were amazed and ran into the house to tell my mom.  We weren&#39;t scared but really excited and yelling at her to call my dad (divorced) she did.  He said that some people saw it too and he reported it, not sure to who, but my mom told us that there had been lots of reports according to my dad ( a school principal in Phoenix Az).  I assumed he called some authority but not sure who.  It was really amazing and I just remember thinking what was it???<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Me and two of my friends were were at the swimming pool in our apartments at approx. 4:00pm. A silver, not shiny, disc/saucer shaped object, very large with what appeared to be some lights flew over head.  It was going slow enough that we could tell what it was - maybe 30 MPH.  It is hard to judge the distance of height in the air - much much lower than a small airplane would fly.  I remember feeling stunned, and not quite believing what just happened.  It went towards Cougar Mountain in Issaquah.  We told my friend&#39;s older brother about it - he and a friend went up on an old dirt logging road the next day and found a spot where the brush/grass had been &#34;flattened&#34; in a large circular area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have wondered all these years if anyone else experienced this sighting in Issaquah or the Seattle area.  No one really wanted to believe us back then - who believes a 9 year old who says she&#39;s seen a UFO? I have always believed in other life out there because of this sighting and I know it&#39;s just a matter of time before the truth becomes known to this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
