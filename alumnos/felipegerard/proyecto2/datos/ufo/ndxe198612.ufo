12/31/86 21:00|Houston|TX|Formation|15-20 seconds|Formation of four star like lights appearing and reappearing.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43089.html|1|ndxe198612| Formation of four star like lights appearing and reappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not have an exact date or time of this event. It could have been between mid 1986 and mid 1987, so I arbitrarily assigned it December 31, 1986. The time of 9pm or 2100 hours local is also approximate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The precise information was recorded in a log book that I used to record astronomical measurements in and was later stolen in a home burglary. And I can only guess the above dates because of other information that was recorded before and after the log book was stolen. Also the Houston area is not much of a seasonal place so that does not help my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following is the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation of lights appeared in my northwest sky at about azimuth 315 and about 30 degrees altitude up from my horizon. The formation was 4 white lights parallel to the horizon appearing as two pairs of lights with about twice the distance separating the pairs as was between each light in the pair. The brightness of these lights were around 4th magnitude star lights and appeared as such - point light source stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were steady and not twinkling. The angular width of the formation was about 1 degree. This formation of lights changed location in the sky within an area of about 4 degrees. I based the approximate degree measurements using the width of the index finger at arms length to be about 1 degree. The formation moved from its initial location down about 1-1/2 degrees and to the left about 1 degree, and then from that location moved about 2-1/2 degrees to the right and down about 2 degrees. The lights did not move but instead disappeared and reappeared in a different location as noted. These were the only movements I can recall and then they disappeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the lights changed location it was and instantaneous movement meaning the lights did not disappear for some time then reappear. This was in fact what caught my attention to begin with so I really don&#39;t know how long they were doing this movement before I noticed them. There were no other noticeable objects or lights in this area of the sky. There was no other apparent motion with the lights. There were no sounds. There was no noticeable object associated with the lights. The formation of the 4 lights never changed its shape. I assumed these lights to have been at a very great distance away from my location. There were clouds in that area of the sky and I viewed the event through an opening in the clouds that stayed open during the entire event. This was all viewed using only unaided eye vision - no telescope or binoculars, etc... The event duration was probably about 15-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
12/31/86 19:00|Mt. Airy|NC|Triangle|30-60 seconds|Roadside triangular UFO sighting resulting in missing time. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57556.html|2|ndxe198612| Roadside triangular UFO sighting resulting in missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (This is a follow-up to a report I had submitted previously) A friend and I observed what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft as we traveled south on Highway 52 near Mt. Airy, NC. At first, I thought that we were approaching some kind of lit up construction site near the treeline on the opposite side of the highway. I was reaching across from the passenger seat adjusting the radio when I noticed this anomaly. The lights looked three dimensional, for lack of a better description. When I realized that the lights were attached to an object and actually gaining altitude, I directed my friend&#39;s (the driver) attention to that direction. We both kept asking each other what this thing was that we were watching. The underside of the object had a white light on each corner and a bigger, very bright light in the center shining on the ground below. As the object slowly and deliberately rose above the treeline, the light in the center went out. The remaining three lights, which had been rotating clockwise while the object ascended, came to a stop. Then the lights slowly rotated about a half of a revolution counter-clockwise and cocked up at an angle simultaneously, which put the lights facing almost directly at our passing car. After a brief pause, the object silently &#39;blinked&#39; out of the atmosphere in a split second, zig-zagging in what seemed like thousands of small straight lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We soon noticed that no traffic was visible in either direction during/after the sighting, which was eerily improbable on this busy four lane highway at that time. The FM radio, which had suddenly failed just prior to the sighting, then started working again (this gave us a scare because I had inadvertantly turned the volume all the way up in my troubleshooting effort). Much to our relief, the normal amount of oncoming traffic soon resumed in the northbound lanes, although we did not see any headlights behind us in the southbound lanes the rest of the 20+ miles to our exit - we also looked northward from the bridge while crossing back over the highway after exiting and could not see any headlights approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very intrigued by what we had experienced as one might expect. Upon reaching our destination, we came to a very disturbing realization, however. The thirty minute trip, which we had made many times before, had taken us almost FOUR HOURS. There was absolutely no explanation for the missing time and we were totally dumbfounded. The only thing that we could figure was that since we were almost directly under the UFO,  we must have been affected by its energy field. That would also explain the lack of continuity in the flow of traffic, we surmised.<n>

We had just bought a 74 Pinto from a welder on the job we worked at.  We rode home with him and drove the car back from N. of Mount Airy,  NC on Dec 31, 1986.  Andy was driving S. on Hwy. 52 when I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation ascend from the trees on the left side of the highway.  I pointed in amazement at which time Andy hunched over the wheel and saw the lights also.  They were about a hundred yards away and rotating as they ascended.  Andy slowed down and we stared at the lights for about 10 seconds.  The lights then moved rapidly east, kind of swirlinga bit before zipping almost straight up and completely out of sight.  At the rate the lights accelerated, it left us in a total state of shock. Since this occured on New Years Eve, we&#39;ve had a hard time convincing anyone that we really saw it and I never heard of any other sightings.  We used to talk about it a lot but people think we&#39;re crazy and heated arguments would ensue.  What&#39;s confusing to me is that no sonic boom or any kind of noise for that matter was heard or felt.<n>

It was in the early evening &amp; it was just light enough to see it; we had climbed the ridge before &amp; found an old WWII lookout bunker up there; on the other side is a rural coastal road &amp; a bay; it was a dark shade of no color,quiet, w/lights around its perimeter; seemingly defying gravity; I did not report it in fear of being labelled a &#34;kook&#34;; however, the next day sightings were reported on the other side of the island on TV news. We lived there for 20 years &amp; that was the only time I heard of actual sighting. I now believe in ufo&#39;s, although I suppose our military could have been testing something new, but is was definitely not a plane; from our view it looked like a giant cigar in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Not really a ufo hot spot. I hovered there until we left after 15 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just after Christmas of 1986. The craft was hovering over a local tavern called Nashville North. I was not drunk. I was to young to drink. But, the night was very cool and clear. My mother and I were driving down the Road and up we looked and saw the craft. It was a very silent night. The kind were if your car windows are open you can hear the tires crunch the snow very clear. There was a very lite snow. But, not enough to inhibit your vision. you could actually hear the snow land it was that clear out. We stopped the car and watched the craft for about 15 minutes as it hung motionless. The only think that seemed to move were the lights that out lined the craft. It was triangular in shape. It appeared to be about 300 feet in the air.It could have been 200 feet long. I can&#39;t really judge it that well because I didn&#39;t have anything to compare it to. I will never forget that night for as long as I live. I do believe it to be an alien craft. A ufo. Or what ever you would like to call it. I have know reason to make this up. I&#39;m not a big Sci-fi freak. Or a Star Wars fan. I just know what I saw. I really don&#39;t talk about it because you always get the same response of.... oohhhhh space men are coming. ET phone home and all of the other things I&#39;m sure that you can think of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object appeared transparent, but had points of red lights on corners of object (maybe 8-10 lights).  Not sure if they were blinking.  The object was moving very slowly, emitting no sound whatsoever.  We commented about the fact that we could see through the object.  Nothing solid.  Almost like a group of toothpicks put together with pin-points of red lights on each connection.  The object may have been less than 1000&#39; high.  Hard to tell, but it was definitely not a formation of several objects higher in the sky.  This was very low in the sky.  I reported it to the Sheriff&#39;s department and they denied any other reports.  In 2001, another man described having seen the same object that night, and described it the same way to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At the time I was 16, my friend 17, my sister 15 and my mother, 37.  We were on a desolate road called Read St. Read Street ran through old farm land with  a few industrial complexes along the way.  There were also big power lines in the vicinity.  We were driving by an old farm when we noticed what looked like 2 headlights coming out of the sky.  The lights were coming down towards an old field lighting up a dilapidated barn.  The lights were so bright that we couldn’t make out the shape of the object so we assumed it was a small plane or helicopter making an emergency landing in the field.  My mother slowed down just in case we needed to lend a hand as there were no other cars around (which wasn’t unusual).  Suddenly,  the object stopped descending and became level.  It was then that we saw the actual shape and size of this object.  It was slowly moving towards us.  The object was silver, an immense disk with a big reddish bulging light on the bottom and little white lights around its widest section.  It hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I started yelling at my mother telling her to drive away.  I was pushing her seat from behind (I was in the back seat) and telling her &#34;go, go, go!!&#34;  She stayed put and to this day, she can&#39;t explain why she didn’t drive away.  The craft made no sound at all despite being no more than 80ft above us.  (my mother smoked so she had her window cracked)  It stopped and hovered above us just ahead of our car where we could all see it.  When my mother finally started to drive (slowly) the craft mimicked our movements forward.  Then in one swish, it moved to the left side of the car, and hovered over a small stand of trees which it illuminated.  It stayed there for about 15 seconds then whisked away over the trees and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all very shaken and upset and after dropping my girlfriend off, we went home and my mother immediately called the police.  The local police station literally answered the phone &#34;UFO Hotline&#34; in a joking manner (Attleboro was a small town back then!)  My mom reluctantly told the officer about our sighting and he indicated that there had been many calls that night and that an officer was sent to check things out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, there was a tiny blurb in our local paper about the area of Read Street losing power over night.  It went on to say that the outage was due to a squirrel eating through a rotted power box.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother, sister and I still talk about that night but overall, I&#39;ve been reluctant to share my experience with others simply because of the stigma that comes along with such an admission.  I don’t know what we encountered that night but to this day, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it nor have I seen any technology that comes close to what we saw that December night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

12/12/86 20:00|Pocahontas|AR|Light|2-3 minutes|What appears to be 2 comets suddenly shoots overhead and turns into red, pulsating lights in a random formation; hovers 2-3 minutes.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42366.html|8|ndxe198612| What appears to be 2 comets suddenly shoots overhead and turns into red, pulsating lights in a random formation; hovers 2-3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although this happened several years ago, I still remember it vividly.  My family and I had just driven to a nearby community, called Engelberg, to look at the Christmas light display that this area is known for.  The road that leads to Engelberg is a rural road without much traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way back to town, while on this road, my younger brother, who was about 6 at the time, said &#34;Hey, look, its two Haley&#39;s comets.&#34;  Haley&#39;s comet had already come and gone earlier that year, so I said, before I even looked, &#34;No, stupid, Haley&#39;s comet has already gone!&#34;  But about that time, we all looked over out the passenger&#39;s side of our van and saw what appeared to be two comets (complete with tails) in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had we fixed our eyes on them, they &#34;shot&#34; directly over our van.  My dad stopped the van because we didn&#39;t know WHAT the heck it was.  It was probably no more than 50 feet above the vehicle and it no longer resembled comets, but appeared to be random red glowing lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night out, but the lights were hazy.  We could not distinguish a craft shape, although whatever it was was hovering.  We just stared at it for about 2-3 minutes.  (although it seemed like time had stopped.)  As we were watching it, my parents rolled down the windows to see if we could hear anything.  We heard NOTHING!  Only the wind.  We all commented on the fact that this was just &#34;weird.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad, trying to remain calm, came up with the idea that it must be some sort of special military plane that has special &#34;silencers&#34; on it.  My mom said, &#34;Yeah, but wouldn&#39;t we SEE a plane? It is DIRECTLY over our heads.  Dad: &#34;I have NO idea&#34;  Brother: &#34;I&#39;m scared&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the lights &#34;shot off&#34; to our left, in a blur and then disappeared.  We sat there with our van in the middle of the road for a while after that just trying to absorb what we had just seen.  When we got back home, we were watching the local news out of Jonesboro, Arkansas (KAIT) and the weatherman said that they had gotten lots of calls from the Pocahontas area about this phenomenon, and the weatherman said it was a meteor shower.  However, later in the broadcast, the weatherman said they had just received a report that it was NOT a meteor shower after all, but was reported by the FAA to be a Russian Missle that had gone off course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have believed the whole &#34;meteor shower&#34; story had they not come back and &#34;blamed the Russians.&#34;  I can still recall the exact date, even though it was almost 20 years ago because I wrote about it in my diary that night (which I still have) and my family still discusses it frequently.  I am not sure what it was, but I DO know that meteors don&#39;t hover and the story about the Russian missle is just too lame.  I think no one knows what it was....sure wish I knew, though!<n>

Two family members went with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood talking, a very huge object became noticeable in the sky passing over our house.  It appeared to be very low in the sky, but was difficult to actually tell just how high.  The shape was odd because it looked like a rectangular building on its side with red points of light at each intersection. Must have been around 8 -10 points of light.  The strangest thing was that it seemed transparent.  We could see the sky through it even though it was a mass of some kind that we could tell was moving through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made absolutely no sound and was moving what seemed to be very slowly, almost as if it was floating.  As I said, it was huge.  It was not a formation.  We could actually see an outline of the object as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was very close to Christmas, it never even crossed my mind when I went in to report this strange object to the local Sheriff’s Dept., that they might think I was perpetrating a hoax.  When the Sheriff’s Department came on the line and I proceeded to ask if anyone had reported an object going over the town, I suddenly realized that they may think I am pulling a prank relating to Santa Claus.  I was a little embarrassed, but they said no one else had reported this.  In later years I also reported it on, I believe, MUFON, when it was not required that you pay a membership.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost twenty years later, a security guard and one of my family members, who had witnessed this event,  were talking and the security guard related a sighting he had at the same time and the same description (before this family member ever said anything to him).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
